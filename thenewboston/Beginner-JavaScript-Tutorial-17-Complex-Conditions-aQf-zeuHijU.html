17th tutorial and I actually just made
this story but when I got done with it I
accidentally had delete at the end of it
because I'm an idiot
so now I have to make the entire thing
again but I mean at least I had practice
making it so all right let me take a
deep breath and let's do the skin but
for you guys it would be like the first
time so anyways what I want to talk
about in this tutorial is complex
conditions so unless tutorial we saw
that if we wanted to test more than one
condition then what we had to do is
embed and if within another if so
basically if we wanted to test my first
name was Bucky then we go ahead and we
made it if statement and then we want to
test my next my last name was Roberts so
go ahead and we stuck if statement
inside of that but actually I want to
let you guys in on little secret there's
an easier way to test more than one
condition and you only have to use one
if statement so let's go ahead and make
two variables I'll go ahead and make
first and I'll set this equal to Bucky
and I'll go ahead and make another
variable and I'll name this last and
I'll set this equal to Robert's make
sure I spell my last name right though
Roberts and now let's go ahead and make
it if statement so before we needed to
make two whenever we want test two
conditions but now I told you guys you
can test two conditions using one if
statement so in order to test two
conditions the first thing you need to
do is this go ahead and put each
condition you want to test inside
parentheses
I call them curly braces sometimes but I
mean I'm not lying myself I know there
are parentheses so the first thing I
want to test is that first variable is
equal to the name Bucky and now go ahead
and stick the next condition you want to
test in parentheses so now I want to
test that that less variable is equal to
my name Roberts so Roberts sir saying
all right
that's simple enough you have two
conditions
in here that you want to test simple
enough but you're not done yet the last
thing that you need to add is in between
them go ahead and above the seven there
is a key called ampersand go ahead and
hit that twice what this is going to
tell JavaScript is all right you want to
test this condition and you want to test
this condition and I'm only going to
execute this code let's give some code
real quick to XQ document write and
write something stupid like hey good job
buddy here's a cookie whatever I spelled
every word with a typo but it doesn't
really matter so anyways like I was
saying whenever you use this special
double ampersand it means all right I
know with one if statement you usually
use one condition but in this case
scenario you want to test this condition
and this condition right now and if
they're both true that I'm going to
execute this bit of code right now so
let's go ahead and save it and refresh
and see what we get hey good job there
buddy yadda yadda yadda so anyways like
I was saying when you use the double
ampersand this needs to be true and this
needs to be true if one of them is false
or both of whom is false it's not going
to run so let's go ahead and change this
first name to like Tommy name my cousin
and go ahead and refresh it and it's not
going to work since one of those
conditions was false so that is how you
test two or more conditions in a single
if statement and ever saying all right
so how would I test three or four well
if you want to test more then just go
ahead add more amber signs and another
condition right here simple enough so
now that I told you guys about that
special and let's go ahead and delete
this and I want to teach you guys about
another way that you can text test
complex conditions and that's using the
or so let's go ahead and make a simple
if and let's go ahead and document
right whoa wrong simple is their arm is
right bacon it really doesn't matter
what you're right in there and now say
you come across this scenario all right
I want to test two conditions but only
one of them needs to be true for me to
execute the bit of code for example if
your name is Bucky or if your last name
is Roberts the code is going to get
executed not both conditions have to be
true but one or the other well let's go
ahead and I'll show you how to do that
just like before you go ahead and write
your two conditions in here if first is
equal to Bucky and last is equal to
Roberts in now you're saying all right
go ahead and put those double ant signs
well when you're using or you actually
use this sign it's called I think it's
called the pipe symbol or something it's
above the enter key or the return key on
your keyboard and I guarantee you just
look there right now so don't lie I know
you just look there
you can't resist so anyways when we use
the or sign let's go ahead and run this
and see what happens
it says bacon percent all right well we
said if first is equal to Bucky and
first is actually equal to Tommy so why
would this run the reason it ran is
because this last name was indeed equal
to Roberts so again only one of these
conditions has to be true in order for
this code their own if both of them are
false if the first one equals Tommy and
last one equal Hanks Tom Hanks then
they're not going to be equal to Bucky
or Roberts so whenever you try go and
run this nothing happens so again with
or either this one has to be true or
this one has to be true and if they're
both true Tommy and Hanks it's going to
run
so if they're both true or this one or
this one it's going to run it's
basically saying it is long as one of
the conditions is true I'm going to go
ahead and do the code you told me to do
so anyways just like before if you want
to add more just go ahead and add more
pipe symbols and more conditions right
in here but that's the basics of this
story and testing complex conditions it
might save you some time from nesting a
bunch of if statements again if you want
to test one or more condition and they
all need to be true then use the double
+ sign just like that if you want to
test two or more conditions and only one
of them needs to be true then go ahead
and use those or signs or pipes or
whatever the heck you column just like
that so that's the basics of that and
don't forget that it's not only - but
you can add an unlimited number of tests
just by adding more signs and more break
over whether they call parentheses so
that's all I have for you guys for this
tutorial hopefully whenever I stopped
this surah I'm actually going to save it
this time and not to leave it because it
well I guess if I delete it this time
then you guys would never be hearing
this but anyways um thank you guys for
watching don't forget subscribe and I'll
see you guys next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
