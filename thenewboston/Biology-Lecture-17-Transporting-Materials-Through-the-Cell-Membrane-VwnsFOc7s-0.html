swirl and in this video I want to talk
to you guys about transporting materials
through the plasma membrane or cell
membrane whatever you want to call it so
we already know that things need to get
across the plasma membrane and that's
because first of all cells create things
for other parts of the body so obviously
when they're created inside the cell
they need to ship out towards other
parts of the body therefore crossing the
plasma membrane and aside from that
things need to get inside the cell
because whenever a cell needs energy it
uses particles from food so obviously it
also gets like oxygen and stuff those
things need to get inside the cells so
the cell can break them down use them
for energy and we'll talk about exactly
how the cell does that later on but that
is the reason why a cell would need
something from outside to come inside
again crossing the plasma membrane so
simple enough so that is why things need
to transport across the plasma membrane
all those materials but let's go ahead
and talk about how they do this well
whenever you have a really small
molecule like oxygen is really small or
I don't know what else carbon dioxide is
an example these are really small modern
molecules or particles that can go ahead
and pretty much slide across the
membrane easy so those things are always
flowing in and out and it doesn't really
take a lot of work from anything else so
they can pass through the plasma
membrane relatively easy without any
complex method however certain other
things like let me go ahead and choose a
color and go ahead and choose red so a
larger molecule like food is actually a
really large molecule it can't go ahead
and just cross this with ease without
anyone noticing because it's so big in
those phospholipids are packed together
so tightly it can't just slide across
like I don't know oxygen can because
it's a lot bigger than oxygen so
whenever the cell needs energy it needs
food but it needs a way to get that
inside the cell so whenever larger
molecules need to get inside the cell
they need help from proteins
and I know in the last tutorial I drew a
diagram of the membrane and I showed you
guys the phospholipids and the proteins
and I pretty much just drew the proteins
there and I'm like don't worry about
what they do we're going to be talking
about it in the next Sorrell well this
is the tutorial so like I said whenever
a larger molecule needs to get inside
the cell it uses proteins but what
exactly does a protein do well some
proteins form openings called channels
and a channel is basically exactly like
it sounds
it pretty much forms a channel or an
opening that allows the larger molecules
to pass through all right that's one job
another job however is with carrier
proteins carrier proteins now carrier
proteins are pretty much exactly like
they sound - they pretty much pick up a
molecule on one side of the cell so say
we have some food over here it can't
just pass through or else it'll get
stuck so what a carrier protein will do
is actually pick this up kind of like
taking on a piggyback ride
and drop it off on the other side of the
plasma membrane so picks it up on one
side carries it hence the term carrier
protein and drops off on the other side
of the membrane so those are two jobs of
proteins again one type forms channels
the other type literally picks up a
larger molecule carries it across the
membrane and drops it off if you're
saying I like like what do they have
arms or something
well they attach them in we're going to
be looking at these processes later on
and we're going to be talking about this
more especially when we learn about how
cells turn food into energy but for
right now the key things that we have to
take out of this tutorial is that cells
create things for other parts of the
body and they also need things to come
inside them to form various things
energy stuff like that so that is why
things need to transport across the
plasma membrane also smaller molecules
like oxygen and co2 they can pass
through really easy so they don't need
the help of anything else however larger
molecules such as food as we looked at
in this example they need help from
proteins and proteins either form
channels right here
or come in the form of carrier proteins
which pick up the molecules and drop
them off on the other side of the cell
so that is all you get for this tutorial
in the next story we're going to be
looking at different methods of
transportation it's going to be sweet so
thank guys for watching don't forget
