tutorial I want to talk to you about
something called threading so first of
all let's go ahead and understand what a
thread is and why they're useful so up
to now we've been building some very
simple programs and you learn that
pretty much building a program is kind
of like giving your computer ACEF
instructions we need to give it a nice
logical order to follow follow step 1
then 2 then 3 that's pretty much what
writing code is all about giving your
computer some instructions to follow now
sometimes it's useful to break up a
single program and have it do multiple
things at a time now I want warn you
guys most of the time this isn't a good
idea because like whenever you're making
a calculation you just can't like add
the numbers or divide them or do
whatever you want in any order outs your
going to get a bad result you need to
follow a specific order so most of the
time you don't want to use threads in
your program is going to run fine so
when would building a program that does
multiple things at once be beneficial
well one of the most common examples
whenever I teach threads is whenever
you're making a messenger program what
you're going to do is you're basically
going to build two different programs
that run at a time one of them is going
to be responsible for sending messages
and one of them is going to be
responsible for listening for messages
so whenever you're talking with someone
like instant messenger it doesn't matter
when they send the message or excuse me
when you send your message or when you
receive a message um you know you don't
have to like wait for them to send a
message before you can start typing so
what you would want to do is you would
want to build two different objects and
one is responsible for sending out and
one is responsible for receiving or
listening and it builds a really cool
like a chat or Skype or instant
messenger application so let me go ahead
and show you guys how to do that right
now so the first thing we need to do is
import threading and what this does is
it
a class that what we're going to do is
we're going to make anything like a
Bucky's messenger and what we're going
to do is we're actually going to inherit
from this class so remember anything you
put in here is the parent class that you
inherit from so now any object that we
create
that's Bucky's messenger we get a bunch
of cool built in thread functions so the
one function that we need to have is def
run now you see it automatically popped
up because this isn't just a you know a
name that I'm picking it off the top of
my head this is a very specific name
that we need to have just kind of
special to threads so means something
special to threads basically whenever we
create a thread it's going to call this
run function so it won't off so now
let's go ahead and just write some code
in it so just for a simple demonstration
I mean typically what you'd want to do
is make a complex program responsible
for like sending messages every I don't
know like you can do it like once a
second maybe but for now I'm just going
to loop something ten times to show you
guys it's a really good demonstration of
how exactly this thread is going to work
so for actually I don't even know if I
taught you guys this so you know before
whenever I was making a for loop and I
put like 4x and arrange 10 or fortuna'
in range 10
well that tuna or X variable is equal to
the numbers 1 2 3 4 all the way up the
well it's either 9 or 10 whatever many
times you want to loop so you can use
that variable and print it out or use it
in the calculation or something but
sometimes we just want to loop 10 times
and we really don't care what number
we're on or that variable at all so what
you can do when you don't really want to
use that variable or that value you can
just put an underscore right there and
that's the kind of convention it pretty
much is saying okay I want to loop 10
times don't really care about the
variable so I'm just going to use
underscore in place
so that's what that means you know just
kind of Python convention so what do I
wanted to do ten times well the cool
thing whenever we inherited a bunch of
stuff from this thread class or
threating is actually let me type it out
because it's kind of current thread part
we should move my cursor out of the way
get name now what we can do is one of
the built-in things is we can give every
thread a name so it's one of the default
properties with a thread so all I want
to do is I'm going to make two different
threads with two different names and I'm
just going to print out their name
however it X really cool it's not just
like printing something out on the
screen ten times so I'll show you guys
how cool it is right now so for our
messenger this is all we have
that's all we need what we did is we now
have this class right here but it can be
threaded and what this means is you can
have multiple objects from this class
running at the same exact time you don't
need to wait for one to get done to
start the next one so let's go ahead and
actually create one so I named one X and
this is just going to be equal to
Bucky's messenger and remember one of
the built-in properties or the default
properties for a thread is we can give
it a name so I'm going to set this name
equal to and this is just an example
send out messages so we'll say that this
is what this thread would be responsible
for so now let me go ahead and make
another run real quick and in real life
what this would be is instead of just
giving it a name you would actually you
know add functionality to like receive
messages so now we have two threads
right there and check this out right now
you're looking at this and said okay
there's only one function in here called
run so you're probably going to do
something like X
run but that's not the case whenever you
create a thread what you want to do is
you want to call the start function on
that thread so X star and Y start and
even though that this is kind of I don't
know it doesn't really make sense at
first whenever you call this start
function what it does is it goes to that
class and it looks for a function called
run so it's it's kind of weird but
that's how it works
so start kicks off a thread now how is
this different than any normal function
well check this out actually you can
kind of see here but let me run it one
more time just a there we go that's a
better example so before whenever we
created objects what happened is our
programs run from top to bottom so it
ran this line it finished and then it
went on this line it finished went on
the list line and what this line does is
is is it creates a thread with the name
send out messages and it loops through
it ten times so before what happened is
this would print send out messages ten
times and it once it was finished it
would move on to the next line but check
this out send send send receive send
receive send receive why are they all
jumbled together well that's a cool
thing about threads with threads you
don't need to wait for this to finish
before moving on to the next line with
threads what your program is going to do
is this is going to say ok this is a
thread and I'm going to start it off in
other words I'm going to call run and as
soon as I'm done before this is even
done I'm just going to go on to the next
line and do whatever it tells me to sew
again eventually what we have for a
brief period of time is both of these
things running at the exact same time so
now our computer program is well a lot
more powerful and a lot more faster or a
lot faster however the heck you say it
so that is how in one
instance you would utilize threads to
make a messenger program and again just
warning you guys you don't want to use
threads with everything even though it
speeds up your program this would be
really awful in the calculation so say
you're like averaging a bunch of numbers
well you need to add all those numbers
together before you do your division so
if you're like okay add and try to
divide at the same time you're going to
get one you know
messed up answer so you wouldn't want to
do it in that case scenario but for
programs that really don't depend on
something else to happen and can run
concurrently or at the same time threads
are an awesome feature to have so for
now thank you guys for watching don't
forget to subscribe and well I'll see
you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
