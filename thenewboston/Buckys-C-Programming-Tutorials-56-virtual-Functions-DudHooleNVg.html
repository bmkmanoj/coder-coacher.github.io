C++ tutorial and in this tutorial we're
going to be talking more about
polymorphism because I know I kind of
cut off the last tutorial abruptly and
that's because I understood that I
wasn't making a couple things clear so I
wrote some comments here and read these
line by line and hopefully they can make
you understand the basics behind you
know inheriting and using these pointers
with different types of objects easier
and also I wanted to stress one thing
that you guys may not quite have
understood now if we go up to you know
the ninja class in the monster class you
saw that each of these specific classes
had a function called attack so a ninja
could attack and a monster could attack
however if we strode up to the enemy
class where they both inherited from
there was no attack function right in
here so that is why we had to switch
back to using the ninja in the monster
attack after we set the attack power so
that's why the enemy object see let me
go ahead and like if enemy object was to
try to attack you would get an error
message because an enemy object can't
attack because this enemy class has no
attack only these specific classes do
you see what I'm saying so that's why we
could use the enemy object to set the
attack power because every class
inherited this attack power but we
couldn't use those enemy objects to
attack because only these specific
classes can attack so saying alright
Bucky that's uh I understand it now but
it's still kind of you know a dumb way
to program because first you make a
ninja object and an enemy object then
you use the enemy object here then you
have to switch back to the ninja object
right here well wouldn't it be nice if
we could just have these enemy objects
come on I keep it in that dumb plus sign
what it'd be nice if we could just have
these enemy objects attack as well that
would make our lives a whole lot easier
if we didn't have to switch back to this
ninja in monster class if these enemy
classes excuse me these enemies objects
could just set the attack power attack
move around to whatever an enemy needed
to do we'll check it out guys that is
the core concept behind polymorphism and
it's going to make your programming life
a whole lot easier so let me go ahead
and I'm going to go ahead and delete all
this crap right here and I'm going to
clean out all my classes so I just have
a blank monster class a blank a ninja
class and a blank enemy class now I'm
going to teach you guys how to do what I
was just talking how to call the attack
function on every single enemy object
and have it work beautifully now before
you're saying oMG you deleted everything
I just follow the tutorial and now I'm
going to have to retype all that code
why would you delete everything well
I deleted everything because the code
for this is actually a whole lot easier
than what would be doing before so
before I wanted to stress you guys you
know how you inherit and indeed you can
you know use different addresses with
different pointers and once you
understood the last tutorial come to
this tutorial and look how easy I'm
going to make this for you guys so we
want every enemy object to be able to
attack so let's go ahead and make a
public function and we're going to name
this void attack so now every enemy has
the ability to attack so now what we
want to do is before we start coding the
rest of the stuff we already know that
whenever we build a specific class like
ninja and monster that they're going to
have their own specific attack functions
an engine is going to be like karate
chop and a monster is going to like roar
I'm coming out from under your bed well
we already know that each of these
classes that is going to pretty much
overwrite this attack function so what
we want to do is we want to make this
function virtual whenever you make a
function virtual it means that you're
going to be using it polymorphically and
that way whenever later on we're using
like enemy 1 attack enemy to attack it
knows that it's supposed to look in the
specific class for that function instead
of using this funk
right here so now when we go ahead and
you know public make our attack function
using void attack and we'll just whoa
easy back slashes now whenever we write
something like void and just right you
know ninja attack and line and let me
just go ahead and code this real quick
copy this paste it right there and the
monster attack can be like monster
attack so now whenever we go ahead and
use well I might as well just code the
rest of this program because you know
instead of telling you what I'm going to
code is we're just shut up and code it
so we have a ninja object and we have a
monster object now we know from the last
tutorial that what we can do is sense a
ninja is just a specific type of enemy
we can go ahead and make an enemy object
like enemy object and make a pointer to
enemy one get my cursor out of the way
and we can set this equal to the address
of ninja whom can do the same thing with
monster and this is valid again because
monsters and ninjas are just more
specific types of enemies so anything
that you can do to an enemy including
attack you can do to a ninja and a
monster if an enemy can move around a
ninja in a monster can move around if an
enemy could stab you with sword a ninja
in a monster could stab you with a sword
so that's why we were able to do this
right here so now what we can do is
since we made this virtual function we
can now go ahead and do stuff like this
enemy one
attack and let's just go ahead and copy
this right here and now we can go ahead
and write enemy to attack and if you run
this it works perfectly fine ninja
attack and monster attack so basically
whenever we use virtual functions were
telling C++ this our a so C++ let's sit
down and have a conversation we're going
to be building a computer game and we're
going to be putting enemies in it now
each of these enemies is going to have
its own specific attack function now
whenever I call an enemy object I'm
going to have an attack I don't want you
to use this attack function right here
this is just a template telling you that
each class that inherits from enemy is
going to have a tech function whenever I
use an enemy object that has an attack
function I want you to find out which
address aka
which type of enemy has that attack
function and call that attack so
basically it said our right enemy 1
attack ok let's go ahead and I'm going
to call attack from enemy hold on
enemy 1 is indeed a ninja object so I'm
going to ninja attack and then set re
and me to attack well I know that enemy
2 is an enemy object so I'm going to go
ahead and call it tak but hold on this
is a virtual function so I'm going to go
ahead and see oh that is a monster
object so I'm going to go ahead and
monster attack you so virtual functions
are basically template functions and any
class that inherits virtual members
whether it's variable or function or
anything ritual is a polymorphic class
because well not because that is the
idea behind polymorphism that you can
call this same function I mean check it
out we're using an enemy object and
we're calling this Sam attack function
but it has different results so that is
the beauty behind polymorphism that you
can use the same function and produce
different results so hopefully I didn't
confuse you guys too much I think this
story is a lot more clear than the other
one
that's you know what basically what
polymorphism is that well first of all
in order to have polymorphism you need
this virtual stuff right here and also
the idea behind polymorphism is that you
can have different functions from the
same type and I and I'm doing those
little quotation signs with my fingers
you can have the same function with the
same type of object but you produce
different results based on what address
it's pointing to so you know that's it I
don't want to confuse the eyes anymore
anything I have left to talk about I'll
talk about next story so hopefully you
guys understand this a little better
than last toriel if you don't don't
worry we're going to be covering it more
in the future but uh thank you guys for
watching don't forget to subscribe and I
guess I'll see you guys in the next
