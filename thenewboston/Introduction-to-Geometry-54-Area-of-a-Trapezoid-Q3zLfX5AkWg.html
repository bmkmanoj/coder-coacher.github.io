the area of a trapezoid and it's very
similar to the area of a parallelogram
with one big difference this part right
here so because a trapezoid will never
have equal length
bases because if you draw a height down
here it has to be parallel to the two
bases since you can never have a
trapezoid with equal basis we have to
take the average of the bases so we're
going to take 1/2 b1 plus b2 which is
how we are going to find the average and
then we multiply it by the perpendicular
height just like we do in a
parallelogram so now we're gonna go into
an example find the area so this is our
height and it's been drawn in for us so
our height is 4 base 1 is 6 base 2 is 10
so area is equal to 1/2 6 plus 10 times
4 now
these parentheses right here are really
important you have to add the two bases
together before you can multiply it so
it's 1/2 6 plus 10 is 16 times 4a is
equal to 1/2 times 16 is 8 times 4 so
our area is 32 so this trapezoid is a
little bit different
the leg of this trapezoid just happens
to be perpendicular to this base so we
don't have to draw in a height because
this is already our height so H is equal
to 4 base 1 is equal to 6
base 2 is equal to 8 so even though we
don't have to draw in a height our area
formula is going to be the exact same
1/2 B 1 plus B 2 times 4 so a is equal
to 1/2 6 plus 4 is 14 times for 1/2 of
14 to 7 times 4 that area is equal to 27
I'm sorry that should be 28 but this
time they give us units so we have to
make sure we put millimeters squared so
that's all we're going to do with
trapezoids but in the next lesson we're
going to start talking about
circumference --is of a circle which is
kind of like the perimeter of a polygon
so make sure you come back in and watch
that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
