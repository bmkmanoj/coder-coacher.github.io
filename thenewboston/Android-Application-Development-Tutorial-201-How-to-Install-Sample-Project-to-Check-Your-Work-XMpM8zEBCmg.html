quick tutorial it's not really in the
series let's gonna show you how to add
your package basically check your work
because you know sometimes you might
miss type something and you want to
check it and it's hard for me to respond
to everyone so what I did is I basically
created a package that you can download
from the internet and it's going to be
on my website I also give it to Bucky
the new boss in which this tutorial is
for and basically you can download the
whole project so we're I'm gonna locate
it on my website my bring back comm is
under the tutorial section and just
click there and there should be a link
to the new boss and under the Android
category here so it should say the new
boss and you click on that and then
there will be a download link which will
download your project
I basically acted like I downloaded the
project onto my desktop so how you're
gonna import it into your into eclipse
we're gonna right click and go to
Android project or new Android project
and then we're gonna go over here
instead of setting up our package like
we did in like the fifth or fourth
tutorial in a series
we're gonna go to create project from
existing source and also if you guys you
know later on the series when you get a
little bit more familiar with Android
you can also check out some of the
samples if you downloaded that as well
so instead we're going to say create
project from existing source and again I
said I located this on my desktop but
you're gonna just find wherever you
extracted this file and again mines on
the desktop and I'm gonna what I call
this I call it the new boss in here
we're just gonna click on whole folder
and hit open and now it's gonna pick
again the API we're working for or fill
in all of our information and all that
good stuff the problem you might be
having is if you did create the package
already it has the same name it's not
gonna allow you to hit finish so you
just want to change your name to do
whatever you want so we're just gonna
say source example something like that
and then we're just gonna hit finish
it's gonna import a project and here is
all of your information that you're
gonna need here's like the source
and I added some additional stuff but
here's all the classes that we're gonna
create and all that good stuff also
you're gonna have the resources that I
included in my project so there and also
like the music and stuff so and the
manifest everything is pretty much
updated so you guys can check all of
your information and make sure
everything's spelled correctly and all
that good stuff so thanks again for
watching this guys and hopefully you'll
learn something throughout this series
again if you have any questions feel
free to hit me up on my bring back and
also I will include the maps package as
well because later on in the series
we're gonna develop with Google Maps so
I'll include that package as well and
I'll catch you guys later
thanks again for watching and have fun
developing so see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
