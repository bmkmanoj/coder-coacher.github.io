tutorial that I'm making for the new
Boston and in this tutorial and be
showing you how to use the picture box
control and how to get the image class
so our gonna need for this tutorial is a
button and a picture box so just go over
your tool box and drag your picture box
onto your main form I'm just going to go
ahead and resize this picture box so
it's rather large also I'm going to
change the size mode so in order to do
that just go over and click this little
triangle in the upper right hand corner
and you can just change your size mode
and the size mode is basically just how
the image will be displayed in the
picture box and I'm just going to change
it to Center image so that when an image
is open the image will be displayed in
the center of the picture box and the
image won't be resized or anything like
that so it'll look just perfect these
dotted line or this dashed line around
your picture box indicates that the
picture box is invisible
so let me debug here who cannot see our
picture box in order to change that to
select the picture box you go over to
the properties panel and change the
border style you can either change it to
fixed single which will put a black line
around your picture box or you can
change the border style to fixed 3d
which will give the illusion than two
picture boxes 3d I prefer fixed single
though once you have your picture box
all set up let's go ahead and double
click on your button under your button
click make sure that you have an open
file dialog and an if statement checking
to see if the user actually selects a
file in the Open File dialog in order to
set picture box ones image equal to
something we're going to do picture box
one image location equals and then the
path to the image and the path to the
image will be whatever the the open file
dialog file name is so goes to 0 FD file
so now whatever image that the user
opened in the Open File dialog will be
displayed in the picture box so now I
need to bug should get our Open File
dialog
yep now if we were to select this image
it should be displayed in this texture
box right here yep if you click on this
falling guy right here should get that
displayed in this picture box as well
yep you can also use the image class to
do this for example we can create a new
image here I'll just call image and
we'll study equal to image dot from file
and this will do the exact same thing at
the image location property so we can
just get it from a file name so we'll
just copy this file name right here
paste it right there and this should
have the same result as the previous
code this is just a different way to do
it also you probably be using this only
if you owe me except the enmity book you
but you would probably only be using
this method if you're trying to set
multiple picture boxes equal to the same
image or if you were trying to save an
image for later use so now only debug
here we should get this exact same thing
we did before
open it it's a sharp image we open a
falling guy image we get should get the
following value yep you can also use the
image location property to get the image
of a URL so as long as you that the URL
leads to an image and not like a whole
webpage then this will work so we just
have this Google right here which is
copy this image or the URL to this image
and we just paste it at this location
then we should get the exact same or we
should get the Google image inside of
this picture box right here yep
so that's pretty much it for this
tutorial on using the image class and
using the picture box control so see you
