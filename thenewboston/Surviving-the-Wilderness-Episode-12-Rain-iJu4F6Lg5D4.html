actually not feeling that bad today i
slept pretty good actually I don't know
what it is maybe my spirits are just
hired now that i found that Creek I know
that it's got to be getting a lot better
coming up here so I'm going to just put
out the rest of the fire then take all
the rope off this and then throw out of
my bag and I'm going to head over for
the creek so better get started
all right I found the creek and it's
actually raining right now which it
actually looked like it was going to
rain earlier but i think i'm going to
set up camp right here under this tree I
don't know what I'm going to build for a
shelter but it's still kind of dry so
I'm going to try and get a fire started
and then I'll worry about the shelter
later on well I definitely need this
fire two nite more than anything else
was well hit food and to the training up
here it's going to be cold sucks it
would rain just enough to soak all the
available wood and everything
I added some rope I cut it and strung it
out so I could get hopefully that'll cut
your spark pretty easily it looks like
it might be flammable well might as well
try it nothing else it seems to be
working so well it's raining quite
profusely now so I'm just gonna try and
wait it out I guess this really sucks I
almost had a fire going I don't know
what I'm going to do it is freezing out
now so I'm gonna problem I hoodie and
sit under this tree and try not to get
to what and wait it out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
