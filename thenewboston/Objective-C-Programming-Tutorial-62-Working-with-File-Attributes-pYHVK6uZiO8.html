objective-c so so far we already are
pretty much created a file make sure it
existed made a copy of it called new
file and then renamed that copy so now
we have a test file and a new file too
so let's go ahead and just do a couple
more things and I promise these are last
things we're gonna do for this little
program I guess and then after this
we're gonna be writing a whole new
program getting rid of all of this
source code it looks kind of jumbled so
these are pretty much three most common
things that we're going to want to do
with file the first thing is get size of
the file and we're going to want to get
the size of file number two I mean it
doesn't matter they're both the same
size you can do with either one I guess
but go ahead and this is kind of weird
so NS dictionary we're gonna create a
new dictionary what and just go ahead
and name it my dick just like the last
not the last or like fourth tutorials
ago and check this out
you're gonna write if and let's just go
ahead and make our air statement uhm NS
log could not get file attributes and we
were returned I think here on return for
all right so now in the if code go ahead
and show you guys worth right there we
go in the F code what we wanted to do is
here's pretty much what happens they
bill in a built-in objects that pretty
much looks at file gets all the
attributes from it and one of the
attributes is the file size and they
store all the attributes in a dictionary
and then you can take your dictionary in
a reference any of the attributes you
want so that was what I was thinking of
telling you guys so let's go ahead and
write this entire method and if it's
equal to nothing no then that's when
we're going to be wanna run our air
but anyways now that we have that it's
all my code right
alright what we want to do is put my
dick and set it equal to manager
attributes of item at path in the path
is what file do you want to get the
attributes from new file to and as your
air just go ahead and put null and check
this out all right if this doesn't work
we're gonna get this but if it does work
here's what we just did we created a new
dictionary called my dick and it pretty
much stores all of the attributes from
this file I mean that's all this code
does it just does it in a really
confusing way so if it doesn't work do
this but if it does work then the else
block is going to run so if it does work
let's just lock something unless lock
something out and we'll get the file
size file is percent eye bytes and in
order to UM make sure I'm typing
everything right all right in order to
remember whenever you're working with
the dictionary you get objects and keys
so you give the key and it gives you the
object so your dictionary is my dick and
go ahead and put object for key in your
key these are built-in keys and s file
size I don't know
there we go I was wondering why it was
popping up and neckli and again this is
the object and we want the integer value
int value for that object so let me see
if I can explain this to you guys what
we did in the story is pretty much
created a blank dictionary because I
mean we don't need to fill in anything
because we want the computer to fill it
in for us
now what this
method attributes of item at path what
this method does is it creates a
dictionary for you of all the attributes
of this file file size with a bunch of
other attributes as well so we store
that entire dictionary in an object
called my dick and then whenever we want
to get one of the attributes for it we
just pass it what key or what attribute
we want to get in this time the file
size and then we just convert it to an
integer value because remember this is
an object we can't be printing out
objects we want the integer value of
that object and then it just prints out
how many bytes that is so go ahead and
check this out remember to delete every
other file besides Tessar file or else
oh it won't work because i mean it would
try to copy a file and rename a file
that's already there and stuff so go
ahead and run this and hopefully I
didn't mess anything up I got a feeling
I did oh no I didn't so first it creates
a new file and then it converts it to
new file too and then it takes that new
file too and it tells you file is 31
bytes there are 31 characters in that
file ah
pretty cool huh so again what we did
create a dictionary have it populate the
dictionary for us full of attributes and
then we just access one of the
attributes in summary so that was a
whole tutorial I didn't get as much
accomplished as I think I was gonna so I
actually need one more tutorial to
finish up by problems the next tutorial
is gonna be real short but thank you
guys for watching and don't forget
subscribe and I will see you in the next
tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
