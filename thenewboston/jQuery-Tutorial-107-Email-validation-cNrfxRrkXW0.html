using the focus in handler to check
whether this has you know gained focus
we could use the click event handler but
this isn't going to accommodate for
users that have tabbed down to this
field so we need to make sure that we
use the focus in handler what we then
need to do is create a blur handler for
when the user leaves this field so when
either when they click out or when they
tap out to something else and then we'll
go ahead and create the actual
validation process with the PHP file I
mentioned earlier so we've given this
email field an email of an ID of email
so inside Ajax jas this is how we can
reference it so we're gonna go ahead and
create an event handler for this and we
need to select a we need to use the hash
selector because we've used an ID here
and we are writing email now what we're
going to do is create the focus in
handler and we're going to create a
function inside of that so focus in
inside is a function as you would
normally layout function parentheses and
curly parenthesis we're then going to
come down and inside here is going to be
everything we write when we focus in now
we're going to be doing something
slightly different in this tutorial
which you wouldn't have seen throughout
the rest of this tutorial series at
least not with event handlers and that
is appending on event handlers to the
end so in a minute we're going to create
a blur event handler onto the end of
this and what happens here is it just
saves us having to reference down so
instead of coming down here and typing
blur and then coming down here and type
in key up we can actually append or bind
different handlers onto the end of this
main selector here so that's just
something useful to know with regards to
focus in what do we want to happen well
we want to create a span over
which is just gonna hold some
information about our selection or what
we've typed inside this email field and
I'm just going to call this email
feedback so inside of here we need to
again select email underscore feedback
and we then need to apply some text to
this so we're going to use the text
function here inside here I'm just going
to right go on enter a valid email
address so now what's going to happen is
when we focus in on this email field the
email feedback span will you know fill
up with this text here so let's go ahead
and test that I'm going to click on that
and you can see that's filled up when I
click away it obviously doesn't
disappear because we haven't created
this yet so let me go ahead and tab down
to this from my URL bar here and you can
see that this produces more or less the
well exactly the same effect I'm just
going to tab down and you can see that
this is now active and that has worked
and this is in addition to or sorry as
opposed to using the click the we would
use the same effect or have the same
effect when we click in here however if
we were to tab down to it you can see
that this is now in focus and we don't
have our text so this is why we used the
focus in event handler okay so the next
handler we want to create is blur and
when we when a user leaves this field
either tabbing out or clicking elsewhere
on the page we want to run another
function so let's bring this down again
and this time we want to do exactly the
same as we did here but we actually want
to create nothing so we want to remove
the feedback
so email feedback dot text and inside of
there nothing so now what's going to
happen is when we click in and click out
that will disappear also when we tab
down to it and then tell away from it it
disappears as well so now that we have
these two these two aren't quite
complete yet for the simple reason that
for example if I was to type something
in here and leave and come back you can
say it you can see that it now all sorry
yet so it now disappears like this now
this is absolutely fine however if we
were to go and click into this we
actually need to be able to validate it
as well so if I was to click in let's
just say there was nothing in here folks
to click in it says go on it enter a
valid email address I can click away
that's fine if I was to then go ahead
and enter a valid email address and
click away that disappears that's fine
we might have come down to another field
down here but when I click back in
because I'm using the focus in we're
automatically generating this this
message here so we want to always tell
the user that the email address is valid
if there is something in here so we need
to create a quick check here to
determine what we want to do so I'm
gonna say if and I'm going to use a
selector to select the value of our
email field so Val here if that equals
nothing
then we can ask the user to enter
something so now let's test that out let
me just go back to the code and I'll
quickly explain we use this selector
here to select the value inside of this
input field we then grab the value of
the field so this would equal say Alex
if I was to have entered Alex in here
now that if that equals nothing so if
it's empty then we can ask the user to
enter a valid email address now if they
haven't if it's not empty sorry we can
do something else</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
