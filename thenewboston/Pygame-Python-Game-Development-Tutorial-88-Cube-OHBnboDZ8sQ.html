another PI M tutorial video in this
video we're gonna be talking about
pseudo 3d or 2.5 D and what we're gonna
do is we're going to modify our square
function to actually be a cube so for
those of you who have forgotten from the
last one this is our square function and
we're in theory zoom zooming in here and
then zoom in out here that was the idea
of it we can also move left right that
but now I want to convert this to to
some sort of a cube and they'll all show
you some fancy stuff that we could do
with the cube to give the impression of
perspective so what do we need to do to
turn a square into a cube well
like I showed you before I mean we've
got this simple square I'll draw a
square instead of then all I make it
ugly soon so when to make a square into
a cube what do you have to do well you
have a square and I don't you do is you
add another square that's about it and
then you just need to connect all of the
lines of that scarra the like vertices
of the square that's the proper
terminology now and boom you have
suddenly generated a cube it gives the
impression as a queue it's really just
lines on a flat you know page basically
but it gives it gives us the idea that
it might be a cube it might be 3d and
then you know when it's stationary our
eyes can play tricks on us and that's
how we have these sort of optical
illusions that are on like a flat page
there's a reason why most of optical
illusions are a 2d representation right
or maybe there are 2.5 attempt at making
depth but the reason why optical you
know illusions are always on a page or
because if you added a real 3d element
to it and you were able to like move
around and change your perspective a lot
of times you wouldn't see instantly the
flaws so like with this cube I mean if
we were to change perspective of the
cube would be totally flat it would look
really weird but anyways just on a 2d it
gives us the impression that maybe it's
a cube that's what we want to do so how
do we do that well we have basically all
of them like well we define all the
nodes he
then we go ahead and draw all the nodes
here or I mean we draw the lines here
then we drew all of the nodes here so
now how might we define some new nodes
well I'm gonna go ahead and define those
nodes here try and put everything under
its other counterpart and we have node
now five and we'll just say five equals
space and then let's go ahead and copy
that paste paste and paste so we need
four more nodes so five six seven and
eight now what
how will we determine where to place
these nodes well ideally to make the
perfect little cube this the length of
of this line should be about the same
length or identical to the length of
this line right that would be the idea
and that way it's like a perfect cube
we're not gonna get that perfectly but
how might we make the length of this
that line this slanted line the same
length is this line well the way that I
would do it at least at the outset would
be mm-hmm I'll call will call this mm
offset and we'll just say offset equals
the integer value of full-size full-size
/ - so
offset will be the offset of x and y
that's why we divided by two because
we've got two axes here that we're going
to apply this to so in theory if you
give it if you give half of the offset
to X half of it to Y we've covered the
same amount of distance and that'll do
so obviously that's not the perfect
formula for this but it's close enough
to give us a decent-looking cube so now
no five six seven and eight are
basically going to be the same same sort
of code so for example node five what
will node v be well first of all is
gonna be a list because we want to go to
modify it and we're gonna say no five is
node
one element zero plus the offset comma
node one element one minus the offset so
this is adding to the X so we're going
you know to the right and then we want
to make this go up for now so we have to
subtract from Y to make things go up as
usual so that is the code required so
now let's just copy this come down here
paste pastes and paste
interesting and now let's just modify
the node values here so one two three
and four and then this will be two three
and four then we're going to go ahead
and we'll draw these lines here so this
just copy this enter enter paste and now
to basically all we need to do for all
of these nodes is add four so instead of
node 1 that would be node 5 and so I've
no three that would be no seven five and
six I think I might have screwed up one
of those I guess we'll find out soon
enough
uh-huh so four six eight seven eight
basic math is failing me so let's check
this one five seven five six
okay good so we've got all those and
then then we want to add the notes so
let's go ahead and add the drawing of
the nodes and then so says node supposed
to be five six seven and eight now you
might think that okay but we've done all
the things we need but really now we
just got to sweaters right we want to
connect those two squares so the final
thing that we do is we're actually going
to draw lines from each node to their
counterpart node so we'll take this
since we're going to draw four lines
let's just copy the
and come down here paste we'll get rid
of these this information here and now
so we're drawing a line to and from the
counterpart nodes so so in our cube not
the best cube ever but basically that's
what we have right now and now I want to
draw the line from this node to this
node and then from this node to this
node not that little dot and it's node
to this node and so on so so now to do
that that would be from node okay we'll
do node one two three and four and then
it's gonna be this node plus four right
so five six seven and eight all right
and then we've got so got the lines now
so now when we save and run this
hopefully I got an ear node five got to
have the underscore where did we put
note five I mean oh here we go right
here underscore okay try again okay so
there we have our cube and we can zoom
in and out of our cube awesome so you
can see the whole cube scales it appears
to be a relatively perfect cube if I do
say so myself
and we can zoom in we can zoom zoom in
zoom out now and all that so yeah we've
got a decent representation now this was
with zoom and the next thing I really
want to show you guys is actually gonna
be more so changing the perspective
right now so like what if we what if we
took this like see like right here this
cube looks about what it should look
like you know really I suppose here
right or the further back section of the
cube is heading towards the center of
our screen but if we move her to move
over here and be perfectly centered now
the walls wouldn't be slanted they would
be perfectly straight you know it would
almost look like you've got you know a
square and then another square drawn
slightly over it so we have to fix that
and then same thing moving up and down
this isn't is hello this is likely
incorrect
let's zoom in a little bit because it's
it looks like it's above the center line
so probably wouldn't be like that as
long as our perspective wasn't above the
center line as well so anyways we have a
few more changes that we want to make so
stay tuned for that and thank you for
