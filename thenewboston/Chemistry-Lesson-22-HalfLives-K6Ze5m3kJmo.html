22nd chemistry tutorial and in this
story I'm going to be talking about
half-lives
and I may even give you guys a nice cool
little story if we have time but if not
then I have to do it in the next
tutorial so basically you remember when
I was talking to you guys about nuclear
reactions and most of the time it has to
deal with a nucleus splitting apart or
decaying as we like to call it and this
isn't the case with fusion and I'll talk
about fusion later on it's actually when
things come together but most the time
it has to deal with the nucleus of atom
splitting apart or decaying so since
this is important whenever we're talking
about radiation in all that good stuff
chemists needed a way to figure out how
long it takes a certain isotope to decay
however they started looking at these
individual isotopes and they saw that
for some it was one second for some it
could been a billion years so whenever
we're looking at individual isotopes
it's really hard to determine how long
it takes because basically whenever your
I'll give you guys an example that it
may be easier to picture whenever you're
trying to determine I don't know let's
say how many people watched American
Idol last night you don't ask one person
you don't ask three people you need to
ask at least 10,000 people because the
bigger the sample size the bigger or
better picture you're going to have of
the overall population so what chemists
do is instead of looking at these
individual isotopes they pretty much
look at all of the isotopes in a
particular sample and they get the
average time so one last time what they
do is they basically get a sample of our
particular isotope let's say it's
uranium or something now they determine
how long it takes half of that sample
that uranium to decay and they call this
the isotopes half-life now they give it
the symbol T 1/2 because in chemistry
you need to give everything what's it
called symbols so the symbol for this is
T 1/2 so if we go ahead and look at a
graph you might be thinking okay I
understand how something can decay it
might look like a linear graph but this
is actually
not the case whenever we're talking
about radioactive decay radioactive
material actually decays in exponential
fashion so if we look you may be
thinking okay so after one half-life
maybe 50% of the isotope remains make
sense now after two none of it should
remain right well that isn't the case
because whenever you have a sample of
something like what to stick with
uranium after one of the half-lives 50%
remains now after another half-life 25%
remains and after another half-life 12.5
so isn't 50% of the original it's always
50% of whatever it was before so this is
useful whenever we're talking about
radioactive dating and stuff like that
later on but just remember that that
isn't in linear form it's actually in
exponential form so theoretically there
is always a little bit of the sample
still remains because if you took
something and split it in half in half
in half and half you're never going to
end up with nothing you're just going to
end up with half of whatever it was
before so saying okay Bucky I understand
that kind of weird but it makes sense
now that you say that but why on earth
what do we ever need to know the
half-life of anything why is that even
important sure you can go ahead and
throw in and graph but it seems kind of
useless well known the half-life of
something is important because it
determines when the sample is safe to
handle now since all of these isotopes
in all of this nuclear material we're
talking about emits radiation or at
least the ones we're going to be talking
about you don't want to be around it
until they're done the King and there
pretty much have become stable because
if you're around some uranium and it has
a really fast half-life and it's going
to be giving off radiation all the time
then that stuff can hurt your body and
it's really harmful and toxic to be
around however if we say okay we figured
out the half-life of uranium and is now
become stable enough time has passed
where everything is pretty much done
decaying and it's now a stable element
that's not going to give off any more
radiation and
that's when we can say okay we can now
handle this and not worry about crap
getting injected in our body like gamma
and beta radiation and all that crap so
anyways that is the basics be between
half-lives in a you know the decay and
all these fancy charts so in the next
tutorial we're going to be talking about
nuclear fission and eventually nuclear
fusion which could be the energy of
tomorrow so I know ace thank you guys
for watching and I'll tell my story in
the next tutorial so I'll see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
