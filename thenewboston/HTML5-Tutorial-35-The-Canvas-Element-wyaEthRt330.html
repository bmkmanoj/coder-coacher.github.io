amazing tutorial and in this lesson I
want to start talking to you guys about
the canvas in html5 now what the canvas
is is it's a very powerful feature that
basically allows us to draw graphics on
our web page and I'm not just talking
about JPEG or ping images that we can
embed on there I'm talking about a
drawing program just like you would draw
graphics in Photoshop we can actually
use that same technology but in our web
pages now to make dynamic moving
changing graphics and it's going to be
awesome so the first thing I want to
mention is this in order to use the
canvas feature you actually need a
JavaScript file the JavaScript is
basically going to be the brains behind
drawing everything the HTML is pretty
much just going to be the display what
you look at so let's go ahead and link
to our JavaScript file now and I'm going
to do that source equal Bucky Jas and I
recommend that you name yours Bucky js2
why because it's my name and it's
awesome so go ahead and link to it right
there and now let's actually go ahead
and make the canvas itself so I'm
actually going to put this in a section
and I'll just give it an ID of main and
this is just because I like organizing
everything very nicely and insider
section is the canvas itself so in order
to make a canvas on your HTML file what
you need to do is first make the canvas
open and closing tags then of course the
tag name is canvas if you kind of
guessed and the opening canvas tag takes
a couple attributes that are actually
necessary the first thing we need to do
is we need to give it an ID so let me go
ahead and just give this an ID of canvas
now why do we need to give an ID well
whenever we are referencing this canvas
in JavaScript say we have five different
canvases on our web page well we want to
say that we want to work with this
canvas so in order to say alright this
is the canvas we want to work with we
reference it through ID actually through
the JavaScript method get element by ID
I don't know if you guys remember that
you'll see later on
and now after this it takes two more
necessary attributes width and you guys
can probably guess height so this is
basically how wide and how tall of an
area do you want to be able to draw
graphics on so depending on your website
depending on what you're developing for
this may be a little bit different but
for me for this tutorial I'm just going
to make mine 600 by 400 and what this is
is it's basically like a blank piece of
paper on your website and in this area
is the only area that you're going to be
able to draw on so if you didn't have
this at all like this you wouldn't just
be able to draw graphics right you here
you actually need a canvas and set the
width and height of it before you can
draw so before we start typing and
drawing you know a whole bunch of shapes
in gradients and you know colors on this
canvas we need to do something for the
people that don't have Google chromia
before you know your grandma who just
got the internet like 10 years ago and
has upgraded their browser let me go
ahead and write like hopefully you don't
see this if you do get Google Chrome so
why would I write an awful mean message
like that well as you guys probably
could have guessed what the canvas does
is like I said it's basically a blank
piece of paper that shows up on your
website that you can draw graphics on
now for those people who have not
upgraded their browser in like the last
three years and are working with like
you know old Internet Explorer 6 what
they do is that browser doesn't have the
capability to you know see the canvas
yet it doesn't even know about it so
whenever someone with the old browser
tries to see a webpage with the canvas
on it and they can't because the browser
just is incapable they're going to get
this message instead so if we go ahead
and save this and run in launching
Chrome I have updated browser that is
you know capable of all the html5
features so I don't see that you know
error message at all I just see this
canvas that's ready to be drawn on
however like I said not everyone can see
this if they don't then your
and get this error message so if you're
watching this tutorial and you're like I
wonder if my browser can see there soon
on just go ahead and throw this in and
hopefully you don't see this so now
before we start drawing crap I want to
mention one last thing you know how this
has a width of 604
well let me go ahead and mention this
what the canvas is is it's basically a
bunch of coordinates or a grid system
now in this canvas zero zero is in the
top left so don't think of this like in
math class while you're making quadrant
one two three four and zero zero was in
the middle not this case zero zero is in
the top left so if I say okay we're
going to start drawing at the coordinate
100 100 it would mean 100 across and 100
pixels down so 100 100 would be right
around here and that's where we tell the
canvas where we want to start making
those shapes so that is all I'm going to
cover for this tutorial again make sure
your HTML file is set up and in the next
surah what I'm going to be doing is I'm
going to be hopping over to this
javascript file and actually showing you
guys how to make different kinds of
shapes how to make different sizes and a
whole bunch of awesome stuff so thank
you guys for watching don't forget
subscribe and I'll see you guys then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
