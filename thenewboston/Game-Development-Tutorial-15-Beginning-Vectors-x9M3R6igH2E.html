your 15th
pygame tutorial and in this tutorial
we're going to be going over something
called a vector now what a vector is is
is pretty much the line that connects
two points so if you had a point in the
top left corner and a point in the
bottom right corner it would be that
imaginary line between those two points
so a vector has two main attributes it
has both a distance between those points
and it also has a direction from point A
to point B and we're gonna be working
with vectors because it's really
important when you're building games for
2d games and it's especially in point
important when we're going to be
building 3d games in future so these
next couple series it's toriel's is
going to be going over vectors and it's
gonna seem like a pain now but I'll make
it real easy for you and trust me when
we're building our 3d graphics um you're
definitely gonna need to know this so
that's why now most people when they
build vectors they put it they pretty
much build a class for the vector
because we're gonna be doing a bunch of
different functions to it so we're gonna
want its own class so we can use those
functions easily so go ahead and build a
class again I deleted every single thing
for meritorious so go ahead and build a
class and actually let me open up my
there we go and you can name it anything
you want I'm gonna go ahead and just
name mine vector and for your parameter
of course the object and we're only
gonna be building one function or method
in this this is the initialization
function so go ahead and death iron
score underscore ini T underscore
underscore and this is in case you never
bought built an initialization function
for whenever we create an instance of
this class this is what it does
automatically so whenever we create an
instance we're gonna pass it three
parameters
and I know I didn't tell you guys before
I probably shut up all this function is
going to do is calculate difference from
point A to point B so we need the self
parameter first which is pretty much the
instance and then list1 and list2 since
we're gonna be passing it to list or to
coordinates and it's gonna calculate the
difference so let's do that right now
make a variable called self diff which
is gonna be in other words our instance
dot if you'll see what it is later on
you should know this if you watch my
python tutorial and the formula for
calculating the distance or vector
between two coordinates is the first
thing we have to do is take the first
coordinate of our second list so list
two and zero because remember the first
one is zero I know that's confusing
- list one zero so this is going to give
us our our difference between the first
point and now they get the difference
between the second point go list two one
there we go
- list one one make sure I got that
order right this to 0 1 0 2 1 1 1 so
what this is going to do is take the
first coordinate from our second list
actually I'll tell you whenever I make a
list so anyways after we get done
calculating that we're just gonna want
to print out our answer so print self
diff and now that's the only thing we
need to build in our class for now we
only have one function and it's our
constructor function so next let's go
ahead and make a list and then after I
do so you're gonna see what's going on
make a list called a and I know that my
call list a tupple but just deal with it
and make it like 20-point Oh for the
first coordinate 25
point-o for the second one make another
point which is B and set this equal to
something like forty point home and also
fifty-five point so these would
represent points a and B twenty point O
would be twenty over twenty five down
and B would be forty over fifty five
down so let's go ahead and after this
what we want to do is create an instance
of our class so just name a thing or
whatever you want and set it equal to
your class name with your parameters
being a and B and what this is gonna do
is take the a coordinate or excuse me
a point and B point and pass them in
here and calculate the difference and
I'll show you guys after I run it how
this does it let's go ahead and run the
module click OK and we're gonna get up
man you can almost see it we're gonna
get twenty and thirty so what this did
is calculated 40 minus 20 which was 20
and 55 minus 25 which was 30 now let me
show you guys visually how this does it
this is represents list one since it's
the verse first variable passed in is a
and B represents a list two so whenever
you see list two it's B so list to the
first coordinate is 40 minus list one
the first coordinate which is 20 so
that's what gives you the 20 and enlist
to the second coordinate which is 55
minus list one the second coordinate
which is 25 this gives you the 30 so
that's your real basics on how to build
a vector class and I know it might seem
confusing for now but after you watch me
do this a couple times or you practice
with it it's gonna be a lot easier so
play around with that and probably once
you build it you're gonna understand
what's going on but if not I'll clear
things up for you
the next clip Soros so thank you guys
for watching and don't forget to
subscribe and I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
