the last video that it was going to be
less total in this mini series but I
didn't want to make a video that's too
long because my attention span isn't
that long I don't like watching videos
that long
so anyways in this video I promise I've
got the freaking hiccups now that we're
going to be finishing up so what we did
so far just to recap this can take like
5 seconds is we took all of the
information from our XML file and we now
have it stored in a raise now we did
that because we can use these arrays
whenever working with our JavaScript
file so now we have one thing left to do
and that's print the crap out on the
screen in a fashion where it's more you
know easily viewable to the user because
whenever you go to your boss who knows
nothing about programming and be like oh
here's the information in a nice XML
file you're like what the heck is this
crap now you want to end user friendly
um kind of program viewing experience
bonanza so let's go ahead and store
everything in variable first and all the
stuff we're going to print out on the
screen we'll just name it stuff very
simple so right now it's empty because
we didn't populate anything yet and what
I'm going to do is I'm actually going to
use a for loop to loop through each
array simultaneously and it's going to
be pretty freakin sweet so for what we
wanted to do is just go ahead and make
accounting variable I is equal to zero
because anytime you're working with
arrays it's always important to set your
loop to zero because remember computers
start counting at zero only people start
counting at one now I is less than in
this year's thing the next parameter is
how long do you want your loop to be
well since both of these arrays are the
same length it doesn't really matter
which array you get the length of so you
can either do names dot length or you
can do social security numbers dot
length it doesn't matter because each of
those are two elements long and that's
another
thing whenever you're working with XML
files you usually have simultaneous or
consistent information so that's another
you know awesome thing and of course
actually let me tighten this up of
course we only want to loop through one
at a time so there we go so basically
this gun this loop is going to or I is
going to be set to zero then one and
then it's going to stop so let me go
ahead and show you guys how to fill this
stuff variable with all the information
that we need so I actually have this
program up and running on my server
right now and let me just show you guys
what's going on
so here is the final appearance of our
program we already coded this here's the
list of people in our HTML file now Java
Script is going to create these or this
um I don't even know this data right
here
bucky Roberts - Social Security number
mike litoris - social security number
and this is actually a old one so the
Social Security numbers are different
but that's the format that we're going
to be printing it out in so now how do
we get that well go ahead and set your
stuff variable equal to the first thing
we want is the name of the first person
so how do we get that well names because
that's the array and in order to get the
first item in the array just right item
I because remember right now I is equal
to zero this is the very first loop so
this is basically going to get the very
first name but it's not that easy you
just don't print it out like this you
need to print it out by calling some
more properties of it the first property
that you need append on here is first
child
now the first child is basically the
text so whenever let me break this down
the names array is basically made up of
several items but the item itself is
this entire thing this entire tag with
you know these names right here
and the text bucky Roberts well we are
only worried about the text or the data
inside in other words we're not worried
about these tags we only want to print
out this name so that's what the first
child is the first child is the name and
data is basically the text and if you
guys are like that's freaking stupid
Bucky why would they make it like that
I don't know don't yell at me I didn't
invent Ajax I just teach it so this
right here is what you need to write in
order to print out the text
Bucky Roberts it's stupid I know I agree
with you but that's how you do it and
that is what first child means the text
and the data the first child is the
things inside the tags and the data is
the text wham bam thank you ma'am
so now let's just go ahead and print out
this little minus sign to separate the
name from the social security number and
after this of course we need to print
out the data of the social security
number array which is going to be
Bucky's social security number so
instead of the names array because this
would print out Bucky Robert skin just
change this to SS ends so what this is
going to do is it's going to say Bucky
Roberts and then whatever my social
security number was so it's going to get
the first element in the social security
number array and print out pretty much
the text of that now what I want to do
after this and I know I'm going
off-screen kind of is I just want to add
a line break and that's what's going to
cause my clitoris and every other one to
be on another line if we didn't have
this line break then that would just
look like one big string of text and we
don't want that so break and there we go
so you don't need to do this for every
single you know user or every single
employee you just make one loop and it
loops through all of the crap so again
even though we only if you're just
looking at this info
Glantz you would think that it loops
through the names array because it has
names length but since both of these
arrays are the same length you can
actually use the same loop in
conjunction with the names and Social
Security numbers and it's going to work
you know you're not going to go out of
bounds in your loop at all so now what
we did is we stored all of this
information inside the variable stuff so
you think okay we can just run our
program right now and it's going to look
like this right wrong and that is
because even though we stored it inside
the variable stuff we didn't say display
that on the screen yet so in order to
display all the content or the value of
stuff on the screen what we need to do
is we actually need to say where we want
to display it and whoa that's basically
it so where do we want to display this
well of course we want to display it
right at this div the D so the first
thing we need to do is reference the D
so the D variable is equal to document
which is basically your HTML document
get elements by ID and what is the ID of
this
it's the D just copy that
so now the D in JavaScript refers to the
D div element in our HTML file so now
what we can do is just populate the
inner HTML this so the D enter HTML so
basically change the HTML of the D to
stuff so now our program is finally
complete so what I'm going to do is
actually save this and I'm going to stop
the video and I'm going to upload
everything to my server and I'll show
you guys the final program alright guys
it was actually a good thing I paused
the video because we did have an error
actually I did have an error I should
say and it took me a while to fix it at
least like five minutes um when I made
my XML file I made it like this but in I
was getting air and it said like the
document object is null and I thought
that I had an error somewhere in my
javascript file so I kept looking for
one couldn't find one and it turns out
that I just had a space between the
question mark and the XML the letters
XML so you cannot have it like this you
need it like that I am an idiot but like
I said was a couple weeks before simple
error but now we have the final program
right here looking pretty freaking sweet
so here it is and well not much to talk
about that's it so thank you for
watching and if you have any questions
about the source code or anything I'm
going to be putting all the source code
on my forum tnb forum calm and you can
talk to anyone there if I'm on there I
can answer your question but anyways
guys for watching do subscribe daraa see
you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
