Effects cs6 tutorial
I'm your host buddy Blackbird and today
I want to go over an additional tool to
help you out with your color King and
those are called the matte jokers and
what they do basically is almost the
same thing as the edge then here where
it like cuts in into the footage to get
out this different kind of green and all
that stuff so I think it works pretty
good with the spill suppressor and will
show you like a method with it and
without this bill suppressor so let's go
so let's add the spill suppressor in
first so let me type that in oh it's
it's under keying I think right yes but
spill suppressor and we want to suppress
this green here and now we've got this
the thing about spill suppressor is that
sometimes it creates this like black
edge and it's not always what we want so
we can increase or decrease the
suppression to kind of get that back but
when you start decreasing the green
starts coming through again so let's
keep it at 100 because I'd rather have
this black color than the green looks a
little better and then we're going to go
to the next effect and it's under I
think it's under Matt yep and then we're
going to go to Matt choker it's not the
one I wanted I wanted it simple choker
actually Matt simple choker and this
one's pretty easy it's only got one
actual property I guess I always forget
that word I don't know and all all it's
going to do is kind of eat in at the
edges of the mat there and it uses your
uses your alpha to either at the edge of
the mat
and this will give you a little bit of a
better look so now we've got the gun
without all that black and everything
like that and that's what the simple
choker does you have a give your mat
that you can look at or your final
output so that's all that the simple
choker does easy enough I'll delete take
off the Spill suppressor and you can see
that the the actual green and stuff is
still going to suppress or is going to
spill over onto the hand and all that
stuff even if you use the simple choker
so that's why I like using the spill
suppressor with it so that obviously
looks way better so let's move on into
the next one here the next one I want to
go over is actually the mat choker and
it's a I wanted to show this simple
choker first because it's obviously
easier to figure out so let's add in the
mat choker and that's under the mat
section so we got mat choker and
unfortunately when they give it to you
the the choke and all the settings
aren't that well like defaulted so this
is these are kind of wrong and it might
seem like the effect is busted
so I'm going to show you how to fix it
what the mat choker does is it kind of
like fixes like any holes or anything
like that in your in your edges which I
don't really I don't think I really have
too many but what it's supposed to do is
spread out the holes in your edges and
then recombine them by using the second
choke too like it'll fill in the holes
and everything like that so your edges
don't look a ripped or torn or anything
like that so the first uh geometric
softness might be up a little high so
let's set that down to two for a
starting point and then this one we're
here we're going to set to two for a
starting point
and the choke one I think is supposed to
we should go into the negatives to bring
it out a little not a lot so that's
going to bring out the edge of the choke
and then we can see like up here words
it might be a little messed up bring
this up there we go so it looks like 70
around there is good for that we've get
we're starting to get a little black
edge but that's okay
gray level softness it's kind of just
going to make like the edges like blur a
little bit so let's keep that at ten now
we've got geometric softness for number
two here we want that at around two also
we need to bring this gray level
softness down there we go and and now
for choke two we need to bring that up
and however far we need to bring it in
so looks like I might need to bring that
up a little and it only goes up to 127
so let's bring this down a little bit so
that looks somewhat decent so that's how
you use the mat choker let's turn it off
and see what it look like before so
that's what the spill suppressor on and
this is what the mat choker on and
that's how you're supposed to use this
properly and this the settings are like
backwards and everything like that so
you want to have your first choke going
to the negative to spread out the edges
and then the second choke here to expand
the edges that you created from the
first one and that will just fill in
everything and it'll cut in evenly
instead of where the simple choker just
cuts it all at once this will spread it
out and then cut it evenly which is nice
your softness doesn't need to be set
very high at all and usually two is a
good number for both of them so that'll
be it for this tutorial on the mat
choker in the simple choker
so use those in combination with your
other keys and everything here and it'll
help you become a better Kier to use
this kind of stuff so thanks for
watching this tutorial and I'll see you
in the next one
good luck guys and girls</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
