seventh JavaScript tutorial and in this
tutorial I'm going to be talking more
about functions and specifically what
those parentheses are and why you need
them whenever you create a function well
let's go ahead and first create a
function and let's go ahead and name it
meatball why not and then go ahead and
add a your parenthesis now let's go
ahead and make the body right now before
we start talking about the parentheses
let's just go ahead and make an alert
box we'll just leave empty for now so
now what we need to do is talk about
this parenthesis these parenthesis are
called the parameter of our function now
sometimes you need additional
information in order for your function
to work for example if you made a
function to convert the temperature of
Fahrenheit to calculus you need a
temperature in order to know what number
to convert if you made a function in
order to you know greet someone like
Hello Bucky hello Tina hello Tom you
need their name in order to know how to
greet them so let's go ahead and make a
function with a parameter now in order
to make a parameter just go ahead and
type in the name of a variable like X or
something like that and then later on
whenever you're creating the body you go
ahead and you use that X just like you
would a normal variable so for example I
love and then go ahead and write X so
now whenever we use this function we
need instead of let me go ahead and just
type something like meat ball and then
we need to pass in a value and let's
just say bacon or something like that so
now here is what's going to happen let
me run this for you maybe that'll be
easier
oh it's off the screen I let me run it
on the screen run chrome there you go
right here I love bacon
okay so why did it say I love bacon and
what exactly is going on well you see we
called our function and used it right
here but since this function has a
parameter it says all right in order to
use this function I need one extra piece
of information so whatever information
we gave it right here it actually took
this word bacon and it said X now equals
bacon so now in the body of my function
whenever I come across the variable X I
substitute it with whatever you gave me
which is bacon so let's go ahead and
call this again with um what else do I
love Natalie Portman and arm the movie
Good Will Hunting so now let's go ahead
and save this and run it and maybe this
will be easier to see it says I love
bacon first and then you press okay and
then it says I love Natalie Portman
press ok and then it says I love Good
Will Hunting press ok so now you can see
that it's the same function
it just has different information being
passed into it and by the way I keep
saying pass because the technical term
whenever you give additional information
into a function it's called passing it
information into its parameters so this
the parentheses are technically called
its parameters and when we give
information into it it's called passing
information but anyways you can say
substituting variables it really doesn't
matter as long as your program works so
anyways you could see that whenever we
give extra information it said I love
and then substituted that information as
X so it says I love bacon I love Natalie
Portman
I love Good Will Hunting so that is how
you can use parameters
whenever you're you know want to use
additional information for your function
so this is a really simple example using
an alert
cocks arm yeah that's pretty much all I
have for you for this tutorial in the
next tutorial I'm going to show you what
happens if your function needs more than
just one piece of information maybe it
needs three names instead of just one
maybe it needs a couple numbers instead
of just one so anyways that's what I'm
going to be showing you guys how to do
it's called passing multiple parameters
into a function and it can get kind of
complex but as long as you stick with me
then you'll be okay
so anyways thank you guys for watching
this tutorial and I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
