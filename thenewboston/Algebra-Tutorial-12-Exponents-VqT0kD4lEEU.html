exponents and we've already talked about
them a little bit when we talked about
order of operations but today we're
going to learn how to write
multiplication as exponents and we're
going to learn some basic exponent rules
it's going to help you solve some
equations so you remember an exponent is
written like x squared or Y cubed so
this number right here tells us how many
times X is going to multiply by itself
so 4x squared when you if you remember
talking about squares in geometry it's x
times X or Y cubed is y times y times y
so we're going to write this expression
as an exponent there's only 14 so we can
write it for to the one which you know
if it's just to the 1 power you don't
have to write it because it's assumed
that anything that doesn't have an
exponent is just to the 1 power so we
have 1 2 3 4 4 X's multiplied so we have
X to the fourth and we have 1 2 3 y's so
we have Y to the third so if it's
written like this and then asked for the
cube of c- a well here's some things
you'll have to just kind of memorize
cube means to the third power square
which you already know means to the
second power and then anything after
three you're just going to say to the
fourth power to the fifth power or
they're just going to write it out like
this and have you write it so the cube
of C minus a is C minus a remember
because this is we want this first
remember our order of operations and
then we just put a cube on the outside
of the parentheses
so now we're going to talk about are
some basic exponent rules so the only
way you can combine exponents are if
they have the same base and the base is
this number right here or if it's a
letter it has to be the same letter or
if it's like 4 squared times 4 squared
you can combine those so now when we
have something with an exponent times
the same base with an exponent we're
going to add our powers so for this we
take two plus two is four and this
becomes a to the fourth because if you
look this is a times a and then this is
times a times a so we have 4 a's so a to
the fourth when we're adding exponents
with the same base this becomes 2 a
squared because this is a times a plus a
times a so this is a squared this is a
squared since we have two of them we can
combine them like that you cannot and I
repeat cannot combine exponents over
addition by multiplying them and for
this last one we have a number with an
exponent raised to another exponent so
what you're going to do is you're going
to multiply your powers so this becomes
a to the sixth this is the only time you
actually multiply your powers because up
here it looks like you multiply them but
you added them you add up here and when
it's a power to another power you
multiply so here is this little note you
have to remember you cannot distribute
an exponent so this
and we're not going to talk that much
into it because this deals with um some
more advanced concepts I just want you
to know that you cannot say that this is
equal to this because this is not true
and we'll figure out why a little bit
later on but you just if they give you
an expression like this and they don't
give you numbers to plug in there's
nothing you can do this is the only way
you can write it so now we're going to
do some work with exponents so when it
says evaluate it means plug in these
numbers and find out what it equals so
we're going to plug in 2 for X so we
have 2 squared times 3 cubed times 4 so
2 times two is four so sig 1 for 3 times
3 is 9 times 3 is 27 times 4 i'm going
to put that in the calculator because
that's going to be a kind of big number
4 x 4 x 27 432 exponents get really big
really fast so this time each one we're
going to go on to number three 2q
squared three squared 4 squared so 2
squared is 4 times 3 squared which is
nine times 4 squared which is 16 and
again I'm going to pull out my
calculator 576 when doing problems with
exponents it's really beneficial to use
a calculator just because the numbers
get so big I mean you can do them by
hand it's just easier so 4 cubed times 3
4 times 4 is 16 times 4 is 64 64 x 3 is
equal
to 192 and then we have three squared
times two now this one isn't going to be
that big three squared is 9 times 2 is
18 so that's all the work we're going to
do with exponents today but make sure
you come back and we're going to learn
about polynomial expressions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
