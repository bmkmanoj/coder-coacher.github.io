different kinds of line ray or segments
that have a special kind of relationship
with a circle so secant is a line ray or
segment that contains a cord of a circle
so if you look at this drawing where the
blue lines are where the blue little
dotted lines are those are chords of the
circle so this line line D P this ray l
j or and this segment km are all seekins
of this circle and we usually made a
circle based on the center point so I'm
going to just now that's not the center
of the center of the circle is about
there and we're just going to go let's
ease so of this circle see now a tangent
is a line rate or segment that contains
exactly one point of the circle so it
touches the circle at one point and only
one point if it like if it's like this
kind of a line see how it's here in here
that's a secant not a tangent because it
intercepts the circle once more than
once so this ray PJ this segment
eh oh and this line k L are all tangents
of this circle PJ intercepts this circle
at Point P only a 0 intercepts this
circle at Point C only and KL intercepts
this circle at k only so as long as
there's only one point that this line
writer segments intercepts the circle at
it's a secant of the circle so that's
actually all we're going to talk about
today and in our next lesson we're going
to talk about arcs and angles of a
circle</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
