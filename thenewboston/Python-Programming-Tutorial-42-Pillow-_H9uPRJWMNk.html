video and these next I want to say like
five to ten videos they're going to be
the coolest place on tutorials so far
because I'm going to show you guys how
to use this awesome
library it's actually really easy to use
but you can do awesome things to images
like rotate them stretch them resize
them you can actually make some really
awesome photo filters like you would in
Photoshop or Instagram so I'm gonna be
showing you guys all of that so uh well
let's go ahead and get started
oh now freakin whooping-cough already
actually winter just started we just got
the first snowfall and for some reason
whenever the snow starts falling the
inside of my house gets really dry like
my skin starts drying out but that's
disgusting so let's get back on track
here now obviously I'm going to be
teaching you guys how to edit images do
some cool things with them so we
probably need some images now I already
took a couple from my computer we should
show them to you guys here's me is baby
I'm also going to be using this one this
is my old profile picture for Bucky's
room
this girl ping I just made this in
Photoshop real quick um I don't know why
I chose this I thought it was kind of
funny she looks like I don't even know
she looks like but I needed something
with some colors and the last photo I'm
going to be using is a picture of my
sister and I so of course just go ahead
and grab any picture or image from your
computer and drag in the same directory
is your Python file and you're going to
be good but if for some reason you want
to use my pictures then I'll post them
on the forum but you know you probably
don't want to look at me throughout the
whole series so again go get any
pictures drop them in and you'll be good
to go so now that we have some pictures
to work with the only other thing that
we need to do kind of to prepare is
download that library now if you go to
file settings of course you can see all
your libraries the package is called
pillow so whenever you of course
download it click this type in pillow
and you'll be good to go so again that's
pillow but check this out
whenever we actually import the library
what we're going to do is we're going to
type from PIL import the class image all
right so we're going to be using this
image class first but wait a minute
buggy you just will need to download the
pillow library but right here I'm
importing from pill so what the heck is
up with that why is it called pill well
if this is probably pretty boring but I
just want to explain to you guys what's
going on so you aren't confused right
now we're using Python 3.4 this isn't
actually code I'll just type it out real
quick so we're using Python 3.4 and the
library to edit images is called pillow
now in the old version of Python that
isn't compatible with what I'm teaching
you guys the old version was called pill
so what they did for the new version is
they pretty much copied it made it
compatible with three point four and
named the pillow so why didn't they just
put pillow right there well for all the
pretty much programmers who wanted who
are already familiar with the syntax of
this library they wanted to you know
make it kind of convention familiar for
them so that's why they just imported it
from pill and you know so I don't know
it's a pretty stupid story but um that's
why it's called pill instead of pillow
to make it kind of compatible and
comfortable for all the people who are
familiar with using it so cool story bro
I know but uh whatever so now that we
got everything taken care of let's go
ahead and get started making a basic
image so the first thing we need to do
is create some kind of object from this
image class a pillow object so I'm just
going to name my object IMG it's the
most boring thing I possibly could have
thunk of this sinc funk think think it
of yep that's it think it up alright so
in order to create an object image dot
open and in this open function what you
do is you just type the name of what do
I want to use all right so I'll take
this image from my computer Bucky jpg
and what we're saying is pretty much
openness
and convert it to a pillow object so now
this IMG variable is actually a pillow
object so now we can do a bunch of cool
things with it before I start showing
you guys the really advanced functions
of how to manipulate it I'll just show
you guys a couple
boring stuff first but it's actually
slept we're going to be using a lot so
the first thing is just to print out
some properties of this object or the
image so we can print out the image size
and the dot symbol and then size
property or attribute so actually you
run this right now and you see your
returns a tuple of 400 by 400 that of
course means that this image is 400 by
wide by 400 wide by 400 tall and we can
also print out something like I don't
know it's another thing format is
another property and what this does is
it says okay so right now we can see
that it's a JPEG and later on I'm going
to be showing you guys how to convert
for example if we you wanted to convert
this JPEG to a ping or a gif I'm going
to be showing you guys how to do that as
well but right now this is how you print
out simple properties of it and one cool
thing that I also want to show you guys
is this anytime you want to actually
display this image then what you can do
is you can type the name of the object
and show now I want to explain one thing
down here
you can't display images this is just a
console it's pretty much like a fancy
command line built just for PyCharm it
isn't made to display images itself so
whenever you want to display an image on
your computer what happens whenever you
call this function is it goes to the
default program that you whenever you
you know you're just um put on show you
guys
whenever you're just looking at files
like this and you double click
whenever you double click an image file
however it opens is the default image
processing program for your computer now
since I have Photoshop installed on my
computer whenever I run this the image
is going to open in Photoshop but if you
don't have Photoshop then I might just
open window explore or anything like
that but that's what's going on you also
probably notice that whenever this open
in Photoshop look at the name in Python
it was named Bucky jpg but in Photoshop
it is named tum 5 a 6 a 3 b JV BMP and
what this is is basically in order to
open in Photoshop it needs to open a
file
so what pillow does whenever you call
this show function it pretty much
creates a temporary image file and it
saves it real quick and then it opens it
with whatever program that you told it
to open so that is the basics and pretty
much all the boring stuff of you know
the boring history of pillow some boring
attributes and you know some boring
rules about open how to open it in
temporary file names so now that we got
all that crap out of the way we can
finally begin learning the cool stuff
and I'm going to talk to you guys about
that stuff in the next video because I'm
pretty hungry and I'm probably going to
go eat like seven hot pockets right now
so moving on I don't thank you guys for
watching don't forget subscribe and I'll
see you guys next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
