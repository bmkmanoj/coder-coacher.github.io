buddy Blackford and you're listening to
another Adobe After Effects cs6 tutorial
and this is for the new boston so this
time around we're going to be learning
about rotation and animating rotation
it's pretty simple and there's a few
ways to do it so let's get on with the
tutorial
all right the first and easiest way to
rotate is to use the twirl down menu in
the transformation menu down here in
your layers in your timeline panel and
that's the most precise and easiest way
so the way you get can get down to it is
twirl down you transform menu to the
rotation section or press R there you go
R so that's easy enough
you've got your degrees here how much
you want to rotate so I can type it in
90 and it'll rotate 90 degrees you can
drag and it'll go around like this
obviously and of course you can hold
shift and drag and it will go faster 0
real quick now if you rotate past 360
here it'll you you can see that it
turned this side over here turned to 1x
that means one time that means you
turned it around in a circle one time
you can also edit that value and say
three times so if you're just rotating
without any keyframes that really
doesn't matter but if you're animating
let's animate it real quick
and let's just rotate this two times you
can see it rotates in a full circle 360
degrees twice if you hold down control
and you scrub it gives you a little bit
finer control not as fast as you can see
this is holding down controller right
here if I let go of controller right now
you can see it goes faster
holding shift makes it go super fast so
there that's the control for this little
scrubber here and turn off my keyframes
and I'm going to set this back to 0 so
we can start fresh another way is to use
the tool panels up here and the rotation
the rotation tool up here you can click
on it or great stupid video game updated
got my way
yes I like to play this plane fighting
video game every once in a while and
updates it's actually not a stupid game
is actually pretty cool but back to the
tutorial you can use the rotation tool
up here it's not super precise but you
can you can get to a general area and
then if you really need to if you really
need to tune it you can tune it down
here in the rotation in your timeline
panel if you hold shift when you're
rotating it'll snap to the nearest
90-degree angle see that which is nice
the hotkey for rotation is W and I guess
the way to remember it is kind of stupid
but rotate so W for what a it's very
dumb but I'm just a easiest thing I can
remember and it's kind of kind of funny
but so if you have you're pressing W you
can rotate so let's go back and I'm
gonna go back to the arrow selection
tool by pressing V now if you hold W you
can quickly go to your rotate and then
when you let go of it it will switch
back to the selection tool so just like
with the zoom oops not just like with
the zoom so if you hold Z it'll quickly
switch to the zoom if you hold W a
quickly switched to the rotation etc
now if you would like to increase
rotation by increments of 1 you can
press the + have your layer selected and
press the plus key and it will rotate by
increments of 1 and press the minus key
to go back if you hold shift it'll
increase in increments of 10 as you can
see down here I kind of had my mouse
over it a little bit but increments of
10 right now and then that's holding
shift and pressing while the layer
selected pressing the plus we'll do it
in - we'll do it by 1 if you mess up and
get really out there with your rotations
and it's been a while and you can't do
anymore undos the quickest way to reset
is to double click your rotation tool
and it will go back to 0 down here so
we'll do that again set it at some
random rotation there go up to the tools
panel up here and double click the
rotation tool it goes back to 0 and
resets itself that's about it for the
rotation tool as I said before it's a
pretty easy tool pretty much all these
transform tools are pretty basic and
easy to remember and you'll use them
most often more than most tools so it's
good to get a good handle on them and
just make sure you remember your hotkeys
and you'll be able to work quickly and
efficiently so hopefully you guys
enjoyed the tutorial make sure you
either leave a comment or like it or
subscribe because there's a lot more
tutorials to come so everybody have a
good day
see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
