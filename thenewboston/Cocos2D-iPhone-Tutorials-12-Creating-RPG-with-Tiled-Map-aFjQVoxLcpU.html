course who would you expect and welcome
to another cocos2d tutorial now in these
next couple tutorials we're gonna be
going over something called tiled maps
and we're actually gonna be creating a
full-fledged RPG role-playing game so if
you ever played pokemon or let's see
zelda for a nintendo the regular
Nintendo 8-bit or you know any games
like that that's what we're gonna be
learning to gray so this is probably one
of the funnest tutorials I'm about to
teach you guys because I love making
these games it's really easy and
whenever you look at a game like that
you'd be like alright if I was to make
this I don't even know where to start
but after least Oriels everything is
gonna be a piece of cake you're gonna be
able to make some of the greatest best
RPGs that you know can come out of your
mind
so let's go ahead enough of me talking
there's your intro hope you enjoyed it
let's go ahead and download the things
we need so let me expand google and the
first thing we need is a program called
it tiled actually before I even do that
let's go ahead and start up our blank
let's create a new project and Cocos
through the application choose and just
name this like RPG and that looks pretty
good and now what we want to do is in
resources we want to drag this tiled map
in and copy it just like that
now I know you guys don't have this file
yet but what I'm gonna be doing is
posting a link below this video and you
can download it there or if you don't
want to download this one you can pretty
much just go google tile Maps or RPG
tile maps and a bunch of options will
pop up but this one was real simple and
you know it was just the size as I need
so if you want to follow along when the
story I'll click the link below to
download it so anyways what tiled map is
I should probably tell you that this is
pretty much
think of these is a bunch of different
stamps and using these stamps you can
create an entire map so yeah it's pretty
much a good explanation so you can have
grass in one area a path a stone path a
fence you know pretty much how Pokemon
or Zelda is made it's made with the same
images over and over and when we create
actual Maps you're gonna be able to see
this very clearly this just looks like a
bunch of collage right now but anyways
that's that so go ahead and if I
actually just go ahead and minimize this
and open up Google and now let's go to
what I was going to teach you go ahead
to Google and let's go ahead and search
hopefully this works
tiled yep here we go and the first thing
that's gonna pop up is tiled map editor
or you can go to map editor org go ahead
and click this and what you can see
right here is this is the program that
allows you to make tiled maps so if you
see in these little images right here
that you can kind of see the maps that
we're gonna be creating later on so here
is one of the views and here's another
view this one is kind of the bird's eye
view that we're gonna be creating but
anyways enough of me talking here's what
you need to do go ahead and you we need
to download this program go ahead and
download QT zero point five point zero
for Mac OS 10 if you don't want to
download it then they have a Java
version that you can use but I really
don't like it so let's go ahead and just
download it I mean downloading programs
is always fun or so go ahead and
download that I'm not gonna show you how
to download it cuz you guys obviously
know how and go ahead and once you have
it downloaded open it open don't mind
that warning and here is the map that I
made so far so you know this is great
you know but you know I needed to you
guys had to make a map so here's what we
need to do go ahead and once you have
tiled open go ahead and click file new
and make sure your settings are same as
mine now
orthogonal is pretty much like um
Pokemon and Zelda pretty much some map
you're looking at right here now this
other one isometric it's kind of like
it's kind of like more 3d than 2d I
think farmville has it and it's pretty
much just like 3d just think of that we
don't want it
so anyways make sure you have orthogonal
selected this is the RPGs we want now
the map size this width and height these
aren't pixels these are the actual tiles
so how many tiles do you want and you'll
see later on what tiles are now the tile
size this is the size in pixels of each
tile
so this'll largely depends on the image
you're using for your tile map but if
you download that one I told you to
download this should be fine so go ahead
and put 32 by 32 by the way this fits
perfectly on iPhone screen since just
320 by 480 there's a little hint for you
make sure our tiles when you're working
with iPhone or 32 by 32 so we click OK
and now we have this blank nothing going
on but what we want is that tile set so
we actually have something to make a map
out of so let's go ahead and in order to
get our tile set go ahead up the map and
go to new tile set and then go ahead and
name this anything like RPG tile set
looks good and now go ahead in our image
mine is gonna be different than yours
but go ahead and wherever you download
that file go ahead and press open and
your tiles of course are gonna be 32 by
32 your margin and spacing should be 0
and 0 some people create tile sets with
little black bars in between so you can
see the grid but for this case just put
0 and 0 most 99% of times going to be 0
on 0 so go ahead and click OK and now
you have pretty much your palette of
anything you can draw on the screen here
pretty cool huh
so now you see your tile set if you have
more than one they're gonna appear right
here but we own
one right now so we won't have to worry
about that so what we want to do is
start creating our map and I'm actually
gonna yeah I think I'm actually gonna
start creating the map in the next
tutorial so you know I don't want to
make this one too long so in the next
tutorial I'm going to show you what all
these tools do even though there's only
like two of them and I'm gonna be
creating a map and we might even begin
coding our program I don't know I guess
you guys are gonna have to wait and see
so anyways thank you guys for watching
this tutorial I bet you guys can't wait
until next time so yeah I don't forget
to subscribe and I'll see you guys then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
