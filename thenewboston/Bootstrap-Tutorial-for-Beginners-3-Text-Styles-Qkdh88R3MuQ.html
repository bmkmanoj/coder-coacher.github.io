video I'm going to show you how to use
some of the default text styling that's
built right in the bootstrap now
actually I'll write all of them I'll
just stick them all on one page so then
when you go to my github page you can
just copy whatever you want and I don't
know I think will be easier than
breaking them down into a bunch of files
but the first one I want to show you
guys is highlighting so I'll say you can
highlight words or texts using the mark
tags now anytime you want to highlight a
certain chunk of text then you just use
this element right here mark so mark
mark and hey when it does that it
autocompletes when I don't want it to
autocomplete and whenever I do it
doesn't pop up now this actually might
be a little hard to see since it's going
to highlight it in yellow let me run
this and check it out so I don't know if
you guys can see this on YouTube but
this chunk right here it has a yellow
tint if you can't then trust me it's a
lot easier to see whenever you're
looking at it in person so that's
highlighting another cool thing is using
quotes so if I use block quotes inside
here say that we were quoting someone
why such as my grandpa so my grandpa
said sometimes I wet to the bed on
purpose you did tell me that I'm not
lying and for the footer we can just you
know quote them or attribute him so my
grandpa so now whenever you run this so
this gives us the appearance of a quote
by adding a little indentation and also
this line on the left and also the size
and coloring in this little - it did it
all for us made it super easy now
another thing that I use a lot is a list
so let me give it a header actually what
can we make a list of movie things to do
when
you're bored we actually give myself a
little bit more space like to be able to
scroll a little bit alright so what are
we going to do when we're bored well the
first thing we're going to do is we're
going to make a list DL now actually
break this up into indoors and outdoors
so what can you do indoors
well we indent this well the first thing
that you can do is take a nap
you know I don't want to put too much
effort in this you definitely don't want
to work or do anything productive and
what else can you do when you're bored
inside watch Netflix for 8 hours
by the way orange is the new black came
out on Netflix today season number 3 so
you know goodbye weekend that's what I'm
going to be doing alright now let me
just add a one more list in I'll say
outdoors I'll show you guys how cool
this looks so Dede what can you do when
you're bored in your outdoors you can go
back inside because you shouldn't be
outdoors doing any physical activity you
should be inside playing on the computer
and this is what a list looks like
pretty sweet check it out art now let's
see what else we got
whenever you're doing code for example
you want to do some syntax highlighting
I don't know maybe you're trying to make
the next big github or maybe you're
making some documentation for an API you
have a couple different options that you
can do so I'll say that um I'll say I
was writing some documentation for a
tutorial to set the users weight use set
user weight what's my weight 374 pounds
and I'll say within it
all right so whenever you're going to
use code then what you should do is you
should use the code tags right there now
if I just highlight this and drag the
code you want to highlight in and run it
this is what you get and I know you've
seen these on a bunch of different sites
before let me actually add a semicolon
to that I don't know why I just bothered
me so the default code styling is this
light pink background and it uses mono
spaced font in the text is like dark
pink but whenever someone sees this they
realize that this is source code so
that's one option that you can use now
another thing I want to point out is
this the code tags they aren't really
good for multi-line code so if you ever
have more than one line or like more
than you know little chunk of text and
you probably want to use the pre tags so
let me just say multi-line code use the
pre tags
all right so inside here what can one
freaking cord for my headphones like get
all tangled up in me so for n in range
one oh one I'll just write some Python
real quick then um what condition can we
make if n modulus for zero they don't
just do like print then again this code
doesn't mean anything at all and you
don't need semicolons in Python so check
it out so as you can see we have some
pre formatted text and the reason that
this is spaced so far to the left is
because this is spaced so far to the
left and it just reads it directly but
if you highlight it all and if you hold
Shift + tab I don't know if you guys
knew this but that means reverse tab or
take away the tabs so you know that's
not a real you know bootstrap related
bit of information but it's pretty handy
so again this is much easier to read
then this right here so for a little
snippet use the code tags for multi-line
code use the pre tags and this stands
for pre formatted text now one other
thing I want to mention that is kind of
code related there's another thing that
you're going to see and it's called KBD
this stands for keyboard input now I
really don't like this because I think
it just looks stupid but this is
supposed to be keyboard input so for
example if you are saying like giving
instructions to a user and they're
supposed to do something like hold down
ctrl Alt Delete then you can stick them
inside the kbd tag so ctrl + Alt +
delete there is some kind of code or
whatever now if you run this then it
kind of looks like the code tags in the
sense that it's mono space code but I
don't know I don't really see this that
often apparently a black background and
white text is supposed to resemble key
word input for some reason you can just
use the code tags that's probably what I
would do but you know follow your heart
now the last couple of things I want to
mention are this two little elements
whenever you use bootstrap it comes with
predefined contextual colors now these
are just colors that are used for let's
say whenever the user does something
correctly like fills out a form then we
probably want to show green text since
green resembles success and whenever
they mess something up or we give them
an error then we're going to have some
red text now instead of just going out
and picking these colors bootstrap
already included these standard colors
for you so we just add a quick heading
so it might look make it look a little
bit easier so I'll say uh built-in color
classes and whenever I stick this on my
github page add comments and make
everything a little bit prettier so
everything is jumbled together
but for now I just want to you know show
you guys some real quick examples so the
class for one of these is let's say that
show you guys a bunch of different ones
so text muted is think of it like
disabled or like not clickable and I'll
just say a text mutant and this is just
going to be a light gray so the default
text is black or very close to black
this is going to be grayed out text and
I'll show you guys two other ones even
though that there are a couple more so
success I'll say like um congrats you
filled out that form correctly and one
other one is text - danger and this is
going to be red and we'll just say like
a danger text we'll keep it real boring
now if I run this check it out
so without setting any colors manually
you see that all right
that's class is grade this one the
success one is green and this is red so
that way we can keep these classes on
every single page without having to
include you know any custom CSS classes
and also these classes they're the same
for the background colors too so in
order to get a background color of let's
say green or red all we do instead of
text is we change this to be G so BG
success means a green background BG
danger means a red background and check
it out so all right so I guess it wasn't
you know red it was a little bit pink
but that is what it does so again there
are some very common text styles in
other words typography as some people
say
and there's a lot of other text classes
and different things that you can do but
now that we know the basics of it it's
time to move on to something else and
that would be tables that's what we're
going to be talking about in the next
video I'll see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
