signals these are actually the rear turn
signals and these are pretty sweet
because they also came pre-wired not
like old school where you had to wire
everything yourself now the wire gets
fed through a bowl on the bottom and
what this is going to do is the first
thing we have to do after we get it all
adjusted is we need to put it through
the bracket on the go-kart so the
bracket is going to go right there
now once it's on the bracket how it
stays there is on the wire you got your
washers and nuts so it's going to go
ahead and go on the bracket and then
we're going to go ahead and tighten it
up and the only thing you have to watch
out for is make sure that this is
pointed perfectly backwards towards the
rear so people can actually see that
you're turning and once it's all mounted
nice and secure we have to plug it in
and since it's pretty wired we don't
have to you know connect any wires just
go ahead and plug this in to plug from
your electrical box and you'll be good
to go so now I'm going to show you guys
where to install the rear turn signals
and I'm also going to install the front
turn signals while I'm at it
now these brackets right here on the
rear of the go-kart is where the rear
turn signals go so here's how you
install this once you get it out of the
box go ahead and feed the wire through
this split on your bracket and push the
bolt through the hole right there now
all of your nuts and bolts or excuse me
bolts in a-okay washers and nuts that's
what I'm trying to say nuts bolts
washers nuts tomato tomahto are going to
be on your wire so just go ahead and
tighten that under nut there we go
now before you tighten it you probably
want to stand behind it and make sure
that this turn signal is facing directly
backwards I'm just going to eyeball it
looks pretty good to me and on mine this
I don't think this is actually metal I
think it's plastic so whenever you have
anything plastic so you need to bolt on
make sure you don't put it too hard or
else it will crack when I'm correct this
right now
I'm scared I'm going to crack it easy
Bessie Bessie there we go so this is
nice and snug it ain't going anywhere
and now what you have to do the last
step is connect the wiring from your
electrical box which is right here to
the wiring on your turn signal so go
ahead and stamp those together there we
go and it should be able to work now now
the only other thing is you guys
probably notice all this slack right
here to get rid of the slack probably
the easiest way is if you just bundle it
up like this stick it to your frame and
then take a zip tie and zip it around
here then then it's pretty much going to
keep your electrical from hanging down
because not only is this really ugly
looking but you don't want it like
hitting the muffler or something because
that's going to burn through the rebel
rubber insulation and ruin your lawyer
so again any time you have slack just go
ahead bundle it up and dip tie it to the
frame and it would be good to go now for
the front turn signal exact same method
I already plugged it in to the wiring so
now sit your wire through slide your
bolt down and then put your washers on
and eventually your nuts
now this one's kind of a pain for this
bracket and hardly to fit my fingers
into okay I can get a wrench into it go
ahead and tighten that before you do
make sure it's perfectly facing forward
and sorry feet here like a dog barking
and old guy
moaning long want to go home to stop
while I make a video buts not that mean
there we go perfect so now do this exact
same thing on the other side and also
the rear turn signal on the other side
and once you hook everything up you'll
be good to go just don't forget to a tie
down your slack from the wire and of
course well thank you guys for watching
