video I want to show you first how to
perform an aggressive scan so up to this
point we've been performing a basic scan
and what we did is let's say we scan a
server it returned all the most common
services like HTTP MySQL FTP and give us
a little bit of information about it
like what ports they're running on and
you know all of that stuff is the port
open or not
well we can also use nmap - capital a
and this does the exact same scan but it
does aggressively now I don't know why
they named it aggressively it's
basically a way to give you more
information so buy more information it
means it does things like try to detect
the operating system the actual versions
of the services it does a traceroute so
basically a scan just like before you're
going to scan a server or device or
network whatever but it's going to give
you a lot more details so I'm just going
to do this with the new Boston comso
54.1 86.2 5079 I can just type the new
boston.com but you know I want to show
you guys that IP address or domain name
doesn't really matter and there you go
we can see that it returns not only the
port's stay in services but also tries
to return the version it doesn't always
get it correct or it can't always
determine it but there you go
and it tells you a little more
information we're using get and you know
it also does a traceroute which is
pretty cool and this is what I was
talking about the operating system so my
server is running on Linux we're
actually using Ubuntu for it so there
you go more information now this does in
fact return a traceroute in other words
from my computer
whenever I connect to the new bus an
outcome server it shows you all the
routers it used to get they're basically
the path now instead of just doing that
whenever you want to see the traceroute
you can actually single that out so if
you're right nmap - - tracer out then
you can just type in the IP address of
some server or the new boston comm and
hit
and what this is going to do is is it's
just going to show you the traceroute
and if you guys are like you know that's
pretty interesting but what am I ever
going to need this well say that you're
connecting to some website and your
connection is really slow you can
actually use this to determine the
bottlenecks so it not only tells you the
extra routers but actually tells you the
time that takes so if you see that one
of these is really really like a slow or
taking a long time then you know that
there's probably something funky going
on there so you can investigate it a
little bit more if you want now another
cool thing that you guys may find handy
is what if you only want to you know try
to detect the operating system instead
of just going through looking through
all that clutter you can write- capital
o and then you just write the new boston
comm or whatever server and boom Orosz
the look of that so it says running a
Linux three point something so some
version of Linux and it also says just
guessing so again like I said there's no
like Universal API on every server where
you can just by hey tell me information
about you and it just gives it to you
and map kind of has to try to figure it
out sometimes it can get it right
sometimes it isn't sure so it just tells
you okay we're pretty sure that it's a
Linux but again note that this is just a
guess we could be wrong and okay that's
embarrassing oh I just had a McDonald's
because like the grocery store is like a
mile away from my house but I'm Way too
pasty to go get groceries so you know
whatever all right now another thing
that you can do is you can actually just
single out the service versions so if
you're a - s capital V so lowercase s
capital V then you can write the IP
address or the domain name and again
this is just going to return the version
of the services that are running so
there you go so now you can see that not
only do we have this port state and
service column but we also have a fourth
one called version and it's going to
attempt to give you
you the version of each service so if
you're I don't know maintaining a bunch
of different servers you can scan them
real quick and make sure that every you
know different service is up-to-date and
there you go so there's that so that is
an aggressive scan basically a way of
getting more information about each
service and if you only want a single
bit of information you can single that
out as well
so I think guys for watching I will
smell you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
