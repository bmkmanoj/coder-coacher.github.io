is Bucky Roberts and in this video
series I am going to be teaching you
guys about a CO now SEO stands for
search engine optimization if you guys
are wondering what the heck of that is
it's basically a way that you can
improve your website's search results
ranking so basically what I'm trying to
say is whenever someone types in oh no
what's this homemade eggnog that your
homemade eggnog business is going to
appear at the top of that list so if you
guys are wondering all right that sounds
cool very useful but how do we do it
well what we basically need to do is we
need to figure out how Google works
because if we can figure out how Google
ranks these websites and what formula
they use then what we can do is we can
go to our website tweak it to basically
look at all the variables and make sure
that we appear at the top now
unfortunately Google just doesn't hand
out their formula however we have a
pretty good indicator of what some of
those factors and variables are now even
if they did just hand out their formula
then you still need to account for you
know the thousands and thousands of
however many different variables that
you know go into it
so there's a lot to talk about and some
of it is simple stuff that you know some
easy things you can do to your website
to really boost your search results and
some other things are a little bit more
complex but I'm gonna be showing you
guys step-by-step how everything is done
I kind of want some eggnog now kind of
getting off track let's let me find
something else pancakes
oh that doesn't make me that doesn't
really take it off my mind art getting
hungry now alright so back on track here
do we need to worry about SEO well the
answer is without doubt yes if you guys
are just like I'm just going to make a
website hopefully people are going to
find it you know maybe our share a link
on Facebook not a good idea this is one
of the most important and most
overlooked aspects of web design now
unless you own Facebook or something
then the majority of your traffic is
going to come from Google so a little
bit of your traffic is
are we going to come from Yahoo and Bing
and maybe social networks you know just
your friends but the majority of
websites most of the traffic is going to
come from Google now another cool thing
I want to point out is in these
tutorials whenever I show you guys how
to you know improve your search engine
or pretty much search results ranking it
isn't just useful for Google any website
that has a search function like eBay and
Etsy and YouTube any website we can type
something in and you have a bunch of
results these techniques are going to be
useful because they all share a lot of
similarities in their formula and the
way that they rank those items in the
results is you know the same in a lot of
cases so it's kind of cool in the sense
that with traditional advertising let's
say you wanted to advertise your pancake
making business you would have to go out
and buy a bunch of ads and they would
appear on the right and you're basically
going after customers however whenever
you use SEO what happens is you already
have people who want homemade pancakes
so essentially if you can get your
search results or a website to appear at
the top then it's kind of like all those
customers are now coming after you so
it's definitely worth it
one of the best returns on your time and
investments so I'm excited to get
started and before we get into the next
tutorial I'm probably going to go make
some pancakes now so thank you guys for
watching don't forget subscribe and I'll
see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
