wanted to make a video real quick
talking to you guys about a couple
things that you might enjoy first of all
I wanted to thank everybody who's
subscribed my channel and has watched my
videos if it wasn't for you guys I
wouldn't be making these videos at all
so thank you very much
and another thing as my way of saying
thank you I've decided to give away this
custom computer that I just built in my
tutorials hopefully you follow along
with me to one of my subscribers now I
was gonna sell this but I thought it
would be a lot funner if I give it away
in the contest and I bet you guys would
enjoy more - so that's what I'm going to
do now if you want to win this computer
that we just built here's what you got
to do first thing you need to do is
subscribe to my channel if you already
subscribe then that's great then you're
already eligible to win but not then I
need you to click that little yellow
subscribe button next in my description
box and once you're a subscriber you're
eligible to be in the contest next thing
you need to do is wait till this video
it's a hundred thousand views once it
hits a hundred thousand views I need you
leave a comment once I see that the
video has helped thousands use I'm gonna
go to my comments and pick the first
comment that I see and once I picked
this comment I'm gonna click on the name
and if that person is subscriber then
they're the winner if they're not a
subscriber then we're gonna move on to
the next person
and once I pick this person that has
left the first comment I see I'm going
to contact you for all your information
and everything so you don't need a
message of me for that and I'm gonna
announce the winner in a video in this
description box so that's how you know
when this contest is over the last thing
that I want to mention is that I will
pay for shipping to ship this computer
to you as long as you live in the 48
continental US states if you live
anywhere outside the US or in Alaska or
Hawaii then you can still win this
computer but you have to pay for
shipping
so that's all I have for you thank you
everyone again for subscribing my
channel and watching my tutorials I'll
continue to post more tutorials so
thanks again and good luck</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
