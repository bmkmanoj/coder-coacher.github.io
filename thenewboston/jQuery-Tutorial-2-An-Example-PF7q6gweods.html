with a video tutorial for the new Boston
in the last part we looked at an
introduction to jQuery however let's go
now on and look at an example that I've
quickly written out I'm going to go over
to this tab in my browser and you can
see that we've got a paragraph of text
here that just says you can see this
paragraph now I've created a button here
which actually hides the paragraph and
then allows the paragraph to be shown
again so this is probably an extreme way
to make a simple example but an
effective example of how powerful and
easy jQuery can be to use now this is
essentially going to hide the paragraph
and then allow me to reshow it while
changing the button text so if I go
ahead and click hide you can see that
the paragraph has been hidden if I go
ahead and now click show you can see
that the paragraph is shown again and
you'll notice that the button text
changes as well now in JavaScript
particularly the animation you see as it
fades up and Scrolls up this would be
extremely tedious to program and quite
long to program and write out however
the code that I'm actually using is
extremely simple
now don't worry too much about the code
I am for now a bit later on I'm going to
show you how to implement jQuery into
your page and we're going to look at
writing our first example but I'm just
going to go over to my text editor to
show you how easy this is to write now
the first thing we have is a button here
and that's the button that we use to
hide and display the message the value
you can see at the moment hide and
that's changed in toggle jas i've given
it an ID so i can reference when the
button click event happens you'll see
that there's no JavaScript code in the
actual part of my page that we see so
for example the input button and the
paragraph every time I click a button
this is handled by this toggle j/s file
you'll also notice that I've included
jQuery the jQuery library into my page
so let's take a look at jog
Tuggle Jas now the first thing that's
happening is we are looking for a clique
within taking the value of the textbox
sorry the button and then we're using
the toggle function to hide the
paragraph we're also then checking the
star the value of the button and then
changing it accordingly so just with
this short code we've achieved a an
effect which is extremely usable on your
website for example if you have a
message that you want to show to a user
but you might want to give them the
option to hide it now this can also be
done with a link it doesn't need to be
done with a button it's extremely
flexible to use so with this example you
can see how easy it is to actually
implement jQuery and start to look for
events happening on your page you'll
also see that I've got jQuery jeaious
which I've just pasted into a text
editor and and actually included on my
index dot PHP page so at the start of
the tutorial I did mention if you don't
understand this then that's absolutely
not a problem this was just an example
to show you how we can actually use
jQuery and how easy it is now this is an
example of an animation effect and
however later on we're going to be
looking at Ajax and how we can actually
take data and pass it to another PHP
file which will allow us to actually
create a more dynamic and useful website
so we're going to be looking at that a
bit later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
