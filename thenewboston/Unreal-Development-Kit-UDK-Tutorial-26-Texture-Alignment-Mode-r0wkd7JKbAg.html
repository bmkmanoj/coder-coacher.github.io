tutorial and this is oral it's probably
going to be real quick because I only
want to go over one very small thing and
that's this this little tea with the
up-down left-right arrow is the texture
a line mode so go ahead and click that
now click on the texture and let me tell
you guys what the textural on mode does
the texture a line mode pretty much
allows you to mess with all the
properties of the texture it allows you
to move her around scale it rotate it
pretty much anything you can do with a
polygon before you can do with the
texture now so basically it's an
alternative to this surface properties
whenever you're working with textures I
recommend that you use these surface
properties but if you just need to do a
real quick fix on a texture like just
move it a little bit then the texture
mode would be fine so go ahead and you
can do things like move them around
using the translation mode I'm go ahead
and demonstrate moving around the
texture and you could also hop over to
rotate now rotate only allows you to
rotate in one direction and in this case
the Z it doesn't allow you to rotate it
like in the X in y direction because it
shouldn't it should always be aligned
right with you know whatever surface
you're working on so you can rotate it
this way or this way but like I said you
can't rotate it in other directions
because that just wouldn't make sense
this is on flat plane so we should only
be able to rotate it like that and the
last one is of course scaling and
non-uniform scaling which allow you to
grow it or shrink it so again like I
said this is just a real quick tutorial
demonstrating one of these other modes
called the texture align mode so I said
we're going to be going through these
buttons when the time is right and now
the time was right to cover that so well
that's why I covered it so I don't know
where we're going to be talking about in
the next tutorial but I promise you guys
it's going to be amazing and awesome and
you should definitely check it out so
thank you guys for watching and I guess
I'll see you guys in next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
