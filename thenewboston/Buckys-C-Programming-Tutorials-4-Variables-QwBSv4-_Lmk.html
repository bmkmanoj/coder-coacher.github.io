your fourth C++ tutorial and in this
tutorial I'm going to be going over
something called variables because
variables are such a huge part of C++ I
can't stress this enough so let's go
ahead and tap into our memory banks and
try to remember back in like seventh
grade when you first start learning
about variables and if you can't
remember let me give you a brief history
lesson variables are basically just
placeholders that's all they are so
let's go ahead and say we had a variable
named X and we set it equal to bacon
well then whenever we would have a
sentence like Bucky loves X we knew that
x equals bacon so this man Bucky
loves bacon simple enough so let me give
you guys another quick example say X was
equal to 7 so then when we had a
statement like 5 plus X we knew that
this meant 5 plus 7 simple enough so as
you can see a variable is basically just
a placeholder now let me go ahead and
show you guys how to make variables in
C++ and C++ in order to make variables
you go ahead and first write the type of
variable you're going to be working with
now I'm going to be going over datatypes
later but for now I want to give you
guys one data type and that's I and T
this stands for integer and an integer
is pretty much like a whole number like
683 540 it's a number without a decimal
place so now that you gave C++ the type
of data you're going to be working with
you need to go ahead and name your
variable go ahead and name it anything
you want I'm going to go ahead and name
mine tuna so now it has a type and a
name so now all we have to do is use the
equal sign and set it equal to a value
so since this e has to be equal to a
whole number let's set equal to 6 it
doesn't matter what whole number you set
equal to but I just like 6 it's easy to
type so now we have the variable tuna
and C++ knows that it's an integer and
it's equal to the value of six so now
what can we do with variables well just
like we can print out text on the screen
we can also print out variables just as
easy so if you went ahead and said C out
and just go ahead and print it out tuna
we can go ahead and build and run this
and it would print out not the word tuna
but it would print out six just like
that so that's pretty cool and that's
the basics of variables and how we can
use variables in C++ and actually and
this is sort of what I was planning on
doing is building a simple calculator um
let me go ahead and I guess I have time
for this let's go ahead and make two
variables and I'll show you guys another
cool thing that you can do the C++ let's
go ahead and make int we'll call make a
variable called a and we'll set it equal
to four let's go ahead and make another
variable called B which is of course an
integer because that's the only type we
know right now and we'll set this equal
to you know 21 or something doesn't
matter as long as they're both numbers
now let's go ahead and make another
variable called a sum and this sum is
going to be equal to a plus B so now you
can see aside from let's go ahead and
yeah that's good enough so now you can
see that aside from just assigning
variables numbers just like that you can
also use basic arithmetic to set
variables equal to another value as well
so now the value of 25 a plus B is going
to be equal to sum so now if you go
ahead and print out C out
some and we go ahead and we build and
run this check it out it prints out 25
on the screen
pretty cool huh so again in this story I
want to show you guys that in order to
make variables go ahead and write the
datatype what do you want the name of
the variable or excuse me what you want
the name of the variable to be and what
you want the value of variable to be and
then aside from just assigning variables
basic values you can also use basic
arithmetic like a plus B on B minus a
you could done that let's see if you had
B minus a let's go ahead and see what
the value of that is 17 so again you can
go ahead and set variables equal to
basic arithmetic using other variables
and you can even do this sum equals 48
minus 7 again this isn't really the sum
anymore it's more of a proud buzz and
not the product not the quotient the
difference there we go that's what I and
there we go I got it
so again you understand the basics of
variables that's what I'm trying to
stress so in the next tutorial what I'm
going to be doing is I'm going to be
showing you guys how to make a very
basic calculator and this is the first
program we're going to be building they
actually interacts with the user and
it's going to be awesome and you needed
to understand variables before I could
show that to you guys so that's why I
had to go over this story but for now
thank you guys for watching don't forget
to subscribe and don't forget to check
out my website the new Boston comm it's
awesome so anyways thank you guys for
watching and I'll see you next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
