this story we're going to be finishing
up this date pecker program well not the
whole thing what do you know the first
part so good enough so let's go ahead
and well might as well go ahead while
we're in here and grab this from an
interface because we're going to need
that tidbit later now go over in your
implementation file and of course I
didn't delete all these comments before
like I should have a noob are i get rid
of those implementations a better a good
go get to go Garibay beast now we'll
leave those in there I mean y2h not all
right so what we want to do first is we
want the synthesized de pecker so under
invitation go sin and then go right and
then date pecker and this will give us
our date picker object and we need this
too first of all paste that to access
all the stuff from the day pecker so now
what we want to do is we want to grab
the date from that picker so NS day and
store it in like a object called choice
or something and set this equal to again
remember our date pecker object is our
outlet to our date picker so it's pretty
much is the date picker and in order to
grab a date from it in order to grab
pretty much whatever you selected just
go ahead and the method is date and this
will return the date and time that you
selected pretty cool huh so that date is
stored in the variable called choice but
thing is whenever we use in alert box we
can't output a date it doesn't know how
to do that it only knows how to output a
shrink or text so what we need to do is
take this date and convert it to a
string all right we can do that NS
string and just go ahead and we'll put
like words or something oh oh I just got
like a sick taste in my mouth those
girls all right now let's go ahead and
NS string allocation space for our new
object in it with format
and the format for this is just x @ % a
nothing fancy I mean you couldn't put
like this is date if you want might as
well why the heck and I are just typed
it in and choice choice alright so what
this does is pretty much is it takes
that choice date it pretty much takes
the date and prints it out in a string
format this is date easy enough so now
what we need to do is once we converted
that date to a string just show it
another alert box so you I alert view I
just go ahead and name this alert and
then go ahead and of course it needs to
be its own object you I alert view
allocate some space with it in it with
title and just put the title like the
title and actually let me do this so you
can guys can all see it for the message
go ahead and put whatever your string is
words for the delegate really you have
to go all the way over there I just put
nail for the cancel button title yeah I
knew you're gonna do that for the cancel
button title there we go this is what do
you want when you want to exit the alert
and just put it like clothes or exit or
something and other bun titles we don't
have any other buttons so just go ahead
and set this equal to nil and that's
about it so all of this was pretty much
I thought to put a semicolon really I
put a semicolon and it jumps all the way
over there code this dumb thing and all
this is pretty much making an alert box
so once we made them alert box you have
to show on the screen alert show and
once we're done showing it I mean we're
pretty much done with this so take that
object and release it and of course
remember we allocated this words so we
need to release this two words release
and you're saying all right what about
this object to stay object look did we
allocate anything for nope NM state
takes care of that so we don't
need to release that all right so in
this button we pretty much wrote what
method do you want to do when you press
that button well first we want to get
whatever date you selected convert it to
text show in an alert box and then just
housekeeping stuff right here but are we
done yet nope but we almost are having
close enough so actually in your view
did unload get rid of these just because
I don't like them what you wanted to do
is self dot date pecker and set this
outlet to nil because we don't need it
anymore and of course super view did
unload good this is just all
housekeeping stuff one more teeny bit of
thing when you deallocate void delegate
whoa where did all my alright that was a
little delayed but it was date pecker uh
release our object when we don't need
anymore okay again housekeeping stuff
got be a god take care of our computers
memory all right so we are looking good
right here let's go ahead and build and
run it and fix our heirs Oh a don't have
any errors how cool all right so this is
our program right here it automatically
selects the date currently but say we
want to select another one for some
reason Friday 25th that's what where I
want to be at this time this time press
me and this is delayed and my thing just
froze I don't know why it freezes so
much by any ice the title right here
here's our string this is and again
here's that exit button I was talking
about what's called a cancel button
title close so go ahead select another
day can do this all day guys another
aware pops up close and that's that so
you see this is the date view we didn't
build anything for a single double
dependent custom all we built is this
one view right here so you know I hope
you enjoy because that's all you got so
far and next tutorials will be building
these other ones but you know I got
feeling already that I'm going to stop
halfway through and you know probably
just talk about something else Oh
anyways thank you for watching and don't
forget subscribe to fam any questions or
need the code click on the link below
and I'll see you guys next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
