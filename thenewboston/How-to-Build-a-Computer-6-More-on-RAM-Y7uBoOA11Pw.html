different pin counsel brain for example
if you picked out ddr2 RAM you have to
note that ddr2 it has three different
pin counts so even though you might have
got the right type you still need to
make sure that it got the right pin
count
so again style of RAM such as DDR ddr2
ddr3 pin count such as how many pins are
on it
the next thing I wanted to talk to you
guys about is the speed of RAM now again
all these specs I'm talking about the
only way to know what specs your
computer is gonna take is it check the
specs on your motherboard once you buy
your motherboard then it's going to come
with a hole the suspects and look at
that and that one's gonna tell you all
right the next thing I wanted to talk to
you guys about is if speed of ram now
once you're looking at ram you're gonna
come across a number that you might not
know what it is and it's kind of a
number that's kind of just flow in there
and not really telling anything a whole
lot for example when you buy ram just
going to say something like ddr2 800 DVR
to a thousand you're like what the heck
is this I don't know what this number
means what this number is is the speed
of your RAM and the higher the number
the faster and before you go and find
the just a random thing I need to tell
you guys one very important thing when
you're looking at your motherboard in
the specs of RAM it's gonna have a
memory standard and what this is the
lowest amount speed that it can come
with for example if your memory standard
is DVR to 800 then that's the lowest
speed they hundred that you can get now
another thing that you should know is
memory or RAM is backwards compatible
therefore you can always get a speed
higher than the standard so if your
standard on your brother bars
motherboard is DVR to 800 you can always
go DDR 2000 DVR to 1200
but you can never go any lower like DVR
to 600 or 400 so you can always go
higher speed than your standard but
never lower it's very important because
if you put lower reimann your beaters
not gonna work it out so now that you
say all right more ram I put in my
computer the more applications I'm gonna
be able to run so I'm going to go out
and buy $12,000 worth of RAM and put it
in my computer well take it easy Bessie
because you don't want to do that just
yet there is a maximum amount of RAM
that you can put on every motherboard
and the way you find out the maximum
amount was Ram of course just like
everything else you need to look at the
specs now one thing you have to realize
that even if your motherboard can take
massive amount of RAM you don't
necessarily want to put all this Ram on
your motherboard because maybe your
operating system can't recognize that to
be safe I would put in the maximum for
any computer I ever built was 4 gigs of
ram and this is plenty enough if you put
in any more than 4 gigs ram then you're
just getting greedy and you know you
just don't need to do it so just back
off now for this build I want to talk to
you guys about what kind of RAM I picked
out we went with Kingston which is just
the brand name we went with 1 gigabyte
total what you actually see is made up
of two 512 megabyte sticks we went with
240 pin which is again just to make sure
it fits into motherboard type moon is
ddr2 and we wanna the 800 speed so this
should be plenty enough to support our
applications that we're going to be
running on our computer in again make
sure you're watching these tutorials in
hi-def I hope you enjoy watching this
tutorials I hope you learned something
so thanks for watching and I'll see you
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
