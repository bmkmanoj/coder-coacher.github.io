here and I've got another cool Photoshop
cs6 tutorial for you and it's going to
be learning about the bitmap color mode
and what the bitmap color mode is is it
makes all the pixels either black or
white and there's a few different modes
and methods that you can use to make
like cool-looking images that are in
black and white so let's just get in
there and I'll show you what one looks
like
now if you go and try to take your
colored image here and make it a bitmap
I go into image mode it's not going to
work first you have to make a grayscale
so click on grayscale and just make it
grayscale and now we can go back into
image mode again and now we can make
things bitmap so here we've got our
different modes just above this is
whatever resolution you want to make it
to so just you might as well make it the
same resolution that you have your image
already I'm just going to leave it here
I don't feel like looking to see what it
is because I'm not going to like make
this for final print but we've got our
different things here we'll start with
50% threshold and hit OK
and you can see that everything is
either black or white
now bitmap images are good because they
have a really really small file sizes
like very small and something that you
might use these for I've heard of people
making line art drawings or line art
sketches with these because a line art
is always black and white black and
white ink drawings I think yeah black
and white ink drawings are some things
that people use and then I've seen my
one of my friends used these to create
halftone screens so half-tones are like
the little dots that are in like the
background kind of like old-school like
80s almost they're like retro II and
they can be used in a modern stuff too
as well if you use them correctly but if
you don't know what half tones are
just look it up there cool I like them
so let's go back to I'm just gonna hit
ctrl Z and I'll just start going over
some of these modes with with you
because there's a few of them so 50%
threshold you just saw and what that
does is it looks at the gray values of
the pixels and if it's above the middle
value which is 128 so if it's 129 or
above it's going to be changed to white
if the valley pixel or the gray value is
that it's going to be changed to white
and if it's below then it's going to be
changed to black and it basically just
creates a high contrast black and white
image so the next one let's go to
pattern dither and hit OK and what it
does is it converts an image by
organizing the gray levels into like
geometric patterns of dots or black and
white dots so it looks like it's got
gray in there but it doesn't it's black
and white dots
they've riddled some white dots within
black dots so there's a higher
concentration of black dots here
obviously a high concentration of white
dots here and then like an even
concentration of the black and white
here where it looks like it's great now
let's zoom in and see what it looks like
see now you can see definitely that
everything is black and white they just
added more concentration into some of
the areas to make them darker black or
whatever
alright let's back off a little let's go
to the next one I'm just going to ctrl Z
so I can go to the next mode flattened
layers yeah yeah but asking the fusion
dealer now this one's a little confusing
as how - the process goes because I
don't know the actual process but what
it does is it uses some 50% threshold
and some of the pattern dither and
combines them and it does the converting
above the middle value to white if it's
a middle value of the gray is above 128
then it's going to be white if it's
below then it's going to be black
and what it does is it creates a green
film like texture so let's go to the
next one
control Z let's go image mode bitmap
once again F tone screen we're going to
hit OK and this is going to simulate the
effect of printing a grayscale image
through a halftone screen
so I'll just hit this there's a
different shapes here you I'll let you
guys mess with these don't really need
to go through all of them but let's go
through let's just do one more to see
what they do but if you need to look up
halftone screen go ahead okay
let's do it again and let's check a line
and I'll just keep these the same and it
okay and you can see basically the same
thing so it simulates like a printing
effect that they use and then they use a
halftone screen for that let's go to the
next one final one custom pattern and
pretty much it simulates the effect of
printing the grayscale image through
your custom pattern and this probably
isn't going to work too well let's pick
what yeah we can pick one of these ones
this pattern won't probably be a little
better it okay and this applies the
pattern in black and white now let's try
that one that we just had blegh oops my
bad let's try the one with the like the
bubbles so the iconic Photoshop pattern
here the water bubble things so that's
what that does and I didn't pick that
one at first because it always looks
like goofy like this and they look like
creepy like look at this face over here
looks really creepy so this is this one
it's like ah oh whatever
well that's some pit map color mode for
you and you can see the different uses
you can use for it some of them actually
look pretty cool I like the 50%
threshold and then pattern together the
best if you want to create some cool can
art use
that's it for this tutorial check out
our more tutorials on bookies Rue Morgue
or the new boston youtube channel which
are already on thumbs up if you like and
thumbs down if you hated it everybody
have a good day see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
