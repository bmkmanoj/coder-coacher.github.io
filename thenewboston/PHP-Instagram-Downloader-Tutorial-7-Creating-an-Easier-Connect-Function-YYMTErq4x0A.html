username we're gonna want a way to
connect with Instagram really easy so we
can get information from it at any time
in any kind of way so instead of having
to write this in every single function
let's just go ahead and make one
function right here to connect with
Instagram and then we'll be done with it
and as you guys will see you later it's
really actually incredibly simple that
way so the function I'm just going to
name it connect to Instagram and the
only parameter it's gonna take is URL so
basically you're gonna give the URL like
this basically ask it what do you want
it to do why do you want to connect with
it what information you want that's all
going to be in the URL and then it's
going to return back all the information
you want really simple so right now I'm
gonna make another girl initialize
another curl object I'm gonna make all
the basic settings in there actually a
little bit different than here the way
we communicate it with here or not
actually let's put should probably put
that so this is how we're going to be
cute communicating with an Instagram
from here on out curl setup array
all right so what this does right here
is it pretty much sets a bunch of
options for your array now the first
parameter it takes is that curl object
which is CH and the second parameter is
the array and these are going to be our
settings from here on out and it's
actually really easy so the first thing
is curl opt and I guess I'd do it this
way for the URL we'll just put in this
URL and are actually gonna want to make
four different settings so let me just
you know make sure to get rid of you're
coming at the end so the first thing we
wanted to do is we want to set the URL
where do we want to talk to the second
one is the return transfer and just go
ahead and set this equal to true and
what this is going to do remember is
just going to return the result of
successful so you know pretty easy there
the second to last one or the third one
as some people say is the SSL verify
here I don't know why they have verify
here is one where it's not like it's a
compound word and we'll just set this
equal to false and the last sending that
we need is verify host and we'll set
this equal to - I know that's kind of
weird
well basically what to means is we won't
verify a host why they had it as - I
don't really know I thought it was a
good idea now the result equals too lazy
to even type like one word I guess they
won't have to copy two letters all right
so the result is pretty much when the XS
acute and all of the information is
stored in a result and also remember I
said that it was a good idea to close it
we got that
err last time because we did throughout
the object in there and after you close
it of course you probably want to return
something so we will return the result
so basically what's going to happen is
we built a simple and effective way of
communicating with Instagram so we never
have to write this crap again
so basically anytime you want to
communicate we just run this give the
URL and it grabs all the data and gives
it back to us really easy so actually
that's probably good for this tutorial
in the next video I want to show you
guys um another function and it's
definitely necessary and a lot of people
also get very confused about it
sometimes so I'm gonna be clearing
things up and it's only like five or six
lines but yeah I'll talk you guys
through it and well that's it so thanks
for watching and I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
