we'll try say Josh for example and the
password pass one two three pass one two
three and click register and that's okay
because the password are the username
Josh for example doesn't already exist
so we're down to the last stage of our
our registration where now everything is
okay so we just need to register the
user one thing to note before we do so
is we need a version of the password
which is md5 encrypted so I'm going to
say password hash equals md5 of password
okay so we've got our password hash now
that we can pop into the database that
will allow our login system to work
correctly
otherwise we're just going to be
comparing an md5 hash to plain data so
now what we can do is actually start the
registration process so else we need a
new query and the new query is going to
be query equals so we need to now say
insert into users values and how many
values have we got let's just go to our
database and check we have got let's go
back to our table right let's completely
refresh that as well so we're ready to
use that in a minute but one two three
four five so we need one two three four
five remember the comma separated values
and what we're doing is we need to use
the MySQL real escape string as well to
stop SQL injection so the first one is
the username then the password then the
first name then the surname so username
password but password hash fix restoring
its md5 data first name and surname but
now what we need to do is just end that
string there and concatenate on user
name we can do the same with the
password hash I guess and the string
there and concatenate on first name and
then concatenate on the rest of the
string and then we do the same for the
surname so end concatenate concatenate
start okay so now we can enclose these
in MySQL real escape string and the same
with this
and the same with the first name in the
last name as well so MySQL real escape
string and MySQL real cool real escape
string ok so now that we've done this
this should successfully register our
user into the system so we need to
perform the query first a query run is
equal to MySQL query and then we put the
string data of the query inside of that
we're going to turn this into an if
statement to ensure that we tell the
user if they've been successfully
registered or not so you can say if the
query run equals MySQL query so this if
this query they're successful then we
can say to the user
echo successfully registered blah blah
blah but I'm going to tell you how we'll
do that in a minute
otherwise echo sorry we couldn't
register you at this time try again
later
so let's just escape that strip up I'm
up inverted comma there single quotation
mark if you like otherwise and we're
going to say now we're going to confirm
that the user is registered in fact
we're not what we're going to do is
we're going to locate them to a page
that's going to tell them that they've
successfully registered what this is
going to do is it's going to stop them
pressing f5 f5 on the keyboard
refreshing the page and registering them
again and again I know that won't work
but it's a good practice to get into
with a lot of data so header location
and we can cool the page something like
register success dot PHP ok so let's go
ahead and create this register success
PHP file
now you can bear in mind you could
transfer over the get variables so you
could say you equals user name/password
it goes past P equals password or
something or just the username but I'm
just going to tell them they're
registered for now in this page so
you've registered let's just call this
page what did we call it and register
success dot PHP okay so that's going to
be it for now I'll leave it up to you
guys to you know use your imagination on
this one so let's test the process and
see if we've got everything working so
register dot PHP I'm going to register a
user called Dale password is going to be
passed one two three password again is
going to be passed one two three and I'm
going to say Dale Garrett we've bypassed
all our security CH up our validation
checks now check for the usernames there
the password is matching we click
register we transfer to this register
success page you've registered perhaps
you'll have a link saying no you now you
can log in and we'll take ourselves back
to the index dot PHP file take a
sneaking look inside here first and you
can see that all the data has been
processed properly
we've got ID of three now username Dale
the password matches that because all
the passwords are the same we've got the
first and last name now let's take Dale
and password and pass one two three and
click login
and you can see that we've successfully
logged in as our new user</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
