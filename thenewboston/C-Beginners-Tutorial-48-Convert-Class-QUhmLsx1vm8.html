tutorial that I'm making for them in
Boston and in this tutorial I'm going to
show you how to convert a class so all
you're gonna need for this tutorial is a
button and a text box and once you have
those on your form just double click on
the bottom so in previous tutorials we
looked at the bit converter class and
the bit converter class um mainly
handled fights and Wilmont
we're going to want to be looking at
other variable types so we're going to
use the convert class so in order to
access the method inside of the convert
class or justified convert and then you
can dot operator and since all the
methods inside of this class are static
we don't need to create every Canyon and
create an instance of this class so
first like I said we're going to be
looking at converting a string into an
integer so we're just going to be 2 into
32 method and then as you can see it
calls for a while this method is heavily
overloaded meaning that you can pretty
much type any variable type inside of
here and I'll convert it into an integer
or it really try to so we're just like I
said going to be converting a string
into a 32 so we're going to type text
box 1 facts because represents a string
and basically what this will do is it
will convert whatever isn't in textbox 1
dot X into any 32 and if it cannot do it
if there's like letters in there or
something it will throw an error so
first it's going to create in to set
people do and then we're just going to
display that integer in the message box
but we have to do all right so basically
what it does here is it takes whatever's
in tax Barcelona tax and it converts it
into an integer and then it sets
whatever it converts it into equal to
this integer right here and then it
displays exists into your in the message
box so now I'm going to bug here we just
type any number here and we'll display a
message box type in before you have to
get 4
like then 10 we get time well if we try
to play some like letters or something
like those it's going to get an area yep
input string is not in correct format
just we can't convert letters into it I
need 32 so we can also do many things
lives like we can treat it just as if it
were numbers add like I can add 2 to it
we don't have to leave it like that and
we can treat as if it is just a number
or very very so we can just add 2 to it
like in like n to get 12
yup so yeah alright so there are many
different methods inside of Kuler class
like I said um you can convert pretty
much anything into anything
Cubert key character but if you want to
do whatever character is in text box on
top and we just want on display this
character we can do that I think like
app right here yep try typing like a
string probably you have a string must
be exactly one character long and it
will 5 or 6 um there's other methods as
well there's two boolean you're going to
convert it into a boolean and some of
these you may say you're probably never
going to use on like this to boolean but
you'd be surprised I thought I would
never use this to grooving but I ended
up eating like a few weeks back so
anyway it's nice to convert xbox time in
that display the message box so if we
type in true here we should get an error
like I'm false we can get an error no
but we try to type in like anything
besides the true or false we don't get
an error
we just type in that yeah stringers not
recognized as a valid rule so it's not a
bad idea to put a try and catch
statement around when you're converting
things because sometimes it won't work
out or like if you're pretty shaky the
only some of the time it's going to
convert I would recommend from you try
and catch statement around it so your
application isn't trash and then you can
always just put nice box - you're saying
like version failed and then you just
know that there's a problem with your
conversion and then you just keep on
converting have your application keep on
going so if we wanted to do actually
we're fine but if you try to type in
anything else now we'll just get the
conversion files instead of our
application crashing which is always
good so that's pretty much it for this
tutorial on the convert class but I
didn't go over every single method
inside of it because it's pretty
self-explanatory
like just you convert dot and then
whatever you want to convert it to if
you want to convert a 28064 then you
just set equal to a long or something
like that so yeah that's pretty much it
for this tutorial so see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
