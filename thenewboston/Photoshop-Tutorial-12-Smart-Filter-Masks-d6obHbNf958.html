Photoshop tutorial and in this tutorial
I'm gonna be talking about Smart Filters
masks now it's a lot easier said than
done
Smart Filters and mash sounds confusing
but it's not so now that we know what
mask is and now that we know how to
apply a filter or more specifically a
smart filter we can mask out certain
parts of this filter so for example if
you watch the last tutorial you know
that I applied glowing edges and glass
filter to these cows so that they are
let me just toggle this off so it gives
them kind of a weird look but what if we
only wanted to apply this filter on
certain parts of our image so for
example maybe we just wanted um like one
of these cows to have like glowing edges
around it well in order to do that what
we need to do is make a mask on the
filter layer so this little white box
you see all right why is white box here
for nothing this is actually the mask so
anytime we paint on this the black is
going to get rid of the mask and the
white is going to show through it so go
ahead and click this little white box
for your smart filters and then go ahead
and uh get paint brush like right here
or something and make sure you're at a
hard brush normal mode opacity 100 Flow
100 and make sure you have the color
black selected and now when we start
painting you can see that it's it gets
rid of the mask so let's go ahead and
paint this with black and as you can see
whenever we would paint it the mask is
gone and say we went outside what we
wanted to do all we have to do is paint
with white and then the mask would um
reappear again so black gets rid of the
mask and white makes it show up again
and if you wonder how I'm adjusting my
brush sizes real quick
this you can either adjust it up here or
if you press the little square brackets
or brace on your keyboard it'll make it
bigger in under and on the other bracket
the ones next to the P on your keyboard
that's adjust the brush sizes so as you
can see right here black pops up in your
um what's called mask right over here
and sometimes you want to do other stuff
like well for instance if you alt click
this mask right here you can see only of
the mass so go ahead and alt-click this
right here and then you can toggle this
on and off so now when you all click it
hold all on your keyboard and click it
you can either see only your mask or the
entire image so if you find it's easier
to paint it like this way then that's
how you do that now aside from just
painting with a paintbrush you can also
use stuff like gradients so if you go
ahead right here
and pick a gradient you can go ahead and
apply a mask this way so look at that if
you uh click and drag that or drag it
inward you got a nice little gradient in
again if you alt and click this any
shades of gray it doesn't have to be
black or right or what you can use any
shades of black white or grey the black
is going to show here I'll just show you
like this the black is going to show
through the mask all the way in the
whites not going to show through it at
all and any shades of grey is going to
be a like semi-transparent or semi elite
so that is how you make a mask or a
smart mask using a smart filter in
anytime you want to get rid of your
entire mask you can do a couple things
you can right click smart filters and
click um just or would you click disable
or delete filter mask and anytime you
want to add it again just right-click it
and put add filter mask or you can also
just click it and drag it down to the
trash bin right here
and again to get it back just click Add
filter mask and you can be in painting
again or adding gradients like that so
that is how you work with masks and how
you add a mask to a smart filter so I
hope you enjoyed it if you didn't then
uh just uh well do something else then
but I hope you enjoyed it I'm now going
to go to Food Lion Inn by chicken to
make a chicken salad because I'm hungry
and you well you can go do something
else but I hope you enjoyed this
