tutorial creating a smokey creepy logo
so in the last tutorial we added smoke
onto our text and we created a backdrop
for to light up the text a little bit so
the next thing we want to do is create
our extra smoke that goes over top of
the text and that's going to be pretty
easy we're just going to copy the old
smoke that we had so twirl these down
and see this will copy them all for now
go up to edit copy I'm gonna go back to
our main comp and create a new layer a
solid it's gonna be smoke cross make it
like I'm just gonna make it gray it
doesn't really matter since we're just
putting on the fractal and everything
just using it for like color reference
where we see these little color box so
let's go into our effects controls panel
and click on it and edit paste and now
we've got our smoke there so the thing
that we really need to just change is
our evolution here on our smoke to get a
different type of smoke otherwise it's
going to be the same exact thing as the
smoke that's in our text you won't be
able to tell the difference between the
text smoke and it's just gonna look
shoddy and crappy basically so let's
twirl down these we don't need those and
we're just gonna start by pressing you
on the smoke crossed to reveal our
animated properties we can see that
evolution is down here make sure you're
on the keyframe that evolution is on and
you know that you're on the keyframe
when this is uh when this diamond here
is yellow so let's change this to
something like three and then we'll
change the last one here to something
like four now we're gonna have different
looking smoke
cool
now I found that having the blue color
on this one put a little too much blue
for my taste so I'm just gonna delete
out the hue/saturation and leave it as
the white smoke there it are it looks
kind of blue already in in mine anyway
it gives it a little more color
different kind of color than just being
everything all blue so we have that and
let's go back into our project here you
need to move this behind underneath the
smoke title I'm going to go on this and
I'm gonna copy this mask here edit copy
and I'm gonna paste it edit paste
so there we have our smoke just going
across I don't want the mask feather on
there as much oh it doesn't have a mask
feather that's what I want on there
feather it out a little there we go it's
a cross now
let's feather this out even more because
it's kind of blocking the text
there we go
I'm gonna change
I think I'm gonna change the behind
masks Oh to be a little more in the
center here
it's not not so much off-screen and just
more centered around the new Boston here
just make it so it's not all the way
around it either so how about that that
way it doesn't look like it's just going
off screen and looking weird
now if yours is covering up too much of
your text you might want to put the
opacity down a little so it doesn't
overtake your text we're going to make
the text pop out anyways so maybe after
we're done with that we can put the
opacity back up to 100
so I'm gonna conclude this part we
learned how to put the smoke on top it
was fairly easy made a little correction
to the behind here and we just made the
mask a little shorter and not going off
the screen because it didn't really make
sense to have it going off the screen so
I'll see you guys in the next part where
we're gonna go over making the text do
come out off the screen a little more
and we're gonna make it so it's like the
edges are growing and just make it look
a lot better so you can see it a lot
better so look forward to seeing you
guys at the next tutorial and I'll see
you guys there obviously see you later
