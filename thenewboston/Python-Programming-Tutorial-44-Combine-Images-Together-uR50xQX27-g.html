open all of my videos with that intro
I really hate actually when I'm watching
a YouTube video and they have the same
intro like I don't know they made a
weird umm animation of their channel
name at the beginning of every video but
maybe if you had something personal like
me
manually singing each intro like today
we're going to learn about pasting
images then I well then I probably
losing my subscribers so probably
shouldn't do that but in this video what
I'm going to be showing you guys is how
to take two images and combine with
together basically the equivalent of
copying one image such as this and
pasting it on top of another image so
that's what we're going to do so I'm
going to take this little girl's head
and paste it right in the middle of this
there is no point to it whatsoever but
it's awesome just for demonstrating so
the first thing we need is to make two
different objects two different pillow
objects one of this image in one of this
image so I'm going to name the first one
sister why not
of course that's image open and the
parameter is the file name so sister dot
it's jpg and for the second one that's
actually a ping this one right here and
I'm Way too lazy to type all that so it
was actually probably could've type to
the faster girl dot ping so now we have
two pillow objects one this and one is
that bada-bing bada-boom pretty easy so
far so the first thing we need is we
actually say okay we're going to be
pasting something on top of this image
right here so we need to give it the
area that we want to paste now we also
know that this is the image that we're
pretty much going to copy and paste in
but what we have to do right now is a
little math so whenever I click on this
implied charm we can see that the size
of this is 200 by 200 now I am stressing
this because whenever we paste it on
we need to give it the exact coordinates
and that area needs to be 200 by 200 if
the coordinates you give it are off it
all then you're going to come across the
area
I'm at an error three reason I said area
is because that's what I'm going to type
so since I want to paste in the middle
and this original image is 400 by 400
the coordinates the post a 200 by 200
image is 3 right there
so again 100 by 100 is a top left
somewhere around here and 300 by 300 is
right down here somewhere
and of course since this is 200 by 200
then this area is going to fit perfectly
so now that we determine the area what
we need to do now is we need to take
that original image which is the sister
object and we need to call a function
called paste now paste is going to take
two parameters the first thing that's
going to say is okay what are you
pasting on top of this sister richer
well we're actually going to be pasting
this object which is this image so we're
going to be pasting that on top of it
and the only other thing is it asks okay
now give me the coordinates of where you
want to paste it okay sir well we
actually just made them right there and
well there you go
all right so now what we did is we
basically took this sister image and we
pasted something on top of it so now if
we just call sister show check this out
run main look at that now of course if
you look in this file display whatever
it's called the file name you can see
that this is indeed one image these
aren't two separate files and if you're
familiar with Photoshop these are the
layers this is actually one layer so we
took that image and we pasted it in
exactly so I'll show you guys what I'm
talking about if we said that our paste
area was like 334 for the second one
whenever we try to run
then we're going to get a bunch of
problems right here because it says
pretty much the area that you're pasting
into is not equal to the size of the
object so that's why I kept stressing
the math you have to calculate it before
I also show you guys later on um how you
like right now we'd probably have to
take a calculator if we had any weird
size images but I'll show you guys how
to get the sizes dynamically and figure
it out like that but you guys probably
could already figure it out from the
toriel so far so I'm just going to stop
rambling that is how you take to him
just paste them together thank you guys
for watching and we can subscribe and
I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
