outside stimuli showing an awareness of
his surroundings my god Miranda I think
he's waking up damn it Wilson he's not
ready yet give him the sedative Shevin
don't try to move just lie still try to
stay calm perfect still climbing brain
activity's off the charts starts pushing
you to the red zone it's not looking
another dog now heart rate dropping
stats falling back into normal range
that was too close we almost lost it I
told you your estimates were all run the
numbers again
this pistol doesn't have a thermal
someone hacking security trying to kill
you look for a thermal clip for your
pistol looks like they set up a
barricade to try holding the mix up look
out keep moving we need to get to the
shuttles
Shepherd security makes a closing in on
your don't take any chances stay in
couple you take out those necks
nice
waste time I come more reinforcements
heading your way grab the grenade
launcher off the security officers body
here come the mechs use the grenade
launcher to take them out
take the elevator
hurry get to the door
come Tate the cost of this project is
astronomical four billion credits so far
but nobody seems to care that we go to
her budget I don't know where the boss
gets all this money maybe it's better
not to know I just wish he'd kick a
little more in my direction once in a
while
progress is slow but subject shows signs
of recovery major organs are again
project
come on over gotta hurt
you doing here thought you were still
working progress I just woke up you
probably know more than I do right sorry
about that i'm jacob taylor I've been
stationed here for hostiles detected
Garrett
things must be worse than I thought if
Miranda's got you running around I'll
fill you in we better get you to the
shuttle first what's with the mechs
security usually they fight for us
somebody must have packed them that
should be impossible unless you've got
access got to get you out of here
Sheppard it's your station ticket I'll
follow you the first step let's finish
off these metal bastards we're low on
thermal clips but I'm a biotic just give
the order when you want me to hit him
with the good stuff</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
