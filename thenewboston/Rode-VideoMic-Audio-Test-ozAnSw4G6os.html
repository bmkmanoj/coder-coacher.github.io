make a video real quick because I got a
new microphone it's called the rode
videomic as you can see right here and
it's supposed to be a lot better than
like the built in mics on your camera
and that's what you're hearing right now
just the built-in microphone on my canon
hv fixya hv 40 that's what it is so I
got this Mike in the mail just yesterday
so I'm going to test it out and see if
it really is better so again what you're
hearing right now is to go in a
microphone in the camcorder and i'm
going to plug in the road mike next and
go through its to settings and see if
it's actually that much better so in one
second and i'll get back to you alright
guys now you are hearing the audio from
the road mike it actually has two
settings this is the high-pass setting
and actually has a low setting whatever
that means I don't know I'm just going
to listen see one's better and figure it
out but again this is the rode mic
microphone so i have to see how it
sounds when i start editing it and the
next test is going to be low setting
whatever that is what's up guys this is
the third audio test this is the road
Mike again but this is called the flat
filter the last one was the high pass
filter and this one is the flat filter i
guess it's supposed to do something with
the base or something like that i don't
know i didn't really read it i'm just
gonna listen to one sounds the best of
me so uh that's it for this test right
now leave a comment and tell me what one
you think is the best actually i'm
probably going to do one more from a
different distance away so um yeah i
think i'm going to do that so this isn't
the end yet alright guys this is a test
of my onboard camera microphone and this
is about from seven feet away alright
guys this is a test of the road
microphone and the high-pass setting and
this is also from seven feet away again
this is the road microphone the high
setting and lastly from a distance of
seven feet away this is the test of the
road mic microphone audio on the low
setting so it went on board camera high
setting low setting so leave a comment
and tell me what one is the best in
though
is pretty much the audio I'm going to
make my videos in from now on so thank
you guys for watching in a see in future</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
