illustration cs6 tutorial my name is
buddy Blackford and today we're gonna be
going over saving a document and you
might think Oh saving a document that's
easy I just go file save and it does it
for me
but illustrator is a little bit
different because you get a bunch of
options when you go to save and if you
take a look on the screen over here on
the right where it says illustrator
options this is the file that comes up
when you save and if you go trying to
save as anything else you get maybe some
errors and things like that so you need
to understand how to use this when
you're saving so yeah so that your
option or so that your work comes out
correctly and it's not all messed up
when you go to open it up again so we
need to do is let's go to file and we'll
go to save as and I'm able to save this
in a bunch of different types here we've
got a Adobe fxg which is a Adobe flex we
got a PDF Adobe Illustrator is this
program obviously illustrator EPS which
is an encapsulated PostScript
and a lot of times some people use this
for Illustrator files we've got a
template and then we've got SVG which is
a scalable vector graphic so go ahead
and we'll select Adobe Illustrator for
now and then we'll change this so we
don't get a huge noise and it's safe and
we get this illustrator options now we
can save it as a certain version
Illustrator cs6 is what you normally
want to save it as as but if you need to
import it into something like an older
version of cinema 4d or Maya or any
other 3d modelling program sometimes
they make you import it in Illustrator
80 or something like that
illustrator cs2
but there's how you select your versions
the next thing we got here is fonts and
you basically you specify or you're
specifying when to embed the entire font
or the characters here and just you put
in the percentage there and here's a
little there's a little help sign here
oh nevermind that's a part of that
that's actually part of the of the
sentence they're going down to options
here we got create PDF compatible file
and you can select it to save the Pete
PDF in the file you can include linked
files you remember when I imported and
there was a linked file well this will
include it there if there is a link file
in there carlo pro our embed ICC
profiles and that uses color profiles
which I'll go over at some point use
compression and if you want to compress
the file you have you select this it'll
make it a smaller file but if you
uncheck it be a bigger file and save
each artboard to a separate file now if
you have more than one artboard this
will be able to be checked and then you
can save the all of them to different
files or you can do a range so if you
have like for our ports you can save one
and two and one file and then two and
four or three and four and another file
we've got some transparency options here
and you go ahead and specify your
options some of these words might not
make sense to you because I have a gun
over a whole lot but if you want to
preserve the paths you can check that
one and this is these are radio buttons
so you're going to be able to check
either or and then you get your
resolution here and at the bottom here
you've got some warnings so says the
document raster effects resolution is 72
PPI or or less well I don't have any
raster files in here and I'm not saving
it as a raster and if you're not sure
the difference between raster and vector
you should check out the first tutorial
where I go over that a little bit and
then
another warning going on here that's
fine
and it will hit okay and now it has
properly saved now there are different
options when you try to save it as
different documents so I'll go save as
again and I'll just put ApS there and
I'll save this as an EPS this time and
now we've got different options we've
got different versions this time we've
got formats and it saves it as a tiff
transparent or opaque and then you've
got all these other things going on here
so I'm not gonna go over every cell
single set of options that's in each one
of these but it would be a good idea to
check these out and just do a google
search or something like that and check
them out
and that way I don't have to waste your
guys's time going over every single
option and you can do it on your own
time another thing that I wanted to show
you was that if you're working on a
project you're able to save copies and
the reason you would want to save copies
is you're making some you want to save
incrementally so if you're working and
your client likes what you have and
you're golden but later on the client is
like no I want this change now go ahead
and make the change and save it as a
copy that way you have two different
versions and in case he decides that he
likes what you had previously first you
don't have to go back and make all those
changes again you can just save it as a
copy so or you can just go back to the
previous version so save a copy file
save a copy and then it'll say copy
going on there so I have already had one
that was a copy and then just appended
number to it if it doesn't already and
then you're good to go
so that's a good idea
you should save your document about
every time you make some decently major
changes or every like 10 minute
just hit ctrl s to save it if you're
saving incrementally alt ctrl s is the
hotkey so that's keep that in mind so
that's all I wanted to go over about
today and thanks for watching this now
you know how to properly save a document
and you're not all confused with all the
options and not clueless when they come
up so thanks a lot for watching and have
a good day everyone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
