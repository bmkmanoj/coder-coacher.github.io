video I'm going to talk to you about a
dictionary in Python now whenever you
have a dictionary in real life you have
a bunch of words and they're associated
with a bunch of definitions now in
Python we have names for these instead
of words and definitions we call them
keys and values and the cool thing about
Python is you're not only limited to you
know like a definition like you would
think in a dictionary you can also use
numbers and stuff like that so let me
show you an example right now so the
first thing you have to do is of course
just name it whatever you want and then
set it equal to and then use those curly
braces now inside your curly braces
you're going to have sets of a key and a
value and you can have as many as you
want you can have one you can have 100
it doesn't matter so for the key I'll
just write Tony and for the value
actually let me use single quotes so
write the key and think of this like the
word in the dictionary and then add a
colon and then after that colon is the
value and I'll write cool smells so say
that this dictionary is um storing like
everyone in my class so again the key
which is Tony and the value of this is
cool but smells so whenever you want to
add a new item what you have to do is
just separate them with commas and then
I'm too lazy to do the format again so
I'm just going to do that alright so
this key can be for Emma and her value
can be I don't know I'll say she sits
behind me let's add one more so comma
umm one more person could be like Lucy
and her value will be I don't like
Lizzie because she asks too many
questions alright so now we have a
dictionary called classmates and it's
made up of three key value pairs Toni
Emma and Lucy so I guess I can go ahead
and just print this out real quick so if
you just print
the name of your dictionary without
specifying any one of these individually
then there's just going to go ahead and
print the whole thing as expected now
obviously you can do cooler things in
this you can print something like um
classmates and then in square brackets
put the key Emma so this is pretty much
saying print the value of Emma and of
course Emma's value is sits behind me so
again you can do this with each
individual item in your dictionary or
I'll show you guys something really cool
this is probably the coolest thing that
you can do with it what you can do is
instead of having to go through your
dictionary one at a time like Emma Tony
okay who's the next Lucy o mg that's
taken forever there's a real quick way
that you can loop through it so what you
do is you use a for loop and then you
know how we just gave our for loop a
variable name and that was the name of
whatever item
it was looping through at the time well
since a dictionary is composed of keys
in values we actually need to give it
two variables so we'll say K and V and
this is what people typically use and
this is pretty much saying whenever we
loop through it treat K is the key so
the first time is going to be Tony then
Emma the Lucy and V is going to be the
value so this is going to be cool but
smell sits behind me and ask too many
questions and then after this we just
need to say in classmates items simple
enough so again this is the dictionary
that's looping through and it's going to
loop through all of the items so now I
can just put something like print arm
kay I don't know let me think of
something stupid okay
I don't even know how I can have this
make sense okay I just do something
really easy k plus V which is pretty
much going to print out this and this
simple enough
so actually let me get rid of these so
it doesn't confuse you so as you can see
since we didn't have spaces let me add
spaces real quick so our bunch together
what it does is you build a dictionary
right here your dictionary o is composed
of keys in values we have three of them
in this case and what this loop did is
it loop through this dictionary and for
each item in your dictionary it printed
the key and the value
so of course the key is just the name
and the value is a little note we wrote
about them so that is what this little
program does and that is how you can
build a dictionary in Python and in the
next couple tutorials they're actually
going to be a lot more interesting than
this because I'm going to start showing
you guys how to work with modules and
also how to build a very simple web
crawler it's probably going to be the
coolest program roommate we made up to
date so think guys for watching and I'll
see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
