actual tutorial of XHTML and today we're
gonna be learning how to add a title and
some body text to our website so before
I begin I just wanted to show you some
code if you go to a website and click
view source this is what web browser
actually sees as code and this is what
we're gonna be learning how to make
today and what it all means
so just exit out and all this code is
made up in of a bunch of tiny pieces and
these pieces are called tags and if you
know what these tags mean and you know
how to use them then you can better
organize your website and better apply
attributes to it so let's just go ahead
and get started the first thing that
we're gonna need to do is include a
little thing called a doctype and what
this does is tell the web browser that
we're not using HTML which is the old
language they use to make websites that
we're gonna be using the new language
and it's called XHTML so if you went to
my website if you're not already there
just go to the new boston.com
click on XHTML click on number two
and then right here right below the
video just highlight this right click it
copy your text editor and paste it in
and if you don't have a text editor yet
then I would recommend you watch my
first video and it tells you how to
download on so the first piece we're
gonna add to the website it's called the
HTML tag now all tags or pieces of the
website have the exact same format a
beginning tag and an end tag and
anything in between this is affected by
the tag so the first tag we remember
right like I said it's called the HTML
tag and what this tag does is tell the
browser that we're gonna be working on a
website and to view it as a website and
not anything else like a text document
or anything that so you start out by
putting the less than sign and typing
HTML and this starts your website then
press ENTER a few times and this is the
beginning tag right here now we have to
make the ending tag so the ending tag
looks like this the same exact name
except less than sign slash HTML and
then close it off so the only difference
between the beginning and the end is
little slash right here then whatever
your tag is the tag name it's the same
for the beginning in the end so our
entire website is now going to go in
between these two tags now there's two
major parts to our website the first
parts called the body and the second
parts called the head actually the head
goes first but
and the head of the website is the part
that you don't see and this includes
things like the title and the keywords
that the search engine looks for and all
the stuff that the viewer doesn't see
but the body includes all the stuff that
he does see like the text and images and
colors and this is what we're going to
be spend most of our time on but right
now we're gonna want to start with a
head so do this exact same format as the
HTML click the less than sign type in
head and click the greater than sign and
then on next line click the less than
sign backslash and that ends it so this
is the beginning and this is the end so
now we have the head section of our
website we have nothing in the head
section so make a little line so you can
have some space to put stuff in and the
first thing that we're gonna want to add
to our head in the only thing right now
is the title so to do this it's the same
format as before click the less than
sign type in title this is a sign for a
title then you can write anything for
your title I'm gonna write my title and
then to end it click the less than sign
slash in title and make sure that this
tag is enclosed in your head tag in your
head tag is enclosed in your HTML tag
you can't have one inside and one
outside over here or anything so now we
have a title to our website but we don't
have anything in the body see the title
is gonna show up right here and it's
going to be blank right here so click
down here in
to start with our body we're gonna open
with a body tag so this is open with a
body tag and the end body tag the less
than sign
backslash body and anything in your body
is gonna go in between here and note
that I'm typing some tags on the same
line such as a title and some on
different lines such as the body it
doesn't make any difference at all where
you type it it's just so people can view
it better as long as you're enclosed in
the HTML tag in your reading just like a
book left or right up down then you
should be fine so in your body tag you
can type whatever you want I'll tell you
this is my body and now we have body
text so now we have a title to our
website and body text so let's go ahead
and see what this looks like we're gonna
want to go file save as and we're gonna
want to save this as a HTML document we
can't save it as anything else or the
browser won't know what it's looking at
so save it as anything HTML click Save
and then we're gonna want run launch in
Internet Explorer or you can launch it
in Firefox if you want we're gonna go
ahead and launch it and as you can see
we have that title we typed in a write
up here my title and we have a body this
is my body right here and as you can see
it's kind of plain right now so in the
next tutorial we're gonna be learning
how to change the color of the
background and also change the color of
the text and also learn to align the
text and some headings and some other
different stuff
so that's in the next tutorial and as I
said if you want to you can following at
my site New Boston comm and as you can
see I have all the step by step
tutorials to help you follow along
