physics story and in the story I'm gonna
be talking about subtraction in
scientific notation I'm gonna be working
with two positive exponents and then two
negative exponents and then finally to
wrap things up I'm gonna be subtracting
a negative exponent from a positive
exponent now to be honest if you watch
my last tutorial and you understand
completely
addition in scientific notation then
this is gonna be really easy for you
however if you want to go through a
couple more examples in see a few
subtraction examples then stick around
because you definitely need to
understand this before we go on to the
next Oriels which is multiplication and
division so the very first thing we need
to do in this tutorial is we need to
convert these scientific notation
numbers to standard notation now eight
point nine one times 10 to the fourth is
80 9100 now 3.4 times 10 to the third is
3400 now 89 one hundred minus three
thousand four hundred equals 85 thousand
seven hundred now what this converted
into scientific notation is is right now
the decimal point is right there and we
want to move it right here so let's kind
of spaces 1 2 3 4 so our final answer
equals eight point five seven times of
course 10 to the fourth so that's our
final answer right there so now let's go
ahead and move on to an example where we
see a negative
subtracted from a negative so the very
first thing we need to do of course is
convert this to standard notation in six
point two six times 10 and negative two
is point
yeah I'm gonna do that in like every
tutorial I'm about to dropkick my
computer but point zero six two six
minus five point nine times ten to the
negative three in standard notation is
point zero zero five nine so point zero
six to six minus point zero zero five
nine equals point zero five six seven
and of course what we need to do is we
need to move this one two decimal points
to the right so the final answer for
this would be five point six seven times
ten to the negative two so there's our
final answer right there now to wrap
things up let's go ahead and take a look
at this right here now what we're doing
is we basically have a really big number
one point four five times ten to the
sixth minus a really small number so two
point six seven times ten to the
negative two so we're taken a really
small amount away from a really big
number so we're going to end up with a
really big number we already know that
so let's go ahead and walk well I guess
I'll go ahead and walk you guys through
this so one point four or five times ten
to the six is 1,450,000 and that's it
make sure you got that all right four
zeros yep looks pretty good minus two
point six seven times ten negative two
is point zero two six seven so one and a
half million minus this really small
number right here gives us one four four
and let me see how many
five nine seven three and our decimal
point is right there so to be honest I
don't even know how to read this summer
let me throw out my comm is in okay
one million four hundred forty nine
thousand nine hundred ninety nine and
nine hundred and seventy-three as a your
you know your fraction whatever the heck
you want to call it so then we got to
convert this whole dang thing in
scientific notation so let's see how
many decimal points we have to move it
one two three four five six so one point
four four nine nine nine nine nine seven
three times 10 to the sixth right there
so there is our whoa definitely messed
that up let's see if I get this there is
our answer right there so one point four
or five times seven six minus two point
six seven times ten to the negative two
equals this massive number right there
and that would probably be like your
mom's weight and tons of course because
she's huge burn and yeah so there you go
there is subtraction again a lot like
addition however and the next order
we're gonna be covering multiplication
and that's where things get tricky so I
don't even know if you guys want to even
watch that sorrow because your brain
might explode but if you are up for it
then I'll see you there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
