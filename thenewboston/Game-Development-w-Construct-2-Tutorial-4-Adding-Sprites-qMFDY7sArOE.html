and in this video it's actually a pretty
important one because I'm going to be
teaching you guys how to add sprites to
your game now what is a sprite like I
said not the soda a sprite in a computer
game is anything that's animated so you
guys might be thinking okay so sprites
are like the player that runs around and
also the enemies who try to attack you
in your right but sprites are also some
of the things that you probably might
not think about generally when you think
about things that are animated or things
that move for example you know whenever
you're playing Super Mario Brothers and
you hit one of those blocks with your
head well even though the block didn't
like run around it did explode so that's
an animation so that block would be a
spray and also like Sonic the Hedgehog
whenever you're collecting coins well
even though those coins look kind of you
think of them as staying in one place
whenever you run into them they
disappear so going from you know just
being visible to invisible that's also
animation so that's a spray as well so
basically like 95% of the crap in your
computer game is probably going to be a
sprite so just remember that whenever
you're thinking do I add this is a
sprite or not you probably do so how do
we add them well just like the texture
double-click anywhere on the layer and
again make sure that you're on this main
layer not the background the active
layer double click and from here scroll
down until you see sprite pretty awesome
on icon if you ask me but don't click
this or you can just click it and hit
insert and now just like the texture we
get these little crosshairs basically
saying where do you want your sprite to
be well for right now we'll just go
ahead and click click anywhere it
doesn't really matter and now just like
before we have to say ok that's where
you want your sprite to be but what
image do you want to use for the sprite
well again let's just go ahead and load
one and first one we'll do is the player
of course our main character and hit
open and then we can just close that out
and as you can see now we can deselect
it our player appears right there
so that's kind of a long process for
adding a spray especially since a bunch
of crap in your game is going to be a
spray itself so I want to show you guys
another cool um kind of easier way to
add sprites and that's this if you
actually go to your Windows Explorer and
find your sprites all of mine are in
this folder called game what you can do
is you can actually just drag them from
your Windows Explorer and drop them
right there and whenever you drop them
they automatically convert that image to
a spray so again you can only do these
with sprites because well that's how the
games or excuse me that's how the
software set up so take all these images
and drag them one by one and that's
another thing I want to mention you have
to drag them one by one because if you
just grab them all like this and drag
them all at the same time then it's
going to make it a single sprite with
different animation frames which means
the bullet is going to turn into a bomb
it's going to turn into a monster no
pretty much just make sure that you drag
them one by one because they're each of
they're pretty much they're independent
of one another so that was a lot faster
and that's the way that I prefer to add
a sprite so now the only other thing
that I want to do in the story is this
if you click all these you can see the
names for them and that's this this one
is named sprite and just probably
mention that if I go to my computer on
the desktop and game whenever you add it
in the first way like I add to that
player then it's going to give it a
default name of spray and if you add in
another one that way it's going to give
a sprite one spray to spray theory
whenever you drag them from your Windows
Explorer it's going to give it the base
name of the file which is monster
explode bullet so what I want to do
right now is I want to rename this one
since it renamed them sprite by default
I just want to rename them player you
know of course to do that just click it
and on the properties panel right here
you can change the name in the name
attribute and
I actually want to change these all to
capital letters just so you know
convention so I'm going to name this to
explosion I'm going to name this to
monster with the capital m and name this
to bullet and also that bullet is kind
of hard to see so I'm going to go ahead
and place it right by the gun so then
you know I'm not looking all around for
it trying to find it so now that you got
all your sprites loaded in and you got
everything where they want to be named
properly you can go ahead and click run
and wow this game is awful all I see is
a bunch of characters not moving around
not trying to kill each other what the
heck is the fun in that
so in the next tutorial we're going to
well I'm going to show you guys how to
make something called behaviors it's
really cool thank you guys for watching
and well I'll see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
