this tutorial your tenth iphone
development tutorial I'm going to show
you guys how to make a slider so if you
actually click on this tutorial thinking
that it was a story on how to make
cheeseburger sliders then well that's
probably pretty embarrassing for you so
anyways here's what it is you go ahead
slide it and it gets the value for you
and you maybe maybe you can use in this
to say how much money do you want taken
out to have a hundred dollars in my bank
account and I want to take all that out
so you know all right don't even listen
to me I'm just uh mumbling right now so
go ahead and quit that an open Xcode and
go ahead and open what every project
name is mine is named bank account
because it's my super secret bank
account now let's go ahead and jump
right into the code so let's think for a
second what exactly was the one thing
that changed that we need to change with
coding well that label changed we know
we need an outlet for that but what
about the slider well actually in this
case we don't need an outlet for the
slider um what we're going to do is just
call an action on that and it's going to
change the label via an outlet so let's
go ahead and like I said we need UI
label I'm just go ahead and name s label
and this will be your outlet and of
course we need a property for it but we
don't have have to type all that so go
ahead and copy this and paste that
is right there and you I label but
instead of password go ahead and put s
labeled so we went ahead and we created
or started to create our outlet right
here but we need one more method and
that is IB action and what can we name
this sliding I guess sliding looks
pretty good
and ID sender so sliding make sure I
spell everything wrong and good to go so
go ahead and copy this and go ahead to
your implementation file and first thing
that we want to do is synthesized that s
label so synthesized s label so it
actually creates the getter and setter
methods for us and you know before I
even build this method let's just go
right to the end and release it even
though it it's built the methods for us
we still need to be responsible for
releasing it so make sure not to forget
that and finally we can begin get into
the good stuff so go ahead paste your
header that's called sliding and this is
going to be your action whenever you
slide that slider bar this is the method
that's going to be called anytime you
slide it even a little bit so what do we
want to do first well instead of using
the word sender every time let's go
ahead and you know let's make this a
little bit easier you I slider and go
ahead and name a star s so then instead
of well let me go ahead and put you I
slider astrix sender so now instead of
having to write this every time we can
just use the S just makes our code a
little bit easier so what do we want to
do now well whenever we slide that thing
it's going to have a value associated
with it so what we want to do is get
that value in store it in a variable
that's easy to work with so let's go
ahead and it's going to be in of course
because you saw 1 to 100 it didn't have
any decimal points or anything and just
name yours value because I mean it's
pretty self-explanatory and go ahead and
cast it into it in if it isn't casted
already in that slider the attribute to
get the value is whatever your sliders
name is in the built-in default is value
and this is going to return the value
casta is it injure and store in a nice
little variable called value that's a
whole lot easier to work with isn't it
so now what do you all want to do
well we want to start building that
label pretty much so what we need to do
is format string that we're going to
print out to that label so NS string and
just go ahead and name new label because
it isn't the old label this is the new
one we want to create and go ahead and
NS string allocate some space for it
remember we're going to need to release
this later and in it with format pretty
much means what format do you want to
use just go ahead and print out an
integer I mean anything more complicated
than that and go ahead and we're going
to pass it the value so all this does is
it creates a string either in all the
string is is one number either one to
100 could be 40 it could be 84 who knows
so after this what we want to do is we
have this new label but the old label is
still on a screen we didn't change it
yet so go ahead and remember in order to
access that old label it's s label since
it built that setter and getter methods
for us automatically and the property to
change the text on a label is text
that's a built-in property so now you
say all right I want to access that
labels text but what exactly do I want
to change it to well just go ahead and
change it to new label just like that so
after that I said that we need to
release it remember since we allocated
it anything you allocate you need to
release later on so go ahead and new
label release so once you synthesize
that built your sliding method and also
release that at the end you can go ahead
up to build and build this and see if we
have any heirs and it said succeeded
impressive so we are good go jump in an
interface voter and start messing around
there but actually I'm going to save
that for next tutorial because I think I
might run out of time in this one but
let me just recap one last time what we
did we pretty much started
nice text message should I see what it
says yeah you guys don't mind Dom what
you up to really really dumb I'm in the
middle of a tutorial alright anyways
what we did is we built our label and we
pretty much declared it as an outlet and
we also built a header to method and in
here what we did is we thin synthesize
it and that means automatically build
setter and getter methods for us so we
can use this basically and we didn't
forget to release it at the end remember
you know need take care of your
computer's memory and the meat and bones
to this tutorial the sliding method this
is the method anytime you slide that
slider this was going to be called first
of all we rename that slider to s so you
know it's easier to work with we got the
value of it and stored it in a variable
called value then we pretty much took
that value and printed it out is a label
as a nice string and then we took that
new string and set it equal to the text
on the label so it actually showed up on
our screen and when we're done where you
just released all our memory because you
know we don't need it we're not greedy
we're give in the back giving it back to
you guys your computer so uh yeah if you
want any of the source code then click
on the link below and yeah it will be
there for you guys trust me and if you
have any questions you can ask me on our
forum so in the next tutorial we're
going to be putting all this together so
I think for watching don't forget
subscribe and I'll see you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
