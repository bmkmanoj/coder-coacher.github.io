to be learning about the RGB color mode
and understanding it a little better
it's very important to understand the
color modes in Photoshop because they
basically that's what makes up your
image is just a bunch of colors so the
RGB color mode is probably the most
widely used of all the color modes it
pretty much it generates color using
three 8-bit channels and one red one
green and a one blue and if we go over
to the channels panel over here we can
see that there is a red channel a green
Channel and a blue Channel so when you
add them all together they create the
colors that you can see in your image
now since each color here has a is
capable of generating 256 shades of
color that translates into 16,777,216
possible colors for damage pixel so
here's that number down here at the
bottom so you can kind of understand how
many colors there oh there's only it's
not 116 it's just 16 let me yeah back
off that one yep there we go
16,777,216 so that's the total amount
that you can make using RGB color mode
RGB is pretty much what your eye sees
and and it is a pretty much how the
human eye perceives color now the RGB
color mode is the color space of
computer monitors televisions cell
phones and any electronic display so
basically everything that's electronic
is using RGB color mode now you want to
make sure that if you're creating
something for an electronic display or
something that's project
did or something like that then you want
to be using RGB you don't want to be in
cm ky color mode so or else your colors
are gonna show up weird when you go to
use it on the or when you go to display
on the monitor or any other electronic
device now one thing about RGB color
mode is that it's device dependent and
what that means pretty much is that it's
not going to always show up the same on
every single electronic device you've
got monitors that have more the ability
to display more colors in them you have
monitors that are better you have
televisions that are just have better
color in them and everything like that
so it's not always gonna look the same
on every computer and most of the time
it looks different but they're generally
pretty close now if you want to check
and see what color mode your image is in
you can either come down to the bottom
down here or says srgb whatever click on
this little arrow and go to document
profile and it'll tell you what it what
it's in and it'll tell you the profile
Edison and this one is srgb which is in
RGB color space you can come to the
channels over here next to your layers
panel and look to see if it's an RGB or
you can come up to image go to mode and
then whatever is checked here is what
you have in RGB and this is also how you
change it so if it's in the wrong thing
if it's like came in greyscale or
something like that just click on mode
or go to mode and then just click on RGB
and it'll change it to that it's kind of
a cool factoid is that red green and
blue are referred to as the edit of
primaries you can add varying
proportions of these colors to produce
millions of different colors now you can
see that green herhere mixes with red
and makes yellow and this is these are a
full full blast here
2:55 green 255 red 255 blue so that's
the highest they can go and you can see
red and blue make cyan blue and red make
magenta and then red green and blue
together on one make white so that's
these are called additive colors and
then when we get to CMYK we'll just go
over what they are as well these colors
here that are created by the three
primary colors are called secondary
colors and knowing the difference
between primary and secondary colors
helps you be able to blend and use
colors effectively to do whatever you
need to do be advertising or just
creating a really nice design that works
cohesively with each other so just
knowing the basics of what RGB is is
good if your client is asking you it's
one of the basic things you should know
you should know RGB is so that's the
overview of what that is and in the next
tutorial we'll be going over what the
CMYK color mode is and understanding
that a little better so thanks for
watching this one and I look forward to
seeing you in the next tutorial have a
good one everyone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
