similar triangles so perimeter is the
distance around the outside of a
triangle so to solve to find out what
the perimeter of any triangle is you're
gonna take its three sides and add them
together so for this triangle we're
gonna sit six plus eight plus 12 is
equal to our perimeter
eight plus 12 is 20 plus six 26 so the
perimeter of this triangle is 26 so in
similar triangles the ratio of the
perimeters is equal to the ratio of any
particular side pair of sides so in
order to find the ratio of the
perimeters I'm just gonna find out what
the ratio of the sides are so I'm going
to take one side of the little triangle
and put it over one side of the big
triangle and using our ratio rules we
can check to make sure that when we
cross multiply 12 does equal 12 so the
ratio of each one of these sides is 2/3
so that means the perimeters are gonna
have a ratio of 2/3 so we're gonna find
the perimeter of each triangle and check
to make sure that it is 2/3 so 2 plus 8
is 10 plus 14 or plus 4 is 14 so the
perimeter of this one is 14 3 plus 12 is
15 plus 6 is 21 if we put 14 over 21 and
if you reduce by
seven you get two over three so yes they
do have the same proportion or they do
have the same ratio so find the
parameter of these two triangles so your
a little hint right here is that these
triangles are similar so if they're
similar than each side is in proportion
so we're gonna find out the purport the
ratio of the side so we're gonna put
this one of the little triangle over
this one of the big triangle because
these are the corresponding sides and if
we reduce by five so we get 1/2
so there's two ways we can find the
perimeter and I'm gonna do both to show
you that it doesn't matter which one you
do so the first way is using our ratio
of sides we can figure out what each one
of these sides is and then add them
together so we're gonna do that first so
3 which is this 1 over X because that's
what the length of that is is equal to 1
over 2 so if we cross multiply we get X
is equal to 6 so this length is 6
and if we did the same thing to this one
we'd get six as well because we'd put
three over we'd call this Y and then we
get y equal to six because these two are
congruent sides and we know that because
these two sides of the triangle of the
little triangle are congruent so then we
could add up ten plus six plus six and
we would get twenty-two and we could add
up the little triangle and get three
plus three plus five is equal to eleven
so we could do that or we could since we
know that the ratio of the sides are
one-half we know that the ratio of the
perimeters also has to equal one half so
since we can find the perimeter of the
small triangle and we know that's 11 if
we put eleven over what over P because
that's the purpose just gonna be the
perimeter of the big triangle and set it
equal to one over two
if you cross multiply you get P is equal
to 22 so either way you find the
perimeter of the big triangle to be 22
and the perimeter of the little triangle
to be 11 so that's why we went over
ratios in proportion so we could solve
problems about similar triangles so make
sure you guys come back and watch the
next video where we're going to talk
about parallel and perpendicular lines
and what kind of things they form</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
