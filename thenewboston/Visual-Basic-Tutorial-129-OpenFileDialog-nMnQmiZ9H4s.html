slash on live gamer for the new Boston
and in this tutorial we're going to be
talking about open file dialogs
now open file dialogues are used to of
course open files and they are built
into Visual Basic so you know you do not
have to create your own form for it and
you can just add an object of it to your
program and use it whenever you need to
so we'll create a new project we will
select windows forms application and we
will call it open files go ahead and
click OK and wait for that to load and
once it's done loading we'll go ahead
and shrink this a little bit and we need
to add three things we need to add a
button we will set the text to open and
we will set the name of it to button
open and we'll add a label so here is
our label and we will set the name to
label file and we'll go ahead and set
the initial text value to no file
selected okay so now we need to come
back in our tool box will minimize out
of common controls containers menus and
toolbars data components and now we need
to come down here let me just get some
of these out of the way we need to use
dialogues now select an Open File dialog
you do not have to drag this on your
form you can just go ahead and double
click on that and it adds an object of
it to your form to your project I mean
so let's double click on open and let's
go ahead and zoom in here so what we
want to do when they click open is type
Open File dialog one dot show dialog so
this is going to show a dialog that will
allow them to select a file now we want
to do is we want to set the label to
whatever the name of that file is so
label file dot text is going to be equal
to Open File dialog or Open File dialog
one dot file name
so let's go ahead and run this you can
see here you can see here we got a form
one I want to click when we click open
it opens a file open file dialog for us
so let's go ahead and navigate here and
let's select back check five so we'll go
ahead and open that sorry that was out
of frame there but we'll select
backtrack five which is a Linux
distribution well click OK we'll click
open and you can see that it gets the
full path of our file now we can open
another one let's go to development
c-sharp projects signs calculator and
we'll select the solution file and you
can see that it's going to give us the
entire path of that file so we can use
this path later on to open the file or
maybe read text from it or what else we
whatever else we need to do now what we
can also do is change some properties
and values of our open file dialog
before it is shown so we'll just type
open file dialog one dot title and we
can set it to whatever we want so I can
even set it to on live gamer so let's go
ahead and run this and see what kind of
results we get it says no files selected
so we'll go ahead and just open one you
can see here that the title says on live
gamer now you can change the title to
whatever you want and it will also
change the icon to whatever your
programs default icon is and so we'll
just select some here click open and you
can see that it gives us the path of
that file so we'll go ahead and close
out of that so practice a little bit
with Open File dialogues later on we're
going to be learning more about save
file dialogues folder browser dialogues
font dialogues print dialogues there's a
whole bunch of stuff built into Visual
Basic that makes it easy for you to open
files print stuff whatever you need to
do without having to waste time coding
for that and you can focus on what your
program is really supposed to do so like
I said practice
this is a little bit I've changed some
attributes of your open file dialog then
once you've got that down go ahead and
move on to the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
