and in this video I want to talk to you
guys about the thing that a lot of you
commented about in a prom that I'm
having and I know that there's a much
easier solution for this but I cannot
possibly think of one in my brain so
that's why I'm asking you guys to help
me hopefully someone out there can come
up with a solution so first of all let
me go ahead and explain the feature that
I built into the website so as a
reminder to the user of what web page
you're on and just to make the webpage
more interactive in the website in
general what I did is I set the link on
the left hand side of whatever web page
they're currently on to orange so if
you're on the offers or receive page you
can go ahead and do your stuff in the
links stays orange if you're on your
Inbox
check it out the inbox the links stays
orange even when you're adding the item
you can go in ahead and fill in all your
fields and check it out the add item
link stays orange even after you take
your cursor off of it so now that's the
feature and like I said it makes the
webpage more interactive pretty sweet so
how did I set this up in PHP code well
the first thing I needed to do is I
needed to identify which page the user
was on because that's the page where I
wanted to make the link stay orange so
how did I do this well every time we
call the function that makes all the
links every single web page has a unique
identification number for example active
maybe one pending maybe to add item
maybe three four five six seven so then
now that each webpage has a unique
identification number whenever that page
loads the identification number is
passed into the function that's called
account links now this function pretty
much creates all the links on the left
hand side so you have the identification
number which on the add items page this
one is evidently zero
so whenever zero gets passed in let's go
ahead and look at the function that
makes all the account links what it does
is it takes that number which is zero in
this case and it runs it through a
switch statement
now what this does is it tests that
number and only runs one of these cases
so it can only set one of these
variables to the CSS now this CSS is of
course the code that turns it orange
instead of white so now only one of
these variables can be orange and the
rest are white by default so that's
basically the system that I built that
turns one linked orange and gives the
user that interactive feeling so once
orange the others are all plain white
pretty sweet but here is the problem
that I'm having and you guys can
probably see it as well the problem is
that each link even though this is all
the same code this one in this one and
this one these have all the exact same
CSS so it's really repetitive really
messy if I needed to change something I
would need to change it 15 different
times so the thing is that I can't just
set it equal to one variable because
each link like I said needs a unique
variable because if you have something
like a loop or an array then you could
only have one variable and whenever
you're making one variable that means
all of the links would either be orange
or white you can't have one orange in
the rest white so I know that there's a
better way to do this and I want to I
guess I probably shouldn't mention this
is my last thing so of course this is
the CSS that pretty much over writes the
default style and sets it to orange so
where does this go in your HTML well it
goes right in your link tag a right here
so instead of saying variable pending
right here it would either say nothing
if it was meant to be a plain link and
it wouldn't overwrite anything it would
just be a plain white link but one of
these which is let's say it's pending if
we passed in 12 then what it would do it
oh it would overwrite it output this CSS
and turn it Orange so of course we can't
just make all of these pending instead
of pending or reported or all of them
would be orange or white so that's my
problem I'm having right now I don't
know how to clean it up
such as put it in an array or a loop or
another function or anything and I know
that this system works right now but
check it out
I have 15 different variables that are
set equal to the CSS that overwrites the
white and then I have to put the
variables down here and things are gonna
get really messy real quick so if
someone has a solution then please tell
me because I would love to know and you
know this is kind of driving me crazy
but for now I think you guys for
watching don't forget subscribe and
please help me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
