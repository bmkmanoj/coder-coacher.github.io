third part of this little mini series of
how to develop an RPG for the iPhone and
so far what we did is we created a world
using you know map editor so right now
we have basically a map on the screen
looks pretty cool but in order for this
to be any sort of game instead of just
you know 2d Google Maps we actually need
a character or a player to add this
screen so what I did is let me go ahead
and exile this iPhone simulator is I
made a little dude right here dude dot
ping and I'm gonna go ahead and import
him into resources um go ahead and
import any ping you want obviously your
dudes probably not going to be as highly
skilled graphically as mine this took me
about five hours to do but uh yeah once
you got something imported you're ready
to move on to the next step so let's go
ahead and no need to save that all right
so now what we want to do is we want to
open tile it again and we actually want
to add him to our video game so how do
we do that well in order to add well
let's just go ahead and cover this first
before in order to make the map what we
did is we built tiled layers that's just
the background layer with tiles pictures
we know how to do that but what we want
to do is we want to add a new object
layer so in order to do this and I
should move it up here in order to do
this go ahead up to layer add object
layer and now you see you have a
different layer aside from your
background background an object layer
one go ahead and rename this to oh gee
will name all of our layers two
different letters so it'll be simple Oh
J object there you go so now what we
want to do is check this out
whenever you click on the screen you
don't get tiles but these weird gray
things that pop up that you can also
drag around so let's go ahead and press
command Z to get rid of those and what
these are is they're pretty much blank
objects that we can do what we want with
so the only thing we
wanted to do now is we want to click a
spot for our player to start out so go
ahead and click anywhere on the screen
let's see this looks like a nice place
to start out let's put it in the center
right there so go ahead and click on a
spot anywhere on the screen and this
gray blank object is gonna appear there
so now what we want to do is we need a
way to identify the different objects on
the screen and this is just in case we
have a bunch of different objects um
this is what you do right click it once
you made it and click object properties
and now we need to give it a name this
is pretty much gonna be our identifiers
and I'm just gonna name my start point
since this is the start point for the
dude we're gonna add so go ahead and
press ok so now you see start point is
over this little object you can't see
the whole world word but it's there
trust me so now that we got an object
made here's what we need to do go ahead
and click file save in before I go over
the sound we just wanna go over this one
time we created a new layer for object
and that layer is named OJ and then on
that layer we created one object named
start point alright so like I said go
ahead file save X add a child and now
what we need to do is this and resources
go ahead and right click buckey's map
and go ahead and delete this and also
move it to trash is very important and
now we have no tiled maps and go ahead
and re-import the new saved version with
the object layers and this is how you
get your new maps on the screen and you
also probably want to do this highlight
your main thing right there and click
build clean all targets and clean and
now this is going to do is is pretty
much is gonna refresh everything and
make sure it doesn't use the old map
accidentally all right so now we deleted
our old map and we re imported our new
one because the new one has our object
layer now we can go ahead and start
typing some code
of course we need a sprite for the dude
and just go ahead and put CC spray and
then just name them dude or dud
whatever your call and now let's just go
ahead and copy this and paste this right
here and now what we wanted to do is let
me check my code real quick looks good
and now what we want to do is just
housekeeping stuff synthesize them
synthesize the dude and might as well go
overhead and release them right now self
dot dude equals nil when we're done so
let me think if I have time to finish
this tutorial actually in the next
tutorial we're going to be doing is
actually changing the init method and
adding him to the screen because there's
a lot of things I need to cover and I'm
probably not going to have enough time
in this story but anyways make sure for
the coding for this tutorial you add a
sprite called dude of course property
synthesized that property and also
release it right here in the next
tutorial we'll be adding him to the
screen so that's all I have for you guys
for this story in the next tutorial you
know enough of me talking just check out
the next tutorial so uh and don't forget
to check on my forum it's pretty cool so
yeah see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
