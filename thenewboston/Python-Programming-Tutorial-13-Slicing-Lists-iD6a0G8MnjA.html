tutorial and in this tutorial I'm going
to be talking to you guys about
something called slicing now what
slicing is is it pretty much allows you
to put multiple elements in the list or
sequence at the same time without having
to do it individually so let's go ahead
and make a list on they might an example
and we'll set equal to let's change a
word into a list using the list function
and might as well put easy Hoss or
something like that now create our list
and let's see it make sure regard right
so now we have eight characters that say
easy hosta and now when we use slice
when we use slicing we can replace or
replace certain elements in our list for
something else so let me just show you
get our example list again in we're
going to edit it this time so we're
going to edit it from four on and
remember when you put an empty on the
right side of semicolon or actually
that's a regular : it means just at the
end of it and so for these four
characters we want to replace what do we
want to put let's put some more more
text instead of haast let's put baby and
then press ENTER to create it and then
go ahead and output your list example
and now you can see instead of easy Hoss
it says easy baby
right there so that is how you can use
slicing to replace a portion of your
list or sequence and you don't have to
replace the exact same amount you can
also do something like example four on
again equals in write something larger
than four characters such as I don't
know racecars something like that
and then go ahead and output it again
and now you can see your uh what's it
called sequence has more than just eight
characters so you don't have to just do
it the exact same amount you can do it
however much amount you want um another
thing that I want to show you guys is
how to add elements in the middle of
your list just replace them on either in
so go ahead and let's uh let's uh
recreate our example and actually let's
make this entire new one PO mmm seven
eight nine or something so now we have a
short little list that's seven eight
nine now if you want to add elements
directly to the middle of the solicitor
sequence what we have to do is go ahead
and type the name of our list type of
where we want to add the elements so I'm
going to name mine so I'm going to
excuse me add mine um pretty much before
this one when you use the same numbers
so before the first one remember it's
zero zero one so if you say alright
first first this means after the first
one and well this is what it means
you'll see why in a little bit now you
have to put equals and what do you want
to add there well I want to add just
three three three just so I can show you
guys so this is saying alright I want to
add this little string of sequence right
before the first element in our list so
go ahead and press ENTER and output it
and it says seven right there three
three three which is this eight nine to
the end of it so that's how you can use
slicing the insert of mini sequence into
a larger sequence to equate to create an
ultimate bigger one I guess the last
thing I want to show you guys is pretty
much the opposite of this how do you get
rid of this and one ways to use the
delete function but you can also use
slicing to do this so let's go ahead and
write our example again and we want to
be working with the care
one which is means include one remember
that first one is inclusive so this is 0
this is 1 and let's see 2 3 4 5 remember
when you put 5 right here it doesn't
include this one so it's going to do 1 2
4 so what do we want to do with that I
told you guys I would delete them and
all you have to do to do that is add an
empty element like that and once you
press Enter and output it instead of
just seven blank blank blank blank 9 it
has 7 9 and that's how you can delete
elements in a list using slicing so
that's all I have for you this tutorial
