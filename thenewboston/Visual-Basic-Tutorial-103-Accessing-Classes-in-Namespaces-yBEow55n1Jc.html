youtube.com slash on live gamer for the
new boss tip and in this tutorial we're
going to be talking more about
namespaces now if you remember from the
previous tutorial we created this people
file right here people dot VB and inside
of it we created two namespaces we have
namespace other people and namespace
friends and inside each one of these we
have a class called people and you can
see here that we have a class called
people right there
now the reason that these don't conflict
with each other is because we have put
them in two different namespaces so
let's go ahead and come over here and we
will add a button to our form one so
we'll just make that bigger
let's find two text boxes
okay so we'll bring this button down
we'll put the textbox is right
underneath each other and then we'll
label them first name and last name so
for label one the text is going to be
first name and for label to the text is
going to be last name so last name okay
so now what we'll do is we'll change the
text for button one so we'll just click
so we'll just type in show friend or
let's just do show person and we will
set the name values for each of these
text boxes so text first name and text
last name okay so now we'll open up our
code for four more VB and you can see
here that it generates the form one load
of it now what we need to do is create
an object of one of our people classes
now for this one we'll just use the
class people from the namespace other
people we could also use the people from
the namespace friends so let's come over
here to form one dot VB and we need to
create an object of that class so we
will type private person as new and now
whenever we're making a new person you
can see that the people class is inside
of the namespace other people so we have
to specify the namespace and then we
have to specify the class because we are
using more than one namespace inside of
our program so come up here and we want
to declare person as new other people
dot people
okay so now we can do is type person dot
first name over here when you leave that
out of there we need to come to our
button one event click so person dot
first name equals text first name dot
txt and person dot last name equals text
last name dot txt and we'll just go
ahead and show that in a message box so
we will type person dot two string and
you can see that we override the two
string function in each one of these
classes so that instead of converting
our person object or a people object to
a string it will just return their first
name and their last name so let's go
ahead and run this and see what happens
so here's our first name let's shrink
this down a bit so let's just do first
name Jim last name Harris and we'll just
go ahead and click show person and you
can see that we get Jim Harris right
here and he is of type people from the
namespace other people so go ahead and
if you have some programs that you've
already made you could try organizing
your classes inside of namespaces and or
make this program right here and once
you've done that go ahead and move on to
the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
