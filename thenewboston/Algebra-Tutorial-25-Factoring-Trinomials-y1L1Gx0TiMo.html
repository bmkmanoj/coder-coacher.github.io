more complex factoring and it's not it's
not that hard it just takes some getting
used to because unlike factoring a
perfect square trinomial or factoring
the difference of two squares when you
factor a normal trinomial it takes a
little bit of guess and check work so
essentially when you're factoring a
trinomial you are unfailing that
trinomial so what you have to think of
when you're going to do it is you're
going to have two parentheses and it's
going to be blank plus or minus blank
times blank plus or minus blank so when
you factor your trinomial you have to
think of what two numbers are going to
multiply to give me 12 and are going to
add to give me 7 X because right now you
know that there's got to be an X here
and an X here because when you do your
first x times X is the only way you're
going to get x squared so to fill in
these two blanks and to decide whether
it's plus or minus you have to think
okay what are the two numbers that can
multiply to give me 12 well there's two
and six three and four and 12 and one so
what two numbers are going to multiply
to give me 12 and add to give me seven
well two plus six is eight to six minus
two is four 4 plus 3 is 7 so we know
that we're going to use four plus three
so 4 plus 3 now since this is a positive
7x and a positive 12x we know that this
needs to be a plus in here and a plus in
here now if you foil this back out you
get the same expression up here
otherwise it's not the right so x
squared plus 3x plus 4x plus 12 and that
just that does give you the same thing
okay so remember we're going to have two
expressions x and then x here so 72 um
what numbers multiply to give you 72
well eight and nine for in 18 and six
and 12 if i add these i get 17 if i
subtract him i get one if i add these i
get 20 22 if i subtract him i get 16 i
add these i get 18 but if i subtract
them i get six so that means we're going
to be using six and 12 so six and 12 so
now you have to think since i need to
subtract these two in order to subtract
these two numbers and get a positive 6
that must mean that i subtract 12-6 so
that means that this
that means that I have to have a
positive 12 and a negative 6 so so a
negative times a positive would give me
a negative 72 and then I'd get x squared
plus 12x minus 6x minus 72 which would
give you a positive 6x in the middle
which does match this so we have one
more example that we're going to do and
ok so what two numbers multiply to get
60 so the first thing we can write down
is we know that these first two numbers
are going to be X and X and that these
numbers on the ends are going to have to
have lies in them because this is 60 y
squared so 6 and 10 multiplied to get 64
and 5 15 so 15-4 gives you 11 and since
my 11 is negative that means the 15 is
going to have to be negative so minus 15
plus 4 if we foiled this back out we get
x squared plus 4x y minus 15 X Y minus
60 y squared which gives you x squared
minus 11x y minus 60 y squared so that's
all we're doing with factoring but make
sure you come back and watch the next
lesson we're going to learn how to solve
a quiz equations using factoring</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
