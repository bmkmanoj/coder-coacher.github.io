about that so in the last video we
learned how to make a very simple window
and we also learned how to make some
text throw it on screen and also how to
make our window appear constantly
without disappearing real quick now of
course in the upcoming videos I'm going
to show you guys how to make drop-down
menus buttons that interact with your
program and a whole bunch of stuff
however before we learn about a bunch of
cool widgets we first need to know how
to organize the layout because I don't
know it's just better if we just don't
have a bunch of crap on the screen and
then we try to figure it out so let's go
ahead and figure out how to organize
crap first so we probably can get rid of
these two things these two middle lines
and we'll keep this one in this one
because basically every single program
that we make in kinter we're going to
need a main window and we're also going
to want to display on the screen so I
don't want to say every single bit of
code from here on out but just use that
as a general guideline anything that
we're going to be typing for the rest of
these stories this is going to be your
main layout and I'm going to be teaching
you guys all the new stuff in here since
this is pretty much the basic framework
so the first thing I want to tell you
guys is something called a frame now
think of a frame as an invisible
rectangle that can be a basic layout
that you can put things in so basically
say that this entire screen this entire
video is your main program well we can
make a frame that goes on top and we can
also make another frame that goes on
bottom and we can put a bunch of widgets
in either the top one or the bottom one
so it's a very simple layout just to get
stuff from the top bottom left or right
so how do we make these invisible
containers as you can think of them well
first I'll make one for the top and I'm
going to call it top frame now what you
do is you set this equal to frame
route this is pretty much saying okay
I'm going to make an invisible container
and it's going to go in the main window
the route okay well now that we made it
let's just go ahead and place it in our
window because right now it's in our
program but it doesn't display in our
main window remember any time we want
something display we have to pack it in
this pretty much says okay place it
somewhere in our main window our main
program however you want to think of it
so right now we have one container one
invisible rectangle well of course if we
just had one it would be useless because
we can just put crap in our window if we
were going to do that so let's go ahead
and make a bottom one as well so we'll
make a bottom frame and to create this
one of course do the same exact thing
say okay we're creating a frame blank
rectangle and we're putting it in our
main window and for this one what we
want to do is you want to take bottom
frame and pack it in as well but however
there is a parameter that you can throw
inside pack to say where exactly you
want to put it or pack it in your main
window well what we want to do with this
bottom frame is we actually want to take
it and put it on the bottom holy crap
what the heck of my typing so side
equals bottom so right now we have two
invisible containers we have one on top
something just freakin texted me and one
on bottom all right so you're probably
scratching your head thinking this thing
Bucky how come you had to say that this
frame went on bottom but you didn't need
to say anything for this frame on top
well you can actually um pack this one
in the top explicitly but we don't
really need to do that because by
default this is just going to go in your
main window and if we put something on
the bottom of it well this is obviously
going to be on the top of it it's like
if you have a cup on your desk and you
put something to the
left of it well then that cups going to
be on the right of it you know so we
don't need to explicitly say it so right
now that is what we have so let's throw
some widgets in there so I might as well
just show you guys how to make widgets
right now instead of using labels
because labels can kind of boring after
a while so let's make a few buttons a
button of course being just a simple
rectangle that you can press or click so
why is oh my god I'm going to dropkick
my computer if I type in the wrong file
one more time all right so let's make
four buttons on name one button 1 how do
you make a button well of course the
object name is button and it's going to
take some parameters the first parameter
we're going to throw in is okay right
now you have two frames what frame do
you want to put it in well let's say
that we want to put like three buttons
in the top frame and one button in the
bottom frame why not so the first one is
where do you want to put it just put
this one in the top frame the next thing
it takes is what do you want to show up
on the button so if you ever were like
on web design and you always have those
buttons like say submit or something for
your forms this is pretty much the value
of your button so the text parameter is
um it's either going to say like click
me submit press here whatever
so for button 1 just so it'll be easy to
see what's going on I'll just name it
button 1 so the last parameter that will
show you guys is FG and what you do is
you actually set this equal to a color
now this is actually optional you don't
even need it but just so whenever you
run our program it's going to be really
easy to see what's going on
I'll set each button to a different
color so now the words button 1 are
going to appear on this button and it's
going to be red that's the text not the
button itself that's foreground so now
what we can do is kind of cheat and make
button to button 3 button 4 now remember
that I said buttons 1 through 3 they're
all going to go in your top rectangle
right up here and we'll have one button
going in the bottom one so of course
this one is going to be bottom frame and
of course the text on each button is
going to be different and also make the
color is different as well
so we'll say that on the second button
can be blue third one the text can be
green not grand not my grandma green and
third one can be I don't know
purple why not alright so we got three
buttons on the top and we got one on the
bottom so what we can do is of course
remember this because I know that it
takes some getting used to and it's not
really intuitive but if we just ran this
program right now check it out nothing
is going to display that's because
creating a GUI is kind of a two-step
process creating widgets you first need
to create them and this is pretty much
your settings your details and then you
need to pack them in or tell your
program that you want to actually
display those widgets and where you want
to display them so what we can do is we
can actually take button 1 pack it in
and do this with all your buttons and
this will actually display them on your
screen now 3 &amp;amp; 4 so this displays them
on your screen and this just runs the
main loop so let me run this and check
it out so you're saying ok so we have 3
buttons on the top frame and one on the
bottom frame but right now it looks like
it's all in one column so what the heck
Bucky what's going on
well by default whenever you pack things
in they get packed on top of each other
so even though you can't see those
invisible frames buttons 1 through 3 are
indeed in that top frame and button 4 is
indeed on that bottom
frame so what if you actually wanted to
make it like how you thought it was
going to appear in your head that these
buttons 1 2 3 are going to appear to the
left of each other and that this bond of
4 would be on the bottom of it
well this pack actually has a parameter
so remember by default whenever you pack
stuff in it gets packed on top of each
other like you're stacking blocks so if
you wanted something to to appear on the
left of your window what you need to do
is press side equals left so this
parameter does we copy this it says okay
pack this button in and whenever you do
place it as far left as possible so it's
going to say okay take button 1 pack it
in the top frame and put it as far left
as possible so now buttons 1 2 &amp;amp; 3 are
going to appear on the left of each
other pretty much side by side and we'll
just go ahead and explicitly put a
parameter for button for button 4 will
be on bottom now this doesn't really
matter because it's the only thing in
the bottom frame so bottom top whatever
it won't really matter but if we run it
check it out now so buttons 1 2 &amp;amp; 3 are
in that top frame which we hold it up
here and whenever it packs it in or
places it in the frame it takes each
button and places it as far left as
possible so that's why button 1 what's
the Left button - well okay we'll put it
as far left as possible but you know
button 1 is already in a way so that's
why it's lining up side by side in
button 3 top frame as far left as
possible
without going over button 1 or 2 and of
course button 4 is the only thing in the
bottom frame so that's why it appeared
under here so pretty cool that is the
very basics of how you can make
invisible containers and how you can
display widgets inside those invisible
containers exactly and precisely how you
want them to now of course
this is a very simple layout but there
is obviously a lot more cover and I
actually save that for the next tutorial
since this one's getting kind of long
but for now then guys for watching don't
