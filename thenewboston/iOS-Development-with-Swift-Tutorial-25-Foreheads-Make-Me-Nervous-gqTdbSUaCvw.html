to show you guys how to make solid
shapes in other words create a shape and
fill it in with a color
but before I do that I have to mention
this so I don't know if this was
yesterday or two days ago but someone on
my website left this comment to my
sister your forehead is very sexy it
makes me nervous
forehead makes me nervous see I didn't
know that anyone's forehead could make
anyone nervous but I have no idea I
don't know if like he doesn't speak
English very well but uh yeah your
forehead makes me nervous
okay there so let's uh get back on track
here what I'm actually going to do is
anytime you want to create a shape and
fill it in with the color you create
some kind of shape like this so I'm just
going to copy my ugly shape and I
already pasted this to the form so I'm
going to delete everything in here
except the context because remember any
time you're drawing you always need the
context and it's just
oops it's just an object that you can
use for drawing so after we have that
context I'm just going to paste that
shape in again so yeah so this is like a
weird look in not a diamond it's like I
don't know some weird stupid shape so
that's where the context is basically a
weird-looking path that's enclosed so
now let me go ahead and show you guys
how to fill in this path and mizar like
to fill in a path first create a path
that you can fill in simple enough now
if we call the method CG
set fill color with color
then the first thing is okay what are
you trying to fill in what's that
context and what color do you want to
use so I'm just going to use UI color
dots what do we use before red or Ari's
purple let's use it red for this one so
we're going to fill it in with red and
of course just to make sure it's a color
object that doesn't give us any errors
we need to end with CG color now the
last thing is remember before whenever
we created a stroke path well what we
want to do here is we want to create CG
context fill path so there's different
types of paths that you can make a
stroke path is kind of like stroking
with a paintbrush a fill path is when
you want to fill a path in with a solid
color so what are you trying to fill in
context and this essentially just prints
it out on the screen or make sure that
it appears in your simulator or iphone
whatever so now check out this beautiful
hunk of glory so again it's the same
exact shape but instead of having a
stroke we now have a solid shape</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
