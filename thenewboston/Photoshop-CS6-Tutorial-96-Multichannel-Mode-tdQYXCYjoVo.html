Blackford here another Photoshop cs6
tutorial and this time we're going to
talk about the multi-channel color mode
and this one is specialized mainly for
printing and setting up things for being
printed on like a press so most of the
time you may not be using this but if
you're like a printer or work at a place
where you need to print out of stuff and
use other people's Photoshop files to
convert them to print then you would
want to know how to use this so what it
does is at a color mode that converts
the original color channels into shades
of gray and the Grays are based on the
luminosity values of the original image
so what happens is that the actual
channels are converted into spot colors
and what spot colors are are they hold
information for where the ink should be
applied on the printing press onto your
image so when it gets printed like the
location is known so spot colors are
actually actually have some more
information about them but you would
have to probably look those up to get
more information of them if you want to
know more about spot colors anyways
we're gonna talk about the multi-channel
color mode and that really spot colors
okay so if we go up into our image we
have we noticed that we're in the RGB
color mode right now
and remember that when you're printing
you usually want to be in CMYK color so
this is something that you need to you
would want to know when you have your
image as an RGB color you're gonna get
the cyan magenta and yellow spot
channels but you're not gonna have the
black Channel if you use CMYK you're
going to get all the channels including
the black so let's do both of these so
let's just convert this to CMYK real
quick and do that first
okay and let's go ahead and go into the
new mode multi-channel right here
flattened layers okay and now if we go
to the channels we have our different
channels here and these are no spot
channels so you can see that everything
has been converted to blue not very
useful but pretty much it's useful when
you are about to go print on something
so that's what that does let's go back
I'm gonna go to hit my history and just
go back to this one and I'm gonna
convert it it should be converted back
to RGB now let's convert this to
multi-channel real quick and I'm gonna
okay you can see this is different
looking and now we've got our cyan
magenta and yellow and you can see that
there's no black Channel well if you
notice in both times we are missing our
composite Channel
so let's go back and actually the the
composite channel is when they're all
combined and they make the actual image
that has all the colors that's your
composite channel so let's go back again
and I'm gonna convert it back to CMYK
okay and then I'm gonna go ahead and
here's our composite channel right here
on the top it has all our colors I'm
gonna come back or change it back to the
multi channel okay and you can see we
lose the composite channel why cuz it's
not needed so that's what we have going
on there so one thing that's important
to know when you're using this is that
the images when they're converted to
this channel here multi channel it needs
to be saved in a certain format and that
is the DC ES 2.0 format and that
generates a separate file for each of
the spot colors so I will show you how
to do that go to file save as and then
with the format here we're gonna go to
Photoshop DC
2.0 and it turns out to be a BPS file
and then you just click on save and
you're good make sure you have your spot
colors checked right here
so that's how you save it and that's all
you need to know about the multi-channel
color mode pretty much it's just like
right before you want a print you just
click on that and you set everything up
and that's how you set it up for
printing most of the time you might not
use it but when you do you'll probably
be using it to set up things for
printing obviously probably said that a
million times in this but that's okay
anyways thanks for watching the tutorial
and be sure to check out more tutorials
coming up have a good one everyone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
