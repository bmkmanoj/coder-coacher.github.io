and welcome to your second physics
tutorial now before everything is
started in this tutorial telling you
guys what I'm even gonna be teaching I
wanted to say this I have a new
microphone that I'm using in this
tutorial so go back and listen to my
last tutorial then listen to this one
and whatever you guys vote is the better
microphone is the one I'm going to be
using for the rest of my tutorial so
it's up to you guys to decide on my
future of what microphone you guys want
to listen to and what microphone I'm
going to use so that being said I want
to talk to you guys about some
alternative or basically different
variations of ways we can write
scientific notation now the reason I
need to teach you guys about these
different ways we can write scientific
notation it's kind of a stupid reason
but I'm going to try to explain it you
know back in high school or maybe you're
in high school now different teachers
have different requirements for like
writing a paper your English teacher
might be like alright make sure you
write this paper in cursive and your
computer teacher is like alright make
sure you type this paper out on the
computer and another teacher is going to
be like alright make sure you you know
just use basic handwriting when the
truth is it's like dude come on does it
really matter how I write my paper you
can read it any way I write it so why
are you giving me these stupid rules
well that's kind of what I have to teach
you now different scientists and
different teachers depending you know
how they grew up what country they lived
in how they practice physics they are so
anal about writing scientific notation a
different way than you probably learn so
I'm going to be teaching all these weird
little variations and then no matter
what textbook you read no matter what
tutorial you're watching you're going to
be able to understand what all these
little weird symbols me so the very
first thing I want to teach you guys
about is something called an alternative
form now all this means is some
scientists are so anal where they make
sure the number to the left of the
decimal point
is zero so you know how we had numbers
like 1 let me go ahead and switch to the
right layer we had numbers like 5.2
six times 10 to the fourth where they
certain all right here's the decimal
point right here and this number is not
a zero so that is invalid so what they
would do is they put a big old align
through this and say wrong
so what alternative form is is it's
basically saying I write the number to
the left always has to be zero so you'd
have something 0.36 two times 10 to the
fourth that's good
zero point eight six one times 10 to the
negative fifth that's good so basically
all you have to remember whenever your
teacher says make sure you're writing in
alternative form make sure that this
number is always zero and that's it
that's good to go so the next thing I
want to talk to you guys about is the
multiplication symbol so in our last
tutorial I wrote scientific notation
like this let me give you guys quick
example yeah that's probably going to
happen two laws so you guys are probably
just going to have to deal with it
five point eight oh five point eight one
times ten to the fourth power and again
as you can see I use the X for
multiplication but some scientists like
I said and some teachers are so anal
they make you write a dot instead of the
multiplication sign so it would look
like this five point eight one times in
your time sign would look like that ten
to the fourth now this thing right here
this way of writing it in this way of
writing it is the exact same way however
some teachers make you write that dot
rather than the X and by the way in my
upcoming tutorials I am never going to
write the dot and I'll tell you why
whenever you have a number written in
scientific notation like five point
eight one times ten to the fourth it can
get really confusing sometimes this
thought in this thought especially if
you don't move it exactly middle and
this one isn't sitting exactly on bottom
right there
so I mean one dot is enough I don't need
to fooling all around my numbers so
that's why I use it X it's a lot easier
than writing a bunch of dots however if
your teachers say use a dot whenever
you're showing your work then that's
what you got to do now aside from that
some other teachers make you use in
asterisks which just throws a whole
nother wrench into your problems so
you'd have something like five point
eight one and then you have to make a
stupid Astrix like that ten to the sixth
power so again it all depends on you
know I needed to go over all these signs
because I didn't want you guys to get
confused whenever you saw an X and dot
and asterisks I didn't want you guys to
think that those are all different
meanings they all mean the exact same
thing it just depends on your preference
and your teacher how stupid they are so
the last thing I want to talk to you
guys about is plain text notation
now what plain text notation is is
basically this scientists long ago back
you know tens and tens of years ago they
wanted to send you know scientific
notation across emails and they wanted
to be able to type it in typewriters
well I don't know if you guys ever use
the computer before but if you try to do
something like this ten to the fifth
there isn't really an easy way you can
type that you need to type a whole bunch
of like combinations to get exponents to
show up whenever you're typing so they
made an easier way to do that and that's
through the use of plain text notation
so plain text notation pretty much means
how can i type scientific notation or
write on a typewriter easily and for
that they used no exponents whatsoever
so I threw a couple examples up here
right now
3.5 86 is example of plain text notation
what this means is 3.58
times 10 to the sixth so it's pretty
much e equals times 10 well you can
obviously see I don't need to explain to
you guys what it means so seven point
zero one for e to the negative eight
pretty much means 7.01 four times ten to
the negative eight so basically that's
what it means so it's basically just a
way of writing scientific notation
that's easily noticeable whenever you're
looking at on a typewriter or email or
calculator something like that and this
down here is just an alternative version
of plain text notation and the reason I
wanted to go over these little care
signs and by the way that's the symbol
above the six on your keyboard the
reason I want to go over that is because
a lot of scientific calculators you use
nowadays they you can't like throw an
exponent and they can't display on their
screen like this so instead what they do
is they type it like this so you see
this a lot whenever you're working with
calculators because again they have the
same problems that computers do it isn't
a really easy form to display exponents
so they need you know a simple plain
text way to display them so that's why
we have plain text exponents aka plain
text notation whatever you want to call
it so now that I go over excuse me now
that I went over all these alternative
variations of scientific notation no
matter what one of these things you see
whether it's plain text notation various
multiplication symbols or alternative
form where you need the zero to the left
the decimal point you I should be able
to understand what these numbers mean
and how to use them and how you can
convert them to you know something that
you feel more current more comfortable
working with so with that being said
thank you guys for watching don't forget
to subscribe and I will see you guys in
the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
