Illustrator cs6 tutorial today we're
gonna learn how to save and edit
selections and by knowing this you can
save yourself a lot of time if you
frequently select the same elements in
the document and if you don't want to
group them together or anything like
that and you don't or you don't want to
merge them or anything like that
then having this selections available to
you saved up is awesome so let's go
ahead and focus on this rectangle which
I made into like a little name tag here
and what I've got is I've got my
rectangle I've got text here and then
another set of text here now I'm gonna
be selecting this and moving it around
all the time and I don't want to have to
go around and select it like this every
single time especially when there's
other objects around that I might
accidentally select as well so what I'm
going to do is I'm going to create a
selection and then save it so go ahead
and create something that you want to
select or just go ahead and select a
couple objects all right I'm gonna
select this badge and I'm going to come
up here to my select menu and I'm going
to go to save selection unless and you
don't want to save it as something that
makes sense
oops I must have caps lock on I'm gonna
say this is name badge hit OK and now I
have that selection saved but where the
heck did it go what would I even do it
doesn't look like anything even happened
well if you go up to the Select menu you
can see that name badge is now down here
at the bottom if I select it
everything's gonna be selected and it
makes it fast and easy to go ahead and
select your object so that's a pretty
handy everything is separate but it also
gets selected all in one so it's pretty
handy now you might want to learn how to
edit your selection in case you mess it
up or named it something stupid or you
just want to get rid of it so it's not
over here on the select menu anymore go
to select and go to edit selection we're
able to select name badge here
and you can only have a few options so
you can delete it or you can rename it
that's basically the only two options
that they give you it would be nice if
they gave you the option to add things
to it or something like that but they
don't end this at its selection so I'm
just gonna go ahead and change it to a
different name so you guys can see okay
and now it's done
there are something else I can also
delete it and now it's gone and I hit OK
and let's see if if I hit ctrl Z if it
comes back it does you're able to undo a
deleted selection if you needed to but
if we look now it's gone so it's not
there anymore it's not going to bother
you especially if you want to just like
delete out the objects there and stuff
like that so that's all that's all there
is really to saving and editing
selections so I'll show you a little
alternative that you can also use go
ahead and make your selection here if we
go to object and we go to group now we
have our selection is grouped if I click
on just like if I click on and say let's
click on this text it's also going to
select everything else with it
automatically that way you don't have to
go up into the Select menu and select it
or have a bunch of selections up there
now why would you use selection over
grouping things up well you can when you
have a safe selection and your project
starts getting huge you start having a
ton of layers you won't have all these
different groups in here so it's pretty
much up to you what you want to do and
it depends dependent on how big your
project is or what you want to do and
that's one of the good things about
illustrator is you there's a couple
different ways to do things like there's
a bunch of different ways to make a
selection there's a bunch of different
ways to save your selections and
things like that so just keep that in
mind so thanks a lot for watching
