this video we're going to start actually
making the project instead of you know
me just talking about it so what I did
is I made the core HTML file again
I just wrote all the basics right now
the shell of it the blueprint I didn't
feel like typing everything when we did
100 times before I also have a CSS file
just like before actually let me show
you how my project set up so here's my
main HTML file and I like to put all my
CSS files in a separate folder so as you
can see instead of just index CSS I put
it in a new CSS directory and another
thing I want to mention is all of the
images like on these images at the
bottom menu these little icon images if
you want to use the same images I'm
using whenever you're following along
with the series then what you can do is
go to my forum and I'll put everything
in a zip folder so you can just download
the entire project all the files and of
course all my images are in the images
folder so if you want to do that then go
ahead if you want to use your own images
feel free to do that too but again all
of our main HTML files are going to be
in the main directory and the CSS files
and images files each have their own
directory or folder as well so now that
we know how it's set up let's go ahead
and actually start coding finally took
us long enough so the first thing I like
to do is before I start typing any real
HTML code I like to set up the CSS file
now this is pretty much the first couple
of things we write our core elements of
our project so the first thing I wanted
to do is I want to apply a margin of
zero and also a padding of zero to all
elements in this little star symbol
means all elements are your entire web
page now why do I want to do this isn't
you know the elements at zero by default
not exactly depending on your browser
and this is one reason why I'm like
heaven
and browsers suck because it makes your
elements displayed differently depending
on you know what browser users using
using interesting but some browsers like
Chrome they apply default padding's or
default margins to certain elements like
unordered lists and not like paragraphs
but like images and stuff like that
so just to make sure that no matter what
browser we're using we're starting with
zero as their default that's what I like
to do so if you don't do this then
you're going to have like random margins
on crap so now that we got that taken
care of browser compatibility let's go
ahead and start working on the
responsive stuff so the first thing I
want to do is I want to set the font
size of the entire body to 100% now I
showed you guys why this is beneficial
pretty much it's something that we can
easily change and um if you don't know
why I'm doing this then go watch this
tutorial on font responsive web font all
we have to do is change this and all of
the font for our entire web site is
going to be able to adjust accordingly
so again I already explained all this I
won't explain again the font family is
just preference I like Arial because I
don't know I just think it's simple and
it looks good on all devices now for the
background um what I'm going to do is
I'm just going to add that tie label URL
just like my main website that is dot ah
images slash dark hardwood JPEG now
remember the reason that we can't just
add images is because right now our CSS
file is right here in the CSS directory
now dot dot means you have to go back
one directory or up a directory and then
we can access the images folder so if we
try to access it right here it's going
to say oh you don't have any images
folder in here so that's why we had that
data and this of course just displays on
the background
also repeat it make sure it tiles so now
the last thing I want to do is for
images remember for a responsive web
design if you add a max width of 100%
what this means is the maximum that they
can be displayed is according to
whatever size they are by default and
this is because if we stretch them
bigger than they are then they're going
to lose quality and we don't want to do
that so again the biggest they can ever
grow is this and they will never lose
any quality that's pretty basic what I'm
trying to say so let's go ahead and save
this already in refresh and check it out
again we don't have any other images
besides the background and we don't have
any font so we can't really see any of
that but the background image it looks
good no matter how far we shrink it or
grow it it tiles perfectly so we've got
that taken care of and what I'm going to
do in the next sorrow is actually start
building this bottom menu right here so
again I'll talk to you guys about all
the pieces of this and it kind of looks
like an Instagram type menu at the
bottom but for mobile users it gives
them a really familiar experience and
it's also really cool and easy to make
so that's what we have to look forward
to and guess we're watching and well
I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
