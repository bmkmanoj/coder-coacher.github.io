now first thing you need to do is of
course install your brake pedal and I
know I didn't show you guys how to
install your brake pedal but the reason
behind that is because a it's really
simple and I just want to concentrate on
the bridge and be whenever I install the
gas pedal I'm going to take you guys how
to do that step by step and I don't want
to have repetitive tutorials so guys
it's really easy and if if you want to
watch it anyway then just go ahead and
skip for it to how to install gas pedal
and you guys are understanding
so anyways grab the master cylinder and
position it where it needs to be hooks
under the brake pedal using two bolts
right here now let me go ahead and grab
my holes and make sure the head of the
bowl is facing towards the driver
because you don't want to have excess
bolts sticking out so go ahead and get
there and you might as well stick your
other one in before you start tightening
this one there you go so now it's nice
and secure and you want to hand tighten
these first
so now we need to install this piece
right here now what this piece does let
me go ahead and take the pin out of here
is it hooks under your brick oh oh right
here and it pushes against your an
opening in your master cylinder these
two openings right here now whenever
that happens pretty much a gate is going
to get released in hydraulic fluid or
brake fluid is going to start flowing to
the calipers now like I said whenever
the brake fluid gets to your calipers
those brake pads are going to pinch your
gifts your rotor and then your tires
going to stop spinning and that is
pretty much how the brake pedal makes
your go-kart stop spinning so in order
to install this go ahead and first stick
these two pieces in here right here hope
you guys can see that now take this
little pin and stick it through the
opening in your brake pedal and then
this piece and then the other opening in
your brake pedal and now you want to
stick the washer on the other side right
like that in this piece as you saw me
take out it actually uses a little pin
to hold it on so this is usually a pain
gun and let's see if I can get in easy
this time there you go
now the only thing you have to do is to
make sure this pin little cotter pin
stays in is open it just like kind of
like spreading your legs open and there
you go now this baby isn't moving
anymore now check this out as soon as
you press on the brake pedal this will
be a foot not my hand obviously but
what's going to happen is that piece is
going to push in the master cylinder and
then it's going to open and let the
brake fluid out stop in your go-kart
so how awesome is that now all you have
to do is hook up the brick helpers and
your brake system will be complete</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
