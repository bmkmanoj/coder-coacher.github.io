I have finally decided to make a video
on video cards and in case you were
wondering video card graphics card vga
graphics adapter they're all the same
thing so if you're worrying about the
terms all those things mean the same
thing and they're probably a lot more
but those are the most common ones so in
case you don't even know what a graphics
card or video card is it's the part of
your computer that allows you to plug
the monitor into your system now there
are 3 different ways that you can plug
your monitor into the system three major
ways you can get an 8gb card AGP you can
get a PCI card or you can have onboard a
video on your motherboard now what
onboard video is is it's pretty much a
video card built right into your
motherboard so you don't have to install
anything extra and there are two
different ways to determine if you have
onboard video or not the first thing you
can do is just get your motherboard and
look at all the ports on it
and if there's a space that you can plug
in your monitor right on your
motherboard without installing anything
else then you have onboard video it
comes already installed it another thing
that you can do is when you're choosing
a motherboard it's going to list all the
specs and if in those specs that says
onboard video included or on the board
video and it says anything but not
included then you have onboard video so
when you're buying a motherboard you
want to keep an eye out for that now if
you're asking are I so do I want to get
a card or do I want onboard video on my
motherboard
well onboard video on your motherboard
is sometimes good but it's not really
good enough for gaming or video editing
or anything like that if you're just
gonna be surfing the internet or doing
something like um sending emails or
spreadsheets then just stick with a on
board video on your motherboard it's a
it's decent for that but if you're going
to do
heavy graphics then how to recommend
getting a video card now to what you
guys have all been waiting for what kind
of video card or what do I even start
looking for when I wanted buy a video
card well the first option you're going
to come across this probably something
called PCI or AGP and these are two
different interfaces or shapes of video
cards that you can plug into your
motherboard AGP stands for accelerated
graphics port and this was the sign to
replace the very old PCI and it's a it
just has greater bandwidth than a
regular PCI port but still even though
it has greater bandwidth than an old PC
port it still isn't that great so again
AGP I would not recommend getting
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
