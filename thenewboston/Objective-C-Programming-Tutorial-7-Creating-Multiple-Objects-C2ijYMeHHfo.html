welcome to your seventh objective-c
tutorial and what I'm going to be
teaching you guys in this tutorial is a
couple things first I'm going to be
teaching you guys how to create multiple
objects from the same class and also a
nice little shortcut whenever we create
our objects that's going to save you a
bunch of time in the future so first of
all let's get the shortcut you see that
whenever we created an object in the
first tutorial we created an object
right here and then we allocated memory
for it and then we initialize that what
you meant get it ready for use but you
can actually do all this in one line and
that's what was going on up here when
you created this pool object so let's go
ahead and instead of in the declaration
line just ending it right there set this
equal to and put two brackets one inside
another and then inside the innermost
bracket per person Alec and as you can
see that takes care of this line right
here so go ahead and delete that and now
on the outermost bracket go ahead and
put in it and this initializes the
object so it's ready for use and that
takes care of this line right here so
that's a nice little shortcut and that's
how I'm going to be creating my objects
from now and in the future so if you
guys see this that's what's going on and
again like I said that's what was going
on up here as well you can split this in
three lines but since you allocate and
initialize objects so often together
that's why they gave you guys this nice
little shorthand to use so now what I
want to talk to you guys about is
creating another object using this same
interface and implementation the cool
thing about creating objects is every
time you want to create a new object say
I want to create a new person named
Sandy you don't have to create a whole
new interface and implementation this
interface and implementation or the
class is pretty much a blueprint for all
objects so anytime you want to create a
new person you pretty much don't have to
type anything new
except the object you want to create so
I know it might sound confusing so let
me just demonstrate go ahead and copy
this because I'm too lazy to type it all
out again and paste it and I'm going to
name my new object sandy because we
already have a guy might as well have a
girl so now we created a new object and
it's called sandy so instead of having
my methods buckey's let's go ahead and
give her a whole new set of methods and
variables so copy this and paste it
right below so go ahead and put sandy
and set her age to 68 and put sandy and
set her wait to see 970 and then go
print it out for her and then release
her memory so let's go ahead and build
this and see if it runs
first of all before I continue succeeded
run console so says here's Bucky object
I'm 23 years old and weigh 350 pounds
and here's the object for sandy I'm 68
years old and away 970 pounds so the
cool thing about this is anytime you
want to create a new object you don't
have to type everything over again you
can just use the same blueprint or
classification that you did in the other
object and another thing I want to point
out is that every time you create an
object it has its own set of variables
so for example sandy has her own age her
and Bucky don't share an age Bucky has
his own weight and that only belongs to
him if you want to give Sandhya wait you
need to call her set weight method so
that's pretty much the basics of how to
create multiple objects or in this case
multiple people using the same using the
same person class so in the next
tutorial I don't know what I'm going to
be talking about but I assure you it's
going to be sweet so thank you guys for
watching don't forget subscribe and I
will see you next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
