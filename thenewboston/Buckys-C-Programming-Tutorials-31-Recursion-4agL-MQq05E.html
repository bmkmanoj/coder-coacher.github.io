welcome to your 31st tutorial and in
this story I'm going to be talking about
something that every single computer
science student on earth just absolutely
hates and that is called recursion now
this is a topic that's somewhat
confusing but I'm going to try to make
it really simple for it you guys so what
recursion is is the idea that a function
can call itself pretty weird huh so you
know how like in main we could call
another function called Bucky and Bucky
would print something out on the screen
well recursion is the idea that Bucky
could call Bucky that's interesting so
let's go ahead and take a look at this
right now
say we had a function called Bucky and
all it did was print something out on
the screen like see out um print out
something stupid oMG WTF vbq oh my god
WTF BBQ and then it went ahead and it
called the function again so now you
would say alright well isn't this
function gonna go ahead and we're going
to run main first and main is going to
say okay go ahead and run Bucky and
Bucky is going to say okay print this
out and then run Bucky okay
Bucky print this out and then run Bucky
again print this out run Bucky print it
out run Bucky and whenever we go ahead
and run it we can see that this is a
function that basically never ends it
prints out oh my god WTF BBQ until check
it out watermelon exe my computer just
crashed and gave up on this so I'm like
alright so what's the point of using
recursive functions other than don't use
them because you know first of all if
you build a recursive function like this
your computer's going to crash just like
- and it's not the most useful way to go
about things so one reason that people
use recursive functions is first of all
let me mention this whenever you build a
truly perfect recursive function you
need to have something called a base
case now a base case is pretty much an
ending point for your function so one
example that I'm going to shown you guys
is how
calculate factorials now if you remember
from math class factorials are pretty
much when you say five factorial and
it's written like this five explanation
point this is pretty much the same same
as saying 5 times 4 times 3 times 2
times 1 um 7 factorial would be 7 times
6 times 5 times 4 times 3 times 2 times
1 whatever factorial it is is just
whatever number times all the way to 1
so then the value of like 5 factorial is
120 the value of 3 factorial is 3 times
2 times 1 which is 6 so let's go ahead
and write a program to do that and this
is one of the instances where recursion
is actually a good idea so let's go
ahead and make a function called we'll
call it factorial final so int first of
all third spell that right int arm
factorial finder I think I spelled that
right and it's going to take a parameter
which is in X can I not spell int today
int X and the parameter it takes is what
value do we want to find the factorial
of so if we passed it in 5 hopefully it
would give us 120 if we pass the N 3 it
would give us 6 so on and so forth so
the first thing we need build is
something called a base case without a
base case this factorial finder would
never end
just like Bucky you know how I ran
forever until my computer crash this is
what this going to do if we don't give a
base case so we need to say okay if X is
indeed equal to 1 then we want to go
ahead and return 1 so whenever you
return something remember your function
ends and that's the point that we're
trying to get to so in order to do this
we're going to assume that they're going
to be passing in numbers other than 1 so
we're going to go ahead and do this else
if they pass in the number aside from 1
like 5 or 3 or 20 or something like that
go ahead and return
the value of x which is you know 5 320
and then go ahead and multiply that by
factorial finder X minus 1 so what it's
going to do is yeah it's going to call
the same function again but it's going
to call it with a different value it's
going to call it with 1 less than before
so if you go ahead and you pass in 5 to
this function what it's going to do is
say all right I'm going to call 5 times
the 4 factorial or factorial 4 I don't
even know how to say it I'm not in
mathematician but anyways what it's
going to do is going to say this I'm
going to call 5 factorial 4 well what's
the value of that I don't know the value
of that is 4 factorial 3 what's the
value of that I don't know 3 factorial 2
what's the value of that I don't know 2
factorial 1 what's the value of that I
don't know oh wait I do know 1 factorial
is 1 so now that it has that bit of
information it can go ahead and solve
the rest of the questions that it asks
you know how I said I don't know I don't
know well now it can say all right Bucky
1 factorial is 1 so now I know that 2
factorial is 2 3 factorial 6 4 factorial
is 24 and 5 factorial is 120 so that way
you can see that whenever we go ahead
and run this on factorial finer there we
go I didn't feel like printing out the
whole thing
that way when you print out factorial
505 and let me just go ahead and end
that line and we run this program it
says 120 yeah it was 120 but there is a
lot of stuff going on behind the scenes
that the user didn't have to see what it
did is said all right it ran this
function like 5 different times
searching for 5 factorial and then it
caught it again searching for 4
factorial then did again searching for 3
2 and finally when it got to 1
it could answer all the rest of those
questions so this is how you can use
recursive functions in a useful way
again our recursive function is just
using the function inside the function
body itself
whenever you do this you need to have a
base case you need to have an ending
point that actually answers that
question so in this case whenever they
got to one it could solve the rest of it
could of its questions because if we
didn't have that base case like before
when we printed out oMG WTF BBQ it would
just run forever and ever and ever
without an end so that's why you need to
give it a base case in other words a
point to get to where if it solves that
question then all the rest of the
questions can be solved so again you
guys can probably see why people hate
recursive functions but why sometimes
you actually need it because there's a
lot of stuff going on behind the scenes
that we don't get look at but we just
have to you know assume in theory that
this is going to work so it's a little
bit different than regular programming
in the fact that you don't explicitly
call a function like this that a
function is going to call a function for
you however many times it needs to so
there's a lot of theoretical programming
that you need to think of and a lot of
different things that can go wrong with
recursive functions so that's why I
wanted to you know show you guys a quick
example of the bad way to use recursive
functions in the useful way to use
recursive functions but now that I tell
you guys at soryo we can finally you
know get over cursor functions I you
will be happy to know that I don't use
recursive functions a lot in programming
and we're probably going to be you know
done dealing with them for a while but
you know it was a topic that we
definitely couldn't skip and now they
watch this tutorial I'm glad I taught it
to you guys so thank you guys for
watching don't forget to subscribe and
don't forget to put a base case in your
recursive functions or else your guys's
computer is going to crash so thank you
guys don't forget subscribe and I'll see
you next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
