we're gonna use the same kind of idea to
multiply polynomials so it's not exactly
foiling because when we multiply
polynomials they're bigger than binomial
so you can't multiply them in the exact
same way but the same principle applies
we're gonna take the first term and
distribute it to every term in the
second polynomial and then take the
second term and do the same thing so
that each term is multiplied out so
we're going to take s times s squared
plus s times negative s plus s times 3
plus negative 2 times s squared plus
negative 2 times negative s and negative
2 times 3 so now we just multiply each
individual term so s times s squared is
as cubed plus s times negative s
negative s squared plus 3 s minus 2
squared negative times a negative is a
positive to us plus negative 2 times
that's just positive 3 so it'll be
positive 6 so we can combine like terms
but I want you to notice that right here
we have a
variable at least to the third power
because when you have a binomial times a
polynomial or polynomial times a
polynomial it has to have a power of at
least three or higher so if you for
whatever reason don't have a higher
power you didn't do your multiplying
right so you want to check that before
you get too far with a problem so now
we're gonna combine these like terms so
s cubed plus negative s squared minus 2
s squared is negative 3 s squared and
then 3 s time plus 2 s is 5 s and then
we just have a plus 6 at the end ok
so we're only gonna do a couple more
examples because once you understand how
to multiply binomials it's really easy
to pick up on multiplying track or
polynomials so remember we're gonna take
this first term and multiply it by each
one of these terms so 2x times x squared
plus 2x times X plus 2x times 3 plus
negative 1 times x squared plus negative
1 times X plus negative 1 times 3 now
right now I'm writing out each term just
to show you what it looks like and to
help you get in the practice of doing it
but pretty soon these will become really
easy for you and you won't have to write
as much of your work out but when you're
learning it's really good to start by
showing all your work so 2x times x
squared is 2x cubed plus 2x times X 2x
squared
plus 2 x times 3 6 X plus negative 1
times x squared so negative x squared
plus negative 1 times X minus X plus
negative 1 times 3 negative 3 we can
combine I like terms I boxed in the
wrong one that one okay so to excuse the
same we have a positive 2x squared and a
negative x squared so are you going to
get a positive x squared 6x and negative
x gives us positive 5x and then we just
have a negative 3 hanging around so this
is gonna be our last example so x
squared times 2x squared plus x squared
times 3x plus x squared times 5 plus
negative 3 times 2x squared plus
negative 3 times 3x plus negative 3
times 5 so we're gonna do the same thing
and multiply each one of these terms x
squared times 2x squared is going to get
4 and remember it's X to the fourth
because when we multiply exponents you
add them together so we're gonna have
negative 3x times x squared negative 3x
cubed plus 5x squared minus 3 times 2 is
6x squared minus 3 times 3 is 9x minus 3
times negative 3 times 5 15 so see how
in this one we have a power of 4 because
we had a binomial x a trinomial but this
binomial had a
exponent of two so now we're gonna
combine these like terms so the 4x is
gonna stay the same the 3 the negative
3x cubed is gonna stay the same but
right here we have positive 5x and a
negative 6 so it's gonna give us a
negative 1 x squared minus 9x minus 15
so like I said this is our last example
so that's all we're doing with
multiplying polynomials today but make
sure you come back for our next lesson
we're going to talk about special
products that are made by certain types
of binomial multiplication so make sure
you come back and check that out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
