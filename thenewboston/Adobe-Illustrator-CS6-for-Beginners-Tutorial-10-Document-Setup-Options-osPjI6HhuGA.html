illustration cs6 tutorial today we're
going to be going over something that
you probably don't even know about which
is called the document options or the
document setup and after you create a
document you can use the document setup
it's in the file menu there to change
your documents default options and you
might not have known that it has options
but there's things that you can change
in there like the language the type of
quotes that you're using you can fix the
bleed if you need to and things like
that so you can always go in and fix up
stuff even after you have created a new
document and set everything already so
let's go ahead and get this going on
let's go to file up here in the menu bar
and then we're gonna go to document
setup here we go and you don't need to
do this every time but if you learn
what's in here you can realize that you
need to use it or not depending on what
you're doing so we're going to start out
here with our bleed and view options if
you click on edit artboards it's going
to close this dialog box
and it's going to use the artboard tools
to edit artboards so if I click on that
now I've got my artboard tool where I
can fix my edit my artboards are at a
new one or whatever so let me go back to
what I was at before there we go and
we've got our units now now it's going
to specify the measurement units for
there for the document so we gonna use
points pikas inches millimeters
centimeters or pixels up to you we've
got our bleed here and that's the amount
of bleed around the edges of the
document so if you have 0 then it's
going to go right to the edge we've got
a couple boxes here that you can check
show images in outline mode is going to
do exactly what it says highlight
substituted fonts and it's gonna be able
to
if you select this you're gonna be able
to highlight unavailable fonts that are
substituted for existing fonts on your
computer and then we've got highlight
substitute glyphs and that's basically
the same thing except for exchange the
word font for glyphs alright let's go
down here into the transparency here
we've got a grid size small medium or
large
and if you look on the right you can see
the different grid size
so usually you stick with medium but I
mean it really doesn't matter grid
colors you can change the colors of the
grid dark ever custom you can change
them to blue if you want or purple or if
you want to you've got a little thing
going on here let me go back to light we
got a little checkbox going on here
called simulate colored paper and if you
plan to print on colored paper and then
you're gonna want to check this so I
check that then I'll be able to it kind
of like replicates the effect of colored
paper
alright then we've got some presets here
you can specify the resolution for your
preset under this box our drop-down menu
or you can go to custom I click custom
and I've got some more options here and
just uh I'm not gonna go over these
because I don't need to right now it's
uh let's go to our type options and
we've got use typographers quotes and
you use this if it's checked just to use
curly quotes instead of straight quotes
so that's what that means
then our language we've got double
quotes here and then our single quotes
or you can change them up which is
pretty cool
we've got our size and this is the size
of position of the supersuit script the
subscript and then our small caps so
those are different types of fonts and
we've got our export here and this is to
preserve the text so we can easier
either preserve the text edit ability or
the text appearance so edited ability if
you're going to use the option I mean if
you're going to come back some time and
probably fix it but if you think it's
the last thing you'll ever do in this
document you might want to check
preserve text appearance so that's all
that we got going on here with the
document setup so now you understand
this and now you now you know you can
change things around a bit and you don't
have to always stick with what's right
here on your screen and that's one of
the good things about illustrator is you
have a lot of flexibility and you can
fix stuff up and change stuff around if
you really need to so thank you for
watching this one hopefully you guys
learned about document setup and if you
don't if you have never even heard of it
that's great so now you've heard of it
you need to learn something new so
thanks a lot for watching see you guys
later in a next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
