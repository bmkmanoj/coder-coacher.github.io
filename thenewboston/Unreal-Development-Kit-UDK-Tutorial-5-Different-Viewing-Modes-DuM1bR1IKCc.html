fifth UDK tutorial and before we get to
the Toro I want to show you guys this
right here I am moving into a new
apartment my very own apartment next
month so I thought you guys might want
to see some pictures right now I live in
a room and it's like 10 feet by 10 feet
and that smells like tuna and beefs
through all the time so I figured I
might as well get a new place so here it
is for you guys who are interested I
posted some pictures up on my forum and
if you guys I live on the 3rd floor
right there and if you guys are not a
member of my forum I would recommend
that if you have any questions about any
of these tutorials you can ask me there
and I'll be happy to answer for you but
anyways I just had to get that out of
the way
welcome to your fifth you decayed Zorro
and in this tutorial we're gonna be
talking more about these options right
here so we left off with this real time
now let's go over this brush wireframe
option right here the brush wireframe
option displays your 3d models in
wireframe now what your frame is
basically well the easiest way to
describe it is just to look at it it's
basically all the edges all the vertexes
it's basically a blueprint rather than
this nice lip mode right here so that's
what brush wireframe is now this next
option after this is wireframe now if
you switch on and off you can only see
some subtle differences and the reason
for that is because well the differences
are subtle while your frame and brush
wireframe are very similar they only
differ in what they display for now I'm
not going to be covering that because
that's really when we get into 3d
modeling and you know working with this
stuff over here but for now just
remember that brush wireframe in
wireframe kind of help you display the
blueprint rather than you know the
models themselves so with that being
said let's hop over to this one right
here and this is unlit mode whenever
you're in unlit mode this displays your
textures and materials but not your
lighting whenever you're making levels
and 3d models you need to make 3d models
and then you
apply textures and materials to it and
you also need to add lights to your word
they'll show what part of your you know
castle you want lit up what how you want
your lights to display in your 3d world
basically this basically shows
everything with a constant light no
shadows or anything like that so
remember unlit mode what we're working
with right now just shows textures and
materials but no lighting if we want to
show the lighting then we need to hop
over to this mode this is your nice
pretty lit mode and check it out we have
bright spots and shadows pretty much
your map with lighting in it that's why
they named it lit mode because it's
pretty lighting shadows it's basically
how ever you see it in lit mode is how
it would look to the player when they
are actually playing your game now we
can go ahead to let's go to detail
lighting lighting only what these two
options are are basically whenever like
I said before in order to make a map we
need to add lighting whenever we want to
concentrate on just the lighting and we
don't want to worry about any of the
textures or materials or anything like
that we can look in one of these modes
these modes allow us to say we want to
work with making sure our shadows appear
properly we probably want to work in one
of these modes again they're either
detail lighting and lighting only mode
this it's pretty much self-explanatory
what these modes are show a constant
material with lighting only now a lot of
these options right here pretty much
take a couple tutorials each to cover
like lighting complexity texture density
shader we don't even know what textures
and shaders are yes so let's go ahead
and skip those lighting without any
Texel density I guess the next thing we
can cover is this game-mode right here
now the game mode I touched on I think
in the second tutorial
it's basically what you would see if you
were playing the game all of these modes
right here they're kind of like the
designer mode but the game mode takes
care of all that wireframe and you know
all this little stuff right here
it makes it
disappear basically if you're the player
playing the game this is what you would
see
now this lock viewport mode right here
is actually let me see I'm see how much
time I got since I you know had to show
you guys those pictures in my apartment
first I'm gonna be covering the rest
these buttons in the next tutorial so
for now I guess that's all you guys get
for now and the next story I promise
we're gonna be finishing up the viewport
toolbar but for now I'm gonna go check
out the pictures in my apartment and I'm
probably gonna go to McDonald's and get
milkshake so you watch this story again
and once you have perfected all the
different modes you're ready to move on
to my next video so thank you guys for
watching don't forget sign up for my
forum and I'll see you guys in my next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
