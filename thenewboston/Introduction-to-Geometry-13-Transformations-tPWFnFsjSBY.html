and when we take an object or like like
a triangular square and we move it some
way we want to be able to describe how
we moved it so there's three basic
movements of transformations so first is
the translation and it's more commonly
known as the slide where we just take
this is triangle a and this is still
triangle a it's the same triangle we
just took it and moved it over and up so
if we were to describe this
transformation we said we translated it
Layton triangle a over right and up so
the second kind of transformation is
called a rotation where we have this
arrow and we just rotated it 1/4 of the
way to the right or 1/4 clockwise so we
there's if it if we had done it a full
rotation it would have been
down here we could have translated it or
excuse me we could have rotated it 3/4
of the way and it'd be here or we could
have done a complete rotation and it'd
be right back here so the last kind of
transformation is called a reflection
where we reflected this shape over this
line right here this is just gonna be
called our reflection line and we
reflected it over here to the right just
like a mirror when you look into a
mirror it reflects your image back on
you
that's why wouldn't you move one way it
looks like you're moving the other way
in a mirror so let's do some practice
with these transformations and we're
just gonna describe them so I had the
letter F right here and now I have it
like this so if we were to describe that
we would say that it is a reflection
because it was literally flipped over to
look like that I was talking about this
one well I have this letter and now it
looks like this well it's not a
translation because if it was just a
translation it would look like that it's
not a reflection because a reflection
would look like that so it has to be a
rotation and it was rotated
once twice so we can say that this is a
half clockwise rotation it was because
it was rotated twice until it got
upside-down this next one we have this
one and this one was our original one
and this is our new one so this was just
translated so we have this and this is
we're just going to call this point a so
point a is here on this hexagon as well
so because a is in the same place on
both of them we know that it was moved
right and then down so translated right
and down so those are the basic
transformations and they're gonna help
us out later when we look at triangles
and try to compare them to one another
so make sure you come back for our next
video where we talk about the parts of
congruent triangles and proving them to
be congruent</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
