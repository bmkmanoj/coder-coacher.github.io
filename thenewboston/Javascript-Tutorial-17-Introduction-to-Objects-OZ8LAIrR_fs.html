story Oh in JavaScript and this is
tutorial on will be talking guys about
objects which is a very important part
of a lot of programming languages and
especially JavaScript now if you never
worked with objects before I'm gonna
give you guys a quick introduction in a
JavaScript is one of the many languages
that you can actually build your own
objects now what object is we'll kind of
learn as we're going along but objects
have two main components to them and
those are properties and methods and
properties are any value of the object
so let me go ahead and begin showing you
guys what this means just type a
variable and we'll name it word move my
cursor out of the way so you can see and
it's actually going to be two words and
I'm gonna type hello Bob and just said
this is just a common string variable
and in the next I'm gonna write document
right
and I'm gonna have a property that shows
us what the length of the object is or
the variable so to do that I'm gonna
type word since that was our variable
and this is just a built-in feature of
JavaScript and then I'm gonna type
length and as you can see when I do this
we have our variable word right here and
we want to tell JavaScript take the
variable word and write which just means
I'll put on the screen how many
characters are it it it is so let's save
it refresh and as you can see it says
nine
so let's go back to here and as you can
see one two three four five and the
space counts as one six seven eight nine
so that's why javascript does that and
this is an example of a property of an
object one of the properties is a length
and this is just built in but let's say
well let's learn about methods now and
Method is an action that you can do to
an object in this case being the
variable word so let's say instead of
length get rid of that we want to do a
method we want to change this somehow
what we do is after the period in word
let's write to upper case
and add an empty parameter and I I'll
tell you about that later but for now
we're just gonna leave it empty and what
this is gonna say is tell JavaScript
right on the screen the variable word
which has the value hello Bob and change
it to uppercase so let's save this and
refresh it as you can see it changed
hello Bob to uppercase and this is an
example of a method of JavaScript and
remember just a recap real quick
properties give you the value as in the
length which was nine and method what
should we just made right here changes
this in somehow and we just change the
topic case and there are many many
built-in features a JavaScript and we
can even make our own which we'll be
learning soon but study this tutorial
know the difference between properties
and methods and please go to my website
