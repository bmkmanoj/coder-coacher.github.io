Robertson welcome to your very first
tutorial in the Ruby programming
language now in these video tutorials
what I'm going to be doing is teaching
you guys all about the Ruby programming
code but before we start jumping into
messin with the code the very first
thing we need to do is actually install
Ruby on our computer so I am running a
Windows machine and one of the cool
things about Ruby is you can practice
Ruby on a Mac or Linux or Windows now
the installation process is a little bit
different for each but I'm gonna guess
most of you guys watching these videos
have Windows so I'm going to show you
guys how to install it on a Windows
machine but just keep in mind that the
installation process is different for a
Mac than it is Linux than it is Windows
so everyone on Windows in order to
install Ruby this is what you do go to
the website Ruby installer org now my
guess is that the website is going to
look a little bit different depending on
when you're watching this video but
nonetheless go to the section where you
download the real B installer and just
go ahead and hit the button now there
going to be a bunch of different Ruby
installers just go ahead and choose the
most recent version unless it's in beta
or something like that now just go ahead
and click it whenever you do it's going
to download an executable file this is
the file that you need to run on your
computer in order to of course install
Ruby now go ahead and double click this
and if you're running Google Chrome you
can just go ahead and click the file on
the bottom but once you double click
this executable file it's going to say
are you sure you want to run this file
well yes computer of course that's why
we just clicked it so run and of course
make sure speedy through all these this
is okay go ahead next does anyone really
read those things anyways not me so one
of the things that we need to take note
of is we have a bunch of optional check
boxes here now whenever we have optional
check boxes make sure you select them
all because hey we want the full package
here I'll explain to you guys whenever
we're working with a Ruby what all these
things mean but for now just make sure
you have all
these checkboxes checked the default
area is probably the best area to choose
and go ahead and hit install now it's a
really small file so it's not going to
be long to download and it's not going
to take too long to install so once it
does is going to give you a little
message that says okay ruby is now
installed on your computer
awesome so just go ahead and hit finish
now it says it's installed but as it
really wasn't lying to us in order to
verify that it was installed go ahead to
your Start menu and choose all programs
and now scroll down and hopefully you
have a forwarder called Ruby something
so go ahead and click this and choose
the program that says interactive Ruby
this is where we're going to be doing a
lot of our learning Ruby so basically
I'll explain interactive Ruby a little
bit more in depth later on but it pretty
much turns code that we write into code
the computer can run immediately
basically something that we can
understand into code that the computer
can understand so I'll show you guys how
to I'll give you guys a little tour in
the next video but just so we can play
around with it just so we can say we
type some code in this tutorial go ahead
and give it a simple math problem like 2
plus um 10 or something like that now go
ahead and hit enter and it should give
you your answer of 12 if you can run any
command any math problem and it gives
you the answer then you're good to go
so that is all I'm going to give you
guys for this tutorial again make sure
you have Ruby installed if you have any
questions you can just go ahead on my
forum T&amp;amp;B forum calm and ask me then and
we can go ahead and troubleshoot it for
you
but anyways in the next lesson what I'm
going to be doing is talking to you guys
about what all these numbers mean right
here and we're going to be start coding
in Ruby so that's what you have to look
forward to thank you guys for watching
don't forget to subscribe and I'll see
you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
