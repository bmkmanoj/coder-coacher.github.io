studio' tutorial and in this video what
I'm going to be doing is I'm going to be
teaching you guys how to add your own
custom notes and by that I mean we're no
longer limited to just the sounds that
came with the software we can make our
own custom notes just like we would on
an instrument so with that being said
before I do that I just want to teach
you guys one quick thing and that's how
to replace um songs or excuse me
how to replace sounds in your pattern so
basically say that you got this pattern
created and you're playing it rock me
baby rock me baby alright so it sounds
pretty good but then you decide you know
what rock me baby sounds a little bit
creepy
so I want to change that to a new vocal
but I don't want to change the pattern I
want it to play once I want it to play
in the same exact spot is there a way
that I can just replace this without
having to reprogram the entire pattern
again and the answer is yes so the
easiest way to do this and we'll say
that we're just going to replace the
vocal in this pattern keep things simple
is go to a new vocal and scroll down to
we need a beat and we push it spin it
again what time is it all right I'll go
with we need to be 1 we need a beat so
now what we can do is we can actually
grab the beat and drag it up to the
pattern now if I dropped it right here
then it's going to make a completely new
blank Channel but I want to replace it
right here so hover over it and you know
when you're hovered over it because it
turns orange and just go ahead and drop
so now if we play it we need a beat we
need a beat and how awesome is that you
don't have to reprogram anything and
that is a very simple way of how you can
change pretty much the sound on the same
channel so we'll go ahead and keep that
we need to be I would like to introduce
alright that was pretty dumb go back to
pattern 1 so now as promised now I'm
going to be teaching you guys how to add
your own custom pretty much your own
custom notes or own custom sounds not
from here so let's go ahead and open up
an instrument and we do that by going up
to channel add one
and there's a bunch of different options
here but one of the most common ones is
3x us and this basically means 3 times
oscillator or you're pretty much
creating your own custom sound wave
server very basic note so let me go
ahead and drag this over there so it's a
little bit easier and as you notice
whenever you do this obviously since we
put channel ad 1 it adds a new channel
however this channel is our own custom
sound it's not a prebuilt sound so the
first thing that we can do is we notice
that if we click the keyboard we can get
a preview of the default sound alright
pretty simple but now we have to figure
out what all this crap means and it's
actually really simple once I explain it
real quick so the first thing I want to
point out is that what we're doing is
we're pretty much creating an own custom
sound wave now this right here is
actually built up of three different
sound waves to give us our final sound
oscillator one oscillator 2 in
oscillator 3 and when I say oscillator I
pretty much mean sound wave one sound
wave 2 and sound wave 3 now each of
these sound waves is one octave under
the other so oscillator 1 is this your
default one and oscillator 2 1 octave
under or lower should I say not so here
3 another octave lower so right now this
entire sound is made up of three
different waves so the first thing I
want to show you guys is all of these
buttons right here so basically the
different shapes of waves make different
kinds of sounds hold on a second I don't
know if I alright just I didn't know if
I'm s on my screen recorder but anyways
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
actually mute every oscillator except
one so I can talk to you guys about
these different waves so right now
oscillator 2 has 50% volume so if you go
ahead and hover over this and drag down
you're going to turn that all the way
down to 0 and also hover over this and
drag it down so now whenever we
playing this note we can only hear the
first sound wave and this is just
demonstrate these different shapes of
waves so now by default we got this you
know kind of curvy one this one right
here all right sounds like a computer
game all right that sounds horrible and
this is just a random wave which should
produce static so I'm going to stick
with the default one and typically you
want something like this and another
side note before I get to you know in
depth with the tutorial you know how I
want to test out these different waves
so I clicked one and then I had to move
my mouse here but to play it click this
play it well instead of moving your
mouse all the way back and forth what
you can do is you can actually just play
the notes on your keyboard and in order
to do that go up to this button right
here and you see whenever you hover over
it it says typing keyboard on piano
keyboard which pretty much means um
whenever you press a button on your
keyboard and I mean the one that you
just type on to you know look at the
look at websites incorrect press uh
let's say press the button Z on your
keyboard so here's my mouse right here
and I pressing Z and as you go from left
to right Z X C V B and so on and so
forth so actually if we press it's
actually the less than button with a
comma under it that's going to give us
our c v so again make sure this is
selected and then you can now use your
keyboard instead of your clicking it
with mouse and you know it'll save you a
little bit of time but you know our time
is valuable so whatever all right now I
want to talk to you guys about the rest
of this crap real quick and actually
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
talk to you guys about the rest of this
crap in the next tutorial
because I don't want this tour would be
like 15 minutes long so anyways thanks
for watching and I'll see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
