tutorial and if you've been following
these stories you know that I've been
gone for like a week and I might be kind
of rusty with C++ but uh I'll get the
hang of it I've actually been planning
something and I'm not going to tell you
guys what it is but I will say that is
awesome and it's going to happen in
about a month
so that's Sarah a little teaser so now
it's good back into C++ let me get my
head straight
actually just open this program so I
think what I was supposed to teach next
was about protected because that's
what's looking like so I think in the
less story I just covered basic
inheritance I probably should have you
know watched that video watch the last
video before I started doing this one
but who has time for that so let's go
ahead and talked about what protected
member is you know whenever I first made
a class like this mother class right
here automatically it's stuck in public
protected and private those three
variables or mean those three code words
and you're supposed to put all your
functions and variables in there and I
usually just deleted private or
protected and I'm like don't worry about
that we'll worry about this later well
now is the time to worry about it so
let's go ahead and in our mother class
just throw in those keywords again so
public we already know what this does
let's go ahead and make a variable for
each one so we already know what public
means um anywhere inside this class has
access to this stuff and also outside
this class can also access this stuff
whenever you write something in public
it pretty much means anywhere in the
program you can access this crap
so we'll just name it public v4 public
variable so now let's go ahead and talk
about protected well before we talk
about protected let's talk about private
because I mean might as well get out of
the way the things you know already we
all do you know that whenever we make
something like a private variable that
this means that only inside this class
has access to this variable for example
if we want to go in another class or in
this main.cpp class this class would not
have access to these private variables
and that's why we need to build methods
inside this class that are public to
access those private variables so
basically what we know so far whenever
we make something public any other file
has access to it whenever we make
something private only this file or only
this class has access to it so saying
all right this is a this is B so what
the heck is this one is kind of like
sitting in the middle is it like
combination of both well yes it is
listen very closely
whenever you make something protected
here is what it means anything inside
the class has access to it just like
public and just like private any friend
has an access to it and remember we
talked about friends earlier pretty much
just saw out things outside the class
that has access to stuff inside your
class and also your base classes
remember a derived class inherits from
the base class right so any class that
is inheriting from this class has access
to it so if we were to make a private
variable in this mother class and then
the daughter class inherited everything
from mother well it wouldn't inherit the
private variables these private
variables are still private to mother
even though daughter inherited from
mother daughter does not get these
private variables daughter would in fact
get public and protected so it would
inherit these two but not private so
that way you can kind of see it's a mix
between public and private um it doesn't
let anything inherit it like public and
it doesn't just stay in this class like
private it's kind of like it in between
so I'll go ahead and make a protected
variable
protected V and I'll go ahead and show
you guys an example so let's go ahead
and build a function inside daughter and
we'll just name this go ahead and make a
public function of course public and
we'll just name it like do something
nice about that right and close enough
so now let's go ahead and build this
method right here and I keep thinking
like I'm forgetting something but I
guess it's just because I haven't
programmed in a while
so let's go ahead and put void daughter
hopefully I'm doing this right all right
and what was that oh do something and
got it right there for me how nice so
now we'll just go ahead and do this Oh
actually I might as well do this one at
a time
this will probably show it to you very
clearly so let's go ahead and before we
even start coding this function right
here let's go ahead and build a daughter
object so daughter I think her name
should be Tina that seems appropriate
for this tutorial and Tina dots do
something right like that
so now hopefully when you run this
nothing happens because nothing's in
this function right now so let's go
ahead and see just whether you have any
errors right now nothing happens good so
let's go ahead and do this let's say we
want to access that public variable and
which is like set equal to a number or
something we just want to try and access
it so let's go ahead and try to access
that public variable and do something to
like set equal to one or something
stupid well we go ahead and run this and
no errors so we know whenever we do that
that we do indeed have access to the
public variable and just a reminder this
daughter class is inheriting everything
from this mother class and that includes
a public variable a protected variable
and a private variable now we already
know that daughter can access that
public variable in this line of code
right here so now let's try and step it
up a notch now let's go ahead and try to
access that protected variable
protected V right there well if we go
ahead and try and set this equal to you
know two or something like that and we
build and run it it works perfectly so
therefore we can see that that excuse me
the derived class can indeed access the
protected members of the base class and
remember mother is the base class
daughter is the derived class whatever
does the inheriting aka the daughter is
the derived class the core class that
has the crop we want to inherit from
that's called the base class so now we
know that we can indeed access public
and protected members from the base
class now let's go ahead and do
something that we know we're not allowed
to do and try to access a private
variable and let's go ahead and try to
set this equal to three and now we'll go
ahead and try and build and run this and
it says I'm Bucky I don't think so you
know the rules you are not allowed to
inherit private members so that's why
we're getting an error
whenever we try to inherit for a private
variable so the concept behind this
story is not to build a stupid program
that does nothing but it's this whenever
you're inheriting from a class you can
inherit all the public stuff you can
inherit all the protected stuff but you
cannot inherit the private stuff so
remember whenever you have a base class
you're going to give this crap and
you're going to give this crap but on
you ank in this class biatch
I met a crap that's embarrassing but I'm
not going to redo the Storrow just
because I mess up that one sentence okay
got it all right so let's um you know
that's enough of me talking for this
story I think that's a I think you guys
understand the concept by now basically
at the heart of the story you can
inherit everything except private
variables I couldn't make this tutorial
real short but I didn't so thank you
guys for watching I don't forget to
subscribe and by the way if you guys
want a nice organized playlist um I did
I don't really like doing them on
YouTube because it's not really easy to
organize that way but if you go to my
website I have all my videos laid out
can watch one right after the other from
clicking a button everything is nice
laid out in a nice playlist for you guys
so thank you guys for watching don't
forget subscribe and I'll see you guys
in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
