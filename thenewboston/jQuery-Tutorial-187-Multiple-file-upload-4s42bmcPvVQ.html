with a video tutorial for the new Boston
in this video we're going to be creating
a multiple upload form we're not going
to be handling the file upload in the
background for example in PHP however
what we are going to be doing is
creating something like this now you'll
notice that when we come on to the page
we just have a an input type of file
where we can choose a particular file
that we want to upload to a server we
then have an upload button which
processes this just to quickly note
beforehand i've changed the form action
to get as opposed to post and this is
just to demonstrate in the URL the files
that are sent with this now we also have
an add more button and what this does is
it adds different or adds an additional
form or file field to our page so what
we can do is we can add as many fill
form as many file input types as we want
we can go ahead and select particular
files here for example I'm selecting
three different files from the use of
pressing add more when I go to upload
you can see that all these files have
their own ID for example or their own
name file one was Berlin JPEG file two
is tartan JPEG and far through viz index
dot PHP so you could then submit the
form at the moment this just comes back
to the to the main page but obviously
you could go ahead and submit it to a
PHP file or however you choose to
process files so this is a really useful
tool to be able to allow your users to
add as many files as they want to
actually upload so we're going to be
going ahead and looking at the code
behind this it's extremely easily but
the first thing we're going to do is
jump over to our text editor and set up
our initial form okay so we're over to
our text editor let's go ahead and start
setting up this form and see what we
need to put in and what we don't need to
put in I'm going to go ahead and set up
the form action to be get so you can see
what's going on in the URL bar usually
this would be post if you're actually
sending files
but for testing purposes we're going to
change this to get the method sorry the
action is not get the action is hash the
method which I was just talking about
would be get and we also have this ink
type that you would you would usually
cember the form which is multi-part
slash form data so I'll go ahead and put
that in even though it's not relevant to
the tutorial now we need to we can what
we can do is we can put the initial form
field in here so the initial file input
in here and I'm going to do that in
paragraph tags so we can go ahead and
put input type of file and that's what
we need to do there and then underneath
we can go ahead and I'm just going to
create a block of paragraphs and the
first thing I'm going to write is the
submit button so that's type of submit
and the value of this too can just beat
upload and then below this I'm going to
create a link and that's to add more so
let's go ahead and modify that so this
will be add more and this the link here
will be or the HR f will be hash now we
need to go ahead and give this an ID and
I'm just going to call this ad
underscore more so let's go over to our
browser and preview what we've done
we've essentially just set up a normal
form that you probably would do when
uploading a file but we've added this
add more link which will add additional
form field with these new names you'll
notice that you'll need to dynamically
generate the new file name for example
over here with the type of file the
initial name would be file 1 then as we
add more form fields we're going to want
these to be called let's just go and
give you an example we want these to be
called file 2 and then we might want
them to go ahead and the next one what
we will want it to be called file 3 so
we're going to need a way to work out
how many files are currently you know on
how many you know file input types are
on the page at the current time and we
can do that easily with jQuery selectors
and using the length function okay so
now that we've set up our initial form
let's go ahead and look at the actual
jQuery code associated with this I'm
going to actually give this form an ID
and I'm just going to call this file
upload for now so what essentially what
we want to do is when this add more link
is clicked we want to go ahead and
prepend
another file input type on top of this
one so it'll always appear at the top
and this will be prepend it to the file
upload form so nothing's changed in the
design I've just given them IDs so we
can reference them now we have this ext
J's file which we're going to be working
in we're not going to write anything
else in this file that's exactly how we
need it and we can handle the rest in
jQuery using our selectors event
handlers etc so inside ext is we want to
go ahead and first of all wait till the
document is ready and we'll go ahead and
outline our function in here bring these
down and we can start to write our code
so the first thing we want to do is go
ahead and ensure that we supply an event
handler for the add more link remember
we created this add more link here and
that had the idea of add more so what we
will want to do is select add more and
apply the click handler to this so every
time the link is clicked the function
inside here executes and we can again go
and bring that down so now we need to
retrieve the amount of form fields that
are currently on the page or sorry the
amount of file fields that are that are
currently on the page so I'm going to go
ahead and save our current file or
current count would be more appropriate
I think and we want to go ahead and use
a jQuery selector to select all the file
types on the page you can go ahead and
make this with all the form fields
inside of this form but I'll leave that
out in this tutorial so if you want to
go ahead and do that in your own time
you can do however if you just had this
form field on a page it wouldn't it
would
matter</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
