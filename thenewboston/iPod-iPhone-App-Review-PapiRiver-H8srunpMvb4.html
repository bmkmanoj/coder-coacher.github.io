another app review and this app is
actually an app that one of my
subscribers name winscombe 123 told me
about and it's called poppy river and
this guy must hate me or something
because this app is I mean it's not the
greatest app actually it's pretty
terrible but I'm going to go ahead and
review it anyways the goal of this is
pretty much move your Pepe which is
pretty much a floating head down the
river without running into the bank and
what you do is if you run into the bank
it souls them down and once he reaches
the top of screen mg once you reach the
top the screen right there it says game
over so that's pretty much all there is
to it and a look at the other games
action potato poppy jump plus poppy gem
cave I mean anything with the name copy
in front of it probably isn't the best
game to get me your iPod so let's go
ahead and don't submit the score and
just play it again and like I said the
things the problems I have with this
game first of all the it's not
entertaining at all no offense whoever
made this but it's just not the graphics
are not that great as you can see it's
just pretty much ahead pretty much I can
make this in Photoshop in like two
seconds and lastly it isn't complex at
all it's just the same thing repeating
itself just move your head down the
river not that entertaining so I mean if
you're in the bathroom if you have
nothing else to do then I guess this
would be alright but any other case I
would definitely not recommend getting
it so that's that for this one good
thing about it i suppose is that it's
free but uh that's pretty much it so i'm
going to go ahead and let him to lose
and thank you guys for watching
hopefully this is a siding factor not to
get this and put it on your ipod or
iphone so thank you guys for watching
don't forget subscribe in if you have
any more apps while review then I just
shoot me a message or comment and let me
know so that's that and I'll see you
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
