video in in this video the first thing I
want to do is show you guys how to sync
up to widgets and then we're going to be
talking about layouts so now that we
understand about the connect function
and how you can use it to you know use
signals and slots and remember a signal
it's pretty much an event that the user
does such as click a button and the sois
is a bit of code that you want to run
whenever they do that action so let's go
ahead and remember how to do this cue
object Connect let me just go ahead and
set this up now remember the last couple
tutorials I said that the first and the
third parameter in the connect function
don't really worry about now well now is
the time where we actually do have to
worry about them and it's going to make
sense what they are after I'm done
typing this but I'm not going to talk
you guys through a parameter by
parameters so let me go ahead and type
this entire thing and then I'll go ahead
and talk you guys through it I'll make a
lot more sense that way so spinner
signal and for here just go ahead and
rate value changed int I'd already put
it in for us now for this one just go
ahead and read slider and I know this is
about to run off the screen but for the
slot it's set value int so the first
thing I want to do is make sure that
this appears on the screen like this now
check it out remember that this is
actually one line of code I just saw you
know shifted it down so you guys could
see so what the connect function does
one more time is it waits for a user to
do some event in this case whenever they
change a value on the spinner then we
want the slot to occur which is
basically this is the code that needs to
run whenever they change the value so
what code do we want to run well we want
to set the value on the slider so
basically with the connect function
that's what the four parameters mean
which widget do you want to wait for the
user to do something - well we want of
course we want to wait for them to do
something to the spinner
and the third parameter is whenever we
call this function right here
widget you want to apply it to so this
is the widget that we're waiting for
these are do something to this is what
we're waiting for the users to do and
whenever the user does that this is the
widget that we want to affect and this
is the code that's going to affect it so
in everyday language whenever the user
changes a value on the spinner then go
ahead and set the slider to that value
so now hopefully you guys understand
what all of the parameters mean and what
this does again is whenever the user
changes the spinner
it changes the slider so now we have to
do this exact same thing but in Reverse
so now let's just go ahead and change
spinner for slider and slider spinner so
basically whenever they change the
spinner the slider changes or if they
change a slider the spinner changes
simple enough this is how you connect to
widgets and now they're synced together
perfectly so basically again like I said
this program is going to allow the user
to choose how many chicken wings they
want to eat in one of two ways through
the spinner or the slider and whenever
they change one the other one's going to
change however the very first time that
they open the program we didn't give it
an initial value yet so let's just go
ahead and do that now and this is how
you do that spinner set value and this
is going to set the initial value to ten
so by default we'll just go ahead and
put ten chicken wings of course they can
change that later on so now that we got
all of the widgets synced up the last
thing that we have to do is we have to
create a layout and what a layout does
is it determines the size and position
of the widgets basically makes them it
lays them out pretty on the screen so if
you remembered we're using a qh box
layout now what this stands for is
horizontal box layout pretty much layout
these widgets horizontally from left to
right in a nice pretty fashion so how do
we create this layout well QH box layout
and then just go ahead and give a name
layout and set this equal to
- qh box layout there you go now after
we have this main layout what we want to
do is we want to add all the widgets
that we need to - the layout so layout
the first thing we want to do is add
widget what widget do we want to add
we'll just add the slider one first the
order you add the widgets doesn't really
matter and now after we add the slider
to the layout we also want to add the
spinner widget to the layout
now that our layout includes two widgets
the next thing we need to do is we need
to tell the main window to use this type
of layout so let me go ahead and code
this first main window set layout to
layout so actually let me go ahead and
code the rest of this is only one line
main and then I'll talk you guys through
what exactly I did show alright so you
know that I said that even though
whenever we run our program let me go
ahead and run this real quick first of
all and make sure I don't have any
errors second of all to show you exactly
what does so this is the slider right
here and the initial value if you forgot
it was at 10 so you see how I'm changing
the slider and the spinner is changing
also whenever I change the spinner the
slider changes so there you go our
program works correctly but whatever
what I want to talk about is this layout
right here now of course in order to add
the two widgets we add them just like
this however it's not that simple what
we need to do is we actually need to
take our main widget because remember I
said this main window
there's technically three widgets in
this program even though it looks like
there are two so let me let me go ahead
and show you there's a main widget which
is basically the main window then
there's the slider in the spinner the
slider in the spinner are actually
inside this main window or main widget
so basically what we did is in order to
use that layout we needed to take the
main window which is the main widget and
set the layout equal to layout which
basically means
at the main window to use the layout
horizontal box layout and in order to
show all the widgets we don't need to go
ahead and explicitly show the slider and
the spinner and the main window since
the slider and the spinner are inside
the main window we can just go ahead and
do this and cue already knows behind the
scenes that sense the main window is the
parent show all of the children inside
so I know that this can get kind of
confusing but trust me once you see like
two more examples it's going to be a
piece of cake to you guys so that is
basically how you sync more than one
widget together and also how you use a
simple default layout and that is pretty
much the coding behind it so now they
understand the coding if you want to go
set everything up in the GUI it may be a
little bit easier but for now thank you
guys for watching don't forget to you
know subscribe follow me on twitter
follow me on Google+
send me a bunch of money in the mail uh
you know give me a high five if you see
me on the streets but anyways thanks for
watching and I'll see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
