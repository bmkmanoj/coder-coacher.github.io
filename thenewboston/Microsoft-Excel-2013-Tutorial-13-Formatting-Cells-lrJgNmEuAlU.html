video and in this tutorial I want to
talk to you a little bit more about
formatting cells it's probably going to
be the last video for now about
formatting cells in terms of the overall
look and the styling of it so the very
first thing I want to talk to you guys
about is how to angle your text now
people do this a lot whenever they have
the column names because it gives it
kind of a tabular feeling I don't know I
guess it's just sometimes natural for
some people to look at so go ahead and
select a row right here and up in your
home tab under the alignment section in
the ribbon you're going to see this a B
little weird-looking symbol it kind of
looks crooked go ahead and click that
and whenever you get the drop down list
you're going to see that gives you a
couple different options of how you
either want to stack your text either
vertical or what you can do is you can
also angle it so go ahead and let's
choose angle clockwise right here so by
default it gives you kind of like the
template the basic angle but you can
actually change the actual angle in
terms of how sharp pretty much to the
degrees of how sharp you want your angle
so in order to do that go ahead and
select whatever cells you want to format
right click and choose format cells' fit
that so you can see and actually then
move it over here to say you guys can
see now under the alignment tab this
little thing right here that you guys
may not have known what it did before
this is pretty much allowing you to
change your angle well I was trying to
like say in some kind of stupid way but
that's all it does so by default it's 45
degrees now to me it looks I don't know
a little too steep so I'm going to go
ahead and take this down I don't know
maybe to only like 25 degrees or
something so go ahead and hit OK and as
you can see it changes the angle of that
so that's how you display text settle
however
I really don't like that a lot of people
do I see all the time but you know it's
just not my cup of tea so I'm going to
go ahead and undo that until it's back
to normal so there's actually a lot of
more styling but most of it is really
intuitive and I don't think I need to go
over it because if you work with any
piece of software before I'm guessing
that you already know what a lot of
these buttons do like the font family of
course just changes your font the font
size and you know this is just the
background color of each cell this is
the text color itself so for example if
you wanted your text armed
I don't know green actually let's give
it a nice blue color and let's make it
something like alright that looks pretty
good so a lot of this stuff I'm not
going to cover in detail it's pretty
self-explanatory the one thing that is
specific to excel rather than I don't
know most document programs is this
border option right here so whenever you
click this is going to give you a whole
slew of options pretty much saying for
the cells that you have selected how do
you want the border so since I have this
entire range selected if I choose
something like thick what was that thick
thick box border kind of a tongue
twister
it's going to put a border around that
entire range right there pretty sweet
however I actually don't like that
either so I pretty much like everything
plain so whenever I'm teaching these
like styling tutorials um you know my
personal taste is just to have
everything default I'm not very artsy
I'm like a computer programmer so that's
probably why I anyways let's get back on
track and the last thing I want to talk
to you guys about in this tutorial is
named styles in some default styles so
you probably see this little section
actually I can't even show you because I
actually minimize this so my so it
looked good on video and on my screen
recorder but typically if you go to the
Home tab
and over in the ribbon you go to Styles
you'll see this little section called
cell styles and you may see this right
here if it's in full-screen but like I
said I have Excel minimize so it'll fit
on my screen recorder but anyways these
right here are some built-in default
styling for cells so let's actually go
ahead and I decided that these column
names looked a little bit crappy I'm
going to go ahead and see what Excel has
built in so go to cell Styles and choose
a theme that you like so okay something
like that accent one looks a lot better
than the one I had so if you ever want
some default styles in you're too lazy
to go through an okay background color
then I have to choose a font and all
that stuff you can just go ahead and
apply those real quick again that's just
selecting them and choosing whatever one
you want now another thing that you can
do is you can make your own cell style
and I know what you're thinking you're
like why would I do that if I can just
you know anytime I want a cell style I'm
just going to go ahead and apply
whatever styling I want in boom so why
would I ever use this option right here
well the benefit of making your own cell
style is you can apply it to many cells
and then if you ever want to change the
styling of it you change it one time and
it automatically applies to any cells
you have the style will apply to so what
am I talking about say that you wanted
to make a style that had a green
background like this and I don't know
maybe like white font right there so
okay so I like this player that's why I
highlighted them so I'm going to make
this one okay I think that was the green
that I chose and of course white font
alright actually I decided that I want
this background to be red so I'm going
to go red and then I have to go make
this one red okay this is taken a long
time and say that I had like I don't
know like
different players selected I'd have to
go through each one and change each one
to read even though it was a really
simple thing to do so let me go ahead
and fix all of that and I'll show you
guys how you can do this really easily
and quickly with styles so go select
whatever row you want whatever range and
go down to cell styles and hit new cell
style so this is going to do is it's
pretty much going to say okay you're
making a new style give it a name so you
can remember it easily and I'm just
going to put on like selected players so
now what you want to do is actually go
over to this format option right here
and this is going to allow you to format
your style how do you want the cells to
be formatted whenever this style is
applied well we want a fill of let's say
green by default and I don't know I
guess we'll make the font color white
you again so color actually let's make
it like yellow just so it'll stand out
so I'm going to hit OK and okay and
check this out now if we select this
cell Styles drop-down we're going to see
that we have our own custom style called
selected players even though the text
got cut off so now what we can do is
apply the style to any rows that we want
apply to that one that one and maybe
this player actually don't know any
player is on baseball not a big baseball
fan but uh you know this is just an
example so now we have the same we
pretty much accomplish the same thing
that we did before however now we did
with styles so the benefit of this is
anytime I decide that you know what
green actually looks like baby poop and
this white looks like I don't know throw
up so I need to change that instead of
going through and changing it row by row
by row I can just go to my Styles right
click whatever style I have and select
modify so now whenever I format it I can
just put fill I don't know maybe this
red actually I
like this let's pick a cool one orange
and for the file I'll have the font
white now I hit okay okay and check it
out every single row that had that style
applied gets changed all at once and
actually this color theme is pretty
stinkin sweet might want to save this so
that my friends is the benefit of styles
and why it's it's actually you're very
underutilized so I would highly
recommend if you ever have a theme that
you want to apply all the time making
your own custom style so I'm going to
shut up now thank you guys for watching
don't forget subscribe and I'll see you
guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
