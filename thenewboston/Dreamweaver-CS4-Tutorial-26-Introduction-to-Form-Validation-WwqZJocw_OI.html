to be sort of an introductory tutorial
to form validation if you've been
watching the previous tutorials you've
seen how to input all the objects inside
a form that allows users to input data
and now we are going to i'm going to
enter going to introduce you to spry
validation this is going to be sort of a
quick introductory tutorial so i can
show you what what is possible with
sprite validation it's really cool stuff
I think you guys are really really going
to like how easy this is I'm going to
create a simple text field and then
we're going to validate it i'm going to
validate it on an email so basically
what i'm going to do is we're going to
make make a text field that is going to
be a text field for email eventually so
here we go i am going to click text
field say email okay and i'm going to
click inside that input and i'm going to
click on spry validation text field and
you can see that it is imported some
script and some CSS has also created
some script down here for the time being
don't worry about that in later
tutorials i will show you how to go
inside of those files and actually
actually edit them so we can customize
our validation even more really can be
really cool so you guys definitely go to
my stay tuned so when i clicked on the
spry validation text field you can see
all that stuff it created it also
created this span tag around the input
itself around the text field and you can
also see down here in the properties
when you click on this span you can see
that it has the spry text field
properties and there's a few options
here i'm going to go over them in more
detail in the following tutorials but
for this introductory one
going to click on email address for type
and we are going to click on validate on
blur and I will explain that in the next
few tutorials so let's go ahead and see
what this looks like and what this is
saying is that it is going to create
this spry assets folder with these these
two files inside there and it's going to
create that folder inside of the folder
where my current forms dot HTML is
located and we're just going to allow
that and say okay so now this it should
have a label email I didn't put it but
you know because I'm telling you that
this is supposed to be an email so you
see it you click inside of it in the the
color of the form turns the color of the
text field turns like a manila color so
i'm going to type in an email address
email at whatever calm and i'm going to
click outside of it and it's all good
given a green light we can go ahead so
i'm going to take out this Exxon and now
it doesn't like it so with a few clicks
we can completely validate a text field
and it's really that easy and in the
following tutorials we're going to run
through each of these specifically and
we're going to talk about what we can do
to customize them we're going to talk
about what we can do to make it look
better to format the text we can change
this text we can change the colors this
is basically just an introduction to
what could be a very very interesting
cool set of tutorials so hopefully this
introductory tutorial got you excited
about the next ones and hopefully you'll
keep watching and keep staying tuned
