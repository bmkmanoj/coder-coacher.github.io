'the androids toil for the new boss and
we're ruining this tutorials we're
actually gonna get some information from
our spinner such as which item has been
selected so we're gonna do is do spinner
dot set on item whoops
set on item selected listener and we're
gonna set this equal to this just kind
of like when we set up a button kind of
as always and then we're just gonna
implement the select or the item
selected listener and again we just
hover over a class ad unimplemented
methods and we have two new methods
basically when items are in selected and
on nothing selected well we aren't gonna
really worry about the nothing one
because we don't really gonna do
anything for the most part so we're
gonna do is we're gonna go with in this
item selected mint method here and what
we're gonna do is we're going to set up
a tent such as position something like
that we're gonna refer to our spinner
here we're just gonna say get selected
item position and that's going to turn
into an int and that's gonna give us the
position of our adaptor that has been
chosen of our array adapter so we have
three positions position zero one and
two and so we're gonna just set up a
switching case for that so we refer to
our position and we're just gonna say
case and a spilled position wrong taste
zero which will be the first thing in
our list which will be music and we're
gonna say case one break
and lastly case two and break now what
we have our what we're gonna have our
item selector do is basically tell us
which directory we want to save in so
what we're gonna do is we're going to
scroll all the way up to the top and
create a file we're gonna call this path
it initially said it equal to null so
it's nothing now what we're gonna do is
set up our directory path within our you
know when an item has been selected and
how we do that is we just say path
equals environments because we're gonna
refer to the environment and see kind of
this see if we can get the standard
directories for the most part such as
music directory people save the pictures
all that good stuff so we're gonna say
environment get external storage public
directory because when we save basically
we're just going to save a picture to
one of these directories we want it to
be public so they can access it without
even using our application because again
we're saving it externally and publicly
and then all we're gonna say within here
we're gonna refer to our environment as
well we're gonna say dot directory what
was the first one I believe is music so
we're gonna say dot directory music and
then just finish our statement there so
let's make sure yeah we have music
pictures and then download so we're just
going to copy this and paste it whoops
and paste it within our case two and
just change the directory to directory
downloads for the third one and
directory pictures for this one
so there we go basically that's it for
this tutorial I know these paths don't
really mean much to you yet but again
I'll talk about it more when we actually
save our stuff to the phone but that's
it for this tutorial guys again all we
learned about is on item selected
listener and we how to access our
spinner to get the current position of
our array that has been selected and we
set up a path which again is a file path
so I'll catch you guys in the next
tutorial have a good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
