tutorial that I'm making for them in
Boston and in this tutorial I'm going to
be showing you how to use settings so
arcane need for this tutorial is the
button and effect box and basically what
we're going to be doing in this tutorial
is making it so when you open a program
you can save a setting you close the
program and then reopen it and that
setting will still be there
so the first step in making a setting is
going to project and then the properties
of your project now go down to the
Settings tab right here and in this
table right here is where all your
settings will be in order to add a new
setting just go ahead and type in this
text box right here and give a name to
your setting I'm just gonna call it name
because we're me scoring someone's name
inside of this property um
and the type right here is basically the
type of variable that will be stored on
so we're gonna start as a string because
this person's name should be stored of
this string so once you have all your
property or properties all set let's go
ahead and click Save up here go back to
your form and then double click on this
pot because basically we're gonna make
it so whenever you click on this button
it'll save on the text in this text box
to the name property in order to access
the property Butte is created type out
the name of your project and mine is
window Swansea application one then go
dot properties property name space for
the settings class and go to the default
property and then finally inside of here
should be the property that you created
and yep there's our name property we
just created and we're going to set this
equal to text box one two times now in
order to save this property we're not
done yet
we have to use the save method and
that's inside of this default property
right here so I'm kind of copy this
because I don't feel like rewriting it
and then we're gonna go to the save yeah
safe nothing and this will just save the
property
because if we don't do this it will just
set this property equal to whatever text
box one's tech base and then when we
close the program all that data will be
lost so in order to save it we have to
save it in order for the in effect on me
open the program again and we're just
gonna have text box ones tax equal to
whatever the property is so copy this
out here again I'm lazy so now when we
be bug here text box when stuck it
should be equal to the property and when
you click this button it should save the
contents of this text box into the
property so I'm just gonna store atom
inside that name property so when I
click this button it should save it so
now when I reopen I should see atom in
the text box because it's saved the
property and thus rereading the property
yep get atom in that text box right
there now you can also store integers as
well and it's the same deal you just go
back here create another property let's
call it age this time we'll save it as
an integer save this we can see the
property I'll just treat another text
box right here for the age of the text
box do so now copy this all out again
very inside the default property we
should have aged yep we have an integer
age I'll set this equal to converting
the text boxes text into here
and then in text box too and no matter
how many properties you have you only
have to save it once so don't think it
since you have two properties you have
to save it twice now you only need one
you only save it once so basically this
will does convert text box to text into
an integer then save that and then save
that property we're also gonna have it
read that property once more just a text
box - chuckles that age property age and
we run into a string stored as an
integer so now we get Adam in 0:15 level
15 save it or reopen it you should get
15
yep it's saved it and reloaded it so in
case you're wondering how to store on
custom variable types such as a button
else politic button hey so right here we
don't have a bottom option however we
can do browse and browse will allow us
to browse through all of the namespaces
we currently have open so want to do a
bottom you go to windows forms for
namespace and scroll down until you see
the variable okay and now you
can store it as a button save this go
back and see if it work it's copy this
all right and we should have a variable
called fatin a yeah it's called a part
so now we can only step equal to a
button smell the study equals button one
build make sure you get no errors
yeah that's perfectly fine setting equal
to a button so that's pretty much it for
this tutorial so see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
