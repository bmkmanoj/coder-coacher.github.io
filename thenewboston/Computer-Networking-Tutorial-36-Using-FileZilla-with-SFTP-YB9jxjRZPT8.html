video I want to show you how to transfer
files to and from your server using SFTP
now I'm gonna assume that you guys are
to use FileZilla before and you know the
basics of FTP SFTP is just a more secure
protocol than FTP because it uses SSH
and I would highly recommend using SFTP
over regular FTP whenever you can so
this tutorial isn't gonna be you know
instructions on how to use FileZilla or
the protocols I just want to show you
guys how to set it up because like I
said I'm sure you already know the
basics of it so once you have FileZilla
downloaded and installed go to edit
settings and from here choose SFTP now
since this protocol uses SSH what we
need to do is we need to tell FileZilla
where our private key is so if you go to
add key file browse to wherever you
stored your private key again the public
one is the one that goes on the server
the private one is the one that's on our
personal computer so open that and just
click OK to save it and now that has the
private key we need to tell it one other
thing and that is what computer or what
server are we trying to connect to so we
need to give the IP address and the port
and also the protocol so if you go to
file site manager then from here we can
just add a new site and the host and
actually before we do that it's better
to name it so I'm just gonna name this
like droplet one hit enter and the host
is just the IP address so this is the
server that we're trying to connect to
and remember the default port for SSH is
22 so if you didn't change it then keep
that however earlier in on like five
tutorials ago remember that we actually
changed the SSH port to seven seven
seven seven so that's the port that
we're going to use and the protocol of
course we're not using FTP anymore we're
using SFTP so it's again from a user
point of view it's the exact same thing
as FTP
but behind the scenes there's just a
little bit more secure so select that
and the login type is actually
interactive and I just wanted to leave
all this because we don't need any of
that interactive means whenever we log
in then we can just type you know like
Bucky or whatever just like we were
logging in through the terminal so we
can actually just hit connect right now
and yep that's where you're trying to
connect what user do you want to login
is well how about Bucky and hit okay yes
we trust it and we are now connected so
all of the files on the right hand side
our furthest server the left-hand side
is for your own computer and you can
transfer files back and forth so let's
say that you wanted to I don't know what
do we want to do here
oh no let's just look at the homepage
file so VAR w w HTML and let me just
download this to show you guys so if you
double-click it from the server it's
gonna download on to your local machine
and we can see that it got downloaded
onto our local machine and let me just
open this in notepad even though you
guys can't see it because it's off the
screen check it out
so there you go that's how you download
files from your server you can also you
know work on your project on your own
machine and then when you're ready bump
it to the server so yeah there you go
hopefully you guys enjoyed see you next
