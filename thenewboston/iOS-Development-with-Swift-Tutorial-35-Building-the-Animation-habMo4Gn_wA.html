on the screen what we can do now is
actually start setting up that level and
one of the very first things that I want
to do is I actually want to go ahead and
start animating this guy because right
now he's pretty much just a still image
I want to actually build that animation
so it looks like he's actually being
affected by the firing of the gun so
anyway so let's hop over to shooter
scene dot Swift where it's pretty much
the brains behind that level and right
now we have zero methods nothing going
on so the first thing I actually wanted
to do is just call it did move to view
and this is just a override method that
gets called whenever the view is first
percentage so whenever the user first
loads this level this code is going to
be called now all I want to do in here
is call a method code initialize shooter
scene now it's going to give me an error
because we didn't build it yet and what
this is just gonna do is I'm just gonna
make a method to set up everything for
this level and one of the very first
things like I said is actually building
that animation so it seen I'm gonna take
any parameters right now and all right
so what do we want to do in this level
well the very first thing we want to do
is we want to make a variable called
score and this is just so later on we
can keep track of how many balls he
they're or enemies he destroyed whatever
you want to call it and another thing
I'm gonna do is I'm gonna add an enemy
count and this is just so whenever we
first load our level balls are gonna
start dropping from the ceiling or the
roof whatever you want to call it and
we're gonna start shooting them and we
need to tell our phone how many we want
to create how many enemies do you want
to have well we just don't want to go on
forever so we'll say have 10 so ideally
10 out of 10 would be the perfect score
you can't have an infinite amount in
like a time limit if you want but I'm
just gonna have 10 keep things simple so
after this
I'm gonna add a one more variable and
it's gonna call be called shooter
animation so again what this is gonna be
is pretty much just a list of images
since that's really all animation is
just a bunch of different images put
together one after another and since
they're slightly different it looks like
movement so if I call SK texture we can
go ahead and store where all of these
images in here now I'll show you guys a
really cool way to do this so in init
shooter scene let me just go ahead and
put what shooter Atlas SK texture Atlas
and what do you want the name of this be
named
why does a capitalized crap when I don't
want it to all right so this is a
reference to Atlas named shooter now
remember that I told you guys in Atlas
is pretty much just a special type of
folder and it's just special to Xcode
and whenever you call it Atlas it knows
that the items inside it are related
somehow so this right here is pretty
much a reference to this folder that's
it nothing that complicated so what I'm
going to do to create this animation is
this I'm gonna loop through all of the
images in this folder and I'm gonna say
for each of these images take these and
add them to this animation however I'm
gonna do it really cool way I can just
go ahead and create one two three four
five six different lines of code but
what if we wanted to add another image
to that animation later well sure you
guys are really awesome wink so if
you're right for index in one so it's
going to start at one and that brings me
to another point whenever you're making
animations
sure you name them in this way this is
the easiest way write whatever name
shooter enemy block and then a number
after in order one two three four five
six now if you have ten or let's say you
have like twenty five frames in this
animation make sure the first one isn't
name one make sure it's zero one if you
have a three digit maybe you have like
150 frames make sure the first one is
zero zero one so you know I'm saying
just don't have it one well you guys
probably know what I'm saying alright so
for here we want to go from one to six
but we just don't want to write six
instead we can erase shooter analyst and
it's not Auto completing texture names
dot count so this is pretty much just
going to count how many textures or how
many images are in this folder for our
youth so you just don't have to write
any hard-coded value right here it gets
it for you so from here what we need is
first just a reference to that image
name the file name and it is just string
in the format this is shooter percent
zero one D and again this zero one D
means one decimal place if I had a like
fourteen or anywhere from like 10 to 99
then I would need o2 or if I name this
like shooter 0 0 1 then I would have o3
it's just how many decimal places naming
convention and for the arguments there's
just index did I get it always gives me
that extra symbol and it's ticked me off
alright so this is pretty much the image
name in in other words it's a reference
to the file and once we have a reference
to each file one by one we can add them
to the animation how do we do that well
we take that
animation which is going to be a list of
all the images and for each one we are
going to add shooter Atlas dot texture
named image name and that is it so it
should be good to go
so right now if you run it we shouldn't
see a whole lot going on because we
actually just created the animation
right now so we said how we wanted to be
organized but we didn't say to play it
for any duration or when we want to play
it or anything like that so we can click
in nothing's happening because we didn't
do that yet again to recap one last time
we just built an animation which is just
a list of images and then we said okay
how many images that we want to add
we'll just get the number of images in
this atlas in this folder and then loop
through one by one and for each image
add it to the animation and now I'm
going to show you guys how to actually
play the animation</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
