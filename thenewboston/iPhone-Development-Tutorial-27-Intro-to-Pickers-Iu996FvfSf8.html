development tutorial and in this
tutorial we're going to be going over
Pickers now what a picker is it's pretty
much like that scroll wheel that you
know you can scroll looks like the big
old wheel of fortune wheel we're spin it
and you hope to get a dollar it's pretty
much that so that's what we're going to
be going over and by the way from now on
I'm going to be calling Pickers peckers
because it sounds way funnier and I just
like to name everything a little bit
different so you know I just do no
reason for it so if you guys are saying
all right Bucky I thought we were still
going over multi-view applications let's
get back to that and I'm saying all
right you know what why don't we make a
multi-view application learning peckers
so that way we can learn something new
and also reinforce what we already
learned so we really can nail it so you
know I think that's the better thing to
do so go ahead and create a brand new
Xcode project and of course we want a
windows-based application so choose that
and go ahead and name this peckers with
a Z and name it too because i think i
already have another class called
peckers so go ahead and save this and
welcome to Xcode and my friends so the
first thing we want to do is go ahead
and expand classes and resources and you
see we only have this main window and
these two app delegates but we obviously
are going to need a bunch of different
classes so we actually I'm going to be
teaching you about different kinds of
Pickers and I'm going to be teaching you
about five different kinds so therefore
we need five different classes you see
how that works so what you want to do is
go ahead and right-click class add new
file and then go ahead and add a new
subclass again under iphone OS
cocoa-touch class view controller
subclass and make sure this is checked
with xib user interface we don't want to
have to create our nib file separately
you want to do it all in the same lamp
Kabam let's go ahead and click Next and
name this first one date
pecker since this is also gonna this is
the picker that's going to show the date
in what I was going to say is make sure
you create the header file too so once
you have that go ahead and finish a
nicey you got three new files so go
ahead and we're going to do this a bunch
of different times and name this second
one single pecker all right and now go
ahead add new file and name this third
one again you should already have this
selected and this selected name this
double pecker finish classes and new
file name the fourth one name this D
dependent pecker looks good finish and
then go ahead and add new file and name
this last one what do we want to name it
let's go ahead and name it custom pecker
this one's going to be a good one
alright so now you're saying all right i
got the header implementation and face
files but check this out I got my nip
files under my classes folder now we
know we don't want that so go ahead and
hold down command on your keyboard and
select all the xib files the interface
files and what you want to do is drag
all of these two resources so go ahead
and select this this one this one this
one and this one and drag them all to
your resources right on our main windows
or I put so all your knit files are now
where you want to be in your classes of
course that's very classes belong so the
first thing that we want to do is we
want to create that root view controller
and remember this is the class that
controls the very first view your users
going to see and it basically is going
to control all your views so in the last
series of saw riyals we manually made
our root view controller but check this
out apple or ipod whoever did it they
included a class built in to do all of
this for us so what we're going to do is
we're just going to create an instance
from
that class and we're going to use that
object to handle pretty much everything
so go ahead and in your whatever your
project name is app delegate H we're
going to go ahead and start typing some
codes go ahead and get rid of that
comment so the first thing we need to do
is we need to create an instance of you
I tab bar controller and just name this
route controller just like that and of
course when you set a property because
we need to outlet to access non-atomic
retain I be out lit and just go ahead
and copy this UI tab controller don't
feel like typing out and paste it and
we're a good go so now let's go well we
won't save it yet but anyways this
pretty much creates an instance of our
root view controller again this is the
class where it is it's already built in
we don't need to make our own class and
this is the object we're going to use to
access it of course we need to outlet so
anyways what I'm saying this is the
thing that's going to control the very
first view your user is going to see so
pretty cool huh hence the name root view
controller it controls the root view or
the first view anyways enough of that go
ahead and hop into your implementation
file for the same delegate class and go
ahead and carry these comments just
because I hate comments and your
teachers are always like make sure to
comment everything I'm like not don't
want to kind of hate it but anyways go
ahead and synthesized window and you
also want I mean don't synthesize when
the under synthesized window go ahead
and synthesize that route
controller there we go I'll get
eventually controller looks good enough
so now we have a setter and getter
methods for that route controller
servicing art why do we even need setter
and getter methods for that because we
want to be able to access the view from
it and plop it on our window so our main
window add sub view which pretty much
means add a view to the window that
route controller add that main classes
view to the window so now as soon as
your application starts this route
controllers main view is going to be the
first thing you see pretty cool huh so
after this of course since we created
that object I think it would only be
fair to give the memory back once we're
done with it so and basically in this
tutorial what we did is we created an
object from this class that was already
built in in this class that's already
built in lets you navigate around your
application via tab bars so that's what
we wanted and we named it route
controller that's the object that
accessed this class and we built setter
and getter methods for actually our
program go to automatically for us many
ways we pretty much took that view from
this main class and added it to the main
screen so now as soon as they start our
program this is the view they're going
to be able to see and then of course
when we're done with the memory we got
to give it back because you know or nice
we're not greedy we got to do it so I
think you guys for watching if you want
any of the source code kick on the click
on the link below and it's all there for
you guys so anyways I'll see you next
tutorial and I don't forget subscribe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
