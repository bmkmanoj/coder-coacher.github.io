tutorial that I'm making for them in
Boston and in this tutorial I'll be
showing you how to use the if statement
so all your need for this tutorial is a
button and a text box and once you have
that on your form just go ahead and
double click on the button alright so
basically what an if statement does is
it will check to see if a statement is
true and if that statement is true then
it will do something else so to write an
if statement you're just going to want
to write if and then following that
you're going to want to put two
parentheses and in these two parentheses
its statement that you're going to want
to check to see if it's true or not and
we're going to want to check to see if
text box one's text equals atom so we're
going to say if text box one for our
text box and then say dot text or the
text property of our text box and you
want to say if the text of the text box
is atom then we're just going to have a
message box show saying um hello all
right and the reason that we have to put
two equal signs here is because two
equal signs will check to see if it's
true or not where one equal sign we'll
just set the value of textbox one so if
we were to just put one equal sign there
it would throw an error but if we were
to put it outside of a if statement it
would just set the text of textbox one
to add them and we don't want to do that
we want to check to see if text box
phones text is equal to atom and then if
it is then we want to have a message box
show so following our if statement we
need to put two curly braces and then
inside these curly braces is all the
code that will be executed if this is
true
so if text box one select equals atom
and we're just gonna have a message box
show saying hello all right so once
again here to write an if statement
using the type I F and then two
parentheses following that and then
inside these two parentheses is the
statement that you want to write to see
if it's true or not
so if text box one is text equals atom
then we're going to have a message box
show and the reason that we have 52
equal signs is two equal signs just
check to see if the value is equal to
atom but one equal sign will set the
value we don't want to do that
want to check alright so let's just go
ahead and debug here and if text box
ones tax equals Adam then we should have
a message box show so it's equal to Adam
right now we click the button we get
hello
but if text box ones text because
anything sides Adam we're not going to
get that message box so if we type like
hello and now we don't get that message
box because this will only occur right
here text box ones tax is equal to Adam
all right
what if you want to check to see though
if text box ones text doesn't equal Adam
so you will always get the message box
and the last text box ones text equals
to Adam and to do that you're just going
to want to put exclamation point equal
sign and what this means is it will
check to see if text box ones text
doesn't equal Adam so if text box ones
text doesn't equal Adam then we'll get a
message box to show all right so let's
just go ahead and debug here so the
message box will show every time unless
text box one stack equals Adam so we're
just going to put hello in here should
get Adam or hello I mean you type in
anything else
hello yeah but if we type in Adam then I
this will return false because it will
say if text box ones text doesn't equal
Adam and it does equal Adam so they'll
never get to this code let's just click
this button and know if we don't get
that message box because text box wants
text equals Adam all right what if you
want to check to see though if text box
ones text equals Bob so one sexy is
chance back to equal to Adam so you're
gonna want to say text boxes text equals
Adam then while the message box show and
then you also want to check to see if
text box ones text equals off so flexbox
ones text equals Bob then we want to
have a message box show saying yo so
alright so you get yo right there
alright and we type in Bob now and we
should get a message box saying yo yep
but there's a better way to do this so
basically what it's going to do here is
going to check to see if it's adam and
if it was Adam
we get a message box saying hello and
then it would go down here and say if
text box ones text equals Bob well if
you have a whole bunch of if statements
right here checking to see if there's
like three or four other people's names
and that's not very good because it has
to go through each one of these if
statements but if you were to just type
right here else if then what it's going
to do is if text box ones text equals
Adam then it's just going to skip over
this because it can't be equal to Adam
and Bob it just can't do that
so if text box ones text equals Adam and
I'm just going to stop right there and
not ever get to this code it will show
the message box but once it's done
executing everything inside of here able
to stop and go right down to there and
just skip it after this else if
statement and you can have as many else
ifs as you want so if you want to have
another else if saying else if text box
ones text equals Joe well then you want
to get a message box that says hi it's
not a message box hi
alright so let's just go ahead and make
sure that this works here so if we type
in Adam we should get a message box
saying hello yep if we type in Bob we
should get a message box saying yo yep
and if we type in a message or if we
type in Joe you should get a message box
saying hi yeah perfect and if we type in
anything else all these are going to
return false these are all going to be
false and won't get anything yeah
perfect all right and before in this
tutorial let me to show you one more
thing there's something called else and
the else will only occur if all of these
are false
so if text box ones text doesn't equal
Adam it doesn't equal Bob and it doesn't
equal G oh then we can just say else
right here and then it will do
whatever's inside of here so we'll just
have a message box saying sorry your
name isn't important sorry your your
name isn't important okay so if your
name isn't Adam Bob or Joe then we'll
get this message box saying sorry your
name isn't important so
let's go how to make sure that this
works so if we type in Adam we get hello
if we type in Joe
we should get high but if we type in
anything else besides Adam Bob or Joe
and just going to go to this else right
here and we're going to get sorry your
name isn't important so if we type in
like hello then we're just going to get
a message box saying sorry your name is
it important so basically what it does
when text box ones text equals hello
it's going to check to see if it's Adam
no it's not so then it's going to go
down to this else if and then is it
equal to Bob nope is it equal to Joe
nope all right so then we're going to do
this else right here which kind of a
message box show saying sorry your name
isn't important all right so that's
pretty much it for this tutorial on
using on the if else if and else so see
you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
