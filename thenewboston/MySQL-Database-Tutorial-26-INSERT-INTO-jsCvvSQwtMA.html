to your 26 minus QL tutorial and in this
lesson we're going to start finally
editing the database because before we
have these tables we have this data and
we can look at it you know maybe select
some columns select some rows that's
nice but we can never update edit delete
make new tables in this tutorial we're
going to begin on that and I'm going to
show you guys how to insert a row of
data first so each of these is obviously
a row but what happens whenever we want
to add a new one
maybe we have a new user that signs up
for our website or maybe someone lists
the new item well let's go ahead and
learn how to do that right now
so take note before I begin that I'm
going to be working in the items table
in every item has an ID number a name a
cost a seller ID which was who was
selling the item and a number of bids
for that item so let's go ahead and let
me show you guys a really basic way the
core basics of inserting an item into a
database go ahead and type insert into
and then after you type insert into you
write the name of the table you want to
insert the data into items so now what
do you want to insert into items well we
just want to insert one row so go ahead
and type the word values now inside here
these are the values now remember I said
that each row has an ID number a name of
the item a price a user ID or excuse me
a seller ID which is like the user ID
and the number of bids so five things so
you need five things whenever you insert
in this kind of way one two three four
five I just go ahead and do that so I
just I don't know I like doing it
because I don't forget any um commas or
you know whatever so the next row I
happen to know is 101 that's the ID
number of the next item and now we have
to give that a name would you say we're
selling like bacon strips or something
and now how much are we going to sell
these babies for 995 seems like a fair
price now let's just say that the user
ID is me I remember from our
customers table that Bucky Roberts is
one and last but not least the number of
bids it starts it is zero so now that is
how we insert a single row into our
table right insert into write the table
name and write the values and make sure
however many columns you have in your
table not only do these have to be in
the correct order well I'll show you
this right now you see whenever we look
at our table the items table how these
columns are arranged first the ID then
the name then the cost that's what order
you have to write into whenever you're
writing your SQL statement so remember
you can't change the order it's given to
you so that's nice
and why am i stressing that so much
because what if your boss comes in and
he says you know what we actually don't
need the number of bids right here or we
actually want to put the name at the end
or he changes your table structure in
some way maybe adds columns takes away
columns well that's nice and off because
now we can just write new SQL statements
but what if we programmed our entire
website set up where it was just those
statements those statements where we had
to insert the items in that specific
order well now we have to go back to our
website rewrite all of our code and it's
going to take a whole lot of time and
we're probably going to have to fix a
whole bunch of crap so I want to teach
you guys a better way to insert data
other than explicitly write on each
column by column so here is an
alternative and better way go ahead and
write insert into you do this every time
you answer any data now of course write
your table name but instead of just
writing values after this and typing in
whatever data you want in your new row
go ahead and add parentheses and inside
here is where you write the column names
of what data you want to insert so ID
name cost seller underscore ID and bids
now you can go ahead and write Wow
definitely spelled that wrong values and
one two three four five remember not to
add a comma after your last one so this
is item 102 I didn't even show you guys
the road that we just inserted I'll show
you in the Tucket and this item can be
fish in chips and how much can this be
$7.99 seems like reasonable price and of
course my seller ID is one and it
doesn't have any bid so far so this is
an alternative way by explicitly writing
the column names so now let's go ahead
and hit go and check it out one row
inserted don't believe me I'll prove it
to you
sorbet ID descending and check it out
that was the first thing that we
inserted 101 bacon strips and 102 is
fish and chips so those are two
alternative ways that we can insert data
into a database row by row but why did I
say this was better I want to talk to
you guys about this you know how our
boss said maybe um you know we don't
need to put the number of bids or maybe
it's going to become you know maybe it's
going to go after ID or name is at the
end well even if your table structure
changes which it quite often does if you
ever work for a web design or
programming company this is still going
to work because you're not saying okay
you're not deleting this and said okay
ID has to be first name has to be second
the price has to be next even if those
values are or columns are all mixed up
you're telling it right here what order
you're going to insert this data into so
let me show you guys an awesome example
even if your columns are ID cost name
now we know our table setup not in this
order as ID name than cost and then it
has these two extra things but it
doesn't even matter because what we're
saying is okay we only want to insert a
row for the ID cost and name so now
whenever we type something like
um let's see well item is this 103 103
and uh I don't know what am I going to
sell this for seventy seventy seven and
the name is beef on a stick
much better than beef off a stick so
what happens is unlike before where we
have to explicitly give it the exact
structure where the tables built we can
just insert data however we want to
however the programmer wants to insert
the data that's what we're going to do
so this is much better in anyways if our
boss comes in and changes the table
structure this code is still going to
work so we're going to say okay we're
inserting the ID number first which is
103 then the cost then the name I don't
care how the table setup this is how I'm
going to insert data so we can go ahead
and hit go and make sure it's inserted
just like this checking out 103 beef on
a stick 777 and these two are default
values which I'll talk about in the next
tutorial but anyways that is your
tutorial again the key thing the
takeaway is you can go ahead and insert
data without adding the explicit column
names but it's very nice to add the
column names not only because it tells
mysql how you want to insert the data
but you can also alter the number of
columns that you want to insert and also
the order of the columns so it gives
more control to the programmer instead
of just the database designer saying
this is how you need to insert data so
there you go thank you guys for watching

add me on Google+ don't forget that send
me $500 and I'll see you in the next
