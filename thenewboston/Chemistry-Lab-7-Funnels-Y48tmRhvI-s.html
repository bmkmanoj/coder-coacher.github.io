welcome to another chemistry lab
tutorial in this video I want to talk to
guys about a piece of equipment that
every chemistry lab should have funnels
now funnels of course are used whenever
you have a liquid or solution and
typically it's in a bigger container and
you want to transfer it to a container
that has a narrow mouth like an
Erlenmeyer flask so they're pretty much
used to prevent spilling really useful
now I don't want to explain in detail
how to use a funnel because first of all
it's incredibly easy and second of all
if you don't know how to use a funnel
you probably shouldn't even be in a
chemistry lab but what I would like to
do is talk to you guys about a technique
in I want to mention this because it
bothers me a lot a lot of people do this
and well it's just incorrect
so typically whenever people use funnels
like this here I have a glass funnel in
my hand and this is just a cheap
disposable plastic funnel what they do
is they usually just stick it inside
their container like an Erlenmeyer flask
and they start pouring the liquid or
solution in now right now this isn't
working too bad but typically in a lot
of situations you're going to have a
really slow pour or it's not going to be
very smooth and the reason for this is
because whenever you're pouring this
liquid in the liquid can enter just fine
but there's no space for air to enter
this container so you're going to have a
really slow or not a smooth pour so
typically what you want to do is you
want to lift up this funnel just a
little bit and that allows not only air
but also the liquid to get in the
container
now whenever you see a funnel like this
one right here and it has ridges on the
side that is what the ridges are for if
this didn't have the ridges then
whenever you put it in a container
it would make a tight air seal and no
air would be allowed to enter the
container so these funnels are really
cool again these like I said are my
disposable plastic funnels because you
don't even have to hold it they already
have the ridges built in to have a
little bit of space between the side of
your container and the funnel really
handy and actually there are many
different types of funnels other than
your standard funnels that you're going
to find in a chemistry lab this is one
of the coolest looking ones this is
called a buchen or funnel and if you
watch my
tration tutorial you know what this does
is basically used whenever you want to
filter a mixer like sand and water
really mean but basically I just want to
mention that whenever someone talks
about a funnel they can be talking about
a wide variety of different funnels but
for our labs we typically need is either
a standard glass funnel or a standard
plastic funnel and you can just find
these off of Amazon and I do want to
mention whenever you have a glass funnel
like this one be very careful of how you
store it and how you handle it because
the stems on these funnels can break off
really easy so aside from that you guys
for watching and I'll see you guys in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
