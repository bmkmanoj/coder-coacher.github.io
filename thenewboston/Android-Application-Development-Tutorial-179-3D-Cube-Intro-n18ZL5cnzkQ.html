Android tutorial where we're gonna start
programming our cube
what if done is I set up three new
classes three new classes you guys don't
have to just so I can you know add it to
the demo application that you guys can
download for the marketplace or whatever
so it's pretty much the same all I'm
gonna do is change if you guys decide to
make three new classes I called this one
GL cube example which is the activity
class and it's gonna take a GL cube
renderer which is pretty much the exact
same as our previous render except
instead of having a triangle I setup a
GL cube which we're going to create here
which is that class we're gonna create
for cube and pretty much everything else
is the same
let's give it a scenario because we
don't have a draw method within our cube
as well but pretty much everything else
is gonna be the same as for now maybe
change this to be a little bit closer
there alright so let's get into it let's
open our GL cube class up and it's right
here it's gonna be pretty simple we're
actually gonna start we're gonna open
our triangle class first and pretty much
copy everything because it's pretty much
the same framework so it's gonna be nice
and easy here a little bit easier we'll
be able to move a little bit quicker
than we did previously and we just need
to change our constructor to cube oops
to the name of our class or cube here so
GL cube and there we go now let's just
think about the points that we need to
set up and we're gonna work with 3d now
it's gonna be pretty much for the same
same concepts here so as you can see we
have four points here and then also if
we hover around you can see two or three
more points here but there's also a
fourth point back here so we have a
total of eight points to build a cube
which you know makes sense and so we're
just gonna you know put those points in
got to think about it
this would be like let's go to the front
view again this front most point up here
would be one one and then negative one
in the Y Direction Earth in the Z
direction
so you know be closer to us and then the
anyways we're just going to program them
hopefully you guys kind of understand
the coordinates of the points and so
we're just gonna go into eclipse change
your point references up here so we're
gonna say first point will be one comma
that's an extraction one in the y
direction and negative one and the z
direction and we can just leave a
comment say point zero and this is
reference to the top front right and
then it depends how we're gonna put
these together but when you guys are
setting up your points you kind of have
a reference to how you label them
because again we did clockwise last time
but we're just gonna set them up and
kind of wing it as we go so the next
point we're going to do the bottom front
right so we're just gonna say one
negative one in the Y direction
and negative 1 in the Z direction so
we're gonna scroll this point bottom
front alright next point we're gonna say
the bottom front left so that's gonna be
negative 1 in the Y or in the X
Direction negative 1 in the Y direction
and negative 1 in the Z direction and
again we're just gonna call this point 2
bottom front left then we're going to
set up the top front to left as well so
we're just gonna say negative 1 1
negative z access and that's going to be
0.02 be in the same position so I'm just
going to copy this whole thing and paste
it and this time we just want to change
the z2 plus 1 instead of minus 1
and they were just gonna change all
these fronts to back and there we go we
have all of our points set up we might
want to change your references because
we're gonna get into that in the next
tutorial how we can connect these pretty
much the most efficient way so we don't
have to do a whole lot of typing and
again we're going to use this this
indices array here this index array so
I'll catch you guys then again pretty
much the same concepts except we just
had a third dimension there which we're
gonna have to change within our draw
method and all that great stuff so I'll
catch you guys in and have a good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
