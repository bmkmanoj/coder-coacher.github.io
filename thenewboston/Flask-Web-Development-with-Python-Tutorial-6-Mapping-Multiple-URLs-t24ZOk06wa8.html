that we understand the basics of flask
how a simple application is set up I
want to start talking to you guys about
some of the cooler things that you can
do with it and in this tutorial I'm
going to show you guys how to map
multiple URLs to a single function and
if you guys are like alright so this
might be a cool little trick but is it
ever useful well I'll give you guys an
instance of when you could use this so
say that you're making this social
network you had a brand new awesome idea
for a social network but you wanted the
homepage to change depending on if the
user was logged in or not
so if user went to the website and they
weren't logged in then the homepage
would just be a login form that says hey
sign up or login whatever you want to do
now if they were already logged in then
the homepage would just be like their
stream or their newsfeed or the profile
whatever so the content of it would
change depending on you know some
external variable in this case whether
they were logged in or not so what we
can do is we can actually type take two
different URLs and map them to the same
function how do we do that well let's
just go ahead and keep this one right
here and I'm gonna route another one and
we'll just say a user so in this case
we'll say whenever the users logged in
then we'll pass in variable right in
their path now remember since we have
this variable right here whenever we
load the homepage it always needs a
variable it's always expecting one even
when they're not logged in so by default
we'll just set the user to none so this
means if you want to override it with a
name you can but if they're not logged
in yet since you need a variable in
order to work then we'll just give it
none by default so instead of just
returning playing static text let's use
the cool render template we used and
we'll make a template called user to
HTML
all right and remember user user this is
going to be the name of user whenever
they are logged in so now we actually
have to make this template HTML file and
hit user did not yep all right
doctype looking good art so remember
this is our home page and whether
they're logged in or not this always
gets displayed this template right here
so how do we have kind of two different
versions of HTML on here well what we're
going to do is this alright so what you
need to do is you need to write curly
brace percent percent curly brace now
anything you write in here is
essentially just Python code or flask so
we're going to check if user now
remember if this is equal to anything
but none it means that they must be
logged in and for actual web site you
might want to test this differently so
people just can't type in anyone's name
and look at their profile but this is
going to be an easy way to explain it
all right so if the user variable is set
then what we want to do is we just run
all right like hello Bucky or hello or
Sally or whatever so just very h1 h1 and
all right a hello user and remember this
user variable is going to be equal to
someone's name because that's what we're
passing in all right so now what we can
do is we can check do this so else and
if all right so this HTML is only going
to be displayed if there is a user name
in other words if they're logged in else
if they're not logged in yet then we can
just write something like h1
I don't or we'll see please login period
nope no period don't want it alright so
there we go and now let me go ahead and
run this and once you see what's going
on it's going to make a lot more sense
all right so right now we're just going
to our web page no special URLs or
anything and it says please log in so
we'll make some feature later on that
the user can log in and now once they
are logged in remember this is just the
home page so we're just thrown in
variable called Bucky it says hello
Bucky so what we're looking at right
here is the exact same HTML template
this user dot HTML however the content
of it is dependent on whatever variables
we passed in if the user is set to a
name then it says this else if they
don't have a name yet and they're not
logged in they don't have this right
here how did we do that what we actually
took two different URLs and we mapped
them or connected them both to the same
functions return value which is right
here pretty interesting and again this
is kind of um oh no I'm we may be
getting our head of ourselves but that
is how you do that in in the upcoming
tutorial I thought I would have time in
this one but I'm actually going to be
showing you guys how to throw in
multiple variables in that structure
it's like a list and it's actually
really cool so I'll see you guys in that
