inserted a table and we have the link to
Google we're just gonna put it at
everyone
all right let's look at this in Firefox
yes and then go we just populated each
Salyut row with a link no it's uh so you
can find some some pictures
well you give it the source when you say
insert image to find some images
here we go
all right so you say image
oh the pictures
all right here's the picture well just
put this one for now yeah
actually off this little google don't
find it there you go
go here
from that and copy
there's location are they going here
it's a source is he okay
there we go now what are you that in the
browser and there's C that's strange
there we go
let's take off these parameters so it
goes back to the right ones there we go
Nosa so stressed out so using a few
examples of how we use the insert tag to
put in tables or the insert panel should
say to put in tables to put in images
there's also a lot of other things like
comments okay we don't want this image
anymore
click on comment save it and it goes
away and also insert all this stuff that
you need over here in the head section
of the HTML document but a meta values
you can put in oh I'm just clicking on
the icon there and you click on this
arrow keywords let's just say keyword
there we go
put that in there you can see you can
add links to other places which I don't
really use that much so I think those
are probably the most important ones
there's also the script the script tag
here this is pretty nice if you have any
JavaScript or any of these other things
VB script do you see me a way ECMAScript
then we have all these sounds you see
here also we have an email link so say
at the bottom you know major web page
you want to go down and you want to say
okay email me that XIV e Meehan and then
you just give me email sky
there we go refresh this down here
and let's view this in Firefox Wow well
even even ask you know which one do you
want to use so it's pretty cool that's
in the browser not in Dreamweaver we
also put in a horizontal rule which is
actually just as easy as typing HR but
if you want to use the insert tab do it
just like that so I have two horizontal
rules but in the date which is actually
a one function that I use a lot in
Dreamweaver makes spinning of the date
really easy and I guess that's pretty
much it for the inserts remember to
