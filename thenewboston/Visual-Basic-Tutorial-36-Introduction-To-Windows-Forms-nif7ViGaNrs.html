slash on live gamer for the new Boston
and in this tutorial we're going to be
taking a look at windows forms now I'm
sure you all been waiting a really long
time for the windows forms tutorial and
I felt it was better to start from the
console level so that all of the code
generated generated by the windows forms
applications project wouldn't confuse
you so and from now on we're going to
make all of our applications with
windows forms no more console stuff so
let's go and get started we're going to
create a new project make sure you
select windows forms application and
then we'll just come down here and we
will name it hello world forms now we're
just going to click OK and let it load
our project now you can see here that it
pops open this window right here and you
can see it from the tab up here that is
called form 1vb and it has the brackets
here that says design now basically what
this does is it shows what our form 1 is
going to look like and the dot V VB is
just the file that holds all the code
for this form 1 and the code that we're
going to be adding to it there's another
file that holds the designer for it now
basically what Visual Basic does is when
you add stuff to your window or resize
the window it automatically generates
code in a designer file that creates the
buttons or the list or whatever you want
and it adds them to your form and it
puts them in the correct place and sets
them to the size that you did all from
users dragging and dropping items onto
your form and resizing them it and or
resizing your form so let's go ahead and
we'll come up here and we'll just click
the toolbox right here and if you don't
see that right there just go ahead and
press ctrl alt X it's going to open up
our toolbox now you can see here that
we've got a bunch of tools that we can
use we're just going to go ahead and use
a button for this tutorial let's resize
the form a bit
and we will just change the text value
of this button to say hello you can see
here that the buttons text is changed to
say hello now whenever you're making a
windows forms application or any
application that's going to use buttons
or lists or labels and stuff you want to
come over here to your properties and
set a good name for your button or item
or whatever it is so if you scroll up
here you'll see that we have a name
value now you'd never want to leave this
as button one because that could confuse
you later on when you're making the
program bigger and adding more code to
it you'll be like what's button 1 where
where is it what does it say what does
it do so we're just going to change the
text value of this to button another
text value the name of this to button
say hello so whenever we access this
button from our code we'll know what it
is and what it does so to access the
code for our form 1 we can just go ahead
and double click on form 1 and you can
see here let me close out of the toolbox
that it creates a sub right here for us
that is the form 1 load
so whenever the form 1 is open and it
has loaded then go ahead and do what's
inside of this son now you can see
there's a bunch of stuff here you
probably don't understand that I don't
expect you to understand that yet but
we'll be covering that later on for now
we're not going to deal with the form
unload we're going to come back to our
design and we're going to double click
on say hello and you can see here that
it generates the sub that will run
whenever somebody clicks this button so
when they click this whatever code is in
here is going to be run so we're going
to start off by typing message box now
you can see here that intellisense pops
up and it says displays a message box
that can contain text buttons and
symbols that inform and instruct the
user so we're just going to type message
box type show and we're going to use the
message box show that uses two arguments
in the / M
the first argument is the text that's
going to be displayed in the message box
and then the second argument is going to
be the caption or whatever is at the top
of the text box so like here's our form
1 if the message box looked like this
the caption would be right there that
says form 1 so we'll just do message box
not show hello world and then we'll just
change the title - let's just do on live
gamer okay so now if we run this you can
see that a window pops up right here and
this is our form 1 you can see that I
didn't change the title or the icon now
if we go ahead and click say hello it's
going to pop up a message box that has
online cameras the title because that's
what we set and it has hello world as
the message now whenever you create a
message box it's just going to create a
window like this and the default button
the show is OK now later on we'll be
learning how to add different buttons
into there and how to get the input that
they put so let's say they click we give
them an option to click OK retry or
cancel we can get what they put in there
and then do some code according to what
they clicked so congratulations that's
your first windows forms application you
can go ahead and mess around with forms
and the code in there I encourage you to
you can learn a lot by yourself and once
you've got familiar with the message box
I'll show and adding stuff to your form
and changing the size and doing other
sorts of things to your form go ahead
and move on to the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
