tutorial for the new Boston and we're
going to do in this tutorials I'm just
going to show you how to set up a tab
within code alone within Java for
example if you're making like a web
browser of some sort so it's going to be
pretty simple nothing too new for the
most part but it's a little bit new so
first we just need to set up our
reference bridges so we're going to say
button and we're going to say new tab
and this is going to again we have to
import the button and I'm also going to
set up kind of references for the next
tutorial where we're going to get build
a simple simple stopwatch application so
fine view by ID oops
I'm view by ID and so again just set up
a couple of these references for this
one we're just going to use one button
but we're going to also set up our
button start and our button stop for
stopwatch from for our next application
so pretty boring stuff here probably
shoulda just clip the video and done
this save you guys the hassle but now
we're also going to add our
onclicklistener so we're going to say
new tab dot set onclicklistener
this and we're going to implement one
click and we're going to set up just a
switch in case here
I know these tutorials have kind of been
dull lately they haven't been is is
awesome but we will get into some
awesome stuff I just kind of wanted to
go back you know it's just like when you
workout when you're trying to lose
weight you don't want to just kind of
jog everyday you want to run one day
you're like run and then like walk a
little bit then sprint as fast as you
can so that's kind of the way I'm
teaching as well like we start out
really fast and we went really slow then
we went kind of kind of fast now we're
going kind of slow again um yeah I don't
know that's a poor excuse but uh yeah
the tutorials will get more interesting
as well so don't worry about that so
we're going to say button add tab then
we're going to do what's ever within
here and also case our ID dot button
start watch break and case button
stopwatch
all right so now that we have everything
set up we can actually do some work so
what we're going to do is within our
button add tab this is where we're going
to add a new tab so all we have to do is
basically we're going to make our tab
host so the first thing that so the
first thing that we're going to do is
create this tab host to be kind of a a
variable we can use within multiple
classes so we're just going to paste it
here and where is it should organize my
code a little bit better here
so there we go so now we can use our tab
house within our on click method
hopefully you guys know why by now
but and then what we're going to do is
we're going to say we're going to set up
a new spec so we're going to say tab
spec and we're going to call this our
spec something like that
we're going to set this equal to our th
which is our tab host we just made a
reference to and then we're going to say
new tab spec and then we're going to say
again like tag 1 or something since it's
kind of a new spec we're just going to
you know set that up and now what we're
going to do is we're going to define our
actual spec in your content within this
with a saw and click method and then
we're going to set it up to create a new
tab so it's kind of beneficial if you
guys were creating some kind of a
browser application and so we're going
to say our our spec dot set content and
this time we are going to we're just
going to create our own content so what
we're going to do is we're going to say
new tab host instead of saying like our
dot ID like we did up here we're going
to say new tab host dot set tab content
factory that's going to allow us to
build our own little application our own
content for the most part and so we're
going to finish off our statement first
here so we don't get confused and then
what we're going to do is we're going to
go within this public view and then
within this tab construction we're just
going to create a new text view so we're
just going to say text view text equals
new text view
this and then we're going to set up our
text view gotta import text even though
we're in state X dot set text to you've
created a new tab and then what we can
do is we can instead we can return and
then we can just return that variable
called techsoup's that we just created
here and so I'm getting this error right
here because we have to do right now
it's trying to think of the context of
this but we want it to be our class name
so our class name which was called tabs
dot this so again our just our class
name right there and then semicolon
there now it's going to return this text
every time we basically what we've done
is every time we press that button we're
gonna set up a new spec and we're going
to set the content through the cup tab
content factory which is going to say
create tab contact content and basically
we just set up a text view and then we
set the text of that textview and that's
what we're returning that's actually
actual information that's going to set
up so then we go outside of this bracket
right here then what we do is then we're
going to set our spec again dot set
indicator and we're going to say new or
new something like that then again we
just refer to and then again we just
refer to our tab host and then we just
say add whoops tab host
add tab and we're going to say our spec
so I don't know if I went too quickly
through that but hopefully you guys
understood everything that we did and
let's just run it make sure it works
but just remember back to the beginning
of this series where you guys would look
at something like this and be like what
them if you like what the heck is he
talking about and now I bet you guys can
kind of look through this and figure out
everything that's going on so let's
check this out and we're going to go
into our tabs and go into our third tab
where we set this add a tab and as you
can see creates this new tab up here we
click on it and it says you've created a
new tab and then we can click on again
create a new tab new tab new tab new tab
so basically you can create new tabs
within Java as well and also we didn't
have to just set up a textview we could
have done again a reference to a layout
of some sort if we would have preferred
so hopefully guys kind of understood
that tutorial I know it's kind of quick
and we I don't know hopefully it wasn't
too complicated though but I'll catch
you guys in the next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
