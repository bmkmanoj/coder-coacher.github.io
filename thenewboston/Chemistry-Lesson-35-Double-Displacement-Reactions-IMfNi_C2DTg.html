34th chemistry tutorial in this tutorial
we're going to be talking about double
displacement reactions now in the last
tutorial we talked about single
displacement reactions which was pretty
much substituting one of the chemicals
but in this is ro we're going to be
substituting more than one to be
specific to hence the word double so if
you guys don't know what I'm talking
about let me go ahead and give you guys
real easy example say you have the
compound a B and you combine it with x
and y well after a double displacement
reaction takes place you would have
something like ax and also B Y so if you
guys still can't see what's going on you
basically take one of the chemicals over
here and put it over here and take
something from over here and put it over
here and therefore you have to
completely new molecules pretty sweet
huh so let's go ahead and take a look
take a lake what now don't take a lake
let's take a look at a real-life example
say we have something like silver
nitrate
now silver nitrate is a G n oh well nice
three there it looks like a backward C a
G no.3 now we can go ahead and combine
this with potassium chloride and the
formula for that is K C L now whenever
we do we pretty much have a double
displacement reaction that takes place
our silver is going to go ahead and
combine with our chlorine just like that
and also our potassium is going to go
ahead and combine to form potassium
nitrate and that is K no.3 so if you
can't see what's going on by now we
basically took this potassium and moved
it over here and we took this silver and
moved it over here and in the process we
ended up with two completely new
chemicals or compounds so now let's go
ahead and balance this baby and I'll
show you guys a really quick way to
balance kind of complex reactions and
you guys don't have to use this
technique but if you want to feel free
so I go ahead and I write all my
chemicals first silver nitrogen oxygen
potassium and chlorine
and then I go ahead and write the number
of each okay so we have one silver one
nitrogen three oxygen one potassium and
one chlorine and I do the exact same
thing on the other side
silver nitrogen oxygen potassium and
chlorine now let me go ahead and count
them up on this side okay we have one
silver one nitrogen three oxygens see we
got one potassium and one chlorine so
now from here is just easy we z we just
go ahead and make sure that they all
match and if they do then we didn't
invent or destroy any chemicals in
process so are we good to go I'll give
myself a nice little smiley face and a
head and nice little body party party
all night long so now let me go ahead
and give you guys a little bit more
complex reaction because hey we need to
take things up a notch if you want to
complete your homework assignment oh you
didn't know there was a homework
assignment did you well surprise biatch
sorry
that's probably why they don't show my
tutorials in schools because I say
stupid things like that but anyways say
we have something like hydrochloric acid
so we have hydrogen and it's combined
with chlorine now if we go ahead and
combine this with n a Oh H what happens
is we end up with HOH and if you never
seen that before it's because most
people write it like this
h2o but I wrote it like this for a
specific reason and I'll take guys about
that later on and also our sodium is
going to go ahead and combine with our
chlorine so if you guys are saying what
the heck is going on okay what we did is
we have this oxygen and hydrogen bottom
together we pretty much took this
hydrogen and shifted it over there and
that's why I wrote it like H Oh H
because we took a hydrogen and combine
it with the oxygen and hydrogen but you
can more technically and correctly write
it like this
h2o either way it makes sense and also
what we did is we took this sodium and
combined it with our chlorine so then we
got this little baby right there so we
pretty much use double displacement
reaction to form two brand-new chemicals
BAM wham bam thank you ma'am however the
heck the saying goes so now let me go
ahead and talk you guys through your
homework what I'm going to do is I'm
going to give you guys calcium chloride
now this is cacl2 and i'm going to go
ahead and combine this with two
molecules of silver nitrate so we have
two agno3 now what happens whenever you
combine these is you have a double
displacement reaction that takes place
and you get calcium nitrate which is C a
and that's a parenthesis right here I
know I you know kind of wrote that weird
no.3 and 2 and you also end up with
something else and I'll write that is a
question mark your job is to find out
what this thing is right here but before
I continue I might as well tell you guys
this because I don't think I mentioned
this before but whenever you have
parenthesis I might as well draw those
in blue so it kind of stands out what
that means is you basically have a
what's it called a subscript right here
and you multiply that subscript by
whatever is in the parentheses and the
reason that we don't have the subscript
out here is because that would mean we
would have to calcium's as well so
basically in this little piece right
here we have one calcium we have two
nitrogens
and we have six oxygens so there's a
little hint because remember whenever
you have a subscript right after
parentheses that only applies to what is
in the parenthesis and not outside so
again if you don't know what I'm talking
about then ah I'll explain it probably
in the upcoming tutorials and I actually
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
change things up I'm actually going to
answer this homework problem in the next
tutorial so if you don't know what I'm
talking about then you will then but if
you get what I'm saying that you only
take what's ever in the parentheses and
times that by two so pretty much you
have two of this molecule right here
then you can go ahead and answer this
question so the question is
what do you have left what molecule is
it and how many of them first person
answer gets to donate five dollars to me
so congratulations good luck and I'll
see you guys in the next tutorial where
we will be answering this question so
thanks for watching don't forget to
subscribe and I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
