illustrator cs6 tutorial today we're
going to learn some cool selection
techniques because there's a bunch of
different selection tools in Adobe
Illustrator that are different from
other programs so if you check over here
on the left our selection tools are
going to be this top section here which
are divided by this little divider right
above the pen tool we've got the
selection tool we've got the direct
selection tool which also has a group
selection tool in it we got the magic
wand tool and we've got the lasso tool
and now if you're proficient in
Photoshop or you've used Photoshop
before you'll recognize some of these
and then some of these you might not
recognize like the direct selection tool
this isn't something you use it would
use in Photoshop so let's start off with
the selection tool and this is the basic
tool that you're going to use for
selecting objects and moving them around
and everything like that the hotkey for
the tool is V and you'll want to
remember that and always use it because
you're going to be using the regular
selection tool a lot so all you need to
do to use this is just position your
arrow over the object on the edge on the
path or if it has a fill then just click
on it and the fill and you're going to
get that are you going to be able to
select the object now this object
doesn't have a fill but it's a spiral
which is a it's just a pass so I click
on the path I wanted to show you that if
you create an object I'll create an
object real quick that doesn't have a
fill so I created a circle no fill in it
when i go to click inside since it has
no Phil I'm unable to select it now you
can also click and drag to create a
marquee which is this square box here
that with the dotted lines and if you
drag it across part of the object you're
going to be able to select the object if
you have an object here that's closed
and it doesn't have any fill in it you
can also use your box or selection or
your marquee selection here and drag and
it'll select the actual object there so
you just can't click to select but you
can marquee select
that I'm just going to delete this out
of here same thing with this here if I
go to try to use my marquee selection
it's not going to do anything because
this is just an open path it's not
closed I'm going to have to actually
click on the path or drag the marquee
selection through some of the path for
it to get selected now if you want to
select multiple items then you're going
to want to click on one and then hold
the shift button down this allows you to
click on more than one and this adds
these to your selection box now I can
move all these if I wanted to now if the
object has a fill you're able to click
in the mitten a center of it and drag it
around if it doesn't and you try to
click and drag it's not going to work
and everything's going to get deselected
now you can use your rectangle marquee
as well you can select over everything
or you can just select through
everything and it will select all the
paths that were involved so those are
some tips and another cool thing that I
like with the selection tool is if you
select something then hold alt and click
and drag it's going to make a duplicate
for you so I thought that was really
neat and that's a pretty good time saver
the next thing that we've got is the
direct selection tool and with the
direct selection tool here the white
arrow on the toolbar here you're able to
select the individual points and the
segments of your paths so the direct
selection tool has the hot key of a so
when I click on this object here we're
going to be able to see these points i
can click on the path and i'm able to
just drag it around that's my segment or
if i go ahead and zoom in we can see
that there's some points here i can edit
these points there we go and move them
around to create to modify the actual
object there's also a couple there's
also handles on here that can drag to
also modify the object and I'll go over
those later on I'm going to zoom back
out let's put this in an area because
I'm want to be OCD there we go so that's
a bout the direct selection tool now the
same principles that were used with the
selection tool can use be used on the
direct selection tool let me select this
object here and we can see we've got
points here that are easy to find and if
I click and drag I'm able to select more
than one point and I want to go to move
them both of the points are going to
move I can also use shift to select
multiple points and when I go to move
them it's going to be like that you can
see a little trick there how to create
an arrow and that's a pretty much it
with the direct selection tool its
maintenance for editing your points I
click on my path I'm able to click and
drag on the path I think I went over
that already but that's it on that let's
go to the lasso tool which is the fourth
one down and the hotkey is Q now the
lasso tool you want to use that when you
want to select the shapes that are like
closest shapes you don't want to select
so for example you are trying to use
like a 4 i'll just show you how to use
it you go ahead and click and drag oops
i went through the actual path there we
go
went and I still only want to select
these three here so i use my lasso tool
to only select that area there we go so
hopefully you can see like the use for
the lasso tool you need to pretty much
close your shape but let me try this
going on here and I pretty much just
went around the shape or went through
these shapes here and I was still able
to select these without actually closing
my shape as you can see if I try to do
like this all the shapes are going to
get selected so you don't have to go
around in a complete circle there's some
more artifact and I was talking about
that happen in my last tutorial too
alright so that's those you can select
single or multiple objects using the
lasso tool um when you hold the shift
key it adds line segments and fills them
so see there what's going to hear and
select these line segments so there you
go
that's how you use the lasso tool the
next two we got is the magic wand tool
so go ahead and take that and you can
just select entire objects with the
magic wand tool as well it's the one
it's a hot keys is why as you can see on
the tooltip there and it actually looks
like a magic wand so that's why it's
named that you don't have to drag things
to select with the magic wand tool so
that's what's what's good about it it
creates a selection based on the ships
and brightnesses within the image so if
there's like a definable color shift
it's only going to select the color that
you have picked which is actually not
easy to demonstrate with these but see
if I can figure out a way to make this
work a little better so what I'm going
to do is create another cult or create
another shape with the same color as
this red square so let me click create
an ellipse here and i'll just bring up
the stroke so they kind of look the same
so now they're deselected if i take the
magic wand tool here and i go ahead and
select this you can see that the red
here are the red square is also selected
so you're just selecting based on color
if i go to select the blue here it's
going to deselect these two colors
because they're not the same color and
all I select blue so that's how the
magic wand tool works pretty easy use it
for selecting colors pretty much now
what if you want to select more than one
color all you gotta do is hold down
shift when you're selecting and you can
get to see a little plus sign there and
when you select or click it's going to
select more than one color if you hold
down alt it's going to deselect the
colors that you didn't want while
leaving the other colors that you did
have selected still selected so that's
how you add and take away different
selected colors so I guess that's all I
really wanted to go over for these
selection tools so yeah it's a different
techniques on how to select things
depending on how your project is set up
and what you need to do so hope you guys
learned a little bit about this these
tools and can put them to use in your
next project give me a thumbs up down up
down below if you like the video and
you'll learn something and thanks a lot
for watching see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
