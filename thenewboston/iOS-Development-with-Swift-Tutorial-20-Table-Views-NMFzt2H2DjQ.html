this tutorial what I was going to do is
explain a little bit more about those
storyboards and scenes and you know how
to customize transitions and everything
like that but what I want to do before
that is actually talk to you about
something called table views because
once we understand table views we're
going to understand how to create
navigation systems a whole lot better
and table views you've seen them all
before if you go to like your settings
they're a bunch of table views in those
so right now just think of it like a
list all those enlists you see that you
can click on those our table views and
you can actually customize them to look
a lot different from one another but you
see this right here whenever you click
on it it takes you to a new scene you
can actually have table views that don't
take you to new scenes just do anything
and again this is just a list you can
have it with just text you can have
images on it icons and I know that we
didn't even understand how to create
them yet but whenever we do I want to
mention this thing that confuses a lot
of people whenever you have something
that looks like this with different
sections or different categories a lot
of people think that you create for
example three separate table views this
entire thing is just one table view you
can just specify that okay this table is
going to have three different sections
so a lot of people you know whenever
they're first starting out they try to
create a different table for each
category but that's not how you do it
you guys are going to see why that is
important later on so let me just slide
that down and alright so what I did in
this example is I pretty much just made
a blank project nothing new single View
application and if you hop over to your
storyboard since we're going going to be
learning about table views we should
probably add one right now so you guys
are probably like alright there it is
right there table view controller drag
that uh-huh check this out go ahead and
type in table and you see that we have
three things that pop up a table view
controller a table view in the table
view cell now a table view
CEL is just one of the individual rows
so again it could just be text it could
have text in the little icon like a
right arrow it could have a little image
but all of those are individual cells so
we don't want that because we don't even
have a table yet what we want is this
right here
table view so take this and drag it out
and make sure that it doesn't cover your
status bar or the battery on top so just
add it right around there
look and sweep and again we want to make
sure that this appears good on every
device and I'm going to be using the
iPhone 5 to test right now and we can do
this in a lot of different ways we can
add constraints like before but the real
quick and easy way is if we go to editor
and then we click resolve auto layout
issues we can just use reset to
suggested constraints and then we pretty
much just let Xcode guess how we want
our layout right now and we can tweak it
later on but if we run this in the
simulator and we could say all right
look in pretty good right now those
default ones you gave us looks like
they're fine so again right now if you
hold down your mouse and scroll you can
see that we can indeed scroll through
this table but uh you know we have a
problem like this is a pretty cool app
right now we could just put on the app
so recall like scroll master 8000 but it
would probably be a little bit more
useful if we added some content to the
table and also a lot some functionality
so that the user could click and
something actually happened so let's go
ahead and figure out how to do that
right now
so the way that you add data to your
table is going to be different for every
project that you make you can do it in a
couple different ways the first thing
that you can do is you can make an
entirely new file an entire new class
specifically for adding and updating
those on different table cells but what
we want to do is we just want to say you
know what let's just use this class the
view controller right now so first of
all and complete all that crap
I really hate these comments delete that
and might as well just delete this whole
function we won't need it
or method alright so hop over to your
main storyboard and we want to say that
for the contents of this table look to
the viewcontroller look to the brains of
this scene right here so how do we do
that well if you highlight your table
view we can do is you can open open up
your connections inspector and that's
this little symbol with a circle and the
right arrow and from here you're looking
for the outlet data source now this data
source is saying okay this is the source
of my data this is all the contents of
the table so right now it doesn't know
where it's at is it in this file this
file of this file where the heck is it
well since we want to use this view
controller as the data source then what
we can do is we can take this little
button and drag it over to this yellow
symbol this yellow symbol of course okay
scroll down you son of whoa
all right so highlight that again so
this yellow controller it says view
controller it pretty much resembles this
file the brains behind the scene so now
if I drag it and release it we can see
in the connections inspector it says
okay the data source is now in the view
controller so now I'm trying to populate
my table hop over to the view controller
and uh where the heck's the data well
that's what we have to add right now so
how do we add data once it points to the
right file well the first thing we have
to do we have to use a class called UI
tableview datasource that allows this
class right here to act as a data source
for a table so whenever we did that it
gives us an error because it's saying
okay you are using this protocol right
here so now since you promised to act as
a data source you need to implement the
proper methods so what methods do we
need to implement whenever we're acting
is that source well there are three
really important methods that
first one is how many sections are in
your table so we need to make a method
that says okay for this example we'll
only use one but if you're making on
something like this then you might use
three so let's take care of that method
first and the method is called number of
sections in table views so just type in
number hit enter and all this does is we
have to return one alright so that was
probably the easiest thing we'll ever do
so this function again just says how
many sections are in your table well
just one for right now the other
question we have to answer is how many
rows are in your table so I'm going to
be making the table do I have one two
three four five six seven eight like
this one do I have like 50 like this one
well it really doesn't matter for this
example I'll just um I'll just like have
three or something because once you know
how to populate one row you're going to
learn how to populate 100 so this is
actually table view and this is going to
return an int so again I'm just going to
return 3 for right now and this is
pretty much saying that we're going to
make a table view and it's going to have
three rows so let me add a comment
return int how many rows and for this
one I'll just say how many sections are
in your table so right now our table has
one section one chunk and it has three
rows I'll just pull like three people's
names and them whatever now the last
thing we have to do you probably could
have figured out is it's going to say
okay now I know how big to make your
table you're going to have one section
three rows but what are the contents of
it what do you want me to stick in those
table cells so that's what the last
function is for umm oh just right like
what are the contents of each
so now the function for this is table
view and it's going to return you a if I
could find it
uitableviewcell so again these are named
the same function name but this one
returns a table view cell because all
right don't have enough space right here
actually let me just do that might be a
little bit actually you know what I'm
gonna get rid of that one there we go
all right looking sweet so this one says
okay what I'm going to do is I'm going
to build you a table it's going to have
one section and it's going to have three
rows now every single time that I create
a row I'm going to call this method
right here and what this method has to
do is it's going to say okay I'm going
to return to you the contents for each
one so the first time it calls it it
might return on alternative the second
time it might return alternative and
Punk and the last time it might return
the word classical so with those three
methods it can now build a table so now
you see that most of the errors are gone
we only have this one right here because
we actually need to write some code in
here so since this indeed returns a cell
let's go ahead and just make an object
for that so far cell is equal to UI
table view cell alright thought it would
auto populate a little bit faster than
that but whatever it's cool it's cool
alright so we know that eventually we
need to return that cell but right now
if we just ran it we would just be
returning it in empty cell with nothing
in it and that's boring so what I want
to do is actually take that cell in by
default every single cell in your table
has a text label kind of like um just a
basic bit of text that you can write in
and access it you actually just call
text label and if you throw a question
mark there checks if it's empty or not
and the property that we want to access
is text and just throw anything in there
like bacon so what this is doing again
you would never do this in a real
application but it's saying okay we're
going to get a reference to the cell
that we're supposed to return we're just
going to add the word bacon to it and
then we're going to return it so now if
I build this check out what happens it
says okay I did exactly what you told me
to do I created one table view it has
three rows and for each row I call this
method and what did you want me to do
well you just wanted me to add the word
bacon to the cell and that's it so we
now have a table that says bacon three
times all right pretty stinkin I mean
it's it's pretty cool I have to admit
but it'll probably get a little bit
better if we learn how to use an actual
data source like a tuple or a database
or something like that so in the next
tutorial I'm going to show you guys how
to do that it's going to be sweet so
I'll see you guys then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
