this video what I'm going to do is we're
going to be adding a little bit of code
onto the existing program and I'm going
to show you guys how to listen for
multiple events or different events with
the same widget so of course a click
isn't the only thing that we can do with
this button we can also hold it down we
could also fling it we could drag our
finger across that we could do a bunch
of different things to it so in this
example I just showed you guys how to
set up an onclicklistener a button wait
for someone to click you but what if
someone takes your finger and they just
hold it down on the button well that's
not a click but it is a different event
so anytime you want to listen for a
different event it's really easy but
there's some weird things as well then
I'm going to talk you guys through so go
ahead and take that again my pro should
mention this make sure that you are
outside your entire listener and
directly underneath it
Lucky's button what we wanted to do is
we're going to set up set on log click
listener now a long click is kind of
just like it sounds but again a click is
when you just press it with your finger
real quick attack almost so click is the
tab now a long click is whenever your
finger is on that button for longer than
a second so it's essentially the same as
holding it down so again tap holding it
down just think of it like that be a
little bit easier to understand now for
this what we need to do is we need to
make a new interface button again this
is on long click listener it's a little
bit different than this one
so make sure that you don't get confused
actually if you ever get in hair when
after you're done typing all your code
it's probably because you got on click
listener and on one click listener mixed
up whenever they're Auto filling on they
sometimes get confused many ways just
like before public
the lien on lawn click and we'll just
pissed view V like before alright so
again this is our online click or
holding down and this is a response
whenever we do that this is how we want
to handle it so I am actually just going
to take this because this is the exact
same and instead of a good drop house
actually right here I'll right I'll keep
that the same and I'll write something
stupid like holy carp that was a long
one alright so that's pretty stupid now
there's one other thing that we need to
do because look at this why are we
getting this little red squiggly line
missing a return statement that's weird
because we didn't have a return
statement up here I mean all we needed
to do is say ok this is what we want to
happen whenever the user clicks the
button so why do we need a return
statement right here let's just go ahead
and return true to make it happy and
I'll talk to you guys through why we
need a return statement whenever we have
an on long click that occurs on our
button we need to return true and this
is essentially telling Android hey I
handled this click the user did
something but we took care of it alright
now the reason that we need to do that
because if we didn't then that event
would not it would be called not being
consumed or not being handled so if an
event occurred and it doesn't get
handled by this bit of code then it
passes it along to here so again if your
finger is on the screen and it doesn't
occur long enough for an online click
event to happen then they get it's going
to get passed on to the next listener
which is on click however whenever we
return true it says ok that finger on
the screen event it was
show you a long click instead of a click
so hey click listener you can go back to
sleep but listen for something else
because we already took care of it so
now let me actually go ahead and run
this alright so here we are and the
first thing I'm going to do is just
click this like normal so I'm just going
to tap it real quick and of course
whenever I do
as expected the onclicklistener kicked
in and it said good job Hoss and now
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
hold down on my mouse and not release it
and whenever I do that it says holy carp
that was a long one so now I'm going to
release pretty cool and actually if you
click this again and it goes back to
good job Haase because that listener
still occurs so click hold down holy
carp that was a long one again what's
happening is whenever we're holding down
it said ok some kind of event occurred
but ok we took care of it right here
return true so no need to check if it
was anything else because that event was
taken care of now for your homework
assignment the next challenge is type in
this code exactly like I have and what I
want you to do is pass in return false
right here and whenever you click and
hold down write a forum response and
tell me what happens in that case and if
you get it correct you are ready to move
on to the next video but if you don't
get it correct then do not watch my next
video goodbye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
