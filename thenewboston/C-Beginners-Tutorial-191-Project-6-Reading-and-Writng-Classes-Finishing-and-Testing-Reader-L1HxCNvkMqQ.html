ninety-first c-sharp tutorial that I'm
making for the new Boston and in this
tutorial we're gonna continue working in
our reader class so in the previous
tutorial we read strings and in this
tutorial we just really have to read
characters so we're just going to create
a method right here that will read a
character at the current position so let
me say public character character and
then we're just going to have our binary
reader read a character at the current
position let me say BR dot read
character just a single pair of dirt and
then we're just gonna have it return the
character that it read to the caller so
just missed a return here and whenever
the user calls this method it will
basically just read a character at the
current position and then return it
alright so there really wasn't much of
that method but next method we just have
to read characters so just a character
array so just a public character array
three characters and then we're just
going to have a return on the characters
read at the current position there were
just a turn pr3 two characters and we
just need to have the user actually pass
the amount of characters that they want
to read through this method so instead
in amount and then we're just gonna have
it pass that amount right through that
read characters method in the binary
reader class alright and you may be
wondering why we're not having it
reversed this well that's because
characters are almost never stored
backwards so if you're trying to read
like a character array or something and
they restored like you're never gonna
see like Adam written backwards you're
like ma da your juice now we're going to
see that so it's always written forward
if you want to throw that in there
that's up to you but I'm just gonna
leave it the way it is
alright so now our reader class is
complete so I highly advise you to put
in summaries like I've been saying to
put a summary in reach method so you can
tell the user what each method actually
does but now that we have the reader
class complete let's just go ahead and
make sure that it works so we're going
to go right here and
on our form just make sure if you have a
button and then just go ahead and double
click on it all right and then you're
gonna want to make sure that you're
using your namespace that you created so
remember inside of our class file I
named mine Adams IO and chances are you
didn't name yours Adams IO you probably
named it something else so just make
sure that you have that namespace you're
using that alright so now it's gonna
want to create and then grouping file
dialog so we can actually access a file
so I'm gonna say ok file dialog ofd
you can use the new or the file dialog
and show that file open file dialog so
log equals dialog result ok we actually
didn't select the file in the Open File
dialog then we're going to open a new
leader and the reader in the class that
we created right here follow the leader
so we're just going to say reader leader
I'm just going to call it R and set it
to leader and then as you can see here
we have two options we can pass through
just a path to a file that we wanted to
read or we can pass through a path to a
file that we want to read and a byte
order and be folly the byte order will
be set to big-endian because remember we
set that so we're just gonna say ofd
finally because we don't need to change
the endian type it's fine big-endian
alright and then we're just going to
have it read in 32 so we're going to say
on message box box show our read in 32
and then it's going to want to convert
that into a string and I'm putting an X
in there so that will return it in
hexadecimal so we can actually see if it
did read it correctly so we were to save
this file right here and have it read an
in 32 right at the beginning we should
get 0 0 or 1 0 0 6 4 let's just make
sure that this works
open that untitled file on my desktop
and we get 4 1 0 0 6 4 and the reason
that it didn't put two zeroes at the
beginning is because there's no me too
it's like the same thing and putting
one instead of zero zero zero one it's
the same thing all right so now we know
that our reader works you can go ahead
and go through and make sure that every
single method works and if it doesn't
just go back to the tutorial that I
taught you how to do that in so say
you're reading a code string method
doesn't work just go back to this
tutorial I think this previous tutorial
we learned that so just go back to that
tutorial and make sure that your code is
the same as mine all right so see you
