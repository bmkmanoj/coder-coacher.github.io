and I will be teaching you about Adobe
After Effects I was drinking with Bucky
at the bar and we're doing a bunch of
shots and all of a sudden he just asked
me to make them some youtube videos I
was like hey why not sounds awesome so
here I am the version of Adobe After
Effects I'm using right now is cs6 you
can see there and it couldn't figure out
how to get that off jeezum and basically
this first tutorial is going to be a
small introduction I'd like to introduce
you to the workspace and what I like to
have my workspace set up and everything
like that and then I'll teach you more
in a series of tutorials later
so starting as the workspace this whole
area is called your workspace and if you
go to to a window you have workspace
here and there are different types of
workspaces you can create your own and
you can have the standard one I like to
created my own
and I like to use that one and I'll show
you different ways to tweak them also so
over here on your left that I have
highlighted over here this is the
project panel you can import videos
pictures folders and your compositions
will appear here and then you can also
search for the different folders with
your in composition because when you get
on larger projects you'll have a lot of
stuff in here over here in the middle
this is the composition panel this is
where any of your video and/or pictures
will show up and then you can see how
the effects work on them and see what
they look like down here at the bottom
is the timeline panel your different
layers and effects will be shown here
and there is a timeline that will
actually show up in this area and you
can scrub back and forth in it over here
on this side is the effects and presets
panel
I froze no it's unfroze and right here
you can find your different effects so
if you type in something like blur you
can say here's the presets and then
here's your actual effects and then you
can drag them onto your onto your
different video footage or pictures and
to create cool look and stuff here's the
paragraph panel and the way you get to
that is going to window paragraph if you
click on it it'll go away then you click
on it again which it shouldn't be
enabled if you first started After
Effects to click on it and then it'll
appear and a lot of times if you're
doing commercials you're going to be
writing text and it'll be in there and
that is very helpful to have I don't
know why they don't have it on there to
start with but I would recommend putting
it in over there this is your preview
panel and this is where you can do what
they call Ram previews or you can just
do regular previews and it'll show you
your video footage in in order so you
can see how your effects are going to
play out and make sure you can get your
timing and animation looking nice up
here is the info audio panel and pretty
much I never use this unless I need to
find like a color or coordinates or
something like that and mostly if I'm
doing audio I'd do it in a different
program but you can also do it in After
Effects and it's not that bad to do it
but I just basically don't use this
whole section a lot up here is the tools
panel you have different things like
zooming and rotating and you can select
your text from here most of the time
when you get good you're going to not
really use this too much you're going to
want to use your hotkeys because that
speeds up your work way faster so that's
just a basic overview of the of the area
of the screen just wanted to introduce
myself again it's buddy Blackford I'm
doing the After Effects videos for the
new Boston for a while and
I hopefully I'll be doing some other
ones too so I hope you guys continue to
watch and check out my next video see ya</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
