talk to you about partials now partials
are actually really awesome and what
they are is it's a way that you can
include little snippets of CSS into
other sass files so if you have a bunch
of different files that you want to
include in your main one then you can
setup your project that way and I'll
show you guys why this is useful right
now so I took everything out from the
last tutorial so this is my website
right now and let's say that we're
making a social network and we want to
work on the profile page so this is the
profile page I'll change the title to
profile and what do I need on my profile
page well a beautiful image of me of
course so image and we'll just give a
class that we'll design later on so
class will equal let's call it profile
image and I don't know maybe we're gonna
add a border around this later and like
make it circular or something whatever
we decide to do and for the source I
already have a link and this is just my
profile image copy and might as well add
my name at the bottom so Bucky Roberts
all right so let's refresh this now and
so here is our beautiful profile page
clearly going to be the next big social
network look how beautiful this is
alright so let's hop back in our project
and think about how we want to set up
our styling so we know that we're gonna
have a lot of CSS of course because
we're making an entire social network
now we don't want to include every
single rule every single property in
this one main file right here now what
we could do instead is we can actually
group similar CSS into separate files so
for example we're gonna make a file and
all of our CSS for the profile page is
gonna go in one file all of the CSS for
the video player is going to go in
another file and that way we get to
organize it a lot better so anytime you
want to do that let's just hit new file
and take note of the name
convention whenever you're gonna make a
file just to include in another file
started out with a underscore this is a
little indicator to scss that says hey
you're not going to include this in like
any HTML you're just going to include it
in other s CSS files or sass files such
as main sass and want to say sass I'm
just going to say instead of s CSS
because I don't know it's just easier to
say so I'm just gonna hit profile dot
sass and hit OK and now we can start
typing all of our profile page code or
profile page styling right here so let's
go ahead and do that right now so we
actually have the class profile image
and let me just change the height and
width of this so since that's the class
I'll do that and I'll actually change
the border radius too so a border radius
equals let's just do 99 pixels so it's
perfectly round and for the height I'll
just do 200 pixels and same thing for
the width so it's perfectly circular so
200 pixels and what's one other thing I
can do let me add a border around this
image as well so border upper like 5
pixels solid C green all right so now
whenever we apply this class to the
image it should be perfect perfectly
circular and have a thick green border
it's gonna look pretty ugly but oh well
so what we're going to do is since we're
gonna have a bunch of pages we only have
one right now but eventually we're gonna
have profile forum videos about photos
all of these different pages we're gonna
include them all in this main sass file
right here so how do we include this
file right here well all we do whenever
we want to include another sass file is
we just use the symbol @ and then type
the word import this means hey I want to
bring another file in or include another
file now you know how our file was named
underscore profile a CSS well whenever
were
importing it you don't add the
underscore at the beginning and you
don't add the extension at the end all
you do is you type the rod name of the
file such as profile and it already
knows to fill in the rest of it all of
these other things are just indicators
to either your operating system or cess
to let it know what kind of file it is
you don't need it when actually when
you're actually writing the SAS
so we now essentially behind the scenes
took all this copied it and pasted it
right there so now we can you know add
our main styling for the website so
let's say on our website we want the
font size to be like 24 pixels so font
size 24 pixels and boom there you go so
this is how people typically set up
their main website or their overall
structure they have a bunch of different
files and usually they have one file per
page per web page I see that a lot and
your main overall styling so for example
if you want like cosmic sands on the
entire website then you can apply those
in the main CSS file now take note that
we're only linking to the main CSS file
so I'll show you guys in a second what's
going on so that all worked looking good
now we're not linking to the mainland SS
file and profile CSS we're only linking
to this right here but since we imported
profile and and this is what a compiled
- you see this is may not CSS the actual
CSS it brought in this other file Pro
FATA scss source s and also included all
of the generic code for your website as
well so you can imagine that instead of
you know having tens and thousands of
lines of one file instead we can just
have a couple import statements and it
allows you to organize your entire
website a whole lot easier so there you
go
that's what a parcel is basically a
little snippet of code that you can
include in other files pretty cool
pretty awesome see
