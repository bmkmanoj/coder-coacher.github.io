position from the bottom of the web
bottom of the browser basically so from
the bottom we want it 40 pixels and if
we didn't have this it would just sit
right on the bottom right here like our
footer is well we actually want to take
this and move up 40 pixels because
remember this footer is 40 pixels tall
so that'll make sure it sits right on
top so the bottom of the drop up menu is
right there now how do we sty style it
to make it look cool well as you notice
there is a border a thin black border on
the left-hand side on top and on the
right-hand side but on the bottom you
really don't want to make a border
because you want to look like make it
look like it's growing from this button
so for the border bottom go ahead and
set none and actually if you do this
border 1 pixel solid then you can either
just like make it black or if you want
to not make anything black you make it
11 11 11 it's like a very dark almost
black what you can do is whenever you
add this border adds border around
everything and then you overwrite it to
say okay keep all the other borders but
don't have a border bottom take away the
border on the bottom and that'll make
sure that you have this effect of border
on the left top right but not the bottom
and after this right now it would just
inherit the background or maybe have a
default background if you set the
settings before but what we want to do
is we want to set the background to
transparent so you see how the
background of this entire drop up list
you can kind of see through it well I
did this by making the opacity fifty
percent so you guys already know how to
do this rgba it's black of course 000
0.5 which will mean that this background
is 50% opaque you can see throughout
fifty percent now the last thing I want
to show you guys how to do is how to
make these edges curved because the cool
thing about this is that
top left corner in the top right corner
have a slight curve to them which is
awesome and on bottom it doesn't have
any curve at all because if you had a
curve on bottom it'll look like more of
a pop-up box instead of a drop up menu
so in order to achieve this effect of
having two corners curved into corners
square this is what you do border radius
which pretty much means how curvy do you
want your corners you go 7 pixels 7
pixels 0 pixels 0 pixels now this is the
order that you have to write it in
whenever you're determining the curve
Venus of your corners first of all the
more pixels that you do the more curvy
it is because it says ok count 7 pixels
over and then curve it but anyways just
remember this the more pixels that you
do the more curvy it is so this is the
order at the top left corner the top
right corner the bottom right corner and
the bottom left so I know that's really
weird and by the way border radius is
kind of a weird name for like curvy
corners by anyways just remember that so
anyways the order that you do it is like
I said top left top right bottom right
bottom left so my top left corner curves
7 pixels my top right corner curve 7
pixels my bottom right and bottom left
corner each curve 0 which means
perfectly square corners so that's how
you achieve that effect so now we got
this basic entire drop menu styled now
what we need to do is style these
individual item elements so calculator
group chat you see how each one is kind
of you know first of all it has some
padding and it also has a little border
on the bottom two separate each elements
that's where we're going to be learning
to do in the next video so think guys
for watching and I'll see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
