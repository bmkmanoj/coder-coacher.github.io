building our
so now that you got everything picked
out first thing we want to do is take a
look at our motherboard that's this
thing right here so let's go ahead and
open it and see what we got all right my
motherboard came with hard drive cables
or these are all IDE cables this is what
they look like and also SATA cables with
a four pin converter on it um I don't
know if we're gonna need these or not
our other hard drive might come with
them hang on to them just in case this
little thing that comes with your
motherboard you definitely need this is
the piece that plugs into your case now
your case already has a generic one but
this is specific to your motherboard so
make sure you keep this now well we've
all been waiting for
enough of the boring stuff let's take a
look at our motherboard now this bag
that it comes in is an anti-static bag
so well so nothing just in case you
wanted to know so let's take this out
instructions make sure that you keep any
CDs that you get you're gonna want to
install all of these once your
computer's installed in your operating
systems around so hold on to that and
hold on your instruction set it to the
side for now
now close the top of your motherboard
box what I'm trying to do this with one
hand and uh you set your motherboard
right on it take it out
and there you have it now this is our
motherboard doesn't it look beautiful
now a quick tour of our motherboard here
is the IDE here is the main where we're
gonna plug in our power supply this is
the 24 pin 8 X 12 e this is our
frontside bus these are for any cards
all these slots these are our components
like where our USB ports plug in here's
our SATA adapters right here and this is
our battery that stores all the BIOS
information and keeps our time and stuff
in this right here is where we're going
to be putting our processor so that's
your $2.00 tour of the motherboard so
let's go ahead and get our processor
ready</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
