fifth physics tutorial and in this story
we are finally going to be jumping into
multiplication with scientific notation
sounds fun oh it is well the thing is
multiplication is a lot different than
addition and subtraction when working
with scientific notation now I'll tell
you guys the rules of how to do it and
then I'll walk you guys through a couple
examples the very first thing we need to
do is we can't just go ahead and figure
out these numbers and then multiply them
by each other we could but it would just
get really messy so I'm going to show
you guys a really easy way what we do is
we take this number the one without the
exponent and we're gonna multiply it by
this number and then what we're gonna be
doing after that is taking this and
multiplying it by this and then we're
gonna be multiplying those together so I
know that sounds kind of confusing right
now but trust me I'll show you guys
right now what I'm talking about so the
first thing we need to do is take six
point seven one and multiply it by this
number right here which is 2.3 and then
what we need to do is multiply that by
this by this what am I talking about 10
to the third times 10 to the fifth so
basically these numbers time these
numbers is going to give us our answer
so what is six point seven one times 10
to the three well the answer to that is
15 point four three three and now let's
go ahead and multiply it 10 to the third
times 10 to the fifth now in order to
multiply 10 to the whatever power here's
what you do
it's 10 to the 3 plus 5 that's the rule
for multiplying those numbers so what we
have here is 15 point 4 3 3 that doesn't
change times 10 to the 8th just like
that and if we look at this this is kind
of in scientific notation already the
only thing we need to do is we need to
change our decimal point from here to
over here so in order to do that we
just go ahead and put one point five
four three three times ten to the ninth
just like that and this is our finer and
final answer there you go so there you
go that's how you do that just remember
whenever you're multiplying one number
in scientific notation by another number
in scientific notation pull this number
and this number and multiply them by
each other and then the two other
numbers in multiplying by each other so
let me go ahead and walk you guys
through another example so in that
example we use three and five which are
two positive exponents now let me go
ahead and use negative four and negative
two
it's a little bit different but it's
basically the same thing so again
remember the very first thing we need to
do is grab 3.2 and I did that again
three point two and six point one so
three point two times six point one
surround those in parentheses times ten
to the negative fourth times ten to the
negative two so again three point two
times six point one is nineteen point
five two I think yeah I'm pretty sure so
now what we need to do is times I'm not
even going to go ahead and I'm just
gonna step skip that one step so what
you do is you basically have negative
four plus negative two so ten to the
negative six because remember negative
four if you add negative two to it then
you end up with negative six so that's
how I'm coming up with that exponent
right there so now we have to figure out
this whole thing right there so
basically if you take away those
parentheses we're basically in
scientific notation right now nineteen
point five two times ten to the minus
six that's a variation of scientific
notation however if our teacher only
wants one digit to the left hand side of
the decimal then what we need to do is
put one point nine five two
times 10 to the negative 5 so that's
probably what they're looking for right
and I can't circle this right there
so 1.95 2 times 10 to the negative 5 is
our answer that's going to get us all of
that bonus points and give me some
cookies biatch that's what you should
say to your teacher if you get it right
you know I probably won't take that
advice but okay one more example in this
last example I have a positive exponent
and we're going to multiply it by a
scientific notation number with a
negative exponent so in order to do that
again the same rules still apply we're
gonna grab 3.18 and we're going to times
it by 9.8 and we're gonna take that
number n times by 10 to the third times
10 to the negative 5 so let's go ahead
and figure out 3.1 eight times 9.8 first
and the answer to that is 31 point one
six four and now what you need to do is
times that by again I'm gonna skip this
step three plus negative five is
negative two so I'm just going to go
ahead and write 10 to the negative two
and again we are kind of in scientific
notation right there already but what we
can do is I'm not even going to write
this number in scientific notation
because it's easier to see if you just
write point three one one six four in
standard notation and I wrote that kind
of messy so I'll clean enough for you
guys three one one six four so there you
go and I don't know if I told this to
you guys but basically whenever you have
something in the range of 10 to the
negative 3 or 10 to the positive 3
anything that can fit in between there
you don't need to write in scientific
notation that's the general rule however
if you have a teacher or really anal
you know boss or something he may make
you always write in scientific notation
but I just think that writing you know
three point one one six four times ten
to the negative one is a lot more
confusing than just writing this it's
really simple when you have small
numbers so I mean you can convert the
number one point five in a scientific
notation if you want but it's just
stupid you know what I'm saying
so anyways that is basically how you
multiply using scientific notation so in
the next story I'm gonna be talking
about dividing which is a whole nother
beast so uh yeah thank you guys for
watching never get subscribe and I'll
see you guys in the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
