your 17th intermediate Java tutorial and
in this tutorial we're going to be I'm
going to be beginning to teach you guys
about generic classes and methods and
first a generic method
now what generic method is is it's
pretty much in a way that a way that you
can eliminate overloaded methods so you
know that an overloaded methods are used
to perform pretty much the same thing
depending on what type of data it has so
instead of having like ten overloaded
methods with each different type of data
it would be real nice if we could just
have one method in that no matter what
type of data we pass the end it will
perform the same action of each so let's
go ahead and I'm going to first show you
guys an example of just two simple
overloaded methods and then from there
I'll show you the problems that they
create and how we can fix it by building
a generic method so let's go ahead and
start with two arrays we'll make an
integer array and I'll just name it I
Rae and just populate it with like four
integers but like one two three four and
now make an array of a different type of
data like character and I'm going to
name my C ray for a character array and
go ahead and put like B got put those in
brackets on B you
see and why or any four characters
that's just a spells my name kind of and
now we have two arrays let's go ahead
and build our own methods that we're
going to create now I'm going to be
created I'm going to be creating a
method called print' me and it's going
to be an overloaded method so it's going
to actually be two different methods and
as one parameter is going to be integer
and the other parameter is going to take
character data so go ahead and put print
me and for the first one pass in the eye
array since this is going to take an
integer array and in that statement and
print me and this one's going to take a
character array so pass in C array so we
got a little error here and it says make
sure that you create the method print me
so let's go ahead and outside of our
main method and this is very important
make sure you're outside it let's go
ahead and put public static void print
me and the first one we're going to
create is the integer or it so integer
just go ahead and name the variable I
and in order what do we want to put as a
code in this print me let's just go
ahead and put for integer X and treat it
as I just an enhanced for-loop system
out print F and let's go ahead and just
print out the array nothing of fusing so
go ahead and as a format let's go ahead
and put string space right there and as
argument go ahead and pass X and what
this is going to do is loop through your
injury rate and print each element one
by one so after that let's just go ahead
and print a blank line so our code
actually looks readable so sound print
line so now we have one method bill and
this is the print me method that takes
integer data but say we have another
type of array right here and we need to
make another print me for this as well
so let's go ahead and copy this and
paste the whole thing underneath it and
instead of print me with integer data go
ahead and pass this character data right
in there and you can keep the
I might as well and another thing you
need to do is change this integer to
character right here and let's go ahead
and run this and we should see a code
that works fine it says 1 2 3 4 B you
see why so that's what we want to do and
this is actually a perfectly fine
program that we can build but the
problem is is we only have two types of
data right here so it isn't that big a
problem but say we want to have a method
that's going to take a whole bunch of
different types that a integer character
string long what we want to do is
instead of having like 800 overload
methods it would be nice if we can build
one generic method they can take any
type of data so that's the problem with
having tons of overload methods and
there is an extremely easier way to do
this and I'm going to be teaching you
guys that in the next tutorial so for
now that's all the time I have thank you
