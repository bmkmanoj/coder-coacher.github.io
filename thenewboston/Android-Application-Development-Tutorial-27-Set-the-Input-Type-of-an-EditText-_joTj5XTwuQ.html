seventh Android tutorial we're going to
finish up our toggle button and check it
out make sure it works and the last
story will reset this if-else statement
and basically it's going to check if our
toggle is pressed for or is if it's on
and then it's going to do whatever is in
this statement if it's off its going to
do whatever is within this statement and
it's going to go through this method
every time the toggle button is touched
or pressed because we're clicked I
should say because that's that's how
this works because it we set up an
onclicklistener and every time it's
clicked it's going to go through this
method and check for us now what we can
do is we're going to use the edit text
variable that we set up here and we have
it reference to our edit text in the XML
and we're going to change that so we
called the Edit text input so we're
going to say input and we can it dot and
then what we're going to do is we're
going to set the input type and
basically you know there's the password
type in a textview or number a number
for the most part you can make make them
only be able to put in numbers stuff
like that so we're going to say the
method set input type and as you can see
it's a textview type for the most part
and within the parameters enough I want
to show you that okay
let's copy and paste this and this is
going to be if it's false so if it's off
we don't want to hide the password so
what we're going to do is we're going to
refer to the input type class and say
input type and then hit dot and we have
certain types of you know text that we
can have within our as for our input
type we're going to use the one called
type class text now that's just going to
be able to mean that's just going to be
plain text that you can see nothing
special about it that's how you'd set up
just you know your plain text so if the
toggle is off it's going to be plain
text now we need to kind of do the same
method for if if the toggle is on
and it's going to be a little bit
confusing I mean this tutorial isn't so
much about learning how to set the input
type all kind of that's basically what
this tutorial is so I shouldn't say
that's not what it's about but you know
knowing all the fine details at this
moment isn't that important
it's like we'd like to say we're
building kind of a reference application
that you guys can go back and refer to
when you guys are developing your own
apps so and learn learning the Android
along the way obviously so how we're
going to set the input type to be a
password or the starred or basically a
let's see if I have it pulled up yeah
see like right now if we put Travis this
is kind of setting the password as four
that's what's going to look like it's
going to start out our text so that's
what we're going to set up if the toggle
is set to true or if it's checked on and
we're going to do is say input type dot
type class text again and you're like
what well that we aren't done that's why
I didn't want to set this one up first
this is just saying we can put text
numbers all that good stuff in there and
then we're going to put this line like a
line like that that's not a no basically
that's the I know what that's called
actually but it's then the button right
above your Enter or right above your
return key and you have to hold shift to
hit it so you put that line and then you
also put another input type or refer to
the input type class and hit dot type
text and then variation and variation
password so that's going to change it to
basically back to the stars and I know
that's kind of confusing why we had to
put two different things in there don't
worry about that but yeah that's how
we'd set that up and now again we're
getting in there because we're using the
edit text within a subclass again so
what we're going to do is just change
that edit text to be final and it should
get it should get rid of those errors
now let's check our application make
sure it works again we're just kind of
getting familiar with Java I'll leave
this up for a second so you guys can
pause it and make sure everything's
spelled right within the brackets but
yeah we're just making sure we're just
walking through the Java process still
and making sure you guys are following
along for the most part but uh yeah kind
of a kind of lame tutorial my bad but uh
hopefully you guys will like this
application after we get done it's going
to explain a lot of Java and how we can
reference stuff and use some certain
methods with text so here we go we say
Travis and since it's toggled on it's
under stars well actually since we
define it in XML we said Android :
password equals true it's going to be
stars automatically and we also had this
set set to true as well when we started
and if we toggle off it says Travis then
we can toggle back on so you know kind
of a lame tutorial but hopefully you
learn something about the set type or
input type and set the input type all
right I got a go to bed but I will catch
you guys later
thanks again for watching and have a
good day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
