After Effects tutorial and this time are
this is where I'm going to be talking
about Matt's again but instead of just
using a still picture or graphic is Matt
I'm going to show you how to use an
entire channel as a mat and this gives
you an awesome background effect so
let's go ahead and the first source you
want to work with is your background so
I got on this right here it's just a
video of one of my friends talking
pretending to be a news reporter and go
ahead and drag it in your composition
symbol and it'll make it the exact same
size is your composition now I want that
one first because when I drag another
clip on top of it I want to stack on top
of it so let's go ahead and find another
clip of me talking and as you can see
just put it right in the middle and it
should snap into place so now we have a
video of me and video of my friend
underneath me so the first thing we have
to do is make the video of me black and
white since that's the best way you can
use a matte is to make it black and
white just like the last time that
flower in that little oval i think it
was those images were black and white so
if we're saying alright how do you make
an entire clip black and white well to
make it black and white the first thing
you want to do is go over in your
effects and presets and look for tint it
should be under color correction just
press intent and it pops up so go ahead
and grab that and drag it on your video
as you can see the whole thing turns
black and white and that is a right here
where it says tint you can play around
of that but what we want to do is bring
out the contrast so it's sharp black and
sharper white so let's go ahead and type
in contrast and you see this thing that
says brightness and contrast go ahead
and bring that and drag it over on your
composition and now what we need to do
is over in our effects controls this
automatically pops up go ahead and turn
the contrast all the way to the right
now you can see instead of just
a black and white tent like this like an
old movie we get a sharp black and white
image so again once you add tint and
keep the default to tint the only thing
you have to alter is turn contrast up to
one hundred percent on brightness and
contrast we get this nice cool black and
white video on top of our regular video
right here so this is the first layer
it's going to be the background and this
is the layer that's on top of it it's
going to be the map so let's go ahead
and go to our track man on the very
first layer and go ahead and change it
to the luma matte and as you can see now
once you play my video we now have the
mat of me on the video with the
background of the old video so it's a
lot cooler like you put it up here or
something there we go and that is how
you can use one video as a man in
another video as a background as a still
image so again um that's how you can
combine a mat when using not only a
still image but also videos as well so
again the keys to this is don't forget
to add brightness and contrast turn your
contrast all the way up and also make
your tint black and white so you have a
nice matte to work with otherwise it's
going to look weird so on that's that
for this tutorial I'll play around with
it and do exactly as I did and once you
do you're ready to move on to next
tutorial so thank you guys for watching
don't forget to subscribe and I'll see
you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
