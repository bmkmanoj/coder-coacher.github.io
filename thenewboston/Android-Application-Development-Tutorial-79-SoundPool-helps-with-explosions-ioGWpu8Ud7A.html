Android tutorial for the new Boston what
we're gonna do in this tutorial is
basically work with the soundpool class
because I talked about this quite a few
tutorials ago because again we've used
media player which is for the longer
sounds but when we use explosion sounds
gunshots short audio clips we want to
use the sound pool class I'll kind of
talk about how that's beneficial and why
we do that in this tutorial as well or
maybe the next one I'm not sure how long
the skin.take shouldn't take too long
here but just set up a new class called
sound stuff and get it going within your
menu class within that array and also
within your manifest extends activity on
create nothing new here and then we're
just going to create a new view and
we're just going to call this V for our
view and we're going to say new view and
we're gonna pass in the context for this
and that's just gonna create a new view
for us and now what we're gonna say is
just something like I could gather my
thoughts here v diets an onclicklistener
because we're gonna have basically
whenever they touch the screen we could
say on you know touch listener as well
we're gonna do on click listener and
then we're just gonna say this and then
we're gonna let this activity implement
the on click listener so we can use use
the method there and so then what we
have to do is add the implement methods
and we have our on click method again
nothing new and we're just gonna say set
content view for this view that we just
set up here just going to take a poll
screen and it has a click listener
attached to it so we're gonna save you
and there we go we have our activity set
up now now let's set up our actual sound
pool class so we're gonna say we're
gonna go above this method here for a
sound pool we're just gonna say sound
pool and we're going to call the sound
pool object SP and then just import or
sound pool and we're gonna set up this
SP to be equal to new sound pool object
and within the constructor or within
these parameters is sim back we're going
to
se5 basically this first parameter I'll
show you after we type it out and then
for the second parameter we're saying
Audio Manager dot stream stream music
and they'll just be the way that we're
gonna stream the music and then we're
just gonna hit zero for the third
parameter and there we go we have our
sound pool object set up now basically
if I hover over here you can see it
takes in the three parameters max stream
that's gonna say how many we're going to
allow how many sounds we're gonna allow
at the same time to be able to be plane
so we're gonna have we're gonna allow up
to five explosions I mean this clip is
probably I don't know half a second
third of a second I don't know it's
really short so if there's five
explosions that's probably quite a bit
but this just kind of handles you know
we don't want to have billions of sounds
going all at once it kind of handles how
much how many streams you can have so
we're gonna allow five and the next type
is the way that we want to stream the
audio and just the normal audio manager
for this example for game applications
will normally use a stream music so
that's what we're going to use and the
third parameter it's the sample rate
basically right now it doesn't have any
effect
so set zero to default that third
parameter means it means nothing right
now
because Android Android developers
haven't really set that up yet in the
SDK the next thing we want to do is we
want to actually you know access the
sound from a resource which is our
explosion diode so oh gee gee so let's
get that set up so we're gonna say our
explosion and this is gonna be an int
okay so let's let's set this up here
we're gonna say int explosion
and there we go now we're gonna define
it down here so you spill explosion I
don't know if I spelled that wrong I'm
sorry but some reason that looks wrong
and then we're just gonna say explosion
then we're gonna refer to our sound pool
object that we just created SP dot we're
gonna say load and there's a few
different ways to load if you guys save
the sound within your assets folder you
can use this ask assets file descriptor
and it set the priority or if you have a
string path you can use that as well
and since we're loading from the
resource folder and we're going to use
the ID we're going to use this a third
load which takes context ID and the
priority I'm and the priority basically
has no effect as well and it says use
the value of one use a value of one for
future capability so we're just gonna
click that there for the context we're
gonna say this ID we're gonna say r dot
raw dot
explosion and for a priority again told
us say one for future capability or and
for the third one we're just gonna say
one so there we go we have that
explosion now set up now what we have to
do is we have to just basically play our
explosion so we're gonna say anytime our
view is clicked we're gonna use this on
click method to play our explosion so
we're just gonna say explosion and then
we're gonna say dot play wasn't loading
here okay we're gonna say actually our
our sound pool now down here so we're
gonna say our sound pool dot and now
play and as you can see it takes an int
which is basically that explosion that
we set up left volume a right volume a
priority which is you know zero is the
lowest priority loop zero equals it's
not going to loop and negative one says
it's gonna loop that sound forever which
we don't want and then also the
rate of playback one is normal but you
can also go down to 0.5 or 2 if you want
to change the rate that it plays back so
we're just gonna click this method for
the sound idea we're gonna say explosion
right volume we're gonna say 1 which is
going to be the highest and I'm left
volume 1 and the right volume on the
priority we're gonna set the zero the
loop we want to set to zero because we
don't want it to to loop forever and the
rate we're gonna set to 1 because we
want to playback normally and there we
go we've pretty much done the only other
thing that we can do are that we might
want to do is basically this might take
a little bit to load and if we click
before this explosion and it's loaded it
might give us an error so we're just
going to quickly just say int is going
to equal 0 something like that to start
out with and then once it sets to this
sound pool load up it will change it
from zero and then that's just a way we
can do air checking so we're just gonna
say if explosion does not equal zero
we're going to play otherwise it it
won't it won't play that so there we go
let's just test it out make sure
everything works
all right so let's click on it and I'll
turn up my volume alright already up and
then we just every time we click the
screen
up to five at a time so there we go guys
I'll catch you guys in the next tutorial
have a good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
