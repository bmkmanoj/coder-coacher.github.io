tutorial that I'm making for the new
Boston and in this tutorial I'm going to
be showing you how to open a WAV file
and how to play that sound and I'm also
going to show you how to play default
windows sounds so all you need for this
tutorial is a button an open file dialog
and an if statement checking to see if
the user actually selects a file in the
Open File dialog you're also going to
need to be using the system dot media
namespace because all the classes that
we're going to be working with today
will be located in there alright so the
first thing I'm going to show you is how
to play a WAV file so our going to want
to do is create a new sound player just
type out sound player I'm gonna call it
s and just set it equal to a new sound
player and we're going to pass through
the string sound location and basically
that's just a file path to the wav file
that you want to play we're just going
to do ofe dot file name because it'll be
whatever wav file the user opens in the
Open File dialog in order to play that
you're just going to want to use the
play method inside of the sound player
class so now when we open or click this
button you get an open file dialog then
we'll create a new sound player on using
the path to the file to view there open
and you open file dialog and then we
will play that wav file so now I'm going
to bug you get our open file dialog just
open our test wav testing lasting one
two three
I don't know if you guys could hear that
but I just made that WAV file like be
quick alright and the next thing I
measure you ought to do is keep play
looping so this will just play it over
and over again so now we open this to
display continuously testing testing one
two three testing testing one two three
testing yeah it played it a three times
there and the final match that I'm doing
we're showing you is the place sink and
what this will do is it will when it's
playing it will freeze your application
which I really don't know why you'd ever
want to do that but the other ways of
just playing a sink so that like you can
move your application around and stuff
like that so now let me play it we can't
move our application around testing
testing one two three
yeah we could we have to wait till the
sounders finish line all right so now do
you know how to play WAV files that
you've opened I'm now going to show you
how to play default windows sounds so
just go ahead and type out system sounds
we're going to use in a system sound
class and inside of here are some static
properties first one we're going to be
looking at the asterisk sound and we're
just going to do dot play Q or you can
use the play method to play this sound
so now let me be bug here we should get
just an asterisk sound I don't know if
you could hear that
so I'll click on a few more times yeah
all right the next thing I'm going to be
showing you is the beep and you can do
this with all of these so you just do
the name of the property basically and
then just use the play method to play
that sound so now we should hear a
beeping sound or just a beep yep now
we're going to do the exclamation yep
now we're going to look at the hand
sound I don't so you don't know what
this one sound like okay and it's just
one more leg if the question sound
I don't know this was employed so yeah
that's pretty much it for this tutorial
on using these sounds so that's pretty
much it for this tutorial so see you
guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
