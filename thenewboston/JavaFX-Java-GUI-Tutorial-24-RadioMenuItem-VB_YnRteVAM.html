I want to talk to you guys about is a
radio menu item now a radial menu item
is a little bit different than a
checkbox
because if you guys ever used radio
buttons with websites before you're
gonna know exactly how these work
they're pretty much a group of
checkboxes but you can only have one
selected at a time now a good example of
this is if you want to select the level
or the difficulty for a game you would
either choose easy medium or hard you
can't choose easy and hard at the same
time so that would be one case scenario
where um a radio menu item would be
great so actually make that little
example so difficulty radio menu items
alright so the first thing we're I'm
gonna do is I'm just gonna make a new
menu called a difficulty menu in equals
to new menu difficulty and I got well
piece of hair in my mouth I think it's
for my sweater
I actually bought a sweater from Kohl's
this was like a couple months ago and I
put it on and it smelled like fish and I
was in my mom's car because we were at
the lunch and I go does this sweater
smell like fish and she looked at me
weird and then she smelled it and she
goes wow actually yeah it does so you
know I didn't really care it smell like
fish no big deal alright so what we're
gonna be doing is we're gonna be making
three different menu items easy medium
and hard and in order to group them
together so the users can only select
one we need to make something called a
toggle group so we're gonna be sticking
all of them inside the toggle group and
that will give us the functionality
where the user can only select one menu
item at a time so I'll call it
difficulty toggle set this equal to new
toggle group gotta say slow like that or
else your program will break alright so
now we just need the radio menu items
just say easy equals radio menu item
easy you know this one medium argh
and hard alright so we have three
different menu items and now the next
thing we got to do is just add them to
the group so for easy easy that's how
you gotta sing it gonna set the toggle
group to difficult the toggle difficulty
taco we got my mind is boggled this is
getting out of hand this tutorial is
getting crazy ladies and gentlemen got a
comment down clam it down alright it's
time this up a bit alright so got
everything taken care of the last thing
we need to do is just add all of these
to the menu so difficulty menu get items
at all easy medium and hard you think
that they would just have it where you
can just add this toggle group to the
menu but no and actually let me space
this out so you guys can see what's
going on a little bit easier so again
our going to create three different
items they're all part of the same group
but we have to add them to the menu
manually and of course we actually need
to add this to the menu bar so let's see
what's up alright so difficulty check
easy and then I'm gonna select you know
what I want to go to medium well what
that does is actually uncheck cz and
selects medium and same thing no matter
what you check basically it's just like
this we can only have one selected at a
time so that ladies and gentlemen is
radio menu items thank you for watching
yes now roll the credits</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
