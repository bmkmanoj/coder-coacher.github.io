that we need to install is our power
supply so get your power supply and put
it inside your case and from the back
and let it set right so it fits with the
screw hole for the screw holes on your
case just like this now another thing
you want to make sure that you use the
screws that came with your power supply
and you don't want to use the ones that
came with your case
now go ahead and start screwing it in
and there you go once we have our power
supply mounted we are ready to start
plugging in our components and giving
them all power juicing muffled first
thing I hook up is our 24 pin main
motherboard connector and to do this
it's real easy just push that in until
it clicks come on baby there you go
next let's go ahead and hook up our
optical drive to do that you need one of
these four pin connectors right here and
go ahead take your four pin connector
and plug that right in to your optical
drive
the next thing we're gonna want to do is
hook up our hard drive so let's go ahead
to take our 4 pin connector and once you
got everything hooked up we are good to
go so now that we juiced up all our
components and gave them our power the
last thing that we didn't have to do is
put on our side panel and after we do
this we are ready to go and our computer
is ready to turn on and get operating
system installed in it so thank you for
watching I hope you enjoyed learning how
to build a computer and I actually have
a surprise for you in my next video so
you do want to watch there's one more
video left in this series and I think
you're going to enjoy it a lot thanks
and there you have a guys our very own
custom built computer and again one last
time I am going to have a surprise for
you in my next video and all of you
enjoy it very very much so make sure to
