iphone development tutorial and in the
last order we built this pretty cool
program that we can enter stuff on the
screen I mean we can enter name in our
super secret password but check this out
whenever we want to exit this program
and you know have the keyboard disappear
I mean check this out this number pad
doesn't even have a button to make it
disappear and whenever we click done on
this regular keyboard it doesn't work so
we're like WTF what's up with that so in
this tutorial we're going to be adding
some functionality to this done button
and actually making the keyboard
disappear once you click it and for this
password what users usually do is
whenever they're done with this they
just click anywhere in the background
see I'm clicking right now but this
still isn't this in parent this in
appearing disappearing so that's all
what we're going to be doing Adams
functionality when you click the
background to make the number pad
disappear so go ahead and quit your
iPhone simulator and of course we're
going to need to add two methods for
this so go ahead and open your interface
file again and we're going to add the
first method is to handle whenever we
click the done button to make the
keyboard go away so I be action and just
name this go away keyboard not bad and
as a parameter of course it takes ID
sender and just go ahead and copy all of
this because I don't feel like typing it
all again and for the action we want
whenever you tap the background to make
any keyboard disappear go ahead and
click tap background make sure I sputter
right close enough just like that so go
ahead and copy these headers and go
ahead and paste it right under your
synthesize methods and now let's go
ahead and we can go and add the body so
add your curly braces because we don't
want to forget to get rid of that
semicolon now what method can we use to
make the keyboard go away we'll check
this out first of all we
need that sender which is the object and
the method make the keyboard go away is
resign first responder never saying all
right what the heck is going on in here
your first responder to any object is
pretty much any controls that are being
used to control that object is the first
responder and since we are using the
keyboard on the text field that keyboard
is the first responder so whenever we
resign it pretty much means get rid of
my keyboard so pretty much your keyboard
is your first responder and when we
resign it means get rid of it so that's
all we need to do in that method pretty
cool huh but now we want to take care of
that number pad and whenever we tap the
background we want the number pad to
disappear actually let's set it up so
when you tap the background no matter if
you have the regular keyboard or the
number pad open either of them disappear
so in order to do this let's go ahead
and whatever when you click remember we
have two outlets or objects our name and
our password so go ahead and click name
resign first responder and this is if
you have your regular arm keyboard open
its going to get rid of that one and for
your password outlet if you have that
open it gets rid of that one so it
pretty much gets rid of all keyboards
whenever you tap the background pretty
cool huh so that's actually all the code
that we had to write right there so go
ahead and build this and save before
building save all make sure we don't
have any bugs and actually let me go
ahead and quit my interface builder
because I already had it open and open
it again just in case you know something
changed so go ahead and open your
interface builder now and now let's go
ahead and attach the functionality to
our objects so what we want to do is in
text field one now that we have an
action go along with that go ahead and
open your connections inspector and
that's this little tab right here
so now we want to say all right whenever
we click the donkey or the return key
then we want to call that method go away
keyboard or keyboard go away whatever we
caught it so the event for that is did
and on exit I know that I mean why did
they name it that I have no idea but
this is the event whatever happens when
you click the donkey pretty much means
donkey so what we want to do is hold
down this little circle drag it over to
files owner and click go away keyboard
now whenever we click the done key on
the keyboard when we reckon with this
object it's going to call that method go
away keyboard and the keyboard is going
to go away pretty swing on but now
things get a tid bit complicated but not
too complicated so we don't really we
can't really attach any actions this
background because I mean it's not
control it's just a regular background
so here's what we need to do in order to
create a control from this well here's
what we need to do go ahead and click
your view button right here now your
view pretty much is all this gray stuff
it's all the background and by default
is just a view you can just look at it I
mean it doesn't have any functionality
or anything well what we want to do is
go to our identity inspector or said all
right how the heck do you get to this go
ahead and sense your view is selected go
to tools identity inspector or you can
go ahead and click this little tab right
here now you can see by default this
view this background right here is
pretty much in the class uiview it does
nothing it's just a view what we want to
do is in this class make it a UI control
so now instead of being a view it's now
a control it now has the ability to call
action methods and now can be treated as
a control so now in your connections
inspector what you want is let's go
ahead and use touchdown so as soon as
they touch it what do you want to occur
go ahead touch
down drag it over 250 owner and click
tap background so never now when anyone
ever touches that background it calls
that method tap background what pretty
much gets rid of any keyboard so I mean
anything else we need to do no that's it
so go ahead and of course save your
interface builder file now go to Xcode
build and run and let's check out our
brand new program all right type in the
username be you CKY and now click done
o.m.g this keyboard actually works but
here here's the true test go ahead and
add our super super super what superman
password super secret password in mines
777 854 one yeah you didn't know that
did you and now go ahead and click away
in our background oh my god this program
is brilliant responding exactly how we
wanted it to so that is how you add some
methods so you can actually get rid of
your keyboards again your first
responder is your keyboard so whenever
you resign it and pretty much means get
rid of keyboard that's a key thing I
wanted two guys in this story and also
aside from that is that you can actually
change the class of your background from
a regular view class which pretty much
means I can just look at it to a control
class and now it has the ability to call
actions or methods so that's it for this
tutorial you can go ahead and play with
your program I'm going to go ahead and
put this on the App Store and probably
make millions from it so thank you guys
for watching if you have any questions
leave me a question in my forum and I'll
be happy to answer it for you so I yeah
thanks for watching and I'll see you
guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
