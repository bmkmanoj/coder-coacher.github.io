tutorial video in the last video we had
our Apple and we generated omnomnom
print statement whenever we ran over the
Apple just to let ourselves know like
hey we had a crossover trigger but now
we're ready to actually kind of like
handle this as we're supposed to in the
game so what do we want to do when we
cross over an apple well first of all we
need to remove the apple from the from
the environment then we need to generate
a new apple somewhere right and then
also we want to make a snake gain some
length every time so all these things
together means we got to make quite a
few little edits here also while we're
here I want to change the color of our
snake to green so just writing green at
pygame for the place where we're drawing
our snake so it's like right near the
bottom come down a little bit green then
go to the very top and let's go ahead
and define green green equals and then
zero and we're going to make the green
like 155 or something so it's a little
dark green if you do 255 it would be
like a really bright green and it just
would look weird on the white background
so we'll do 155 and well thank you fun
umm the next thing let's go back down to
here what we're printing omnomnom so
when we draw the Apple we really have
only one Apple on the screen every time
so really to remove and redraw an apple
what do we have to do really um what
we're going to need to do is we just
need to restate or recall the definition
of the random Apple X and RAM up Y so
really we can come up to the top here
and see this right here we're just going
to highlight that copy that
come down and right where we've printed
omnomnom just like paste this tab this
part over and now whenever we run over
that Apple it'll generate a new Apple so
let me save and run this oh it's in a
tricky location isn't it there we go
okay so we're running out with that
Apple new apple new at oh my goodness oh
me challenge
oh my goodness we're moving too fast
anyway
we saw that generate a new Apple and I'm
not very good at my own snake game but
that worked out so that's cool now the
next thing that we know we need to do is
we need to draw another snake so or like
we need to add to the snake when we run
over an apple so like right now here's
where we're drawing our snake and this
is okay-ish for drawing like a one
segment block but we know our snake is a
combination of a lot of blocks so this
isn't really going to work into the
future so what I'm going to end up
having to do is we're going to draw the
snake and then we're going to have
basically a list of elements like a list
of X's and Y's for the snake and each
time we eat an apple we let that list be
a slightly longer and to do that we
can't really do it with just calling
pygame dot draw it out rect so we're
actually going to have to do is define a
snake function near the top of our
script and basically I would just put it
right above message the screen and so
we're going to say define snake and for
example for now we can go back to the
bottom and we see where we're drawing
snake just highlight that and ctrl X to
copy and or cut rather and then come
over to snake and paste it and that
should be it but oh yeah we have to come
down here and actually call it though so
where we were so like right above pygame
dot display to update come down here and
just type that type in snake now so the
snake function and just to make sure
that work let's just go ahead and save
and run it and make sure everything yes
so that didn't work out so name lead X
is not defined of of course so what we
need to do is to go up to your snake
function and come over a little bit and
you see how we have all the these are
required to like draw our snake why is
it's not moving over no way I missed it
there we go okay so we've got to take
this list of elements I would just just
like highlight well actually we don't
need these three I'll highlight these
right here copy and then
and throw them into the parameters as
well so our actual function parameters
so our function parameters are asking
for what is lead X what is ly Y what is
block size and then what we can do
really simply is we take this like these
three elements right we come down and
when we call snake we just paste it
right in there and so it's the same name
as the variables we're using and that
just makes it really easy that way we're
not like renaming variables and then
making something really confusing but
hopefully that should run now so here's
our snake we're still okay we're moving
around as expected let's make sure we
can get an apple let's make sure you can
crash so we can so everything is working
now with our own snake function and now
we're ready to actually build on our
snake so with our apple it's okay to
like leave the Apple just like as this
like 1 PI game draw it out rect and
there's okay initially to have our snake
but when ends up happening is we want to
modify our snake as time goes on we want
to throw some rules at our snake and do
all kinds of crazy stuff with our snake
and we can't really do that very easily
without making just a nice snake
function I mean we could take everything
that we're gonna put in this snake
function and put it way down here and
make this part a lot longer but
generally you'd like to keep your game
loop is like basic as possible and have
functions that build on top of it so
anyway we're going to be expanding our
snake function in a bit just wanted to
get to that point have our own snake
function make sure everything was
working and the apples rejuvenating all
that fun stuff so the next thing that
we're going to do is start building on
our snake get him to get a little longer
and all that so stay tuned for that
thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
