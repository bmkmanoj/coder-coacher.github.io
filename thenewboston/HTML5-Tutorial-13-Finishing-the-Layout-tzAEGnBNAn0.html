tutorial and in this tutorial I'm going
to be finishing styling our awesome
website so what I want to do is just a
couple quick things this prep going to
be a quick tutorial and the very first
thing I want to do is I want to style
these articles so I want to give each of
these articles their own border and
background and padding so in order to do
that I need to go ahead and style this
crap right here so what I'm going to be
doing is taking out of this I'm not
going to be styling the overall section
because whenever we start yeah right
there kind of got lost there whenever we
saw the main section that was pretty
much to lay out the entire overall I
don't know
this entire overall section right here
however I want to style each individual
article so in order to do that if we
look at our HTML file we have these
individual article tags so that's where
we're going to be styling so let's go
ahead and our CSS go ahead and just type
article and now we can apply the
properties to each individual article
for example we can give each one a
background color and let me give it like
a nice peach color yeah so that should
be something light and also let me give
it a border let's see what border would
we go to that a red border maybe so
border equals one pixel solid red not
nerd red that's a little bit better and
I also want to give a padding because I
want some space between the text and the
border so I'm going to give it an
overall padding of 20 pixels now another
thing is this padding it isn't going to
affect the spacing and mess up the
overall flow of our layout so that's
another reason that I like to style
within the article itself it's only
going to affect the padding of the
content itself and another thing I want
to do is I want to change the margin on
the bottom so margin and just like
border top you can do margin bottom
margin bottom you can also do margin top
left right by the way
you probably would have guessed that and
let me just give it like 15 pixels or
something and this is pretty much going
to separate it from the other article
underneath it so now if I go ahead and
refresh this and refresh it I can see
that each of my articles now has a nice
peach background a red border and that
margin 15 this is what that is right
here pretty much gives us some spacing
between each article and if we were to
put another one under this then there
would be a margin as well so the only
other thing I want to adjust is this my
little signature written by Bucky
Roberts usually whenever you're writing
article this appears on the right hand
side and underneath it a little bit so I
just want to go ahead and text the line
our little signature to the right now if
we say written by Bucky Roberts let's go
ahead and hop over in our HTML and are
written by Bucky Roberts is actually
part of the footer not only the footer
but it's part of the articles footer as
you can see the footer is a child of
article so this is what I'm going to do
and this is one of the cool things about
having a footer inside the article so
instead of a footer like this don't do
that because I think in this case we
have a footer outside so if we would try
to align that to the right it's going to
try to align this so what we want to do
is we want to say okay we want to work
with the footers but only the footers in
the articles so if you go ahead and hit
article footer that's going to only
apply the style to the footers in the
articles so let me just go ahead and
text align right and hopefully if I
didn't mess anything up and go to my
website BAM check it out this footer is
still Center aligned however the article
footers are now on the right so that is
the effect that I wanted and pretty much
our website is laid out awesomely now
and again I want to mention this before
you guys think that I'm just a terrible
web designer because I am but in the
case that these colors are really
awfully you know they don't flow at all
when every
you're making a website then you
typically want all the colors to be
similar not the same but you know kind
of in the same I don't know kind of like
I don't know what word I'm going for you
know kind of like similar color scheme
that's what I'm looking for the same
color scheme so the reason that I had
this yellow and dark blue in Peach was
just so you guys could see but um
typically when you're making a website
make sure it's in the same color scheme
and not this random crap right here
so anyways in the next tutorial I'm
going to be showing you the brand new
flexible model excuse me I think it's
called the flexible box model technique
so this technique is called the
traditional box model it's pretty much
how I laid out all my websites in the
past because it's a really easy and
simple way to get a nice layout
however html5 and css3 came up with this
new thing called flexible box model and
they're actually still incorporating it
into browsers right now so we need to
add some little tricks before we you
know we start working with it but I'm
going to be talking about all that in
the next store or so I think guys for
watching don't forget subscribe and I
will see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
