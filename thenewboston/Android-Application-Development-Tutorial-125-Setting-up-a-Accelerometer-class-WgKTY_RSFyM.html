and twenty-fifth Android tutorial for
the new boss in what we're gonna do in
this tutorial we're going to learn about
the accelerometer or at least get you
know our class setup for the most part
so what we want to do is we want to
create a new class called accelerate and
what we're gonna do is we're gonna
extends activity as always and we're
also going to implement we're gonna
implement the sense something called the
sensor event listener and that's gonna
be basically our sensor of our
accelerometer so let's you know go into
activity import that and our sensor we
got to import that and also add the
unimplemented methods so as you can see
on accuracy change and on sensor change
are two methods that we implement from
the sensor event listener we're also
going to set up just our you know our on
create method
hit okay so we got that stuff set up we
also want basically where this
accelerometer class is going to be
drawing to the screen drawing a ball to
the screen so what we're gonna do is
we're going to open up our graphics
surface class and within here if you
guys remember we set up a inner class
called my bring back surface which
extends the surface view and the
runnable so we're going to do we're just
going to copy this whole class my bring
back surface copy that and then we're
gonna go into our Excel accelerate class
and paste it there so we got some errors
we're actually just gonna delete kind of
everything within our canvas where we
draw to it and we are good to start with
the tutorial probably that's gonna be it
for this tutorial just getting
everything for the most part set up and
so once we copy that all we're gonna do
is go into our on create method and
we're gonna say set content view to to a
new my what was it to new my bring back
surface oops
bring back surface and we're gonna pass
in the context of this alright so now we
have our class setup pretty much
everything is good to go and probably
going to end the tutorial here just
getting everything again set up so I'll
catch you guys later and have a good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
