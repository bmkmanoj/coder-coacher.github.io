Blackford here with another awesome
Photoshop cs6 tutorial and in this
tutorial we're gonna go over cropping
stuff and there is a basic way to crop
and then there's a tool for cropping so
let's start getting into this the first
way that you can crop is by creating a
selection so pick any of your selection
tools I'm just going to use the
rectangular marquee tool because it's
the easiest and you can do this with any
of your other selection tools just make
a selection I'm just gonna select this a
lifeguard house here and I'm going to go
to image and there is a section here
called crop click that and then your
image is quickly cropped you don't have
mess with a bunch of stuff so that's how
you quickly and basically crop things
now you can go in with your other
selection tools and make some like
nice-looking crops like this one oh man
this is gonna be awesome and then image
crop and then it's basically just gonna
crop a square out for you along the
farthest edges out of your selection so
just want to make that clear to you that
you just can't like crap like
crazy-looking things it's squares or
rectangles basically so just letting you
know that so let's go to layer what's
going to select deselect we don't have
anything there anymore and we're gonna
come down here to the crop tool click on
it and we get a bunch and you can you
can see that in the corners
we have our crop selection area so if we
drag this and then we can drag this down
some more we have our area here that we
are going to crop and it's within this
grid like area this is what's going to
stay in the crop so if I hit enter it's
going to crop that area and that's
pretty easy
oops I just went back I'm gonna deselect
because somehow I went way too far back
but I'm on my crop tool again and the
crop tool has a bunch of different
options that we can use to
pretty much refine what we're doing so
right now our cropping area is set to
unconstrained as we can see up here in
the top so it's unconstrained right now
now if I open up this menu we have a
bunch of different settings we got
presets and then we can create a preset
so if we go to original ratio and then
we type in whatever we want 15 by 15 so
we get a ratio of a crop that we can
basically move the picture around into
and crop out what we need it to
and remember press ENTER to initiate the
crop well this is on one to one square
so if I put it on one to one square and
I change this to like three and six or
whatever then you get that so custom
here at the top this will come up when
you just start typing your own numbers
you can make any kind of custom size you
want so let's go down back to
unconstrained real quick now new in cs6
we can rotate our crops in our crop area
so up here there is this rotate button
click on it now we're able to rotate our
corrupt selection it basically rotates
the picture not like really the crop but
it we can still get a rotated crop so if
I hit enter now this is what it's going
to look like and make sure that when you
rotate in your crop that you don't have
a bunch of nothingness in your crop I
mean that wouldn't look too hot unless
that's your plan and you wanted to put
something there like maybe like the guy
from Mortal Kombat's and toasty or
something like that so let's get back to
this now we've got a couple other
buttons up here the straighten button
you can click on that
and then draw a line to see how how you
want this straightened so I drew the
line and then it's like this so if I
click on it again and draw the line if I
hold if you hold shift it doesn't do
anything this time so you want to go by
the angle that you have on the screen so
this just straightened it out a little
more
so let's control Z to go back and undo
undo it's just gonna go back and forth
so because sometimes it does that so
let's get out of this crop can't crop
the image so what I did is I clicked on
like the move tool I'm gonna hit don't
crop and it's gonna bring it back to
what it was normally now we have a bunch
of different views for our crop so when
I start cropping on the crop tool right
now we got this grid here with a 3 in it
and this grid here is basically called
the rule of thirds grid and when you're
taking photography classes or design
classes or anything like that there is a
rule of thirds and basically you want to
look at look that up actually I'll type
it up right now so you can see that I'm
not making this up rule of thirds and
then photography just type in this in
real quick and I'll bring this over now
we've got the rule of thirds
and this is principal and photography
that shows you how to like organize you
get out of here how to organize your
pictures and make them composed really
nicely so that's what that is
now we've got the rule of thirds view on
here let's go up to our view section up
here now we've got a bunch of different
types of views grid diagonal so if you
want to launch stuff up
so there's a bunch of different views
here some of them I don't understand
this one's called Golden Spiral why
would you use that I'm not too sure yet
but I'll figure it out someday so we've
got Auto Show overlay these ones can be
separate clipped on separately always
show the overlays gonna show like our
different different grid and everything
like that and then we got never to never
show the grid it's gonna remember these
for you and then we've got to cycler
overlays we would press o so that's kind
of nice now for our different overlays
here and our different views we've got
an options menu we click on the options
menu we get a couple more options that
help out and make things easier for us
so let's go over those use classic mode
so in classic mode you select that and
you move and rotate the the crop
selection instead of the actual image so
if I use the classic mode and I can move
this around like this and it doesn't
move like the image so I'm just moving
around the crop instead of the image so
if I go back to non classic mode and I'm
moving this around I'm actually moving
the image around this time instead of
moving around the crop so that's up to
you not not too much of a difference
really unless like I don't know actually
I'm not I guess there isn't really too
much of a difference it's up to your
preference we've got to always Center
preview so I would keep that checked if
I was you it's up to you if you have a
huge image that you might not want to
have Auto Center preview and a show
cropped area you can see what you're
working with if you have the show
cropped area on if not so if I move it
around like this I mean you can't really
see it so this will give you a good idea
what your image is going to look like if
you have it off but I like to have it on
too so I can see everything
and see what I might want to get in
there the next set of settings here is
enable crop shield and if I just uncheck
that you'll see that this darker area
around here it turns off and you just
see the crop there no I mean I feel like
enable crop shield helps you see what
you're actually going to crop so I would
suggest to keep that on and then you
have your color where you can change
your color to a custom one if you want
so it could be red or it's up to you
so right now I'm gonna put it to match
canvas which kind of like does it just
makes like a great that's a little more
opaque and then our transparent I guess
and then you can increase your opacity
if you want that's up to you
so auto adjust you can have auto adjust
on there also so it yeah basically you
don't have to do too much work so those
are the settings now it looks like feel
like the crop tool has a bunch of stuff
to it
we've got delete cropped pixels also
over here and you pretty much want to do
that so you don't have any like half
pixels or anything like that on there so
keep don't delete cropped pixels on no
we just got our buttons over here that
we can use for cropping so this one's
gonna reset your crop so if I click on
that it resets it back to the beginning
now over here I've got the next button
over here ten so this is the cancel
button so if you click on cancel it gets
off of everything that I did and then if
I go and click on the check mark here
it's just like pressing enter it'll
commit to the crop so that's how you use
the crop tool a decent amount of stuff
to it because of these view options and
everything like that but the crop tool
is used to cut out any extra information
in your photo that you don't think is
necessary or you don't want to have in
there so it helps focus on
the main aspect of the photo brings more
attention to whatever you want to crop
into and everything like that so that's
how you use the crop tool thanks for
watching it subscribe for more tutorials
it's going to be awesome
have a good one everybody</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
