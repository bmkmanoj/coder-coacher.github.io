seventy seventh Java tutorial and in
this tutorial we're going to be learning
about something called adapter classes
now in the last tutorial when we
implemented from the interface like
Mouse listener and Mouse motion listener
we had to implement seven different
methods and those are kind of time
consuming in sometimes you don't always
want your program to detect all of those
different methods sometimes you only
want your programming to be able to tell
when a user click something instead of
drag release move you only need one of
those so what Java did is in order to
kind of save you some time they made
something called an adapter class and
what an adapter class does is it already
implements an interface and it overrides
it with a method body that is pretty
much a blank body or pretty much a body
that does nothing any we're saying all
right what's the point of that well in
that way when you inherit from an
adapter class you only have to override
the methods that you need so it's pretty
cool in the sense that you don't have to
override all of those seven
time-consuming methods like we did
before you only have to override the
ones that you're going to use in the
rest whenever you do them they just
don't do anything at all just like we
wanted them to so let me go ahead and
show you guys what I'm talking about
going to make two variables for our
program again get all your imports right
here and the first thing they're both
going to be private variables I'm going
to put string in details and what this
program is going to do is it's pretty
much just going to say how many times
arm well you'll see what it does but
pretty much this details is going to
tell what's going to be displayed in the
status bar so that's all you need to
know for now private J label and just
put status bar or whatever you named it
last time and now we got two private
variables the status bar in the details
is pretty much going to be the text
that's going to appear in your status
bar so now we can go ahead build our
constructor which is
like gooey it's not going to take any
parameters and for the body let's go
ahead and add a title super title since
you should always have a title get that
their real name it tootle I mean why not
might as well next we can go ahead and
build our status bar which is the only
thing we're really going to want up here
in the window so wow I really miss that
up
status bar and set equal to nu J label
and just have the text by default but
this is default it's just going to be
the first thing that appears after we
start doing the stuff this is going to
disappear but now let's go ahead and add
this to the window we'll pad status bar
and of course go ahead and put like
borderlayout dot south and now there we
go
it'll appear at the bottom of the screen
if you put south we're going over that
later and now we need to add of course
the mouse listener just like that add
mouse listener in the parameter it takes
here is an object of the class we're
going to boat and we're going to be
building a new class called new Mouse
class and don't forget your empty
parameters for that so make sure we
didn't miss oh I know we're getting an
error because we didn't build the class
yet so let's go ahead and create a class
called Mouse class and with this mouse
class we'll just go ahead and throw
private class Mouse class extends so we
need to build a mouse class because
that's what the parameter it took in in
our class we're going to pretty much
define how to handle these Mouse events
and we want it to extend Mouse adapter
in this adapter class that we're
extending from this is the class that's
built in a Java already so this can be
custom whatever you're named but this
has to mean mouse adapter you have to
type it just like that and again this
adapter class is got is going to allow
you to overwrite only the methods that
you need to overwrite so let's go ahead
and first the only thing we're we're
going
to be working with is public void mouse
clicked that's the only thing we care
about when they click we don't care when
they drag or anything else like that so
put mouse event event oh my god can I
not type I mean seriously
Mouse event event and let's go ahead and
type what do we want to happen when they
click the mouse well let's go ahead and
take those details right up here that
we're going to have and put details set
it equal to string dot format and let's
go ahead and put something it takes two
arguments um put you clicked percent D
so it's going to say you clicked percent
D and for present D what we want to do
is take that event which is pretty much
means when we click and input get click
count just like that BAM
already filled it in for us so it's
going to say you clicked 5 6 18 whatever
doesn't fill in in the end yet so now
we're going to have to make a if
statement and we're going to have 3
parameters to finish this detail
variable so if event in here's another
kind of confusing thing that is maida
down and everything alright
what the heck is maida down and what's
it mean well whenever you're building a
Java program you don't really know what
kind of Mouse the user is using there's
three kind of main Mouse's there's a
one-button mouse like on the Mac a 2
button which is like old classic or a
three button Mouse in the third button
is that scroll wheel so in order to
distinguish the types of buttons that
they have you just can't assume that
they're using all your users are using
the same one so if you ever use the Mac
then how they make up for this rice
mount I mean the right mouse button is
they have something called meta which is
called the command or Apple key that
they can hold down and when they click
the mouse that simulates the right mouse
button or they can hold the Alt key and
when they click the Alt key and click
their mouse it simulates um what is it
the
is a center mouse button so that is how
you can tell I mean for now when we
click the right mouse button it's going
to work perfectly but this pretty much
is just for people who use special like
one button or two button mouse is if you
have a third three button Mouse then
this is pretty much what does
so if meta button is down or is meted
down take your details and I know I'm
probably just going to explain it a lot
easier just by showing you what the
program is while add to the end of that
details variable so you clicked five
will say for example and then go ahead
and what do we want to pend all right
there we go um with right mouse button
so if meta is down which is mean if they
click the right mouse button or if they
hold down that meta key is going to say
with the right mouse button else if what
else do you want to test on event is alt
down just like that
let's go ahead and first put that back
and details plus equals with the sensor
mouse button and the cool thing about
this else by default you don't have to
test anything because you know it's just
a regular click down with left mouse
button so that's how you distinguish
between the right the center and the
left mouse button for different types of
mice and I spelled details wrong so and
now I spelled it right so that's all we
have to do so now we have a variable
called details and it's a string it
starts with you clicked and says a
number and says with the right mouse
button arm either right by either why
don't I just put with embarrassing and
then I pretty much this is the beginning
and one of these is the end of the
string and now all we have to do is add
this to the screen so put status bar set
text and for the text we're just going
to write that details variable so the
status bar is going to set equal to the
details variable and now we can go ahead
run it and I can show you guys what it
does so it says this is default which
you put that by default and I'm going to
go ahead and click my left mouse button
now look click one two three four five
and then if you move it and click your
center look what happens Center center
clicking with my center or in other
words my scroll wheel and then go ahead
and click here with your right and if
you go ahead and move this then it's
actually a new event so if you want to
make your things go up you got to stay
in the same place um if you're moving it
then actually is a move event so that's
why it resets
but that's your basics of how to
distinguish between on the right the
center and left and also how to use a
mouse adapter class 2 only overwrite the
methods that you want again we only over
wrote one method and we then have to
overwrite all seven for our program to
work so that's the power of mouse
adapter class but for now thank you guys
