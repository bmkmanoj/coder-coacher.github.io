computer networking tutorial and in this
video I want to talk to you guys about
the OSI model now the OSI model is
something that confuses a lot of people
but it's actually an incredibly useful
model if taught correctly for not only
understanding how computer networks work
but also specifically how two computers
communicate with each other so if you
had a hard time understanding you know
the big picture of computer networking
and how everything was kind of you know
piece together what this model is going
to do is not only give you a really good
broad overview but it's also going to
take the individual pieces and clarify
how each part works part by part so what
it does is it basically starts with the
user experience basically you looking at
your computer and it explains everything
all the way down to when you know those
electric signals are traveling across
copper wire to another computer so it
does this in the form of layers now this
model calls you know the different parts
of it layers but the layers in this
model are basically just different
pieces of how a computer network works
now like I said it starts with you know
just you your user experience you
looking at the computer and the first
layer is called the application layer
now this is basically software
applications it's basically the user
looking at whatever program they have
running on the computer now this layer
usually you know involves things like
Firefox arm you know Google Chrome those
are you know probably the two biggest
ones that users use whenever they're
networking and also you know whatever
program you use for email and stuff it's
basically software applications this is
the layer again like I said closest to
the user experience software
applications or programs now the next
layer is called the presentation
the presentation layer now this is the
layer that your operating system works
on now what this does is it basically
converts text that the user can
understand like you know letters in
numbers because of course whenever you
type something into your email you're
typing you know just basic letters and
numbers a language that you can
understand but that isn't the language
that your computer can understand your
computer actually one of the languages
that understands is something called
ASCII and this is you know we'll talk
about different you know languages and
stuff like that later on but this is
basically a very simple language that
you computer can understand because you
know it can't understand English like
you can it needs its own special thing
so that's what your operating system
does in this layer it converts text that
the user can understand like letters and
numbers to basically stuff that the
computer can understand and it just
makes it more easy to work with the data
when it's in this form right here now
another thing that the presentation
layer does is it also encrypts data and
whenever I say encrypts that I mean put
a special code on it
so that hackers you know just can't tap
into it and steal your data look you
know what you're sending it in your
email and stuff like that and we'll talk
more about the presentation layer later
on but just remember right now that it's
the layer that your operating system
resides on now the next layer is
actually the session layer now if you're
familiar with you know like PHP
programming or anything like that then
you already know what a session is a
session is pretty much a conversation
between two computers so what this layer
does is let me just go ahead and write
conversation between two computers
so whenever computers are in the process
of having a conversation with one
another we call this conversation a
session now this layer is responsible
for you know starting and ending
conversations or sessions and it's also
responsible for getting data from a
website so with this say that you wanted
to get data from your website this layer
would go ahead and create a session or
start a conversation with a web server
and whenever you know during the
conversation it would help maintain the
communication and if something you know
disrupted your communication it would
try to re-establish the link between it
so you know you guys could still
communicate and whenever it was done
this is the layer right here that is
responsible for ending the conversation
so a session is basically like a
conversation or communication between
two computers and this right here is
responsible for pretty much starting
ending and maintaining that conversation
now the next layer I want to talk about
is called the transport the transport
layer and this will talk about what
packets are later on but basically let
me give you guys a real you know quick
overview and this is not the technical
definition so please I don't want to get
you know a thousand comments a packet is
pretty much like a chunk of data that
you deliver from one computer to another
whenever you know you have an email and
you want to send it to another computer
what your computer does is it breaks it
up into smaller chunks of data just
because it's easier for your computer to
work with smaller chunks of data rather
than one big one so these chunks of data
are actually called packets and I
sometimes use the word packet and frame
interchangeably but there is a
difference I'll talk about that later on
so basically what this does is it
ensures that packets I'll just rewrite
packets are delivered</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
