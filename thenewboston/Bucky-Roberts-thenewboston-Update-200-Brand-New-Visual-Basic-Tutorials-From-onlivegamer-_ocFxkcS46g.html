just want to make a video for a quick
talking to you guys about a couple
things that are going to be going on
with the new bus and first of all I know
I haven't been on for like the last five
days but between work and I'm actually
moving soon so things have been kind of
crazy with that however for those of you
who been looking forward to UDK and 3ds
max and you know those 3d game
programming tutorials I have them a
little free time now so I'm going to be
uploading a bunch of tutorials pretty
soon so anyways speaking of tutorials
and the reason I'm making this video is
this basically ever since I started the
new Boston and teaching online a lot of
you guys have been asking me for
tutorials on you know maybe a piece of
software or something computer related
or a lot of people have been asking me
for computer programming tutorials and I
want to teach you guys all this stuff I
just don't have the time to teach
everything so basically what I've been
seeing recently is a lot of people have
been requesting me to teach of Visual
Basic tutorials and like I said I really
don't have time to teach visual basic
tutorials because I'm busy with you know
the UDK you Bertie's max right now
however I didn't want to let you guys
down I wanted to give you guys these
stories so what I did I want to say
about a month ago maybe is I went on
YouTube and I searched visual basic
tutorials and a bunch of tutorials
popped up and I scroll through and look
for the best visual basic tutorials
something that covered every detail
every aspect of visual basic and also
store knows that were really good
quality because you know something
toriel's are really fuzzy or I can't
hear the sound and then it's really a
pain in the butt to watch I want to make
sure that I found some really good
visual basic tutorials and I did there
is this one YouTube member called on
live gamer and he just had awesome
visual basic soils he didn't have too
many he only had like I want to say 10
or 15 or something but he have a really
good story so what I did is I sent
message tone no my situation and asking
him if he would make some sort Oh
swarming so he basically agreed to make
me some visual basic tutorials and that
was like a month ago I said and
yesterday and the man in my peel box I
got this right here and on this pendrive
is 200 brand-new never-before-seen
awesome amazing quality visual basic
tutorial made just for you guys and the
new boston so there you go i know i
don't have time to teach all these
subjects but i want to give you guys
these sorro's so in the next coming days
i don't know how long it's gonna take me
to upload 200 tutorials but there they
are for you guys they're gonna be coming
soon I promise
so basically on live gamer I want to
thank you so much for doing this
for the new Boston you have no idea how
much it means to me and to my
subscribers I want to say this for
anyone watching this video and for
anyone who has watched my tutorials in
the past I know I don't ask guys for a
whole lot but if you could go check out

leave a description or you can I'll
leave a link in the description below if
