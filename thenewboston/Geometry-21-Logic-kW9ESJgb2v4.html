logic and geometry is the most logical
math it's very systematic and there's
always a reason for everything you do so
a huge part of geometry is these if-then
statements and they allow us to do a lot
of our proving of things so a
conditional is a statement is a
statement that follows this pattern if P
and P is just an action then Q and Q is
just another action so for an example if
it rains then soccer practice will get
canceled where you have one statement P
that implies another statement Q so the
conditional that you're given is always
true we're gonna talk about some other
kinds of statements that are not always
they're not necessarily always true okay
and one of those is called the converse
where you take the two statements and
you flip them so if Q then P so if
soccer practice is canceled
then it rained where you're saying that
instead of P implying Q you have a Q
implies P so if you look at this one if
soccer practice is canceled
then it rained that's assuming that the
only time soccer practice is canceled is
when it rains if there's not school like
if there's a snow day or something
soccer practice is going to be
cancelled too that's why this statement
isn't always true for certain statement
for certain if-then statements it could
be true but we can't say with certainty
that it is true so now we're going to
talk about another statement called the
inverse where you take the opposite of
the first action and then and say that
if not P then not Q and this little
symbol right here means you negate it
which is which just means when you put
not in front of P you're negating the
action so if it is not raining then
soccer soccer practice is not canceled
so not P implies not Q but this you have
to be careful with because like the
converse the inverse is not always true
because think about it if it is not
raining then soccer practice is not
canceled well didn't we just say that
there could be other reasons soccer
practices cancelled it doesn't always
have to be when it's raining it just
says that if it does rain soccer
practice is canceled so we can't just
simply switch we can't negate each one
and say it's true so a last one and this
is the only statement other than the
conditional you're given that is always
true so if not Q then not P so the
contrapositive is really just taking the
converse and taking the inverse and
doing it at the same time because we're
going to switch the order of the two
actions and we're going to negate them
with the not statements so if soccer
practice I should say practice
if soccer practice is not canceled that
it is not raining where we have not q
that implies not P so think about if we
were gonna state this a different way we
it would just it would just say that if
soccer practice is if they are having
soccer practice then it's not raining
which makes sense because our original
conditional said that if it rains they
will not have a soccer practice so this
is the only statement where it's true so
it's really important to remember this
one because this there's contrapositive
of some of our theorems that we have
learned it's gonna help us solve some
proofs later on so that's all we're
gonna do with logic but as promised our
next lesson is gonna deal with more
proofs so make sure to come back and
watch that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
