other angles formed by parallel lines
and their relationships to one another
so when two or more parallel lines but
is these two lines right here are cut by
a transversal which there's one
transversal here and when transversal
here their alternate interior angles are
congruent and alternate exterior angles
are congruent so if you remember what an
alternate interior angle is it's just
those angles that when you pair them up
they form a Z right here their alternate
because they alternate what side and
what part of the line there on and now
we know that they're congruent so I can
say that the measure of angle one is 87
I can do the same thing this way draw my
alternate interior angles with angle 2
and this angle right here so that means
that angle too is 93 degrees and I can't
do that over here because I don't know
what these are what these measures are
but I can use the other part of this and
say that alternate exterior angles are
congruent because this and is important
because both of these are congruent so
we start with angle 3 and I draw my land
line down go on to the other side so
that means that 3 has to equal 85
degrees
and I do it the other way starting with
95 going down to 4 that means the
measure of angle for has to be 95
degrees because I know these angles are
congruent so using those two rules we're
going to find the missing measurements
of this quadrilateral so I know this
line will call this ad is parallel to B
C and we know that ad is parallel to DC
or a be sorry so I want to find the
measure of angle 1 well if you look at
this BD is the transversal that cuts
these two parallel lines and a half so
that means that the alternate interior
angles of these two lines are congruent
so if we start along this first line
come down the transversal go over this
other parallel line because both of both
sets of parallel lines are cut by this
transversal I know that a measure of
angle one has to be 38 degrees and if I
look at these two parallel lines this
time instead of these two they're also
cut by this transversal BD so I'm going
to start because I know their alternate
interior angles are congruent so I'm
going to start with this first parallel
line come down the transversal BD and go
over to this pair
line and that means angle 2 has to be 86
degrees because they have their
congruent which means they have equal
measures so we have one more example
we're going to do so find the missing
measurements so this is what we need to
find so the first thing we're going to
do is find out what this what this
measure angle equals because then I can
use my supplementary my knowledge of
supplementary angles to find out what
the measure of angle 23 is
okay so i can find this out because i
know that these two lines are parallel
they're cut by this transversal so that
their alternate interior angles are
congruent so I mean this has to be 65
degrees as well so now that I know what
that ain't gold equals I can use my
supplementary not my knowledge of some
supplementary angles set 23 this is
angle 23 not the number 23 plus fit plus
65 equals 180 if i subtract the 65 / i
get angle 23 equals 115 okay so if you
notice these marks right here this means
that these two angles are congruent so
this has to equal 65 as well and if you
look this angle and this angle are also
supplementary so we're going to do the
same thing to 25 angle 25 + 65 equals
180 so angle 25 also has to equal 115
degrees
so out round 1 115 degrees so last if I
look at these two parallel lines here
they're cut by this transversal so that
means that they are alternate interior
angles are congruent so if I start here
on this parallel line come down the
transversal and go across I know that 6
that 24 has to equal 65 degrees so
that's it for parallel lines but make
sure you come back and check out the
videos on polygons next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
