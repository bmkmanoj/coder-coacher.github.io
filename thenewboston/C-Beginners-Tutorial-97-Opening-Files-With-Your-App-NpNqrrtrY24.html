tutorial that I'm making before the new
Boston in this tutorial I'll be showing
you how to open files with your
application meaning anywhere on your
computer you'll be able to right-click
on a file click open with and then
browse to the application you created
which is this application I do so the
first thing that you're gonna have to do
is just right click on your form right
here and click the view code and then
right here and through the constructor
we're gonna want to pass a string
variable and basically the string will
be the path to the file that we open now
in order to get the path to the file
that these are opens in the program
we're gonna have to go to this program
dot CSV file right here and we even
talked about this yet but basically what
this is or here is this is whatever the
program looks for when it runs so it'll
go right directly to here and then I'll
run this code and right here it just
creates a new form and runs it that's
why we see form one when we evolve or
run our application and right here being
an error because the constructor does
indeed take an argument but we'll get to
that in a little bit so in order to get
the packs to all the files that the user
opens we're just gonna have to create a
new string array and we're gonna have it
pass it through this this main method
right here this method that it looks for
every time it runs so if we were to open
a file with it it will pass through this
the path to the file if user opened and
I'm just going to all this files right
here and that's basically what it is
adds to the files and we're just going
to create a for each statement here
saying for each file that the user opens
you wanted to run a new form warning or
you're opening a reform so we're gonna
say please string let's call it s in
this files array
to run a new forum one create a new
forum one and we're just gonna pass
through this strength right here
so basically what it will do now is if
you open one or more files it will pass
through this string right here into form
1 and then we can do something with that
and all we're gonna do is we're gonna
have it display in a message box there's
been a string let's call it as I guess
capital S and we'll say that is equal to
whatever string pastor here and then
we're still have a message box display
that string actually we don't you need
this all right so let's make my message
box display the string that I've passed
through or the path to the file that it
opens so I'm just gonna do bug here save
it so now we can go access our
application and check out and see if
this work so now I'm just gonna go
navigate to my application which should
be one application within bug released
okay so case you missed all that this is
basically how you get to the file or the
executable file that you created in
c-sharp you just go to your projects
folder for Visual Studio 2010 go to the
name of your project then name the name
of your project again the bin folder and
then the debug folder and then an exe
should be inside of it and it's not es
host it's just the name of your
application I'm just gonna go ahead and
copy this and paste it in this this
folder right here so now in order to
open this file in this program we're
just going to drag it in there it says
opening windows forms application 1 yeah
if I want to do good running yep we get
a message message box with a path to the
file
it's exactly what we want and now that
you know the path to the file you can do
pretty much anything you would like to
that so that's pretty much it for this
tutorial
opening files in your application so see
you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
