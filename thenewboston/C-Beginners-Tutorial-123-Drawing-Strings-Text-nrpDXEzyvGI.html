tutorial that I'm making for the new
Boston and in this tutorial i'm going to
be showing you how to draw a string into
this panel right here and by drawstring
I mean basically just draw text into our
panel and by drawing it that means we
cannot like select it or copy it or
highlight it or anything like that so
for this tutorial you need to have a
panel and when the user clicks on that
panel you're going to want to have it
create a new solid brush it doesn't
matter what color of the brush is I just
made fine blue and you're also going to
have to create graphics so if we have
something to draw on and do panel one
create graphics so we can draw on our
panel alright so we're going to do here
is we're just going to use the draw
string method inside of the graphics
class sword is going to G dot whatever
you name or whatever you need your
graphics and we're just in use the draw
string method to draw our string so the
first argument that it wants us to pass
through here is a string to draw so I'm
just gonna have it draw Adam so just
like that Adam right there the next
thing in the calls were those are font
so what we're gonna have to do is create
a new font we're going to have to do
system drawing gone even though we
already are using a system dot drawing
up here because if you did just dot bond
it would access this font and it would
access the font of this text right here
of the text of our form we don't want
that we want to actually create a new
instance of the font class so we have to
do system dot drawing that font I'm just
going to call it cloth for font instead
equal to a new font and the first thing
that our font calls for a here is a font
family and a font family is basically
just the type of font that we're going
to be using so we have to go up here and
create new font family let's call it f5
for font family
do a new font ban and basically will
have to pass through here is the name of
the font that we're going to be using so
I'm going to type an Arial and make sure
that you type in the name of the font
correctly because if you don't it will
throw an error so I'm just gonna have to
use Arial for right now so now that we
have our font family created we can just
pass through our font family we create
our font and we're also going to have to
choose to be how big our font is going
to be so I'll just make it ten points
big and there now we have our font
created and now we can pass our cloth
through right into this drawstring
method and next they cause for a brush
to actually draw the bond and I'm just
going to use our solid brush that we
created up here so s and finally is the
point that it wants to start drawing the
font and I'll just make a few 2020s it
will start drawing approximately right
there so can be a new point 2001 all
right so now I'm going to be bug here
and click this should just draw atom
right out into this panel yep Oh perfect
and if you want to change the size the
font we can easily change it just by
changing this number and our off font
class right here so I'll just make a few
50 to make it much larger yep Adam there
you go and we can change the font style
so if you want to make it another font
like Corrine our new courier new I guess
to place my suit all right so now I need
to bug and click we should see Adam in
courier new font yep and if you wanted
to make it be like
bolded or italic or underlined or
something like that you can just pass
that as a third argument through your
font class so we can use two font style
dot and here
have an enumeration of all the different
types of font styles so if you want to
make it bold we just do font style top
hold and our text should be folded yep
obviously if we did something else like
how I could get Halleck yep now let's do
one more here so if we made it strike
out and then strike stricken out yeah
and if you just wanted to be clean all
the regular you just do that regular so
that's pretty much it for this tutorial
on drawing text so see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
