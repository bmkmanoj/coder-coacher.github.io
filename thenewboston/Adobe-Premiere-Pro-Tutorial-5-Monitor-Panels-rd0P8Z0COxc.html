welcome to your fifth Premiere Pro
tutorial and in this lesson I'm going to
be talking to you about monitor panels
now what a monitor panel is this is
basically an area where you can preview
your work it's basically like a mini DVD
player built right into Premiere Pro for
example if you look in the top right you
can go ahead and play it if you hit this
button and then it turns into a stop
button or you can go ahead and you know
step forward if you need to fast forward
rewind basically like a DVD player
except this is a really fancy one so
you're saying all right at first glance
these kind of look the same this source
monitor and program monitor which is in
the top middle in the top right you
can't really see a difference between
them just by you know glancing over them
but there is a difference and that's
this with a source monitor right here
and if you can't see it just go ahead
and double click one of your sources in
your project panels and it will pop up
the source monitor lets you preview a
single file so for example if you have a
bunch of different files in here and you
wanted to look for one specific video
clip you can go ahead and double click
each of these and they would pop up in
the source so you're saying alright is
this the video clip I want no that's
with Bucky I'm looking for one with Lola
closer to the camera so let me double
click this ah that's the one I want or
if you have a bunch of images that you
you know you want to find the one that
fits your program just go ahead and
double click all those and back oh so
that's the thing so it pretty much is
like a preview of whatever file you're
looking for so the program monitor is a
little bit different the program monitor
lets you preview your entire final
project pretty much lets you preview
your entire movie after it's piece
together so for example if we go ahead
and play this in the source monitor it's
only going to preview this raw file this
only one video clip but in our timeline
after we piece together the title and
this video clip in this video clip and
we go ahead and hit space as you notice
this program is changing that's our
entire movie
piece together so that's the difference
between the source monitor and the
program honor this one in the top middle
lets you only preview a single file and
this one in the top right lets you
preview your entire project but that's
not all there is to cover I have all
these dumb widgets and numbers and stuff
that we have to go over so let me go
ahead and skip over these real quick I
guess I'll start with the program
monitor since this is a little bit
easier to understand first of all you
have this number in yellow right here
this is the current time where you are
right now so ever saying all right I
want to put a title in it ten seconds
you go ahead and scroll your current
time indicator right here until this
reached ten seconds and then you might
want to move your title over accordingly
like just like that or something so this
is pretty much the current time
indicator so saying all right what's
this one right here this is the total
length of your movie so pretty much this
is where your current time indicator is
but this is the total length of the
movie service and all right
I want my movie to be ten minutes long
and then what you need to do is scroll
out and move your current time indicator
to around ten minutes and then you would
need to shorten all these clips too
right there so anyways that is that is
the difference between this first number
in the last number this is the current
time and this is the final project
length and of course that thing in the
middle that says fit this is the zoom
level if you want whenever you resize
your panels for the video to just fit in
nicely then go ahead and leave that at
fit I'd do that 99% of the time however
if for some reason you want to see it
smaller like 10 percent or really big
like 200 percent you can do that too but
usually just leave it at fit and then
whenever you resize everything it's
going to go ahead and fit nicely so
aside from them
we now have all this crap all these
little things that say mark and Mark out
and all these little weird look in
parenthesis things and to be honest 99%
of the time I don't ever touch any of
these six buttons right here they really
annoy me and you can just edit in
online whenever you need to edit right
here but I'm going to go ahead and show
it to you real quick I'm going to go
ahead and zoom out and guys if you just
want to kind of blink out and don't even
listen to what I'm saying for next
minute or so um you can do that because
again like I said I never use them but
if I just skip over them everyone's
going to be mad back oh you should go
over everything so okay let me go ahead
and drag out 36 and 112 two separate
video clips now if I go ahead and scroll
out you can see that these are basically
the same length so now I'm going to go
ahead and delete 112 and double click it
so I preview it in my monitor now what
this in and outpoint
basically does is it shortens the clip
so instead of starting at the very
beginning in the very end you can
shorten it so if you go ahead and move
it till you know two minutes and say
mark in and then you move it to eight
minutes and say mark out your raw file
is now only six minutes long so now when
you go ahead and drag 112 out check it
out it pretty much took that raw file
and shortened it but why did I say never
to use that because obviously you're
going to need to edit clips the reason I
never like to do it like that is because
whenever you're editing I'll show you
later on you can just shorten Clips
really easy so all of this stuff is kind
of like messing with clips but don't do
it ignore what I just said I hate these
buttons right here it's a much easier
way that I'm going to show you in a
couple tutorials so aside from that let
me go ahead and talk about these buttons
right here previous edit point what this
means is basically a cut or a fade or
something you can just go ahead and hit
back and it's going to take you to that
point right here so instead of trying to
line it up maybe you zoom in and you're
trying to line this current time
indicator up exactly or right here you
can go ahead and hit this button and
it's going to jump to previous edit
point real nice and neat now this step
back just moves one step back or one
frame this play button of course a lot
of these are self-explanatory it goes
ahead and it plays your final movie
and then it turns into a stop button you
can go ahead and stop it these ones are
just like these ones but the opposite
now this shuttle and jog is pretty much
like fast-forward or in this show which
is one I never use this one by the way
okay this one shuttle this one jog if
you go ahead and drag this you can move
back and forth in your project kind of
just like fast-forwarding in a kind of
weird way but fYI I never use shuttle or
jog I just find it a lot easier to move
the current time indicator but if you
gette want to get some real precise
movement you can go ahead and use that
if you want so basically the only thing
I ever use here is go back to edit point
and play and stop everything else you
can kind of do with the current time
indicator now these last set of buttons
right here are is useful some of the
time whenever you want to watch
something over and over you can go ahead
and loop it and then if you play it when
it gets to the end it's going to start
all over again if you don't have that on
and you go ahead and play it it's just
going to go ahead and stop whenever it
gets to the end and you know it's just
going to stop just like that but if you
have loop it's going to play over and
over again this next button safe margins
if you go ahead and click that you can
see two boxes appear on your screen one
is called the title safe and one is
called the action safe I don't really
know if this is a problem anymore since
you know everything is kind of up to
date technology wise but on the
old-school TVs whenever you made a movie
it kind of cut out some of the edges
depending on you know what TV
manufacturer or you know maybe you're
watching it in the movie theater versus
your home it kind of cut out some of
these outside edges so this is just
saying all right if you want to
guarantee that something is going to
show make sure it's within these boxes
but I never seen anything really cut out
and have a big problem so I usually just
leave those off one is for the main
action in this middle one is for the
title but again don't really worry about
that too much the output you're never
going to use they lift and extract those
are kind of editing methods which I'm
going to show you guys later the only
other useful thing let's go
to come in handy is say you're making
this video for YouTube and you want a
nice thumbnail so what you would want to
do is look for a good spot where you
know maybe we're saying alright I like
the way you look at the way I'm looking
Oh
it just moved look at the way I'm
looking right now it is excellent I want
to use this as my thumbnail whenever
people search for videos so you what you
would do is hit export frame and this
would pretty much give you the
opportunity to take this frame and save
it as a picture so you can go ahead and
export excuse me export frame is a JPEG
or a ping and you you know pretty much
take this point in time from your movie
and save it as a picture so that's all
that does turn your movie into a single
picture so wow that was a lot of crap to
cover so I hope you guys enjoyed that
probably not but anyways um thank you
for watching in the next story I'm going
to talk to you about how to add some
special effects to your movie and it's
going to be really cool so again thank
you guys for watching don't forget to
subscribe and I will see you guys in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
