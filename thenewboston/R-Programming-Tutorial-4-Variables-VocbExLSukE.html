art tutorial and in this video I want to
talk to you guys about variables now if
you're new to computer programming what
variable is is just a placeholder for
something else so let me go ahead and
give you guys example I'm not going to
be typing our code so don't try to run
this this is actually just some text so
I can demonstrate exactly what a
variable is so say that we have the
variable X and we set it equal to bacon
and then someone writes I love to eat X
obviously what this means is I love to
eat bacon because this X variable is a
placeholder for bacon so that's how easy
it is in real life and actually that's
how easy it is in R as well so how do we
set these variables actually using R
well there are a couple different ways
and let me go ahead and show you that
right now
say that well let's go ahead and keep
the variable X what we can do is use the
equal sign and set it equal to some
value such as 32 so right now whenever
we use X in our program the computer
sees it is 32 so now we can do those
math functions like before such as X
plus um 8 or something like that and if
we highlight both these and run it the
result is of course 40 because Y X which
is 32 plus 8 equals 40 very simple now
another way that we can set variables is
a little bit different um and I say
different because it's different than
using the equals sign and it's also a
little bit different than other
programming languages what you can do is
make a variable let's just name this one
B you can name the variable pretty much
any the rules for naming a variable is
this you can name it any combination of
letters but it can't start with a number
and it can't start with an underscore
and there are a couple other rules as
well but I'll talk to you guys about the
specific rules right now right now just
name it any letter or
any word easy enough so anyways I'm
going to name mine B and what I want to
do is I want to set this equal to 8 so
we can press equals 8 but we can also
use this little symbol the less than and
then the - I don't know if it's called a
- this next 0 on your keyboard but what
this does is it basically this helps
some people like visualize it better
assign the value of 8 to the variable B
or set 8 equal to B so this is basically
the same thing is this but the arrow is
a little more common in R so right now
whenever we use B we're going to get 8
so we can do B plus 10 run this bad boy
and check it out 18 so those are two
different ways that we can set or assign
variables on whatever you want to call
it and another cool thing is we can also
set multiple variables at once so say
that we have the variables Bucky and
tuna let me go ahead and type this and
we want to set all those to like a my
favorite number 20 so whenever we want
to set multiple variables at once we can
write the code like this and what this
is basically saying is take the value of
20 and assign it to tuna and Bucky as
well so now anytime we use Bucky or tuna
let's just go ahead and you can actually
just type the variable name to print it
out we can see that Bucky is equal to 20
and tuna is also equal to 20 so that's
another way of doing that if you want to
again set the value of multiple
variables at once you can do it all in
one line no need for two different lines
for Bucky and tuna so that'll clean up
your code a little bit as well and the
last thing I want to mention is that
there is even a third way to set a
variable so again we learn the equal
sign
we learned the little arrow and now I'm
going to hit you with a third one and
that is using the keyword assign now
this is actually called a function but
we'll talk more about functions later on
so what this function does is it
basically you need to give it two pieces
of information separated with a comma
the first one is the name of your
variable and I'm just going to name my
variable ham and then hit a comma and
then after that you need to give it the
value so I'll just set this equal to 71
one of my favourite hockey players
numbers and what this is going to do is
it's going to assign the value of 71 to
the variable ham so now we can do ham
plus oh let's just do a ham plus 20 or
something run this and check it out
whenever we assign 71 the ham we can do
ham which is 71 plus 20 and that equals
91 and if you're ever wondering alright
so we know how to set variables equal to
values but how do we pretty much how do
I say this
how do we remove the assignment or how
do we remove on the fact that 71 is
assigned to him well what we can do is
we can use another function called our M
and of course this only takes one um
they're called parameters but one piece
of information and that's the name of
the variable so let me go ahead and do
this and I'll tell you tell you guys
what I'm doing so the first line is
going to assign the value of 71 to ham
so we're going to print out ham on the
screen and it's going to say 71 and now
when we remove the values from ham this
ham variable has no value anymore since
we removed it that's what our M means so
now when we print it out well I'll show
you guys what happens so the first thing
we did is we assigned 71 ham printed out
71 and then we removed the ham variable
and I said object not found because well
we removed
it's no longer in memory so that's why
you would want to remove a variable it
pretty much helps free up memory and uh
well can help your computer or your
program run faster but that is basically
what a variable is
now you guys understand and you also
understand the three different ways that
you can assign values to variables to
use in your program later on so thank
you guys for watching and also if you
guys ever have any questions then there
is a forum and I'll put a link below
Bucky's room org slash forum you can go
to that and there's a bunch of people
willing to help so thank you and I'll
see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
