familiar with this environment if you go
to view file system support then you can
see that these are the different file
systems and you know these are the
different things that you can do with
them just real quick
these ext 2's don't mind like most of
these are here most of these are old
legacy or you don't really use them that
often anymore
all these ext s on ext2 you don't really
see a lot anymore but xt3
this is a file system that's used on
Linux alot X t4 is the more modern one
for Linux so if you want a file system
um you know for example to plop on your
USB that's going to be compatible with
all versions then you can use this but
this X t4 is the more modern one if you
don't have to worry about compatibility
if you want to make a file system on
your USB Drive that's going to be
compatible with any operating system
Linux Windows Mac then you probably want
to use fat32 and whenever you buy USB
Drive they're probably all going to have
fat32 or NTFS may be installed but these
are the ones that are kind of you know
cross-platform so worried about those
right now now another thing is whenever
you have your device selected if you
just go to view device information it's
going to give you some basic information
about this device and this is just the
USB Drive this is the model size this is
the path to it so on and so forth and
high that just go to view device
information again and boom alright so
right now like I said it came with one
huge partition on it and we want to get
rid of that because you know in this
tutorial I'm going to show you how to
create your own so if you select this
partition before we delete it let's just
actually just view some information
about it so partition information and we
see ok so this partition uses the fat32
filesystem in other words we can pretty
much use this USB drive on any computer
so Windows Linux Mac it's going to be
compatible with anything and for this
partition it's pretty much taking up the
entire USB Drive
so if you you know want to put another
operating system on here or something
else and you can't really do that so
let's close out of this and alright so
we want to delete this partition but
before we can just delete it as you see
hmm deletes grayed out right here we
actually need to unmount the filesystem
and that pretty much just means unlock
it so again select your partition go to
partition unmount and then what this is
going to do is it's going to unlock the
filesystem right here so now if we have
a selected we can delete it where's the
Lee right there all right now with this
gparted
we do is you actually write what you
want to do and then you click this check
check mark right here and it says apply
all operations so if you just hit this
are you sure you want to delete this
partition yes we do and it's going to
say ok it is accomplished or whatever
the little indicator so close out of
that so now our USB Drive has no
partitions no parts it's just a blank
you know piece of hardware well what I'm
going to do is I'm going to actually
make two partitions on here we're going
to say that I know maybe you want to put
um Ubuntu or some operating system on
one part and we just want to use the
other part for storage maybe you want to
save files for school or something well
the first thing I recommend doing is
actually creating our partition table
now this is just part of the device that
keeps track of all your partitions that
you're about to make and it's really
easy so if you go to device create a
partition table then you can just say
ms-dos that's the most common one and
hit apply that I hit it alright there we
go so now we have partition table now we
can start creating partitions and it's
going to be able to keep track of them
so in order to create a partition or a
chunk on your USB Drive just select this
unlock on allocated space and hit
partition new I believe we can also
click this all right click that nice
little icon instead and now it's saying
okay you want to create a chunk on here
I need some information about it
so first let's just go ahead and give it
a size and I'll just say on like a
gigabyte so 8 1 9 2 all right so that's
how big this partition is going to be
and whenever you click this it's going
to auto fill in so we're taking up you
know about 1/4 of this USB drive right
here now if you want you can actually
take this and slide it but I like having
it nice and neat so like doing it
manually all right so you always want to
line to this right here because it just
is faster performance whenever they're
aligned on to the proper megabyte so
always keep that remember we can create
it as a primary partition looks good the
filesystem we might as well keep this as
XT 4 again ext3 is kind of the standard
for linux but xt 4 is good for more
modern systems where you know we don't
really need the standard and the last
thing we're going to do is we're just
going to give it label so let me
actually say that I want to install
Kalyan here so I'm just going to name it
Kali
and hit add so create the partition and
of course hit this check box and hit
apply and it's going to go ahead and
create and it actually takes like I'm I
don't know maybe a minute or two all
right so it took about 40 seconds
looking good we now have one partition
on our USB Drive but now I actually want
to create another one so I don't know
maybe I want to store some files on it
for school so just hit new partition and
for this I will give it um I don't know
a little bit smaller so 4 0 9 6 and for
this since I want to use this on Linux
and Windows I'm actually going to use
fat32 and I'll just say like school
whatever name it whatever you want and
hit add so now if I hit check apply it's
going to make this partition as well all
right looking good now close out of this
and boom
look in sweet art so remember this
device was SDB our hard drive was SDA
and this USB Drive was SD B so now that
we created two partitions that's why we
have these numbers stb-1 and SD b2 if we
were to create another partition maybe
for I don't know some other a
distribution of Linux then it would be
SD b3 but now let me just close out of
this completely and check it out so if I
just look at this visually we can see
that it's pretty much visualizing it as
two separate devices so even though that
this is one USB Drive since we
partitioned it it's essentially looking
at two separate devices so this could be
like I said operating system this could
be all of your schoolwork all of your
personal files I don't know maybe we're
working on a website whatever so there
you go that's the basics of how to take
a device or a drive and break it up or
partition it into separate chunks so you
can keep your files separate from one
another and yeah there you go so thank
guys for watching see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
