to another Photoshop cs6 tutorial
I'm your host buddy Blackbird today
we're going to go over using the stroke
command and we're going to do that by
using a selection so it's going to be
pretty easy to show you so let's just go
over here to your selection and just go
ahead and make a selection click on it
and just make any anything you want and
I'm just going to do the square because
it's right there so what we're going to
do is make sure that your selection is
on a new layer some that'll be just
easier to follow along with and come up
here to edit and then we're going to go
to stroke and what a stroke is is a line
around the outside of your selection so
you actually have the option to make it
on the center your selection on the
outside or on the inside that you can
adjust the width the color and then
here's some blending mode stuff but I
wouldn't worry about that too much so go
ahead and add something like 5 pixels
change the color to anything you want
I'll just change it to black and then
we'll just start on the whatever's and
already click down which for me is
Center I'm going to hit OK and now you
can see along the dotted line here by
zoom in you can see that when the stroke
went out from the center of the dotted
line and that's how it created it using
the center I'm going to hit control Z to
go back let's go back to the stroke and
this time we'll just do inside and you
can see now that on the inside of the
dotted line that's where the stroke is
and I'm sure you all know what's going
to happen next it's going to be on the
outside when I click on outside here so
that's how you use the stroke the next
thing that I want to show you is called
a fill so what I'm going to do is to
illustrate this a little better is I'm
going to create another selection so
let's move back here
and what I'm going to do is I'm going to
subtract from the selection here so we
got like a box here that is has a hole
in the middle of it so if I add a stroke
right now edit stroke will add that in
and I'll just make this like 2 pixels
and I'll just hit outside you can see
now that there they are on the outside
of the box so this box that I made is
missing the middle if I take off this
background you can see well I guess it
didn't really matter if I took off the
background but that's how its work now
this is good for me to demonstrate what
a fill is for you so I'm going to undo
the stroke and let's go ahead and add a
fill and what a fill does is it just
fills in between your selection here the
one that I'm going to pick right now is
going to be the foreground color which
is going to be black I'm going to hit OK
and you can see that the middle has been
filled in or the selection has been
filled in now if I go ahead and maybe
like add another shape it within here
I'll just throw this in here and that
did not work okay that's fine as because
I switch into another shape let me go
back to my rectangle let's add in here
and then let's just go to edit fill and
we've got a foreground color again I hit
it and then you can see that since this
is now part of the shape this has also
been filled in so that's how the fill
works let's go into the fill and check
out some of the other options we've got
the ability to use our background color
which would have been white I can choose
a color so let's choose red hit OK and
that's how that fills in like that
we can add a stroke on top of our fill
we would like to get something like this
and then let's go back to fill we've got
a couple other options here
content-aware fills it in with what as
with what's underneath pattern will
you're able to select a pattern that you
have downloaded the Photoshop and
history here you can use like a snapshot
or something like that and we've got
black 50% gray and white now if we click
on preserve transparency here it'll
preserve any areas that are actually
transparent so if I click that okay
it'll preserve anything that is a
transparent within the object so this
stuff will always remain transparent
because it is so that's a little neat
and that's pretty much it for the fill
and stroke using our selections here so
thanks for watching it and if you have
any questions write them in the comments
and I'll try to answer as many as I can
and thanks for watching everybody give
it a thumbs up if you liked the video
have a good one everyone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
