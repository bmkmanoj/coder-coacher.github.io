tutorial and in this tutorial I'm going
to be creating just a basic array table
to show you guys visually the index and
value of each array so let's go ahead
and just make a header for our table
using a system.out.print line statement
and I'm just going to put index and then
put a tab and backslash T is just a tab
it's like five spaces or something I
didn't feel like typing five spaces
because I'm lazy just put backslash T
then put some value let me show you guys
what this is real quick this gives you
this index of value and that's the
header for our table so now we have a
header I can go ahead and list the index
and value of each array but before we do
that we need an array of course so I'm
going to make integer array called Bucky
and I'm going to use that a ray
initializer that we use last time and go
ahead and add like five or six values or
something at like 30 to 18
the 54 and 2 it doesn't really matter
how many values you add as you'll see
why later on but go ahead and make an
array and put some values in there
doesn't really matter what they are or
what how many you have next let's go
ahead and make a for loop to loop
through each index of our array so let's
go ahead and press 4 and we want it to
start let's make a counter variable
before I keep talking we want it to
start at 0 because our array our first
index of our array is 0 even though it
might have 6 elements in it or 5 the
first one is the 0 with index and you'll
see why this is later on but and then
the next thing you want to do is give it
how long do you want to go well as long
as it's less than however you however
many are in your array and this brings
me to another point every time you make
an array your computer knows how many
objects are in that array and it stores
it in something called the name of your
array dot length and the only thing
that's going to change in this is the
first one whatever you named your array
dot length is would be in this case 1 2
3 4 5 so counter is less than 5 but for
rate changes you don't have to change
this so anytime you put your array name
dot length that gives you the length of
your rate it's built into Java it's
pretty cool function and now let's just
make it increment by 1 and now that we
have our for loop looping through five
times beginning is zero we can begin to
use this so let's go ahead and make a
print statement out print line Die type
of right hopefully and the first thing
we want to output is the counter and
what the counter is going to resemble is
our index it starts at 0 and it goes to
4 0 1 2 3 4 and this is going to
resemble the index so this counter has
the exact same value is the index
next let's go ahead and just put a tab
because I'm too lazy to put a bunch of
spaces and now our last value we want to
enter and this is going to be under the
value tab of our table we want to enter
the value of the array so Bucky and in
here we have the index which is going to
be counter so let me run this and let me
show you guys what this does hopefully I
don't have any errors and I don't so
here's what it does as you can see we
have built a nice little table right
here that shows us what index of our
array is and what the value is so Bucky
0 equals 32 1 12 and so on as you can
see
Bucky 0 equals 32 1 12 to 18 354 4 2 and
that's what this table did down here
there you go now let me show you guys or
explain you guys one last time why this
works the first thing we need to do was
create a header this is just so to make
it look pretty pretty much the next
thing we did was create an array
initializer and I tell you guys how to
do this in the last tutorial the next
thing we did was make a for loop and key
here is you need to start is 0 and this
is because your first index starts at 0
so that's where we want this to start as
you can see right here index starts to 0
after that what you did is enter a
maximum for how far you want your
counter go and your maximum depends on
how big your array is and you can get
this by the special link thing I told
you about and of course you want to go
go through it one at a time after that
you just output it on the screen counter
which was the index which was cycled 0
through 4 this thing will just give you
a bunch of spaces in between and Bucky
and then the counter inside it or the
subscript inside it and whenever you did
this a reference say you reference Bucky
1 it will give you this value Bucky to
this value Bucky 3 Bucky 4
Bucky's
zero so that is how you build basic
table to it pretty much is just a nice
visual so you can see the indexes and
values of your arrays so that's pretty
much all that does and I hope you
understood that at least a little bit
so thank you guys for watching don't
forget to subscribe to my channel and
hopefully I'll see you next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
