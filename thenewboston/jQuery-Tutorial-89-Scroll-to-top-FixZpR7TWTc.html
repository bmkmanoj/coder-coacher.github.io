with a video tutorial for the new Boston
we're going to be taking a look at
scrolling to the top of the page using
jQuery and the first thing that we're
going to do is use the animate feature
of jQuery to you know force our user to
the top of the page you've probably
visited pages before with lots of
content on and they will have a link at
the bottom of the page content just to
say go to top and then that will take
you to the top of the page now
traditionally this was done with an a
tag and this had a particular name so
for example it would be called say top
let's just go and take a look our page
content you can see that I've just got
like a load of text on here live just
Latin text on here just to stimulate
simulate a large amount of content on a
page and we would then have a link at
the bottom for example go to top and
this would be let's just put that in
paragraph tags so it stays away from the
rest of the content and then you would
just sort of like reference hash top in
this H ref and that would take you to
the top of the page now I personally
find there are a few problems with this
let's just get rid of this content here
that was from a previous tutorial when
we go to the bottom we can click go to
top and that will take us straight to
the top of the page where the a tag was
you know initiated up here so we've got
this just linking up here now the one
problem that we've got with this is that
we can't animate it and it's a bit sort
of like sudden and jerky the other
problem that we have is it you have to
be careful where you place this because
you'll notice that at the moment we've
got some whitespace just up here if we
go down to the bottom of the page and
click go to top you see it cuts off this
white space altogether and as well you
have the problem where you know you
might want to you have to might place
this a in a particular area on your page
where you want the content to go to the
other problem we've got is the URL now
shows hash top so it looks slightly
messy in that sense with regards to the
URL so if you do have a problem with
that as I've experienced we can go ahead
and use jQuery to you know do exactly
the same thing but you know a lot more
effectively and we can add animation as
well so let's just go ahead and get rid
of this tag up here this a tag and we're
going to keep this go to top link but
this time we're going to set the H ref
to hash we're not going to actually
allow this link to go anywhere now this
will still put a hash on the URL but we
won't have this hash top present let's
just go ahead and test that out so go to
top at the moment just gives us a hash
there but we you know don't really have
the ability to you know to control this
I mean I think we do but I'm not going
to cover it in this tutorial so what I'm
gonna do is I'm gonna give this go to
top link a class and this is going to be
called top and what we can do in jQuery
is we can allow when this link is
clicked to animate to the top of the
page so we don't need any a tags on here
and you can also use this function to
actually you know perhaps supply a you
know although not really you know
advisable but you can use an on click
and for example you could use a top and
then specify an element in here of your
page so there's a variety of different
ways we can do this and with jQuery it
makes it extremely easy as well so we've
got this go to top link here and the
class is called top so we're going to
use jQuery to reference this link now
I've included ext djuced on my page as
well as jQuery obviously we need to make
use of jQuery and ext jeaious is where
we're going to be writing all about
jQuery code and there isn't really a lot
of code to write but we're gonna look at
it quite carefully so now that we've
done this we can come over to ext top
j/s and we want to go ahead and wait for
the document to load as we usually would
with jQuery so document dot ready or not
really the document to load this doesn't
do this it just you know this initiates
as soon as the Dom is available so the
first thing we want to go ahead and do
is set an event
to this link so we know when this class
top has been pressed and you can use
these links anywhere and give them the
same class and it'll have exactly the
same effect so you could have them say
twice on your page one halfway down and
one at the bottom so we are using a
jQuery selector to select top week
selecting a class called top and we want
to say dot click so now when our link is
clicked we perform a function within
here so we outline our function and we
bring these braces down or brackets down
so anything inside of here now will
execute when this click when this when
this link has been clicked or any other
element associates with top is clicked
ok so now we want to go ahead and
actually animate to the top of the page
so we are using another selector and
this is HTML body so we're selecting
HTML and body as the selector so this is
what where we want to animate to so we
use the animate function in jQuery and
we're going to take two parameters here
and the first one is the actions or the
animations that we want to perform and
then the speed afterwards so we'll set
this to zero for now so in inside here
the animation that we want to actually
carry out is scroll top and the value is
going to be zero we want to scroll to
the very top of HTML and body so we're
scrolling to zero position zero here if
we were to change this to say 20 it
would scroll you know sort of like 20 in
measurement from the very top and
obviously zero is the speed so now that
we've done this we're actually ready to
go we can go ahead and test our link out
let's go to the bottom and click go to
top and you'll see it takes us all the
way to the top of the document including
this whitespace area as well which means
we've eliminated the needs to even put
an a tag in in the first place but
considering that we had it at the very
top of our body it still didn't show the
whole document so we've animated to the
very top you'll also note that if we do
change this value I'll go ahead and
change that to say 100
let's go and refresh the page and come
down to the bottom and click go to top
oh and you see that hasn't actually
worked okay maybe I'm wrong maybe I'm
wrong in that sense but anyway scroll
top zero and we want to go ahead and in
fact this might work as +20 let me just
go ahead and try this no it hasn't okay
so you could probably go ahead and look
that up I'm probably having a funny
moment where I'm unsure what I'm doing
but we've got this last integer here
which we can either set to a millisecond
speed or a textual representation of a
speed so obviously speeds and j.crew we
have broke jquery sorry we have slow
normal and fast so we can either specify
them or we can go ahead and specify an
amount of milliseconds that we want this
time this scroll to happen so from the
very bottom when we click it to the top
we might want to say three seconds which
would be 3,000 milliseconds so I'm gonna
go ahead and first of all choose slow
and then we'll look at the difference so
this will automatically you know create
an animation because we've supplied it
with a speed so instead of applying
supplying it with zero we're now
applying it with a particular speed so
let's go ahead and click go to the top
and you can see that that scrolled with
a nice slow speed of the top of the page
we could also then go ahead if that
might get annoying to your users for
example if you had sort of a lot of
content and you wanted them to go more
or less straight to the top that still
maintains some kind of animation you
could go ahead and change it too fast
and that you know speeds up to the top
but also you know shows the nice
scrolling animation as well and as I
mentioned we could use a speed such as
ten seconds so for example if you did
need this kind of effect I think it's
quite effective if you were to have you
know say an application that or a
webpage that you want to just manually
scroll the user down the page to display
all the content if it was a more sort of
visual site as opposed to you know
something being able to be used you
could use this but you
could you scroll to the bottom instead
so you could start say at the top of the
page and scroll down to the bottom
anyway let's go ahead and click go to
top and you can see that this slowly
starts to scroll up the page and you can
probably tell now that how nice it would
be if you were to you know enter a user
into a website and have them scroll all
the way down to the bottom to view all
the content and perhaps you could have
some kind of now smooth event to stop
this at particular points so essentially
I've gone on about you know adding to
this and creating animation with it so I
guess you could call it some kind of
animating tutorial but for now we've
selected the HTML body with animated by
scrolling to the top and here we've
supplied ten seconds
and we've done this all with just
creating our link and letting jQuery
handle this so much better than
supplying the a tags ourself so that's
how we are going to scroll to the top
using a go to top link in jQuery</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
