tutorial and now that we know what
collections are let's go ahead and learn
about packages so in this tutorial what
I'm gonna be doing is I'm gonna show you
guys how to create your own custom
packages and how to add things inside
them like materials and stuff so let's
go ahead and actually carry on right now
and before I get started I want to say
this when people typically make packages
they typically like the group similar
objects and packages for example they
want a packages a package of sounds or a
package of materials or static meshes
what we're gonna be doing is since we
already know what materials are let's go
ahead and make a package for materials
so in order to make a new package
can you guess what one yep create a new
asset and this is gonna allow you to
create a new package so the package name
I'm just gonna name mine my package
sounds kind of kind of dumb so um
buckey's awesome package kinda sound
sexual but I kind of like it at the same
time so grouping a group is pretty much
a it's a like a way of organizing all
your stuff so go ahead and just type
materials it's not that important your
name just go ahead and this is actually
going to be the name of your material
itself so I'm just gonna name my like
crappy material oh one and for your
factory you need to select what you're
gonna be storing in your package and of
course if I can find it material right
here so this crappy material one is a
name for a material so go ahead and
click OK and now when you do first you
get this material editor that pops up
and we're gonna go ahead and exit it up
for now because we're not ready for that
yet the material editor is where you
make your material but like I said we're
not ready for that yet so by default
whenever we hit OK the material editor
pops up and behind that it took a sort
of package so as you can see in new
packages right here we got a package
called Bucky's awesome package and our
group is materials and inside our group
we have our material which is called
crappy material
by the way this little asterisk next to
the bookies awesome package means that
you created a package with a material in
it but you didn't save it yet so make
sure you go ahead and save it and you do
that by right-clicking it and press save
and now just go ahead and it verifies
where you want to save it and now you
can see the ACT asterisks disappear so
that's all the asterisk means make sure
you save it or else when you excited the
UDK you're not going to have it so that
is how you create a new package and add
a new material to it but say you already
have a package created so I already
created this package I want to add a new
material in this package any time I
already have a package created and I
want to add an additional material just
go ahead and right-click anywhere in
here and click new material there at
Gori there and I could add a new
material but for now I'm just gonna
stick with our one material don't want
to jump ahead of ourselves so in order
to open that material editor what we can
do is we could have not exit out of it
but I want to exit out of it because I
want to show you guys how to access it
anytime you want to work with a material
in the material editor go ahead and
select your material in the content
browser and go ahead and just double
click it and whenever you double click
it this thing called the material editor
is going to pop up now the material
editor is where we create our own custom
materials pretty cool huh
so let me give you guys a quick overview
of the material editor in the upcoming
tutorials
I'm gonna be teaching guys how to add
textures and how to add you know make
your materials different colors and
shiny and stuff like that but for now
I'll just give you guys a quick overview
because you know I have some extra time
I might as well so the first thing I
want to talk about is this toolbar white
right up here now just like when I was
covering the UDK in general a lot of
these tools were not ready I'm basically
going to be covering them as we go along
so eventually we're gonna know all these
tools mean but some of this stuff like
toggle real time material viewport we're
not even close to wearing with that as
yet so instead of overwhelming you guys
with like toggle expression in real time
previews I'm just gonna say these are
tools that we're going to be covering
later
now this is a black pane right here this
is called the preview pane or the
preview window I guess whatever you want
to call it and whenever we carry a
material we can preview it in 3d on a 3d
model for example if we made a material
of wood we can go ahead and draw sphere
and it would show us what the material
would would look like on a sphere so
it's pretty much just a preview pane and
that's why it says preview up there
pretty cool huh
now this big gray panel with this window
floating around it's called the
materials expression window or panel I'm
just gonna call them panels so without
getting too in-depth for now expressions
are pretty much formulas that give they
pretty much give you a value and they
allow you to change the appearance of
your material now again I'm gonna be
getting in this later but here's your
material right here and here all the
different aspects or attributes of it
the diffuse is the general color the
emissive is like the glow the specular
is how shiny it is so what we're gonna
be doing is we're gonna be bringing a
formula like this in this formula is
gonna like output the number seven I'm
just want to say that for a quick
example and now when we give the value
of seven to your diffuse it's gonna like
turn it blue or something so this pretty
much outputs something and changes one
of the attributes and again that was a
pretty bad example I know I didn't
really I'm just giving you guys a real
quick example so anyways that's what the
material expressions pane does if you
don't understand that then you probably
shouldn't because that was a pretty
terrible example but over here is the
expressions list this is pretty much all
the formulas that you can have and by
the way I want to mention this the
reason you need formulas instead of just
constant numbers is say this you have a
material that you want to apply to a
spaceship well we can apply the color
red to it or the color blue to it and it
will stay red or blue forever but
whenever you're playing the game you
don't always want to apply a constant
color so that's why you need formulas a
for
can change its value so soon all right
why would I want a material that changes
its value well say you were modeling a
spaceship or something and you had green
lights on it but anytime that spaceship
got shot the lights you might want to
make turn red or something or maybe you
had a gun and whenever you fired it the
material would change to like a glowing
fire material so that's why it has all
these different properties and these
formulas can change the properties as we
go along so I see how I'm saying you see
why we don't just apply a constant value
to these attributes right here we
actually need a formula to change those
values if need be so with that being
said the last thing I want to talk to
you guys about is this expression list
down here now this I mean excuse me this
was the expression list right over here
this down here is the properties panel
now the properties panel whenever you
don't have anything selected like here's
a formula right here whenever I'm just
gonna deselect everything it gives you
all your properties of your material
that you're working on and since we
don't even have a material we made yet
it's not going to show us a whole lot of
stuff but whenever we do we can adjust
some of these settings it's pretty much
allow you to adjust the settings of your
material however once you have one of
these things called an expression
selected it allows you to edit the
properties of that expression so
depending on what you have selected if
you have nothing selected it's just your
general material properties if you have
an expression selected it gives you the
properties of that expression and again
I know you guys don't know what
expressions or properties or any of
these attributes mean yeah but trust me
I just wanted to give you guys a quick
overview of this material editor and by
the end of these next like three
tutorials you guys are going to be a pro
at this so thank you guys for watching
don't forget to subscribe and I'll see
you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
