tutorial that I'm making for the new
Boston and in this tutorial I'm going to
be showing you how to use arrays so all
you gonna need for this tutorial is a
button and once you're going your form
just go ahead and double click on it
alright so an array is basically a
special variable that will allow you to
hold multiple variables of the same type
so for example if I were to create a
string array then I could only hold
strings inside of there
but I can hold multiple strings inside
of it so we're just going to go ahead
right here and create a string array so
it's going to type out string and then
following that we're going to want to
put two brackets and those two brackets
basically just symbolize that this
variable is going to be a array so we're
going to be able to hold multiple
strings inside of this and following
that you're just going to want to put a
space and then you're going to want to
give a name to your array and I'm just
going to call it names since we're going
to be holding multiple people's names
inside of the string array then yours
going to put an equal sign and 2m empty
curly braces and then inside these curly
braces is very going to want to store
all the strings that will be inside of
your string array so to start adding
strings to our array we're just going to
want to put two quotes and then inside
of here we're going to want to put the
first string will be inside of our array
and the first name will be inside of our
array is Adam so I'm just going to put
Adam and then if I wanted to add another
string I'll just put a comma and then
add another string so if I want to have
Adam and Bob inside of my string now I
have that so inside of my string right
here I have two people's names Adam and
Bob if I wanted to add a third I just
put another comma and then another
person's name non-smoker Joe alright so
at the moment we have three people's
names inside of the string array right
here to access them what you're going to
want to do is type the name of your
string right and I just called it names
so I'm just going to put names and then
two brackets and then inside of these
brackets I'm going to want to put the
index of the string that we're trying to
access so if we wanted to access Adam
we're
put zero because computers start
counting at zero so the first element
inside of any array its index is always
zero so this right here 0 this is 1 and
this is 2 so if you want to access atom
we're going to put 0 inside of there all
right and let's just display this in a
message box and see what happens
so message box show and we should just
get atom in a message box sent inside of
our names right the string at the zero
index is atom so we should just get atom
in message box yep and if I wanted to
get Bob in a message box or access fob I
just put a 1 there since it goes 0 1 2
so I should just get a Bob in a message
box now yep and if I wanted to get Joe
I'd obviously just put 2 and it should
get Joe yep perfect
alright and there's another way to
create arrays so for example if you just
want to create an array that's empty and
doesn't have anything in it then what
you can do is just say new and then
whatever variable type your array is
holding and ours is strings so it's
going to put string and then two
brackets then inside these brackets
we're going to want to take the number
of strings or elements that our array
will be able to hold so if you want our
string array to be able to hold five
strings we just put five in there and
now inside of our string array we have
five empty strings so if we wanted to
access the fourth element which would be
the last we just put four inside of
there and we should get nothing in a
message box since none of the strings
inside of our string array are set equal
to something we just simply created
spots for them
so yeah we get nothing and that goes for
every single M element inside of our
string array or every single string
inside of our string array so if we were
to put 0 we get nothing in a message box
yeah but you wanted to change that we
could so to access the zero element we
just put names and then 0 so we're
accessing the
at zero and then if we wanted to set it
equal something or just put an equal
sign right there and two quotes and
inside these quotes we're just going to
want to put whatever you want to set
string at zero index equal to so if we
want to set it equal to I don't know go
then now if we were to show names and at
the zero index and a message box would
get Jo because we changed it right up
here to Jo and now we're displaying the
string at that index just debug and see
what happens and yet we get Jo perfect
and you can create arrays of different
types so up until now all we did with
strings but you could create a pool
array or an integer array or something
like that for example right here I'm
just going to go ahead and create an
integer array so I'm just going to type
int and then following that two brackets
to symbolize that it's going to be an
array and then it will be able to hold
multiple numbers or multiple integers
then I'm just going to want to the name
to my array I'm just going to call it
numbers I guess so numbers and then I'm
just going to set it equal to on two
curly brace brackets so inside of here
I'm just going to list all the numbers
that I want to be stored inside of my
integer array so I'm just going to have
five five five six six six and seven
seven seven all right so now inside of
my integer array right here I have three
numbers 555 666 and 777 so if I wanted
to access this 666 I would just put
numbers for the name of my integer array
right here and then two brackets and
inside these brackets the index of the
integer that I want to access so if I
want to access 666 I just put one in
here since it starts counting at 0 so
this is 0 this is 1 and this is 2 so I
just put a 1 in there and since this is
a number or integer we're going to have
to convert it into a string so I'm just
going to do that to string right there
and now we should get 666 and our
message
yep perfect all right so that's pretty
much it for this tutorial on using and
creating arrays so see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
