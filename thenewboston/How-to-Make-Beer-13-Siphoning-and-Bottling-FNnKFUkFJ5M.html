need to siphon the beer from the
fermenter to the bottom of the bucket
and this actually helps you have two
people because one can go ahead and
siphon and the other can make sure that
the hose stays in the bottle it's also
slippery
so don't block the shot if your DOB
so what you want to do whenever you're
cycling is you want to make sure that
you start at the top and work your way
down as the beer level goes down because
you have a layer of gunk at the bottom
so if you jam it right into the gunk
then your cycling is going to go ahead
and get clogged so anyways with this
auto siphon just go ahead and stick it
right in and give it one or two pumps
and as you can see the siphon begins now
if we never siphon before a few tips
that are probably pretty obvious is
first of all make sure that your
fermenter is at a higher level than the
bucket of course and also once we start
getting towards the bottom if you don't
have two people then it's going to be
pretty difficult with two people it's
pretty easy but what's going to happen
is we're going to have a really low
level of liquid so if you can get a book
or some other wedge to stick in here
what you can do is you can actually tilt
this and get the most liquid you can so
again with two people one person holding
I can go ahead and tota myself but if
you only have one person then just go
ahead and jam a book under here and now
that can ensure that you get as much
beer as possible and what you also want
to do now is you want to make sure that
the hose is pressed against the side of
the bucket don't go ahead and put in the
middle because if you do it's going to
create a lot of oxygen and we don't want
a lot of oxygen in it right now so go
ahead and make sure your siphon is nice
and quiet and the liquid doesn't create
a lot of bubbles or anything so what
Joey is doing right now
go ahead and keep the hose pressed up
against the side of the bucket
that's pretty good right there you're
going to have a little bit of liquid or
beer left and fermenter that's fine and
now just go ahead and leave your gunk
behind you can go ahead and make cookies
or pancakes with that or something now
the next thing you need to do is you
need to go ahead and take your priming
solution and pour it into your beer and
you want to go ahead and stir this after
this you use a big spoon working just go
ahead and use your siphon just stir for
a couple seconds now the reason that we
need to add that priming sugar is so we
can have a small controlled fermentation
while our beer is in the body so before
whenever we were fermenting the beer our
goal was to create alcohol we did that
however we allowed all of the carbon
dioxide to escape through the bunghole
well now what we want to do is you want
to go ahead and keep that in the beer so
whenever we pour this in we're going to
go ahead and put the cap on and that
sugar that we just added is going to go
ahead and go through the fermentation
process however instead of allowing the
carbon dioxide to escape it's going to
go ahead and stay in our beer and
carbonate it so that of course is how
you carbonate beer through priming sugar
so now what we need to do is we need to
go ahead and hook up the bottling
assembly so go ahead and take one end of
your hose this is a tight fit hook it up
to the spigot and make sure that's on
till you and you really want to make
sure that the hose is pressed all the
way to the top as far as it can go or
else it may leak then just go ahead and
take the other end of the hose and
attach it to your bottle filler right
like that so now go ahead and grab a
sanitized bottle from the bottle tree
and of course stick your bottle filler
in and press it against the bottom of
the bottle now whenever you do this a
valve is going to open and it's going to
allow beer to flow from the bucket to
the bottle now go ahead and when you get
to the top pull it out and as you can
see you have about an inch of head space
and that's perfect alright guys
congratulations you are now finished
making the beer the only thing you have
to do now is you need to actually let
the
badal sit for two weeks this process is
called conditioning and it's when the
beer becomes carbonated now after two
weeks you can just go ahead make sure
you know it's cold of course pop it open
and drink it now whenever you do there
may be a small layer or sediment on the
bottom so what I like to do is I like to
go ahead and pour this in the glass and
I like to leave about an inch left
because all that gunk we didn't filter
it out completely
whenever you make your own homemade beer
there may be some small particles or
like I said sediment on the bottom so if
you want to just go ahead and drink it
right from the bottle or pour in a glass
but anyways if you guys have any
questions about anything then just go
ahead and leave me a comment below and
also make sure to check out my
winemaking tutorials I'm going to be
making though those in about like two
weeks or something so anyways thank you
guys for watching and I'll see you next
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
