slash on live gamer for the new Boston
and in this tutorial we're going to be
talking about the get names method or
function in system in the system
namespace and the enum class now if you
remember from the last tutorial we used
get values in this tutorial we're using
get names now it's not necessary that
you know what we did in the last
tutorial but it'll probably help you
so other than get values there's get
names and get name so we'll go ahead and
just create a little demo for this now
you can see that we have list enum names
and we created that in the last tutorial
for a purpose so we're going to list the
names of the items in our enumeration so
we're just going to use a for each loop
for this so for each item as and since
we're using the name we're going to go
ahead and use string instead of integer
because the items are a string so in and
now we're going to use the system
namespace dot enum dot get names now you
can see there's get names and get name
we're going to be using get names and we
will talking about get names at I mean
get name after this so now what we're
going to do is we are going to get the
type of sports so get type and sports
and we'll go ahead and press enter and
now what we're going to do is we're
going to type list enum names items dot
add and we'll add item and we don't need
to convert that to a string because it
already is a string so let's go ahead
and run this and see what kind of
results we get so let's go ahead and
select sport we'll select a football and
I'll say your sport is football we get
the values which is 0 1 &amp;amp; 2 and the
names which is baseball basketball and
football and you can see that these
match up to the corresponding values if
we go ahead and
grow up to the enumeration here and so
the application you can see baseball is
zero basketball is one and football is
two now we can do this with any other
value and it's going to give us the same
results now you can see that it
continues to add it to the list
so we can go ahead and do make a simple
fix for this so we'll come down here
below combo sports and we'll type
private sub clear lists clear list okay
and inside this will just type list enum
names dot items dot clear and lists in
them values items dot clear so this is
just going to clear the items and we
need to call that each time button
analyze this click and that needs to be
the first thing so it doesn't clear it
after the this stuff has been added so
let's go ahead and run this and you can
see that we can pick any sport let's do
basketball this time analyze the sport
it gives us the everything right here
the names of the enumeration and the
values inside of it and we can do
football click analyze sport and we get
the same things so now we can use what's
called get name now what this does is
instead of just getting all of the names
of the enumeration we can get a single
one so to do this we're going to use
everything the same as we used for get
names but instead of just having one
argument we're going to need two so
we're going to have the enum type and
we're going to use get type of sport so
it'll get the type for us and we need
the value and the value would be either
0 1 or 2 so we can go ahead and let's
say it will put the value 2 in so it's
going to get the name of the value 2 in
enumeration sports so if we run this
we're going to go ahead and click
football and we'll analyze sport
and we get football right here now you
can see that it prints out every single
letter and now the reason it does this
is because the name of it is split up
into different parts now what we can do
is we can declare a variable right here
let's do well will declare a variable
outside is so dim named as string and
we'll just go ahead and do name plus
equals item and now we'll we'll take
this out here and do it after the for
loop and we'll just add name instead of
item and we'll just set this equal to
nothing so it will quit complaining to
us so now if we run this we can go ahead
and analyze a sport so select one
analyze sport and we get football so I'm
go ahead work a little bit with get
names and get name and once you got that
down go ahead and move on to the next
tutorial and thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
