tutorial and only things we have left to
do is pretty much change the blue view
so it's pretty much work with the
interface files adding the colored
backgrounds so go ahead and click blue
window excuse me that XIB and this is of
course going to open up interface
builder pretty cool so now what we
wanted to do is this file's owner it
doesn't exactly know which class is
supposed to be changing this view so go
ahead and click files owner and its
identity under class you see the default
is nsobject we want to say all right you
are a charger of controlling the blue
class or what I mean the blue class is
in charge of controlling you so make
sure you do that and now we can go ahead
and begin working with the interface
itself so go ahead and click view and in
the attributes right here go ahead and
change the background to a nice blue
view looks pretty good I change it to
this that's a little lighter I like that
one a little better so make sure you
change to the light blue or else your
program is going to blow out now in your
attributes inspector right here you see
simulated interface elements and this
can simulate interface elements if you
couldn't tell by the title so remember
in our program we have that bar at the
bottom and it's a toolbar so in order to
simulate this in our view go ahead and
your attributes and attributes inspector
simulate the elements bottom bar go
ahead and select tool bar now look what
happens in our view this little blank
toolbar pops up and it simulates a
toolbar on the screen pretty cool so
this actually isn't going to show up on
our view is just going to simulate what
a toolbar would be so I mean that's kind
of what we want so the only thing we
have left to do is the class well pretty
much do this I'll show you guys in that
note I kester in your file owner icon go
ahead and ctrl and drag over to your
view icon and go ahead and click view
now why did I do that so this class
needs to be able to access the
that view and we didn't set everything
up by default remember we made all our
classes so that is how you get this
class to be able to access its view I
know it's a weird that you have to do
that but I mean you just need to do that
so now what we need to do is go ahead
file save an interface builder quit
interface builder and we need to do the
exact same thing for the red one so
every we're wondering how to do all that
maybe you missed something here's what
you do file owner over an identity this
one is going to change the red class I
really have to scroll down and find it
this is bull spit I said spit guys take
it easy and what I even named it red
sprout red class there we go only took
me half an hour to find it so the red
class now controls this view so after
that go ahead click view and in your
attributes go ahead and change the
background so nice read this is the red
class working but isn't it and of course
add that simulated toolbar at the bottom
toolbar pops up right there and now
control drag from a file's owner to view
and select the view is the outlets and
now this class can change the view or
access the view so go ahead file save
interface builder quit interface builder
and now here is our big moment let's
build and run this see if I got any
error see if it works gonna run all
right looking good so far awesome oh my
god it works switch views and again this
isn't just changing the background this
is actually changing the views of your
application so how awesome is that
congratulations guys you finally built a
program that has a multiple views it
only took like 10 tutorials but yeah we
did I am extremely proud myself I did
that whole thing without getting any
errors so if you want to leave me a
congratulatory message I and saying how
awesome I am do so in the comments below
because you know I'm super happy right
now about this program we just created
so yeah thank you guys for watching if
you have any questions I know this can
be confusing but
we're going to be building a lot of
multi-view applications from now on so
it'll naturally clear up as we go on so
I think you for watching if you have any
questions leave me a comment in my forum

them for you and by the way don't forget
