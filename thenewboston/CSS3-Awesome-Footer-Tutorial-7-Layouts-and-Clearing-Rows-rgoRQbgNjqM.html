video and in this video what I'm gonna
be doing is I'm gonna be talking to you
guys about the general layout of this
footer and we're also going to be
working developing the clear class so
before you get started with this I want
to talk to you guys about what I'm doing
with this footer now generally whenever
I make something from my website i don't
you know i don't plan on sharing it with
the world so i just make it however is
easiest for my website is easiest for me
however with this footer what i did is i
want to give you guys different layouts
because i know that you guys are
following along and you want to you know
easily be able to tweak it customize it
for your website so what i did is i
actually set this up so it has different
layouts now what this has of course
aside from your unordered list which is
pretty sweet
you have a one column layout which you
can see right here think of tables
whenever I say columns right now one
column a two column layout and as you
can see you have one piece of data right
here in another column right here and
then if we go to a new row you can
actually you know have a row that takes
up two columns with so this is a two
column layout right there and you can
also have a three column layout in this
you know I don't want anything more than
this because you might as well just make
a webpage if you're gonna have this much
information above a three column layout
but as you can see just like a table you
can have three columns data either three
single columns or you can have one that
takes up one and another that takes up
two columns for a total of three and you
can also have one row that just takes up
all three columns just like you know
whenever you're developing tables that's
what I want to do for you guys because
again for my website I may not use this
three column layout but just to you know
show the world and teach you guys how to
make a cool footer and plug it in I'm
going to show you guys how to develop
everyone and then you can use whatever
style you prefer or like this make
and match it so with that being said you
probably are asking yourself Bucky um
aren't we supposed to be working on this
clear class and now you go off on a rant
and started telling me about layouts
we're not even working on the layouts
yet so why you teaching me you know
about this crap well actually that's
what the clear class is going to be
responsible for whenever we have a
layout like this whenever we make a row
of data we need to tell our browser to
clear our layout or excuse me clear the
content so we can move to a new row if
we didn't have this clear class then
what our browser would try to do is put
everything on one big row so that's why
we need this clear class you use it
between rows of content so whenever
working in HTML we're gonna make this
row clear it make this row clear it make
another row so again I just want to
repeat this so you guys know what this
class is for you use this class between
rows of content and it just tells your
browser that hey browser I'm moving to a
new row don't try to stick everything on
the same row so the first attribute that
we need is clear:both now if you guys
are unfamiliar with a clear attribute
what this means is that no floating
elements are allowed on the left or
right hand side that's what we're
telling it by both neither the left or
right so that's the first thing that it
does clears everything to the left and
right now you also want to display this
as a block now of course you know block
level elements they can't have
everything
they can't have anything above it or
excuse me to the left or right of it
unlike you know inline elements you guys
should know that already from the CSS
tutorials or just you know school or
wherever now what I want to do after
this is just ensure that this element
does not display now if you guys are
like okay slow down tell me what the
heck you're talking about well as you
can see whenever we clear
it isn't like a paragraph or a heading
where we want something to display on
the screen
we just are using this clear class to
tell the browser we want to start
working on a new line
so generally whenever we style things
like paragraphs and headings in CSS we
display how they look but this element
we don't want it to display at all so
how do we ensure that this element
doesn't show up on any browser well the
first thing we need to do is set
overflow to hit in and also visit
visibility hardly spell that to hidden
now there are a couple additional things
and what this basically tells your
browser is listen we're just using this
class for design purposes don't show
anything to the user now we also can set
the width to 0 pixels and also the
height to 0 pixels and just in case your
visibility becomes unhidden or anything
like that then the width height and
overflow this is just all of these lines
basically are just um verification or
just security to make sure that nothing
shows up to the user because like I said
we're only using this class to tell the
browser that we want to move to a new
line we don't want to you know put a
horizontal line or anything right there
so that's what this clear class is
responsible for so one last time what it
does is we're gonna be using this
between rows whenever we are working on
our layout so make a row of columns
clear it make another row clear it make
another row so you guys are gonna see
more clearly no pun intended what this
does whenever we're working in the HTML
document and in the next tutorial what
we're gonna be doing is we're gonna be
styling some very simple things no more
weird clear concepts so thank you guys
for watching don't forget to subscribe
and I'll see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
