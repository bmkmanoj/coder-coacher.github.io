toriel and in this is oral I'm going to
show you guys a really easy way to print
out multi-dimensional arrays so let's go
ahead and first thing we need to do is
create a multi-dimensional array go
ahead and name it Bertha and Bertha can
be two rows by three columns same as
before so now what we need to do is go
ahead and make an array of arrays so the
first thing I do is put my two arrays in
there separated with the comma so now we
have two arrays which would be two rows
and now put three values in each like um
we'll just put one two and three in the
first one and seven eight and nine in
the second one so now we have an array
called Bertha that has two rows and
three values in each row so it's
basically a table that's two by three so
in order to print this out what we need
to do first is we need to loop through
each row one by one we're going to loop
through the first row and then we're
going to loop through the second row so
let's go ahead and make a for loop and
int well we might as well name this row
and of course it always starts is zero
because the zero if index is the first
element in your array so row zero and
the second one is Row is less than two
so what this is going to do when we put
row plus plus is it's going to go from
zero to one so row zero then Row one
it's not going to go row two because of
course two is not less than two so now
we're looping through each row one at a
time and now of course you guys can
probably guess what I'm going to new
next we need to loop through each column
or each element in the row so now in
order to do that go ahead and make
another for loop and this is going to
look really familiar familiar there we
go int column make sure I spelled it
right this one starts at zero as well
again all array start at zero even there
even if they're inside another array
column is less than three because that's
how many columns you have you basically
write the maximum the number of rows in
the number of columns right there simple
enough you know what that kind of looks
like a heart hmm that's kind of cute
anyways moving on column plus plus so
now what we're doing is this we're
looping through each row one by one the
first time it loops through Row one it's
going to loop through each of those
elements 1 2 &amp;amp; 3 and then it's going to
loop through Row 2 and then it's going
to loop through each of those elements 7
8 &amp;amp; 9 so after we get through looping
through each column we want to move to
the next line see out and line because
again each row is on a different line so
that's why when we're done looping
through the last element in the row we
want to move to the next line so now we
can just go ahead and print it out on
the screen like see out a Bertha was
your name and you put the row number
which would be this 0 or 1 and then you
put the column number which is going to
be some value 0 to 2 and that would be
these values right here so let's go
ahead and make sure you don't write end
line on actually what we do need to do
though is add a space there but make
sure you don't write end a line on this
line right here because these are your
column values you don't want every
single one of these numbers to go on new
line you only want it to go to a new
line after you're done looping through
the last element in that column so let's
go ahead and print it make sure I didn't
forget any semicolons which I did
somewhere and let me see what's wrong
are oh I see what I did here is I put a
call
come on eyelet put a comma instead of a
semicolon so now let me check make sure
to run it again and there we go in our
first row it printed out one two three
and in our second row it printed out
seven eight nine so this is a perfect
way to visually see multi-dimensional
arrays so pretty cool huh
so again one last time here's what we
did I'll just leave this down here we
made an array that was two by three
and what that means is it was an array
consisting of two different arrays with
three values each and what that means is
basically made a table that was two rows
by three columns as we can see right
here the first thing we needed to do is
loop through each row loop through this
row the first one and then loop through
the second one and we did that by
writing row 0 rows listen to yahya data
all that fun stuff you basically the
only thing you need to worry about is
make sure this value right here is the
same as this value right here so we said
all right for each row we loop through
we wanted to loop through each one of
the elements one at a time so that's why
I wrote start with zero one two one at a
time
and why we had this little spacer right
here is because if we didn't have that
it would put one two three real close
together so what it did is it basically
printed out a row one element at a time
and then when it was done it said see
out end line and that's why it jumped to
this next line and printed out seven
eight nine and it did that until it was
done printing out all the rows and then
it just ended so that is how you print
out a basic multi-dimensional array
again of course this is a whole lot to
see visually it's a whole lot better
looking at than this right here so that
is why you actually use this quite a bit
whenever you're programming so that's
all I have for you guys for this toriel
thank you guys for watching hopefully
you understand how to print out a
multi-dimensional array now because
we're going to be done talking about
arrays for now in the next tutorial I
think I'm going to be covering something
called vectors which is kind of like an
array but it's a little bit different
so thank you guys for watching don't
forget to subscribe if you have any
questions check out my website and I'll
see in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
