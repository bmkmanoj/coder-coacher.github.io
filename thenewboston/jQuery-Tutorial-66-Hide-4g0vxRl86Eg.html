with a video tutorial for the new Boston
in this tutorial we're going to be
looking at the hide effect in jQuery now
the hide effect allows you to call this
function appended to a specific element
on your page in order for you to hide
this particular element essentially what
this does is sets the visibility in CSS
so it cannot be seen so it's not visible
so what I've done is I've set up a basic
page and we're going to create a couple
of elements and then use this effects
jas file to trigger the click of a
button and then hide these specific
elements so the first thing we're going
to look at is a plain div so if we
create a div and give it an ID of a
underscore div and we write some text in
side here when we go to our browser and
refresh our page you can see that we've
got just some text inside here now let's
go ahead and create a button at the top
of our page and we're going to be able
to click on this button and hide this
particular div so let's go ahead and
create the button so we need an input
type button we're going to give this a
value of hyde and then we need to give
this an ID as well because we need to
use an event handler to actually what
well for when the user clicks the button
we need to handle this event so I'm
gonna call this a button so inside fxj s
which is included on my page as well as
jquery we can go ahead and start writing
the code so the first thing we want to
do is actually handle the event when
this button is clicked so we use hash
because we're referencing an ID and then
we write a button then we say dot click
which is the click event handler so when
we click on the button this is what will
happen we produce a function from this
and inside of this block here
we've written the function out with the
parentheses at the start of the block
and the end of the block inside this
function here we write our code so now
what we want to do is we want to
actually hide this div so the first
stage of this is again to actually
reference this element so I'm just gonna
write hash referencing this by its ID
and the ID is a underscore div then we
use dot to actually carry out the hide
function so if we would just write dot
hide and then empty parentheses you'll
notice that when we actually press this
button the event handler is called and
we actually hide this element so let's
go ahead and test that you can see that
the element has disappeared from the
page so now that we've hidden this div
there were a few parameters that we can
give to this hide function in order to
change some settings the first one is
the speed in which it progresses and we
can even either give this in a textual
representation or a numerical
representation for example we might want
to hide this fast now this will
automatically this will automatically
show some kind of animation with this
the hiding of this so when we click hide
you can now see it sort of scrolled up
into the corner now if we were to choose
slow for example this will slow down the
animation and you can see that it slides
up slightly slower now what we can
actually do is give a numerical
representation in milliseconds so for
example I was to choose 1000 this would
represent one second so now when I click
hide it takes one second to disappear we
could obviously then increase this to
say five thousand which would represent
five seconds when we click hide you see
it very very slowly disappears
now there's an optional parameter and
this is the easing of the animation so
let's just choose slow for now easing by
default is at swing but you can choose
linear and what this does is it just
changes the way that the anim
happens and the easing of the animation
so if we were to choose Linea we get a
slightly different effect and it it
hides it slightly differently let's just
test that in our browser and you'll
notice that it's it's quite hard to
notice with short pieces of text but if
you were to compare them with say larger
text it just eases the way the animation
starts and ends now furthermore there is
a third parameter we can give this and
this is the cooler back function so if
you wanted to feedback something to the
user once the animation had been
complete or once this div in particular
had been hidden
you can then append a function on to
here so if we create a function and then
again and a start and an end block we
just bring this down to here what we can
do is then we can do something that will
carry out an action that will tell the
user that we've successfully hidden this
element once the function has been
called so I could say for example
element hidden so what will happen now
is once we've clicked this button the
element will be hidden slowly and in
linear fashion
it will then use a callback function and
this will alert the user that the
element has been hidden so let's go
ahead and test that out when we click
hide you can see that after the
animation completed we have this alert
box element hidden now the reason we
have callback functions is essentially
so we do something after a particular
element the majority of functions in
jQuery support callback functions so
let's say for example you gave the user
the option to hide a particular element
but you wanted to save this later on so
when they log back on to your website it
would actually still remain hidden you
could use a callback function to perhaps
add an eval you into a database table or
in fact you could store this in a
session so there's a as a wide variety
of ously of use for a callback function
it just depends on if you need it and
what you're going to do with it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
