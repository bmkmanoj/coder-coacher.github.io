going to show you how to use the
built-in editing tools inside of
Dreamweaver cs4 in this tutorial we are
going to crop brighten and sharpen and
image so if you look here you see where
i was testing it out and you can see
that I've already selected a crop window
so I'm going to going to get out of that
and i'm going to show you exactly what i
just did so i inserted an image here you
can see in the code that i went and
downloaded an image of Dubai in the
United Arab Emirates and we are going to
crop this first so you see here we have
a crop the brain and contrast and the
sharpen and it's telling me that if
you're going to crop it is going to edit
the file and basically it's saying don't
forget to edit undo if if that's not
what you want so I'm gonna say don't
show me this again so it brings up this
this crop window damage is so large so
we're going to have to have two sizes
down a little bit let's just get up
let's just get this island over here
so to move this down I'm just get enough
to get against that little port right
there and then this island and then just
press ENTER and you can see that we have
now cropped the image down and so we're
going to go and select that image again
click on the Brighton contrast tool down
here and let's just change it very
slightly just so you guys can see it's
not going to be noticeable but maybe a
tiny bit noticeable say okay and then
we're going to sharpen in a little bit
not much but just a little bit and that
is how you use the built-in image
editing tools inside of Dreamweaver cs4
