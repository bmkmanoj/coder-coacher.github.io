create a brand new screen let's go ahead
and learn how to give it a custom icon
and a name so the user actually knows
what they're trying to click so in order
to do this what you do is you go back to
your storyboard and if you click the
icon at the bottom by default it just
gives you a square and the word item now
click that and go to your attribute
inspector the one that looks like a
little arrow slider thing and you're
going to see a bunch of settings right
here now if you want and if this is just
something generic and what you can do is
you can just give a system image and I
don't know maybe it's like your
favorites
it'll add just the favorite icon and the
word favorites or I don't know maybe
your history or to add that little clock
in the word history so here are a bunch
of default ones and those work great but
what we want to do is we want to add a
custom one
so hit custom right there and now it
says okay you provide the info for me so
the first thing is down in the title I
want this to be the profile so I'm going
to hit profile and hit enter and that
changes just the title of it right like
that
now instead of the square I want my own
custom image now I already made images
before and what I did is I added these
to the form so if you want to use the
same ones as I am then go to the forum
download them and use the same naming
convention right here now if you're
making your own I want to just mention a
few things first of all make sure that
they're solid black don't add like a
blue or grey or anything like that
because I'll show you guys this even
though you're looking down it right here
and you're saying okay these are gray
and then when I click on they're blue
what you do is you actually make just
solid black for all of your icons and
then your iPhone is automatically going
to change the color of them itself so it
takes care of all that behind the scenes
just add black and you're good to go
another thing I want to mention is this
so anytime we want to add images
we add them to our assets file so click
your assets file and of course what you
can do is you can take all of these and
just drag them in now why did I name
them these weird names okay profile DUP
thing and that kind of makes sense
profile at 2x but paying profile at 3x
not paying those are kind of stupid
naming conventions well remember that I
said that you need different size icons
for different iOS displays for example
your new iPhone is going to have the
Retina display it has a little better
resolution so you need a little better
quality image now the three icon sizes
that you need are 25 by 25 that's what
this one is 50 by 50 and 75 by 75 so
what you can do is you can create three
separate and just drag them all in there
and you know before whenever we played
the game where you take each one okay
this is my 25 put that in 150 put that
in 275 put that in 3 if you use this
naming convention with the name the name
at 2x in the name f3 X then you can just
drag them all in like that and it fills
it in for you so if you like playing
that guessing game you can but that's
why I use that weird naming convention
so another thing that I want to mention
is this now that you have all of your
icons in there to your assets file we
can now use them in our project so hop
back over to your storyboard and again
make sure that this icon is selected and
for the attributes go down to image not
system image this is something different
in your image use profile now check that
out and now since you use those cool
naming conventions no matter what device
they are looking at this on it's always
going to use that on pretty much the
proper icon and again if you ever forget
okay what was it 25 by 25 like 50 by 50
I didn't just make those up off the top
of my head Apple actually has guidelines
and they're probably going to change in
the future because they keep changing
but the documentation is always online
so let's go ahead and run this
now and check it out first
second and now our cool profile with our
little dude right there pretty sweet so
now that we have that taken care of the
only other thing that we need to do is
we need to figure out how to add some
brains to this screen because alright so
we know where the brains are no big deal
it's a C this is for the first one this
is for the second one but uh-huh
where is the brains that controls that
profile screen well what we need to do
is we actually need to create a brand
new class for it so if you've got a file
new file what we need to do is choose
cocoa touch class this is the basic
class that all your brains use next now
for the view controller uh what can we
name this watch them a profile view
controller this is the file that
controls the profile view pretty simple
and it's a subclass of uiviewcontroller
and that's just a standard and yes
that's where we're making it and it
creates that file for so again they all
were UI view controller subclasses so
that's why I did that so we pretty much
got a standard brain file pretty stinkin
awesome and let me just delete I'll
leave those right in there for now
because I'll show you guys something
cool all right
so backing your storyboard now that we
got this class what we need to do is we
need to say okay we need to connect this
screen this screen with this view
controller did actually then oops I
accidentally deleted all of them on my
second view controller so let me delete
all this so this was the file that it
created for us I was actually playing
around with this one so I mean back in
our storyboard what we
we just created a brand new class but
Iowa still doesn't know okay that class
was supposed to be the brains for this
profile right here so how do we connect
it well using them back into 100 and if
you click this button right at the top
this yellow button right on top of your
profile screen and what you can do is if
you click this little identity inspector
that looks like a little ID card then
this is where you can say okay the
brains for my screen right here I want
to be controlled by profile view
controller so that's where you connect
it and if you guys don't believe me
check this out in the first view its
first view controller if you click the
yellow button and check out the second
view the class that controls it is
second view controller and now the class
that controls this is profile view
controller so it says okay this is the
screen these are my brains I'm good to
go
now just to verify that everything works
go over to your class and we can just
add something simple just for testing
like print line and it'll just print out
like a profile page loaded so now
whenever we let me stop this and run it
again all right so look at what happens
whenever we click first second nothing
happens but whenever we click profile it
prints out in the console profile page
loaded so again it only loads one time
but it does indeed verify that this file
is hooked up properly to this screen
pretty stinkin sweet so that is the
basics of how you create a multiple view
application and how not only you add a
new screen but also the brains behind it
an icon custom title pretty stinking
awesome and there are a lot of different
types of navigation that we're going to
be learning but that was the basics so
uh yeah now that we've got our feet wet
we are good to move on to the next video
so well I'll see you guys then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
