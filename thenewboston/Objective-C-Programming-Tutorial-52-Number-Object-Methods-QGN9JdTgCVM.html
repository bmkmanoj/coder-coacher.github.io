tutorial and in the last tutorial we
learned pretty much how to create number
objects and all we did is pronounced
screen now I already deleted my NS log
statement because we'll be needing it
for this tutorial but what we didn't
really learn is why would we even need
to create number objects ever I mean all
we did is prin mount on the screen I
mean we've been doing that since
tutorial number one so what's even the
point of learning this stuff well the
beauty of a number object is you can
call methods Bill and methods that we
don't even have to build on these and
number objects and they can make your
life a lot easier when comparing numbers
check this out not even the same type
you don't even have to limit yourself to
comparing two integers or two floats or
two doubles you can compare an integer
to a float so how cool is that so let's
go ahead and begin typing some code so
let's go ahead and make a if statement
and let's go ahead to test if one number
is equal to another number
but unlike before we can just but if x
equals equals and y if we can go ahead
and compare two different number types
so remember we have two objects Bucky
int which is integer of 100 and Bucky
flow which is like Hydra 45 and some
change so let's go ahead and write if
and remember this is a method it's gonna
return either yes or no
so Bucky int in the method remember this
is built-in we don't have to make this
at all is equal to number and let's go
ahead and press write the right arrow
just keep all that and now you say is
your parameter what you want to test if
it's equal to so Bucky float so it
really doesn't matter what number you
put first because you're testing
equality I mean if one is equal to two
or two is equal to one you're gonna get
false both ways so just go ahead and put
exactly equal to yes so again this is
either gonna return a yes or no
so if
it's equal to the Bucky flow it's gonna
return yes so let's go ahead and just
log something now they are equal make
sure you put explanation point because
this will be a big moment so else NS log
they are not equal this one won't get
explanation point because you know for
some reason whenever this first if
statement happens I'm also excited but
then it's else and it's like yeah I'm
not that excited so no explanation point
for you so let's go ahead and build and
run this to see what we get we got they
are not equal why is this because 100 is
not equal to 145 so this works but that
is just work because you're trying to
compare injured or float what happens if
you did this well check this out save it
all and bam they are equal so this
program can indeed compare injures the
floats so it works beautiful so now what
else can we can do else can we can do
way too many cannons in that sentence so
anyways let's go ahead and delete this
and let's use another common method and
that's not only testing quality but you
can also test which one is less than and
which one is greater than so let's go
ahead and this is another method called
Bucky and the method is called compare
pretty easy and right after your
obviously you want to write what you
want to compare it to
Bucky flow so if this is equal to and I
these are pretty weird stuff that they
said this equal to and s or D are
ordered a ascending just like that so if
you get back and that's order descending
and these are the billion things
compared is built in and it may return
and that's ordered ascending if the
first number is less so let's go ahead
and put first is
less else second is less it also returns
same I think if they're equal to but
we'll just make them not equal to let's
so let's do thirty two point twenty so
right now we should get back when we
call the compare method to compare Bucky
flow and Bucky int we should get back n
s order descending which should print
out first is less so let's go ahead and
build and run this and bam check this
out first is less now let's go ahead and
change this to two hundred and printing
it out and see what we get second is
less so this program is also working
beautifully just like we expected so
that is kind of the beauty of creating
number objects you can compare different
data types of different data types and
also we didn't have to write a compare
method we didn't have to write a is
equal to number method
those were built-in methods that we were
just able to use pretty sweet huh
so that's all I want to teach you for
the numbers objects from now in the next
tutorials we're going to be going over
string objects and trust me there is a
lot a lot of stuff to go over so I thank
you guys for watching if you want any of
this source code copy it put it in my
forum link below so again thank you guys
for watching don't forget subscribe and
I'll see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
