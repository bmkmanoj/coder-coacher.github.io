triangles we're gonna learn what's
called the Pythagorean theorem and this
is where your knowledge of squares and
square roots will really help you out
because we have this equation a squared
plus B squared equals C squared so for
any right triangle this long side right
here which is called the hypotenuse of
the right triangle is equal to this side
squared plus this side squared so now
that we know that we're gonna do an
example so this is the hypotenuse this
is our hypotenuse and this is what we're
trying to find out so a squared which is
8 squared plus 6 squared is equal to x
squared or C squared it's the same thing
because they're just variables so 8
squared is 64 plus 6 squared is 36 is
equal to x squared so 100 is equal to x
squared but we want to know what X is
equal to so we're going to take this
square root of both sides and we get X
is equal to 10 now we're gonna do
another example so notice that we know
we know what our hypotenuse is equal but
we want to know what this is equal to so
we're gonna like we would normally we're
gonna take a squared plus B squared and
set it equal to the hypotenuse squared
so
49 plus X squared is equal is equal to
625 so x squared is equal to is equal to
576 and if we take the square roots of
both sides we get X equal to 24 and for
one last example we have so this is our
hypotenuse and we're trying to find out
what x equals so we're going to take
each one of the parts square and square
them and set it equal to 5 squared so if
you take the square root of 7 and you
square it you're undoing this square
root so this just becomes 7 plus x
squared equals 25 x squared is equal to
18 you take the square root of that you
get X is equal to the square root of 18
18 is not a perfect square so we're just
gonna leave it written like that because
there's no way but because this isn't a
whole number X is not a whole number so
now that we've learned the Pythagorean
theorem we're gonna learn some rules for
special right triangles in our next
