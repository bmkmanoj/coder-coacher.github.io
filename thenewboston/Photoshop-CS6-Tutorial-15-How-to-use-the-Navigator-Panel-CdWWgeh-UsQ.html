Blackford here with another Photoshop
cs6 tutorial and in this tutorial we're
going to be going over how to use the
navigation system that is built in one
of the panel's of Photoshop cs6 and it's
going to be like moving around and
zooming around into your panel and like
pretty much like a quick way so let's
get started now make sure you just have
anything loaded make sure it's on like a
picture or anything that you have and
load that up now what we're going to do
is come over to this panel right here
where it says navigator and it's one of
those I can't remember what it's called
right now just fell off the tip of my
tongue one of those things that sailors
and stuff back in the day used to use
the wheel looking thing man I wish I
remember the name oh well so click on
that and then you get this panel called
navigator and that's basically used to
just like move around in the scene
pretty much now we can zoom in and move
around so click on this little slider
here and then you can use that to zoom
in or zoom out quickly if you want you
can also click on these like Mountain
buttons and it will zoom in and zoom out
appropriately so on the right side is
zoom in and the left side of zoom out
and then you can also type in however
much you want now the lowest that you
can go is 0.39%
so like super I don't know why you want
to do that but maybe if you have
something that's like really really big
and then 3200 is 3200 which that's the
highest that you can go so you can see
basically every single pixel which is
pretty cool now I'm going to go back to
100 and what I'm going to do is I'm
going to zoom in a little bit and if you
look there's this red box around the
actual picture here if i zoom in you can
see that the red box gets smaller now I
can come in and click on it and drag
that around to get to an area that I
want to work on and this is pretty handy
if you need to get to an area to work on
now if your Navigator menu isn't showing
over here it's gone for some reason you
just come up to window and then click on
navigator right here and it'll show up
and it'll pop out for you it'll be cool
and there's another cool thing that you
can do with the Navigator if you hold
down ctrl or the option key no control
if you hold down ctrl and drag in the
Navigator you'll get the magnifying
glass looking thing and if you let go of
it it'll basically make it'll zoom in to
how we're big you made this area here so
if I make it large is going to zoom in
less if I make it really small it's
going to zoom in a lot so that's a
pretty helpful if you need to just like
zoom in on like just her face and you
don't want
do all that crap of like trying to
figure out what exact measurements it's
got to be or whatever so this view box
here defaults as read but if you're like
colorblind to like red or something like
that or you hate the color red really
really badly then you can change the
color of the view box so if you come
over here to the panel options right
here and click on it click on panel
options we can change the color of the
view box if we wanted to so now my view
box is magenta pretty cool I guess and
there's one last cool thing that I want
to show you so this thumbnail is pretty
small and might be a little hard for you
to navigate or actually see what's going
on so if you come down to the corner
here and drag out make sure it's the
double arrow there and drag it out your
thumbnail will get bigger and therefore
your Navigator thumbnail will be easier
to navigate but it also gets in the way
of what you're working on so that's up
to you how big you want to make it so
it's not just a fixed small thumbnail I
like to keep mine about this size and
it's not too much in the way but if it
ever does I'll just you can just close
it by clicking on these double arrows
here and I'll go back away just open it
by clicking on that or you can click on
this again and I'll close it so it's
pretty easy so that's all about using
the Navigator and it's helpful what to
just have up to quickly work with other
brushes so you don't got to move around
and if you like only using your mouse
using the Navigator is cool so you don't
have to use so many hotkeys like you
don't have to switch to the hand key eyo
so or the zoom key here in a tool I mean
and I'll show you these tools in another
tutorial because they basically do the
same thing that the Navigator does I'll
just show you how so I'll see you guys
in the next tutorial where we start
talking about stuff like that so you
guys later have a good one thanks for
