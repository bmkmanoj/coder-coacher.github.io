okay these are the three items that
configure your connection the first one
is how to send data to the server and of
course you have git and you also have
some other options but I won't confuse
it right now pretty much any option that
you can have in PHP arm you know you
have your options there but right now
we're you know using basic git so you
know if you're thinking like you know
post or anything don't even worry about
that right now the second parameter is
where to send data so of course we
aren't working with the PHP file right
now that's going to you know generate
this cool crap we will later on but
right now we're just working with a
plain text file so the last parameter is
if it's true we want it to handle a
synchronously and asynchronously pretty
much means of course at the same time so
that's the basics of the open function
remember it doesn't connect with the
server we are not connected with the
server yet it just says okay whenever
we're ready to connect use these options
so like I said poorly named function
whoever created Ajax get your craft
together so the next thing we want to do
is we want to call xml on ready state
change now this actually isn't a
function it's just oops actually did
that wrong it isn't a function it's just
a property now we need to set this
property equal to whatever function is
actually going to handle the response
and the cool thing about HX is that
there is no built-in function because
every response is unique so we're going
to have to build that function on our
own later on it's going to be the last
function that we build so I'm just going
to name mine handle server response so
basically whenever we create a function
handle server response
you need to tell HX okay whenever and
this is you need to set this property in
every single program it's basically
saying anytime something happens in your
communication or your conversation with
a server any time something changes that
I want you to call this function and
we'll talk about the different states
right now and then you're going to
understand why this is called already
state change but just the basics this is
what you have to remember set this equal
to the function that gets called anytime
your state is changed boom
roasted so the last thing that we
actually need to do is we need to call
one more function and that is send and
go ahead and type nowhere right here
alright so this function right here is
the function that sends the request or
basically this function is a function
that communicates or connects with a
server so the key things that I want to
point out here is you need to make sure
you have your on ready state change
before this a lot of people you know
communicate with the server and then
they're right after this what happens
whenever we get a response back but you
always want your honorary state change
set up before this and this is why
whenever the server responds then you
already need to make sure that you are
ready to handle the response properly so
in every HX program configure your
connection setup you know basically how
you want to communicate with a server
where you want to send that data to or
basically what file you're going to be
working with and then you're going to
say okay whenever I get a response from
the server this is how I'm going to
handle it and then once everything is
set up just like you needed to you can
go ahead and send your request to the
server or pretty much begin
communication so that's basically all
the process function is going to do and
now that we have you know established
hopefully a communication with the
server what we want to do that o
Flintoff them slept on phlegm
what we want to do now is we
want to handle the server response so in
the next tutorial I'm going to show you
guys how to code this last function
handle server response and after this
you guys are going to be pros of Ajax in
this is pretty much the it's going to be
the most complex function but it's going
to give you guys the greatest
understanding of why Ajax programs work
the way that they do so I'm excited you
guys should be too it's going to be
awesome I'll see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
