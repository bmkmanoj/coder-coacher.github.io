tutorial that I'm making for the new
Boston and in this tutorial I'm going to
show you how to force a user to do
something with a control so for example
if there's already text in the text box
then the user deletes all that text then
you're going to want to tell the user
that they must provide text in that text
box so for this tutorial you're just
going to need to have two text boxes and
the first thing that you're going to
want to do is basically have text
already in one of the text boxes so I'm
just gonna make it to say Adam and then
we're gonna want to go over to the
events and go down to we this event will
basically occur when the user selects a
different control so encloses go ahead
click on this right here and the first
thing that we're going to want to do is
check to see if the user actually did
delete all that text so we're going to
say if text box one text equals nothing
then we know that the user did in fact
delete all the text from the text box so
then we're just going to tell the user
that they must provide a name so to say
message box that show you must provide
and then we're gonna want to go ahead
and use a select method and the select
method will basically bring the user's
attention back to the control and it
will put the user's cursor inside of the
text box so that they can actually type
in a name they're just gonna say text
box one that's a lot all right so now we
need to bug here and since we didn't
delete all this text in here and click
away it's fine but if we do you know
that text and click in this text box
then you must provide a minute now
obviously this isn't perfect because if
you put like a space here and then click
away it's fine but you can obviously run
more checks and replace all the spaces
nothing or something like that alright
and this method will basically work with
any control so let's say you had a combo
box and in your combo box you had a few
different items but the first item is
basically just a label telling the user
what is in the combo box so
but just like like country is the first
item we don't obviously want anyone to
be able to select this item and then
under it create like a new country like
the US UK and Canada then alright and
then you want to force the users to be
able to pick or if I have to pick one of
these countries right here so what we're
gonna want to do is just go down to the
leave method again and check to see if
the user didn't select a country so they
say if comma box ones selected index
equal zero then we're just gonna have a
message box show saying that they must
select a country so I'm gonna say you
lost so I a country and then we're just
gonna want to again use that select
method to bring the users attention back
to that combo box so we're gonna say
combo box one dot select and right up
here well the form is loading or before
it loads we're just going to want to set
the combo boxes select it index to zero
because if you don't do that it'll be
set to negative one meaning there will
be nothing in the combo box like you can
see right now and we want it to say
country when it loads so there's gonna
say combo box one selected index equals
zero soul equal that a country item so
yeah now we see it says country right
there now since we selected country and
try to click away it won't let us it'll
say you must select the country and then
you click OK you see it highlights that
country again since we use the select
method so now if we were to select an
actual country like us it's fine if you
select the Canada or something that's
fine alright so that's pretty much it
for this tutorial on how to force a user
to do something with a control so see
you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
