very first lesson in physics now for
those of you guys who don't know me my
name is Bucky Robertson evidently I'm
going to be teaching you guys some
physics today so before I begin I want
to mention a few things the first thing
is at any time during this tutorial
series if you guys have any questions
about topics that you want me to cover
or just questions about physics in
general or maybe you even want me to go
over a specific problem then please
don't ask me in the comment section
below because the videos are too
scattered around and it's difficult to
look through all the comments so if you
guys have any questions then please ask
me on my forum the link is below every
video so go ahead and click that if you
have any questions so now that I gave
you guys my nice little introduction
let's go ahead and jump right into
physics so basically what the heck is
physics well the formal definition is
the branch of science that deals with
matter energy motion and force now for
this tutorial I'm going to be focusing
mainly on motion basically things moving
around now whenever we talk about motion
we need to cover one quick definition
first and that's the definition of speed
what is speed well for those of you who
are addicted to drugs out there you know
that speed is indeed a drug but that's
not the kind of speed we're talking
about we're talking about the speed
that's defined as distance over time and
yes you guys are just going to have to
deal with my handwriting so speed is
basically the distance traveled over the
time travel basically the rate at which
an object moves or as simple as I can
put it how fast is something going
that's what we want to try to figure out
that's the very first core concept that
I'm going to be teaching you guys in
physics so whenever we need to solve
problems dealing with speed we'd like to
use variables now we use the variable s
for speed we use D for distance
and can you guys guess what we use for
time yep
T for time so with these three variables
we like to plug these into different
equations whenever we're trying to
calculate the average speed so we're
saying okay so the average speed is
basically the distance traveled over the
time travel simple enough so let's go
ahead and take a look at an example so
say we have a problem that let's say we
want to find the average speed of I
don't know a car or something so we say
that we just think of something here say
that we drove 48 miles and it took us
four hours to drive well what
information do we have already the 48
miles is of course the distance so we'll
set that equal to duty and the 4 hours
is the time now if you remember the
formula for average speed I'll just
write average speed equals the distance
over time so we're trying to solve for
speed and we already got 48 which is the
distance over 4 hours and I guess I
might as well plug in my miles and hours
so the average speed of this car I think
I said car didn't I would be 48 divided
by 4 which is indeed can you guys guess
12 miles per hour so that is how you
calculate average speed basically take
whatever distance you have and throw
over whatever time frame you have and
remember whatever terminology you're
using in distance miles put that per
time now typically in physics we don't
deal with miles or hours we typically
deal with the meters and seconds but for
this example it's just a real quick
example and another thing that I want to
mention before I let you guys go in this
video is I know I said speed is what
we're trying to figure out but in
physics we more commonly use a letter V
now V stands for velocity and to be
completely honest velocity and speed are
similar but they are a little bit
different in I will talk about that
later whenever I talked about scalar and
vector quantities but just remember this
for the upcoming tutorials I'm going to
use the letter V which stands for
velocity instead of s which stands for
speed right now just think of them as E
as the exact same thing although I'll
cover their differences later on so
anyways for this tutorial that's all you
guys get hopefully you guys understand
how to calculate average speed now again
average speed equals distance over time
so thank you guys for watching don't
forget to subscribe and I'll see you
guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
