Blackford here with another After
Effects cs6 tutorial and I want to show
you how to randomize your text effects
with the wiggly selector so what I mean
is I've got this text here and it's just
flying down and I've got the per
character 3d enabled if you don't know
what that is I did recently just make a
tutorial right before this about that
and you can check that out on the new
Boston's YouTube page so what we've got
here is just some text flying and I'll
put it in the custom view so you can see
what's going on so basically some just
some text flying on and onto the screen
in the z space and in the Y space let me
go to the active camera here and we want
to make this a little bit more
randomized and we don't want them to all
come from the top and just fly down we
want each letter to come from like a
random areas well sometimes your client
might ask you to do that and you got to
do it you got to figure out how well how
do you do it you add the wiggly selector
or yeah you just got to add that so
let's uh go to the selector here right
here by clicking add if you twirl down
in your text okay I'll start from the
beginning twirl down in your text here
and you'll have this animator section
and it has the add button next to it so
click on add go to selector and click on
Wiggly now you've got the wiggly
selector and your range selector in
there already so
right now when I add the wiggly selector
you can see it just like flies around
like this and then it comes back into
work where it is well first of all we
wanted to start all these off the screen
and we wanted to like have them fly in
not just fly around on the screen where
people could see them already so what
we're gonna have to do is change the
position here of the wiggly selector so
let's change these to make it so it's
more more off the screen here so this is
Z so that's not gonna help that much
let's change the X and if we can get it
so pretty much everything's off the
screen that's good so we've got one
lighter here and I'll turn off the
motion blur got one letter here that's
still in the middle so what we want to
do when something like this happens come
down to our wiggly selector and twirl
down we've got this random seed right
here and what we can do is change the
seed what the random seed is is pretty
much every time you use the wiggly
selector it it has a bunch of different
preset what they're called is random
seeds and the letters will move in a
different way based on what number seed
you have so if I push one it's going to
set the letters up in a different way so
we need to find one that does not have
them in the middle or one that we can
get the letters close to the side so we
can take them off of the screen so the L
is pretty close here so we can probably
take that off
by moving one of our positions here and
there we go so now everything's off the
screen and you can see now that's way
all over the place which is okay because
then I'll fly in later one way out let's
RAM preview it and see what happens
now they're just flying in from all over
the place now if I put my motion blur
back on to make it look a little more
realistic
now maybe that's what your client wanted
right there
so the wiggler here the weekly selector
here is very random and so I can't
really I can't explain what some of
these do but they're not always gonna be
do the same exact thing every time so
we've got our modes here first the modes
let me comment into the middle will
affect how the wiggly SEC selector
interacts with the selector that's above
it so this in this instance it's going
to be the position was what I selected
for the range selector here so if I
change it to add it's going to interact
in a different way and this is probably
not what we wanted so in this one it's
just flying around subtract we can see
what that does
subtract you might want to use they're
flying in from all over the place and
not really like hanging around hanging
around on the screen as much so that
would have been a good one to use for
this it's all about experimenting with
the wiggly selector and then I mean you
can check out these other ones to see
what they they do at some point I mean
this one the max doesn't have the
letters stay on so if you wanted that
kind of effect that's how you would go
for that
you've got the max amount here and the
minimum amount which is pretty much like
the offset in the range selector and if
I change these the amount that the words
are gonna fly around on the screen are
gonna be lessened if I will lessen the
amount as you can see here by the you
can see how the box now I maybe I can
move back if I lower these the box is
gonna get smaller and it lessens the
area that they're gonna fly around it we
put those at a higher range they're
gonna fly around even more so now the
box that they're flying around in is
even bigger and then this based on
characters is the same as the one in the
range selector so you can base on words
lines of text or characters without
their spaces we got Wiggles per second
which means pretty much how random and
how fast it's going to we go all around
and be random so if I increase this to
maybe 10 they're gonna go even more
crazier so I'll do a save it real quick
and then do a ram preview so we can see
what this looks like
a lot more stuff is going on so it's
taking a little bit longer to render so
there you can see how they're like
really really flying around right now so
that's what the Wiggles per second does
this was at two before the correlation
property here determines if all the
characters are wiggled the same or if
they're wiggle it like different
separate from each other so if I put
this at a hundred percent they're all
going to do the same exact kind of
wiggle motion so if you if you watch
this text box you'll see that they're
all still grouped together and they're
all flying around together great
basically until they fly on to the
screen on their own so they'll all be
grouped together and if I set it to zero
they're gonna do totally different
things than what they they're totally
different movement from each other so at
fifty percent it kind of does like a
half and a half obviously which is fine
for here the temporal phase here is like
movement over time so if I scrub through
that it's kind of like evolution if
you've seen that in in other effects and
the spatial phase here is through space
so it's just kind of more of another way
to randomize by using these and their
keyframe bubble
so things the next one is lock
dimensions and that's pretty useful when
you're like doing scale so that the X&amp;amp;Y
will scale at the same time instead of
really stretching out the the letters
and everything like that so if I turn it
on for position it's going to have them
move in like kind of like the same type
of ways it's the move different but
they're not it's not as random so that's
a lock dimensions and I've talked about
the random seed earlier where it'll just
change the starting points and of the
it'll change the starting points of your
characters while they're when they're
flying around and how they move around
down this on the screen so this this
really randomizes what's going on so you
can if you have two sets of letters and
you have them on the same and they're
the same things and you have them on the
same random seed then they're gonna do
the exact same thing so you might want
to change up the random seeds for each
of those texts so that you don't have
the exact same animation going on so
that's how you use the wiggler selector
and all of its character properties here
and now you can be more of a pro at
using this use it when you want to
randomize things and you learn how to
reel in your letters so that it works
correctly and isn't just a bunch of
mumbo-jumbo on your screen so thanks for
watching this tutorial
I appreciate it when you guys leave
comments and uh poke down vote I mean it
sums up and comes down on YouTube I
guess so thanks for watching the house
see you guys in the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
