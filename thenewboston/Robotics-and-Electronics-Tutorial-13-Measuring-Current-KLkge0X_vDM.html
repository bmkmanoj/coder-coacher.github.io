tutorial in how to build a robot and in
the last tutorial I showed you guys how
to measure volts by hooking up your
multimeter to the battery and touching
your red probe different parts but the
way you measure current is a little bit
different see you what a volt is is
pretty much how much force each electron
hands but current is pretty much how
many electrons go through a certain
point at a certain time so instead of
just touching this in measuring point to
point the electrons actually have to go
through the multimeter so that the
multimeter can count off the electrons
so instead of just using the multimeter
from outside it has to actually become
part of the circuit so I'm gonna build a
simple circuit here and I'm gonna walk
you guys through how to measure current
so go ahead and hook your red probe up
the positive and then go ahead and hook
that up to the resistor so now we have
battery resistor and then go ahead and
take your white probe and hook one of
the ends up to the other end of the
resistor in your other end up to your
red probe in your multimeter so right
now our circuits going battery resistor
multimeter and now all we have to do is
complete the circuit so go ahead and
once the electrons go through the
multimeter they have to come out
somewhere they come out through the
black probe and you just want it to go
back into the battery so let me click
clip that to the negative and now we
have a full circuit make sure you guys
can see everything now all we have to do
is make sure that we're plugged into the
milliamp and go ahead and switch this to
milliamps and as you can see we're
getting a reading of about seventeen
point five million and what this means
is this is what this means in pretty
much comparison to one amp this would be
point zero one seven
of 1 amp so this is like a small
fraction of one hand that you can't see
it but I have a little M right there
what that means is you need to divide
this by a thousand so if you're divided
by a thousand means move the desk point
Oh decimal point over three times so
this is actually a point zero one seven
of an amp and that's what we're looking
for and that is how you use your
multimeter to measure current again hook
up your battery pass it through the
resistor pass your electrons or circuit
through the multimeter have a come out
and back into the battery again the key
point the multimeter has to be part of
the circuit so that electrons can pass
through and so that your multimeter can
count the electrons and so that's how it
figures out the current so that's your
quick tutorial on how to figure out
current in the next tutorial I don't
know what I'm gonna be teaching but it's
going to be useful and awesome so check
it out and I'll see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
