video I'm going to show you how to add a
drop-down menu so up to now we just made
regular menu items and I'm going to add
another one but instead of just going to
a page whenever the user clicks it it's
going to pull up a drop-down menu and
they can select from some sub menu items
and before I actually get to that I just
want to change the default styling of
this main navigation bar because this
light gray I don't know it just looks
kind of wimpy to me so instead of the
Neph our default styling which we have
right now I'm going to change this to
inverse and that just inverses the color
scheme and I don't know I just think it
looks a little bit cooler makes it pop
out a little bit easier to read but you
know follow your heart choose whatever
one you like now let's go ahead and add
that drop down menu now in order to do
this we're actually going to add a new
let me comment this might be a drop down
menu so we're just going to be adding
another menu item to the list but inside
that menu item is actually another list
and that's going to be the drop down
menu so just like before a regular menu
item but we have to give a special class
to indicate that it's a drop-down so not
door up/down drop down there you go
Bucky alright so the first thing we have
to take care of is what text do we want
to appear on the button so just like
before this one's home this one's about
this one's contact I'll say that it's
like my profile and then when you have a
drop down list that you can like choose
different like your photos your settings
whatever and also another thing I want
to do is this right now if we just write
my profile and don't do anything else
whenever the user is looking at this
navigation bar they don't know which is
just a regular menu item in what is a
drop-down item so to the right of the my
profile text I'm going to add a little
down arrow and that's just a little
indicator that hey whenever you click
this it's actually a menu
and not just a direct link to some other
page so in order to do that you just add
a dead link
yeah autocomplete is messing with me and
are so my profile and let me just make
that carrot right now are you kidding me
all right so inside span you write
nothing because what you do is you just
actually change the class to carrot and
that's not spelled like the vegetable
it's ciear et if you want to add another
you know icon then feel free but this is
the one that I like and also this link
right now is just going to act is a
basic link but we want to give it drop
down functionality in in order to do
that the first thing we're going to do
is we're going to change the class to
drop down
- toggle and we also need another
parameter called data toggle and you set
this attribute to drop-down so now
whenever we click this link it doesn't
treat it as a normal link it's going to
treat it as a drop-down and open up a
menu that is inside this list so let's
actually go ahead and create that menu
right now now it's going to be an
unordered list and our submenu items or
the items on the drop-down menu are
going to go in here and before we do
that we need to change one more class to
let them know that hey this is a
drop-down menu in can you guess what
this is
drop-down menu so now all we have to do
is make our list items and let me just
copy some of these so again these are
the items that are going to be on your
drop-down menu and I'll just say like a
friend's um
photos settings there you go
so there you go kind of confusing but
hopefully when I run this then you see
that my profile instead of being a
normal link it has a carrot to the right
and I should probably add a space right
after my profile and this just makes it
so that arrow is abutted up right up
against the text so you see that and now
instead of just going to another page
whenever I click it we get that drop
down menu pretty sweet
now let me show you one more thing since
I have a little bit of time and that is
how do you make it so that you have some
items right here so on my webpage the
New Boston comm if you noticed um the
logout link is to the right of all the
other ones because this is where you're
going to be navigating most of the time
and if you ever want to logout then you
know you don't accidentally click it or
anything so show you guys how to right
align our a so here are all your menu
items and this unordered list right here
think of this as for the left hand side
so if we want to get one on the right we
need to make another one and just say
write a line slide right aligned and now
we need to make another unordered list
in the class this gray for some
redundant typing nav nav bar nav nav bar
right see could they not come up with
some better naming conventions but hey
I'm not complaining just saying just
saying and now all we have to do is you
know just make any list item so I'll say
logout so I'll build it like copying my
website and there you go here is our
main navigation menu on the left and
also this additional one that is right
aligned for the logout and of course if
we ever want to add additional items on
the right we just copy this and add some
more by I only like to have one
on the right because it looks kind of
goofy if you add more than that but now
that you know the basics of how to
create a drop-down menu and also how to
right align certain menu items ready to
move on to the next part and that is how
to add that main toggle for mobile
