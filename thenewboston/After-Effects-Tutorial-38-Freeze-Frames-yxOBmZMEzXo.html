effects tutorial and in this tutorial
I'm gonna be going over how to create
freeze frames now if you don't know what
freeze frame is it's pretty much a video
clip that plays at normal speed and then
when it gets to a certain point of time
it freezes on that frame it looks like
they're pausing and then after a couple
seconds or however long you want to
create it it just resumes playing again
so it's a really cool effect and I'm
gonna show you how to do it properly in
this tutorial so the first thing you're
going to want to do is get a video clip
and drag it into your new composition to
create a new composition so now we have
a composition that's the same size as
the video so the first thing we want to
do pretty much is edit the composition
settings and so go up to composition
composition settings and expand your
composition by like a minute or
something and now you can see our
composition is longer than our video our
video ends right here
but our composition keeps on going you
never say alright why'd you do that
because whenever we create a
freeze-frame what we're going to do is
take a frame and freeze it for a certain
amount of time so we're gonna end up
with a clip that's longer than our
regular clip depending on how long that
freeze frames for so that's why we want
to expand the composition so we can see
that data so now let's go ahead and
start working with freeze frames now in
order to work with the freeze frame what
you need to do is select your layer
right here and select layer time enable
time remapping now what this does is let
me shrink this so you can see is it puts
a time remapping setting right it puts
pretty much two keyframes at the
beginning and end of your animation
right here and these keyframes represent
points in time of your video so if I
show this graphically you can see I want
to click time remapping you can see that
your video is playing at a constant
speed again the x-axis is the length of
your Cubs
and as the y-axis grows it just means
that it's playing in a normal speed
nothing new so what do we do let's go
back to normal view right here how would
you think that you would um edit this so
you can set up timer mapping well what
you could do is this you could set go to
position like right here let me find a
good air right here when she's eating
the toast and right there and you can go
ahead and create a keyframe right here
and then go back a little bit right here
and a little bit longer and go ahead and
create keyframe and then when you go to
your graphical editor just move this
down and as you can see it plays for a
little bit right here and then let me
move this even more so get a nice longer
freeze-frame so a place normal speed
right here and then a one that hits this
the composition keeps going but your
video stays in time it doesn't go
anymore so as you can see this is one
way you can create what's called a
freeze frame I was about to call it a
keyframe so let me play this and you can
see in the video plays stops right there
so if we think in our a I can create a
keyframe or excuse me free stream that
way so enough for this tutorial see you
later whoa not so fast Hoss there's one
problem with this and yes it is a major
problem whenever you do it this way as
you can see that the ending slope is a
different slope and what this means as
it is that this portion of the video
right here is gonna play at a faster
speed since is a steeper slope again the
less dramatic the slope the house a
slower place the more steep the slope
the faster place so even though we
created a freeze frame successfully
right here by having it totally the same
whenever you get right here it's going
to play at a faster speed so this is not
the ideal way to create a freeze frame
and I was just wanting to show you that
because I know a bunch of guys we're
gonna do it so let's go ahead and in our
animation again just get rid of all your
defaults go to a place you want to
freeze and now I will show you how to
success look successfully create a free
string go ahead and click your layer
click layer time enabled timer mapping
and then go to someplace you want to
freeze like right there go ahead and
click your keyframe button right here to
add a keyframe looking familiar well not
so fast what you want to do here is
click the page down button on your
keyboard this is gonna move your
composition or video one keyframe and
then you on go ahead and click this
again so if you scroll in as you can see
we now have two keyframes right next to
each other so from there make sure you
only have that one selected and go ahead
and press shift on your keyboard and
select this last one now go ahead and
undo shift and you can move both of them
at the same time and now if we look in
our graphical editor right here our
freeze frame was successfully created
right here and it kept the slope right
there so again this is normal speed this
is a freeze frame and this is normal
speed right here as you can see this
slope is not more intense or less
intense same angle I'll throw up so that
is how you successfully create a freeze
frame and let me play this video for you
as you can see it's slow just because
it's rendering but this is real speed
and now if freeze frames right there and
then when we get to the end of our
freeze frame I'll play it and boom back
to normal speed so again that second way
is the ideal way and the only way we're
should be creating freeze frames again
create a frame a keyframe where you want
your animation to freeze then press page
down and then when you press it create
another keyframe and select the ending
two frames and press shift
move them in this way as you can see in
the graph edible graph ethical what the
heck graphical editor there we go
we get a nice ideal animation with
successful keyframes and we don't speed
up or slow down anything so never do it
the first way always do it the second
way and this is how you can great
successful freeze frames so thank you
