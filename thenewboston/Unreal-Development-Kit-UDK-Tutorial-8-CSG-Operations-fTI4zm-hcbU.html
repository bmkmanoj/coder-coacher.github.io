tutorial and in this story I'm gonna be
talking about the different CSG modes
these different boxes right here what
they are how we can use them so the very
first thing I want to do for this
tutorial is build a simple cube so we
already have cube selected and we
already know if we click Add
it adds mass simple enough so now let me
talk to you guys about the subtract CSG
choice so what this does is it subtracts
mass when there's already mass so let's
go ahead and probably if we work with
our front view it's going to be the
easiest so go ahead and make sure you're
working with your move tool like a a
translation mode go ahead and select
your reddit builder brush now go ahead
and move this to the right and probably
up just take a chunk out of this you
know wherever you want let's take a
small chunk out of it like right there
so as you can see already we have our
blue block and that's the mass that we
already added and then this red builder
brush is basically saying all right this
is your work tool basically so what
we're going to be doing is we want to
subtract this piece from this chunk of
mass right here so we already have the
red boat of brush where you want it
maybe it'll be better if I change this
view right there and go ahead and hit
subtract and as you can see that
subtracts mass from where you already
have mass so basically the CSG ad adds a
chunk of mass to your game and the CSG
subtract subtracts a chunk of mass to
your game simple enough so now let me go
ahead and with that being said go ahead
and select both of these and we'll
delete that and now let me go ahead and
move this out of the way and we'll go
ahead and delete this subtraction and
actually I'm kind of jumping ahead of
myself just go ahead and hit file new
don't save because I wanted you guys
something first what I want you guys now
is what the intersect and D intersect
tool mean I almost forgot that so go
ahead and might as well add a chunk of
mass right here so now we have a chunk
of mass
just a square on our screen now let's go
ahead and jump to front view again and
I'm gonna move this red bow to brush
let's go ahead and move it right where I
was before up and over until it's taken
out of nice little section right there
so let me change this view right here so
now we have a chunk of math right here
in the red builder brush is intersection
intersecting a section of it now what
these two buttons down here mean
intersect Indy intersect it's basically
a way of quickly changing the shape and
size of your red builder brush without
without having to change every single
point so anytime you hit this intercept
button look what happens it takes where
it's overlaying
a chunk of mass and it changes the red
builder brush to intersect that
perfectly so as you can see instead of
having to resize this brush right here
what we did is we hit this intersect
button and it pretty much changed the
brush size to intersect that maybe you
can see a little better right there so
check it out pretty cool huh so I'm
gonna go ahead and hit this button undo
so just to get you know my red go to
brush back to normal and now let me go
ahead and hit this button right here now
with the CSG D intersect means is
basically the exact opposite wherever
there is mass already or wherever it's
overlapping something let me go ahead
and click it and I can talk about it
later on so you can probably see it in
this perspective view in this front view
the best instead of only creating the
red boat brush where is overlaying
something instead that's the only space
that takes away from the red builder
brush so now our red builder brush is an
entirely new shape depending on what we
were overlapping so just remember CSG ad
adds mass to the screen CSG subtract
subtract smash from the screen intersect
changes the brush size to whatever it's
intersecting it only changes the red
boat brush to that size and CSG D
intersects takes a chunk out of the red
boat brush depending on what it was
overlaying so with that being said let
me say this
go ahead and get a new file once again
and I want to cover one last thing
before I let you guys go in this story
go ahead and let's say we want to add a
shape right there and then we want to go
ahead and we decide that we want to make
a subtract brush so go ahead and we want
to take a chunk out of this and go ahead
and hit this to subtract it and as we
can see nothing new nothing unexpected
it takes a chunk out of this so let's go
ahead and get rid of our red boda brush
and as you can see in this front view we
got our main brush right here which is
of course the main add brush it adds
mass to the screen and then we have this
subtract brush what's basically
subtracted mass takes a chunk out of it
so let's say we want to change this and
maybe we didn't want to take a chunk out
quite as big so what we can do is we can
move this subtract over here and we'll
move up a little bit so the chunk isn't
quite as big but look what's going on
right here hmm that's kind of weird I
mean it changed in this view but
whenever we change it in this view it
didn't update it that's kind of weird
since our red go to brush I mean our add
brush was right there and our subtract
brush is still there yet the geometry is
not updating anytime you come across
this issue where your geometry is not
updating this is because of this the UDK
doesn't rebuild your geometry every time
you move a brush if it was gonna do that
it would eat all your computer's memory
and resources so anytime you want to
explicitly update or refresh your
geometry you need to go to this button
up here build geometry for visible
levels now I'm gonna go ahead and click
this and look what happens in my
perspective view down here go ahead and
click it and it basically updates it
so this basically means the geometry for
visible levels it's basically another
way of saying are at UDK update or
refresh my geometry so again any time
you move your shape like this it's not
going to change in the perspective view
because it's not rebuilding your
geometry in order to explicitly rebuild
your geometry you need to go click this
button right here
treat for visible levels and then it
updates all your geometry so if you have
a parameter like alright I move this but
that's not you know updating that's
what's going on so that's all I want to
talk to you guys about in this story
again don't forget what all these CSG
modes do and also when you come across
the issue of you try to rebuild your
geometry and it doesn't look exactly
like you expected that's what's going on
UDK doesn't rebuild your geometry each
time you have to explicitly tell it to
rebuild so that being said thank you
guys for watching don't forget to
subscribe and I'll see you guys in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
