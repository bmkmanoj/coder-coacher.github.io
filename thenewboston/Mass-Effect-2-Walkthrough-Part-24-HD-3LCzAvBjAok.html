mercs or alliance I'm not I'm not
telling you anything I've got a nice
application of meta gel ready to go but

just shoot the overflow from the laps
the old Croghan up there she's really
been cleaning house lately j'adore hired
him to make her an army but the krogan

live ammo training so crap I don't get
paid enough to goddamn plead out not

need coordinates on that growing back I
want your friends gone understand ah

a shady spot before you bleed out oh
