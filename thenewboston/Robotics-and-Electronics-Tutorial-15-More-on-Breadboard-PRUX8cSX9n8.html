combinations that work and some
combinations that don't work when using
a breadboard now again I said that these
holes are in sets of five so anything
you connect and that this hole is going
to be connected in any of these holes in
that's cause of strips of copper
underneath that connect each of these
holes now anything you connect into this
hole is not going to be connected
underneath it because that's just not
how your breadboard works so for example
so you connect a lawyer into here top
hole now anything to the left and right
of it let's see F G H I J
ABCD efg hijk up um anything that's
going to be connected in here see those
wires would be connected right there but
let's say you connected a wire down
there that wire would not be connected
only wires to the left and a right of it
within that little v set is going to be
connected and what this means is even
though it might be in the same row if
it's over here in this set that wire
would still not be connected in again
when you connect the wire any water
that's in the same v set is going to be
connected anything down for man even if
it's directly down like this or across
these small gaps right there anything
like that it's not going to be connected
so that's your intro bread boarding make
sure you check out my next tutorial and
I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
