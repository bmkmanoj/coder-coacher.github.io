your 69th java tutorial I've been making
a lot of Java tutorials I just noticed
and in this tutorial I'm going to show
you guys how to add some functionality
to the box so what we need to do to add
functionality is add an item listener
and one item listener does is pretty
much just chose there and waits for you
to click something and when it clicks it
it pretty much just well tells it to do
something so let's go ahead and take
that box because that's what we want to
add an event to and we'll go ahead and
add it add item listener there we go now
as you know an item listener usually
takes an event handler object as its
parameter well I'm going to tell you
guys how to do something real quick here
instead of having a new object like
handler and having it pass into the
handler class what you can do is if you
go ahead and there we go just like that
instead of having an object in creating
a whole nother outside class somewhere
else you can actually put something
called an anonymous inner class in here
and what this does is it actually
implements the item listener class so
here's how you do that go ahead and type
new item listener just like that
and this is your declaration for an
anonymous class that implements item
listener so instead of having like
before handler class implements item
listener outside and we have to make a
whole new class what we can do is just
go ahead and stick a class in here and
pass it in for the parameter as add item
listener and we bypass that entire step
of having to create a whole new separate
class so again since we named a non
anonymous class that implements item
listener we need to use that method and
that's called item state changed as you
can see right there so what this class
has to have in there is only one method
that's know let's go ahead and create it
right now item listener has let's go
ahead and make it public
void item state change got make sure I
spell that right and did I oh yeah nice
now what we have to do is of course it
takes in item event event just like that
and as our body for this we just go
ahead and write whatever we want to
happen when we select one of the options
and here's how you can do that go ahead
and make a if statement in this if
statement determines what option you
selected so if the events get state
change this pretty much if you click a
button we want to set it equal to or
excuse me we want to test if it's equal
to title event dot selected so what this
pretty much means all right did you
select a button is equal to what will
this pretty much means what was selected
just a nutshell so what will selected
first of all whatever you select we want
to take that picture and remember this
is just the picture that appears on our
screen
we want to set icon which pretty much
means change the image to and the
parameter says what icon do you want to
change to well we have an array called
pics and what we have the thing is we
have two elements or two images in this
one so what one do we select well go
ahead and type box dot get selected
index with empty parameters just like
that make sure I typed everything right
parenthesis bam bam now make sure the
method gets state change is undefined
type and oh here we go hold on a second
all right guys in all of my excitedness
I did another stupid ear I actually put
get state change instead of changed
quite embarrassing make sure you type
that right but now pretty much that's
all we needed to do so what this does is
it makes anonymous inner class and this
is the class
itself and in this class the only thing
we needed to do is since it implemented
item listener we needed to add an item
state changed method since that was the
only method in item listener and then we
pretty much just said r-right what item
did you select or what option did you
select in the drop-down list and change
the picture to that icon or item so now
we can go ahead and get out of add item
listener and we can pretty much just add
all this this screen so add that box to
the screen and remember that box is just
the drop-down box and now we want to
take that picture and add it to the
screen but by default let's go ahead
instead of equal to nu J label and we'll
do pix 0 and this pretty much just gives
a default value so you know something
appears before you choose any options
and lastly let's just go ahead and add
that picture to the screen just like
that and we shouldn't get any errors
should it and now let's go ahead and
just run this and I'll show you guys
what we get by default again like I said
we have B on the screen which is at the
index 0 then when we select X our
picture changes the X we can go ahead
and select B X we can do this all day if
we want really but no time for that we
need to overview our program so what we
did is pretty much let me get the good
stuff we made a box variable a picture
variable just a hold box and picture
later on we made an array of file names
and we made an array of images named
pics and then we went and go ahead and
our constructor which is pretty much
making the window we add a title add a
layout we set that box equal to new
jcombobox and it took the file names is
the options so again if I go ahead and
run this this these options right here
are the default for filename so that's
why that was able to run and the only
confusing part which we did new is this
instead of having a new object in a new
class we just went ahead and
the handler class inside the add item
listener and that was actually an
anonymous inner class and what we needed
to do is we needed to overwrite this
method item state changed because that
was the only method in item listener and
we overrode it with a nice little
function right here and then we went had
to added the box at a screen then we
went ahead and added the picture to the
screen and just gave a default setting
and we were good to go so again here is
our awesome little program right here
flawless no bugs to know anything so
that's all you get for this tutorial
thank you guys for watching in the next
tutorial we're going to be going over
something else cool you can do with
gooeys and well that's it so again thank
you guys for watching don't forget to
subscribe and I will see you next door</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
