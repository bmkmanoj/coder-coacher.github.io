Photoshop cs6 tutorial
I'm your host buddy Blackford and today
we're just going to go for a quick
tutorial here about converting a
background into a layer and if you've
been watching my tutorial series you
probably already know how to do this so
this is more geared toward someone who's
just looking up on YouTube how to
convert a background layer or background
into a layer and they're stuck or
something like that so we'll just get
right into it the background layers are
necessary in Photoshop because you for
some like image types you need to have
no transparency in them so if you're
trying to like export a JPEG or save as
a JPEG
it'll add in like the background layer
for you to have everything covered up
also when you're like saving as a JPEG
it'll take if you have multiple layers
everything will get blended down into
one layer and that layer is called the
background you just it just does it
really quick and you don't really see it
when it's happening but that's what
happens so converting a background layer
to a layer is really easy and then
there's there's a couple ways to do it
if you double click on the background
layer it'll bring up the new layer info
you can name your layer and apply colors
or modes or anything like that and hit
OK and now it is a changed into a
regular layer I'm going to hit control Z
so it goes back to a background you can
also right click on the background layer
and click on layer from background and
this does the same exact thing and if I
put Mike again it changes it just the
same as if you double clicked it and my
preference is just double clicking in it
because it's a lot faster now you might
be wondering why you might want to
change a background into a layer well
there's some things that you can't do to
background layers first of all they're
locked
and just by double-clicking on it and
make it a new layer unlocks it things if
you want to apply things like
transparency or blending modes and some
other adjustments probably you won't be
able to do that to a background layer so
that's one of the reasons why you might
want to change it to a regular layer so
you won't be able to move it up and down
in the timeline either or in the layers
panel I mean because it's locked and as
a background layer and it needs to be at
the bottom so those are the reasons why
so that it was just a quick tutorial on
how to do that very easy very simple so
thanks for watching everybody and have a
good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
