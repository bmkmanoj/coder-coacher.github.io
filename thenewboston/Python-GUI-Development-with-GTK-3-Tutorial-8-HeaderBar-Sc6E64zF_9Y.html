video I'm going to show you how to make
a header bar for your program now a
header bar of course is a bar that
appears at the top of your window and
you can do some pretty cool stuff to it
like add a title add some icons give
those icons some functionality and it's
a really cool way to customize your
program so its title this header bar
boom roasted and before begin with
actual tutorial I'll show you guys a
couple other things that you're probably
going to find yourself doing a lot so
just for the main window before you like
I said get to any of the header bar
stuff usually want to set a border width
so what this is going to do for your
window is it's going to add some space
between the content that's inside and
the edges and you can do this with the
individual widgets or you can just do
all at once I usually give it what about
10 or so and just makes everything look
a little bit better and also you know
like in the button example where I ran
the program and it was like the tiniest
program ever because I was just trying
to explain how to make one button well
you can actually if you have your
content that's rather small you actually
probably want to do something like sets
default size right there so this is
going to set default size for your
window so as soon as the user starts the
program let's say that you want the
window to be 500 by 400 this is what
that will do and of course if they want
to they can go ahead and resize it
maximize it you know stretch the borders
out to whatever size they want but this
is just the initial size as soon as your
program starts so now let's get to
making the header bar and actually give
myself some more room to scroll around
Oh scrolling feel so free
alright so header bar this is going to
be equal to it gtk
header bar it would just said header a
bar all right there we go
so what you usually want to do after
this is the first function you want to
call is set show close button and this
is gonna make sure that the user can
actually close the window you you want
this on there 99% of the time I really
can't think of any scenario where you
would not want to show these or a close
button maybe if you're having some kind
of weird custom alert and you were
forcing them to choose ok or cancel or
yes or no and they just couldn't close
out of it but there are alternative ways
of doing that too so we'll see those
later but just put truth right now and
another thing that you may want to do is
change one of the properties on it and
to do that you write header bar dot
props and what property if you want to
change Bo just the title so I'm just
gonna make a stupid program this isn't
really gonna work but I'll just call it
like rip in music player so we'll
pretend we're making the layout for some
kind of music player but essentially
what this does is it adds a title to
your header bar in other words a title
to the window so what we can do now is
actually start adding some cool stuff
other than a title and I'm gonna show
you guys how to add icons to your header
bar and you can actually do these do
this in a couple different ways and
let's add a UH an icon on the right and
now I had an icon on the left and
they'll be a little bit different so in
order to add an icon such as like a
graphic or a picture what we're gonna do
is we're actually gonna make a themed
icon that's what type it is and then we
need to convert it to an image and then
we can stick that image on our button so
it sounds weird that you just can't make
a button with an image on it you need to
go icon image stick it on the button but
you know I don't make the rules
alright so I just name an audio button
set this equal okay button alright so we
have our button first and again the
button is the thing that's going to
appear over all and there are actually a
bunch of different icons that are
already built in um to your computer or
you can load your own custom ones if you
download them from the internet or
whatever but I'm just gonna use some of
these that came with the module so let's
do um GI oh nice nice crap popping up
for me name equal one I know is Nome dev
all right so this icon right here is an
icon it just like a little picture of a
CD and I forgot to import GI o or Gio I
not really sure how they pronounce it
this week I'm sure it'll change like in
two seconds but import that module as
well and now we have our icon now
remember after we have our icon we need
to convert it to an image and by the way
if you guys want to look at all the
different types of icons are already
built in to your system
then go do it online there are a couple
different ones but uh yeah so you don't
have to like memorize them all so
anyways for the image what we're gonna
do is we're gonna go gtk image dot new
from G icon right there now this takes
two parameters the first one is what was
the icon you just created right there
and next what is the icon size so icon
size and since this is going on the
button
this property is button so now this is
our icon we converted it to an image and
now with that image we can just add it
to the button so audio button that's the
thing that's going to appear on the menu
bar
image now we actually need to add the
button to the header so let's just rate
header bar pack end audio button alright
so if you guys want this button to
appear on left then you would just write
pack start but I want this icon to
appear on the right hand side so that's
what I'm doing pack and follow your
heart what everyone do and I think I'm
gonna burp in like two seconds
nope not gonna that was a joke just
kidding I really had to burp you know
I'm just gonna keep going alright now
that's a plane I can crack myself up
over here art so what I want to do now
is I actually want to show you guys
another cool trick and that's how you
can create linked items so if you just
add a bunch of these buttons like here
maybe you wanted a bunch of buttons on
there then they're gonna appear to be
kind of separated you can also link
items together and when you link them
they appear to be pressed together so
when would you want to do this you want
to do this whenever you have a group of
related items such as maybe all your
player controls like play stop
fast-forward in Reverse those are all
related
they can now control the time of the
music maybe something else like a jet
that's completely different so you want
to throw that in another buttons but you
guys are going to see in a second so say
create the box of linked items so I'm
gonna make a box and gonna set this
equal to box and the orientation of this
is going to be equal to GK orientation
horizontal art so just left and right
you know I don't want to put my buttons
on top of each other so that's why we're
doing that now another thing that I want
to do is this GDK style
context add class jeez Louise add class
box gets so out of context and linked
all right so what this does is it
essentially says whatever we put in this
box they're gonna be linked together so
most things up to now we saw whenever we
put them in a box they were separate
items but now like kind of glue them
together so what I'm gonna do is I'm
just gonna make a left arrow and a right
arrow just because I don't know it's
really easy to see those kind of related
and these are actually really easy so
left arrow you name it whatever you want
I'm gonna name my left arrow and they're
just gonna be buttons and again these
are just gonna be buttons with left
arrows and right Arizona so left arrow
arrow type left and you always have to
do some of the shadow so shadow type
none all right
so whenever you make an error like this
all you have to do is you say I'm
creating a button and then I want to add
an object of this arrow class to the
button so it's a little bit different
than these icons um I don't know why
they may have different I think they
should just all make them the same but
what do they care about me so of course
we need to add this to the box and then
we're gonna do the same thing with the
right arrow but we're just gonna copy
this because we are super lazy right
arrow right arrow right arrow right
arrow and this is of type right now I
also just want to add it to the box
plane like this and since I added this
one first it's by default going up here
on the left so the last thing that we
have to do two more lines of code is we
actually need to add this entire box to
the header so we added these arrows to
the box but we didn't add the box to the
actual header yet
so header bar pack starts box and also
let me add just show you guys real quick
just a little text area to the windows
so the text view like this now a text
view is just the area that you can type
inside kind of like a text field if you
ever use them HTML and I just want to
add something so you know we have
something cool to look at and hopefully
let me run this bad boy and it did not
work because
what did I do all right
so I actually forgot because I am an
idiot to set the title bar equal to our
header bar so it is just using the
default one right now all right so
anyways after you make your header bar
you have to actually set it from the
default title bar and now hopefully
whenever I run this all right that looks
a tidbit better mate so check this out
we made our own custom header bar a lot
better than an boring default one we got
a cool title and not only that but we
have our own custom icons built right in
so this is the first one I was talking
about when I was talking about icons and
images yada yada and this right here is
that linked little area in and remember
this is great whenever you have a group
of buttons that is related or that are
related however you say it like
fast-forward play stop and rewind those
are all usually you know appear together
and if you don't link them then they're
just gonna all appear as separate
buttons but look at this and this is
that text field in case you guys are
wondering just the area you can type
inside but ripping music player ready to
put this baby to the market make
millions but I have to teach you guys a
few other things first so for now then
guys for watching don't forget subscribe
yeah yeah but tomato tomahto see you
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
