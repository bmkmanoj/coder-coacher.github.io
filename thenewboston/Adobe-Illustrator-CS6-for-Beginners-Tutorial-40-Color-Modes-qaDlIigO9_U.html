illustration tutorial on a new pasta and
YouTube channel my name is buddy and
today I'm gonna do an explanation of
color modes and these are actually
really important because when you export
your final project if it's if you're
having like a client who actually knows
what they're talking about or needs
something in a certain way you're gonna
need to know this so what color modes do
is they define the colors represented it
represented in the document and you're
gonna select your colour mode usually at
the start of your project there are two
main color modes and you might have
heard of them before but one is called
RGB and that's called red green and blue
is what it stands for and the other is
CMYK and that's cyan magenta yellow and
black
now color modes determined a number of
colors and pretty much like the file
size of an image and we what you're
trying to set up in the beginning is for
the output so if you're using RGB this
is the main thing to remember if you're
using RGB then your output is going to
be something on a monitor be that your
computer monitor or a television or a
giant film screen that's when you're
going to be using RGB and it could be
for websites little instructional videos
that you've made for kids or anything
that's basically on a monitor the other
thing is CMYK and you're going to use
CMYK when you're outputting to prints or
presses so think of it like a photograph
or you going to make like something
that's going to be printed out for the
company that needs to be high-end
anything that you would print out on
like pretty much like a high-end printer
you're going to want
- you CMYK let's see what else one of
the things a tip for you to think about
when you're doing this is when when you
import sometimes images they'll come
into your they'll come in as RGB or CMYK
automatically and sometimes illustrator
doesn't always get it right what you
need to what you need to output it to so
for example you take a picture with your
camera a high-end camera and you want to
use it for a printing press so you're
gonna take a picture and you're gonna
have it you're gonna mess around with it
and then you're going to print on it
print it up and give it to your client
well the smartest course of action is to
work in RGB throughout the whole thing
and then convert it to CMYK at the end
that's just a little tip for you so
let's go into how to change our color
modes so it's pretty easy first thing
you probably want to do is save your
document and if you're starting from
scratch you want to set this up first so
you go to file and then you go to
document color mode and we've got CMYK
color or RGB color and you can switch
between these two
remember that RGB is for anything on a
monitor and CMYK is for anything that's
gonna come off of a printing press you
can change those you can change it
throughout the hour throw whenever
you're working on a project but it's
never a good idea to change it mid
project because the way illustrator
mixes the colors it's going to get all
messed up and it's not going to be what
you will actually want not going to be
the true colors that you want printed so
the next thing that I wanted to go over
was changing the color profile and what
a color profile is is it's these it
specifies the color usage in the
document
and each color profile has a bunch of
different colors within it and most of
the time you're just gonna leave this at
what it is but if you get somebody that
is a stickler for it you get a client
that makes you use a certain profile you
got to know where to change this so you
go to edit and you go to assign profile
you've got don't manage color don't
color manage this document I've never
used that before you got working RGB and
this is srgb here that's the one you're
going to use most of the time or you can
click down here in profile and you can
change change it to any of these here
that you think you need to use sometimes
Adobe RGB is used pretty much everything
else I haven't really used if you're
using like if there's a printer that
you're printing out of and it's an Epson
printer and it uses this color profile
to print out of and those are the only
colors that it really has in the printer
then that's what you got a pic so just
keep that in mind another thing I want
to show you is after you change your
color mode so now it is in CMYK color
ready for printing and you go to assign
profile you can see that now we've got
different CMYK profiles instead of just
the RGB profiles that we had last time
just think of that when you're working
on these some of these are used for
printing on newspapers some of these are
used for printing on Billboard's or
photos or whatever well the most of the
time we're going to use us web coated
swop v2 that's the one you're going to
use most of the time and that's all I
wanted to show you about this I'm going
to change this back to the color mode I
had before nothing's gonna really mess
up because all I've got is this text
that I don't care about I can just
delete it
and now I can start over and work on my
new project in RGB mode so thanks a lot
for listening if you want some more
information about it I went over this in
a way more detail in one of the
Photoshop tutorials that I did about
color motes and color profiles and
things like that so go ahead and check
those out thanks a lot for watching this
tutorial
give a thumbs up if you understood what
I was talking about and be sure to
subscribe to get more exciting tutorials
about all sorts of stuff
computer-related on here thanks a lot
everybody for watching have a good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
