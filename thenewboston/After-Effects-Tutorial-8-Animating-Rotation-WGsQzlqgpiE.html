and after-effects and in this tutorial
we're going to be gone over rotation so
the first thing we need is an object and
instead of Sammy the sausage we've been
using in the last tutorial I'm going to
go with a new file I made this guy right
here this is Charlie the Chupacabra and
we're going to be teaching him how to
rotate today now when I'm working with
these images don't get upset that your
images may not be his advanced or
professional looking as mine because
I've been working with Photoshop for
many years so that's why my images look
awesome so now that we have Charlie in
the middle of a screen let's go ahead
and shred a bit and just put them right
in the middle of the screen and as you
can see he automatically pops up in our
composition panel go ahead and select
the layer charlie or whatever you named
your object and press R R is going to
bring up rotation and once you have this
brought up you can go ahead and click
your stopwatch this is going to let you
edit keyframes so rotation is a lot like
any other animating arm type where you
can scrub your values into half
keyframes so let's go ahead and do that
right now the first keyframe we're going
to set to zero because we don't want
them rotating it and let's go ahead and
move this to about three seconds and
let's go ahead and scrub our rotation to
about 250 degrees now as you can see
there are two values right here the
first value is how many times you want
them to do a 360 degree spin and the
second one is like fine tuning all right
so you want to do 0 250 degrees if you
want them to do three spins then you
could um edit this little number right
here to make it go three so this would
pretty much be like three and 75% but I
just wanted to do a basic
arm spin right now so in another thing
if you scrubbed it all the way past 360
degrees you notice that the little how
many times automatically adjust it past
that so take note of that so right now
we have Charlie Charlie rotating a full
360 degrees plus an additional 70
degrees so let's go ahead back to home
and see how that looks and there you
have a basic rotation and again if you
want to change the number of times your
rotates let's make them spin a bunch
right here seven spin 19 times with a an
additional 70 degrees move that back
actually forgot to have that key frame
having spent about 17 times and let's
watch them all spin ah Chupacabra
Charlie and there you have it so another
thing that I wanted to go over let me
delete these keyframe is there are two
different ways you can spin you can spin
on the x axis the y axis in the z axis
and to bring those up um I move back my
home keyframe to bring those up you need
to click this little checkbox under your
square what this square is is it lets
you open up 3d rotation to rotate on all
accesses or axes whatever they're called
then just by watching this they're the
best way to explain what the x axis is
and what the y and z axis is is just to
watch my animation the x axis as you can
see that'll spin it on the x axis now
the x axis is actually the one going
left to right so when it spins on the x
axis it's actually looks like it's
flipping up and down so anytime you want
to turn your object up or down you need
to spin it on the Y or excuse me the x
axis now the y axis is the axis that
goes up and down
so whenever we rotate that you can see
it looks like it's spinning either left
or right in the z-axis this is what when
we edited to the last time this is just
going to make it spin like in circles so
anytime you want to spin that just scrub
it to the right and any time you want to
spin it in the opposite direction just
scrub it to the left so when you edit
all of these accesses just like any
other or just like the basic zero
rotation just make your keyframes and
have it rotate over time so that my
friends is how you um rotate objects and
after-effects again if you want to
rotate on different axes or axis in the
z-axis then make sure your little cube
is checked and that's how you bring that
up and also make sure your stopwatch is
checked if you want to animate keyframes
so once you learn how to rotate objects
and also 3d rotation you're ready to
move on in my next tutorial so thank you
guys for watching I hope you enjoyed it
and I will see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
