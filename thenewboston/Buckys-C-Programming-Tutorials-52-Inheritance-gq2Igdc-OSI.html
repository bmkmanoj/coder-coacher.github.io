tutorial and in this tutorial I'm going
to be talking about something called
inheritance now inheritance is a topic
that confuses a lot of people but I'm
going to be giving you guys a really
simple explanation and showing you guys
a really simple example of what
inheritance is now inheritance is the
idea that you can inherit things from
another class for example say you have a
class that has a couple functions in it
and a couple variables in it and you
wanted to make a new class that also had
the same functions and variables in it
well instead of you know copying them
all and pasting them all into your new
class you can just inherit from the
other class and whenever you inherit
from another class you get all the stuff
you get all the functions and variables
so let's go ahead and make two classes
file new class I'm going to make one
class named mother and this class is
going to have a couple things in it well
it's going to have a function in it for
the sake of this tutorial so let's go
ahead and create this add it to project
and I'll press ok and now I'm going to
create a new class called a daughter now
what the daughter is going to do is
inherit this stuff from the mother so go
ahead and press create yes and okay
so the first thing we need to do is go
to our dot CPP copy this paste inner
main and also go to our daughter copy
this paste in our main and then copy all
this and paste it and paste it so now
all our dot CPP s look the same that's
why I like doing all my tutorials so
let's go ahead and our mother header and
actually in both our header files take
out protected and private because um I
didn't tell you guys what those mean
right now so let's forget about it for
now they're actually pretty important
when we're talking about inheritance but
like I said in this story we'll just
want to give you guys a really simple
example
so before I go on let me give you guys
the technical terms see we're going to
be inheriting all the stuff for a mother
and we're going to be putting it in the
daughter class but now the technical
terms if you're on a test or if you're
working for a job or something
whenever you inherit from a class this
main class that you're inheriting from
is called the base class so in this
example mother is going to be the base
class now the stuff that does the
inheriting the daughter that gets the
stuff this is called the derived class
so the base class is the class with all
the stuff in it and the class that is
going to get all the stuff is called the
derived class so let's go on and start
typing our example so let's go ahead and
throw one function into the mother class
and we'll just you know void say name so
this is the Robert's family we're
dealing with so let's go ahead and build
this function right here right here all
right we don't have anything in the
constructor because the constructor is
annoying now let's go ahead and build
this void mother say name function and
all this function is going to do is see
out
I am a Roberts because that's what my
mom shouts all the time and she doesn't
know how to spell so that's why I have
to add some typos in there so now if we
go ahead in our main CPP we can build an
object called like mother named it mom
and what mom can do is say name and of
course it would say I am Roberts on the
screen and say you wanted to build
another object a daughter object and
we'll name this Tina and you wanted Tina
to have that same function because I
mean she's Roberts - she should be able
to say it well right now whenever we
build it it doesn't work because Tina
doesn't have that function only the mom
does so saying RA I know in this case go
ahead and copy this put in the daughter
header then copy all this crap put it in
the daughter CPP and it should work fine
well yes you can do that and it'll work
fine but I got an easier way to do
things and that is through inheritance
now whenever you want to use inheritance
all you have to do is this in the header
file whatever class you want to inherit
the stuff from right after the class
name put a colon and then right after
this write the word public and then
write the class you want to inherit from
which is mother now we're going to be
talking about this keyword why I put
public right there basically it means um
all this public stuff is going to be
public in here but we'll be talking
about later there's a couple of weird
things but you know just put public for
now so basically what I'm saying
to C++ is this alright in my daughter
class include all the stuff from the
mother class so what it's going to do is
go over to this mother class go ahead
and grab this function right here it's
not going to grab the constructor that's
another silly role but it's going to
grab any public variables and any public
functions and right now we only have one
public function in that same name and
it's going to throw it inside the
stoddard class so now this daughter
class is in
hairatan from the mother class so now
check it out even though we didn't
explicitly write that same name function
in here it inherited it so it's there
even though we can't see it
so now let's say we want to take away
this part right here and we try to run
this we don't get any errors and now the
daughter is able to use that same name
function so again what inheritance is is
this whenever you have a class and you
want to inherit the crap from another
class you can write a colon and then
public and then that name of the class
and what this does is it takes
everything from this class and it sticks
it in this class so this is called the
base class and this is called the
derived class
whenever you inherit everything from the
base class gets thrown in the derived
class so now even though we can't see
the same name function it's there so
that way whenever we created a daughter
object the daughter object was able to
use the mothers functions even though it
wasn't explicitly written in the
documentation or dot CPP file whatever
the heck you want to call it so that's
why we were able to run this daughter
object and use the same name function on
that so that's what inheritance is it's
basically inheriting stuff from another
class but you know how I said that there
are a couple weird rules like you needed
this public thing and whenever you
inherited it grabbed all the stuff from
this mother class and throw into the
daughter class well that's not exactly
true I don't want to say I lie to you
guys but for the sake of this tutorial I
just wanted to make a simple arm there
are a couple weird exceptions in
whenever you inherit from another class
it doesn't actually grab everything
Aronian grabs a couple things and also
you need this public keyword or out some
weird stuff will happen if you try to
use protected or private and that's what
I'm probably going to be talking to you
guys about in the upcoming tutorials but
for now what you have to remember is
this inheritance is basically grabbing
another class and throwing all the stuff
in
to a derived class so this is called the
base class this is called the derived
class
that's what inheritance is pretty simple
huh you inherit this stuff from another
class that's all it is so now that I
talked about that we're ready to move on
to next tutorial so thank you guys for
watching don't forget to subscribe
hopefully you understand the concept of
inheritance if you don't watch the video
again and I will see in the next
tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
