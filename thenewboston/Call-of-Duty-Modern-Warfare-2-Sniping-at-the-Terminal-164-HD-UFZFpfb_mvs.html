a quick game of team deathmatch on
terminal here with the Barrett 50 Cal
precinct in the lead and primarily today
are on this video I'm going to be
talking about two quick things map
terminal in general just in general and
sniping on this particular map first of
all I'm going to talk about this man I
have to say this is prob most likely in
my opinion at least at least one of the
best maps in this game or one of the
definitely one of the better mastery
game and I say that because um most most
of the time unless you've got like an
absolutely dominating team domination
search and destroy you a veal and and or
demolition there isn't one side usually
that windy dominates over the other it
is a fair balanced well put together
um like and here see out there is on
most Maps I would have just been like
unskilled row if that was just like the
long holiday I would have definitely
been killed right there um from that
perspective I was able to run away
because there was cover there was places
that were far object sorry that were put
there that you can actually like use for
cover instead of just like round it went
okay this map is I'd probably say is
definitely a very very good map and
sorry I speed myself but it really is
definitely one of the better maps in
this game I'm you a veal and yeah I get
spawn killed right there and sleeping on
this map I just want to talk about that
for a second unless you're actually at
least know what you're doing
sniping don't snipe on this map like
I've been sniping since call of duty 4 I
know what I'm doing actually that was
called Voldemort and then told you
before I start sniping so I actually
know what I'm doing if you're new to
this game if you don't know really what
you're doing just like trying out a bear
50 cal don't try on this map try it on
some other map try it on maybe like
wasteland orc warrior a map where it
actually is or it's a really big map
where there actually is a bunch of
really nice open areas where you can
practice statement or just have maybe
even just have a game for you and a
bunch of friends just go around with
like interventions or something like
that I've done that before it's really
fun actually it was incredibly fun and
it's effective because I've gotten
better I've actually gotten better
sniping ooh there's some models kills
are you a beauty cannot actually better
sniping to a deal from where I was just
because of that because one of my
friends one of actually my cousin he
really does like to no scope he plays on
a high sensitivity knows knows how to no
scope
he has gotten a bunch of just a bunch of
random noscope she's done because he's
practiced like if we're playing a
competitive game I will fix it or parts
with whatever if I'm just running around
running it with an intervention I'm
missing life it's competitive yeah I'm
not just gonna lie it's practicing a
quickscoping or something like that I
would but oh yeah ok back to just
sniping on this map particular sharma
Lloyd terminal I'm not sure if I already
said this but you know what you'd only
if you know what you're doing snipe if
you don't down standing by if you don't
tell you really I would just run around
with like something okay um I think the
game is getting yeah i think the game is
about to end right here so um this is it
here we are there's the ND game with me
at Nicki verse 16 and 4 and I'd have to
say my brother got the last kill okay um
16 in for Barrett 50 Cal on a terminal
