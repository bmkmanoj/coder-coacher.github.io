this is another PHP video tutorial for
the new Boston now in this tutorial I'm
going to be talking about embedding PHP
inside HTML now you obviously probably
all know what embedding is it's just
putting something within something
embedding it inside so if I was to setup
my PHP document and let's just use the
example of let's say outputting hello
world now if we come into our browser
and refresh this we can see that we are
produced with the text hello world this
is a pretty standard example and
nothing's changed since my more basic
tutorials so how about if we want to
let's say actually embed some text
inside for example an input text box now
I'm going to get rid of this and I'm
going to start typing and an input tag
and I'm going to give the type of text
and we'll just say the value of hello so
what this is going to produce I'm not
using any HTML tags just to keep things
simple and obviously you would set your
page out properly and this example will
produce a small text box with the text
hello which obviously is edit editable
so we can do what we want with them go
back into this so how about if I wanted
to take a variable in PHP and just pop
it into here which later on in
programming you will want to do because
you'll want to say dynamically update
forms and this is a great example to
show you of how to take variables within
PHP and put them straight into forms so
let's have our PHP tags at the top of
the page now already what we're doing is
we're combining PHP with HTML inside the
same document we're still using the PHP
extension for our file however we can
just plainly echo out HTML as you
you seen or not echo out but display
HTML now inside PHP up here I'm just
going to create a new variable called
text remember using the dollar sign and
then our variable name and we're going
to make that equal to hello world now
let's just say this was something that
the user may have submitted or that
something's in a database or something a
bit more useful than some static text
that we've just declared up here now
what happens if I want to pop this value
of this variable inside here now you
basically simply have to start up a PHP
tag you can end your PHP tag just so
you're ready to fill in your content and
all you need to do is you need to echo
out the variable remembering your line
terminator because PHP code is processed
on a line on a one line basis it doesn't
incorporate different lines necessarily
when it's processed as a whole so by
doing this all in one line you're still
producing the same effect as if you were
to do this it would work in exactly the
same way so we can in fact just pull all
this in so it's all on one line and it
just looks a lot neater as well so now
what we do is when we refresh the page
we have the the contents of that
variable input embedded if you like into
a HTML page so these are the basics of
embedding PHP inside HTML</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
