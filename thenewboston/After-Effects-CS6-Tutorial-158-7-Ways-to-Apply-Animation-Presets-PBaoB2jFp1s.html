name is buddy Blackford and this is
another After Effects cs6 tutorial and
in this tutorial I'm going to show you
the many ways you can apply your
animation presets to your whatever
you're using actually so what we're
gonna start out with is just this text
and we're gonna create our own animation
preset from scratch so we can basically
start out and know what we're doing
already
so my animation preset is just gonna be
like a position move
so let's animate the position of this
and I'll just make it go across the
screen a little bit and then I'll do
something like a rotation let's make it
just like turn in or something like that
just like this is good so this is gonna
be our animation preset so I'm gonna
select all my keyframes and properties
and I'm gonna create a new preset out of
it and this is going to be our let's
call this one a test so I know that I
could delete it later so that's our this
is gonna be our preset here now one of
the ways that you can apply the preset
which I have showed you before is by
going into the animation presets section
here twirling down into the user presets
and we'll apply by dragging onto the
text or we can drag onto our layer
either or so now our preset is made and
it uses the position values and the
rotation values from where our current
time indicator was
so that's one way so there are six
different ways as I said before the next
way is to come up here and into our
animation menu and we couldn't go to
recent animation presets and this will
have ones that I've used before or I
have saved and will come here and press
that make sure you have your layer
selected oops that just created on the
side because I didn't have the layer
selected like I was just telling you two
recent animation presets and click on
the one that we just made and there we
go for that now control Z to get that
off make sure I have my layer selected
again and we go to animation and then we
this time we can go to apply animation
preset and pick the one that we want and
hit open and there we go for that now
apply animation preset is good for if
you have some in a different folder and
you need to navigate to that folder so
if you don't save them in the user
presets folder you can navigate to that
different folder that you have so we'll
get out of that we can use the hotkey
which is a lot of different keys it's
got a total of four four keys ctrl alt
shift F is the hotkey so ctrl alt shift
F and then it'll plot that I'll apply
the last animation preset and if you're
on a Mac that's going to be command
option shift F so take those off
and the last way is to come into your
effects and presets menu here and
double-click on the on the effect you
want and it'll automatically apply it on
there and actually I just thought of
another way that you can do it by using
the Adobe bridge application and this
will work if you have your presets saved
in the user presets folder so if we go
to animation up here and go to browse
presets it'll bring up Adobe bridge and
then we've got our presets here we're
gonna have to go to support files and
see if the user presets is in this one
where is usable these are presets is
under my documents so my documents Adobe
After Effects cs6 user presets and then
we've got our presets here that way you
can and double click and it'll add it
that way
but usually Adobe bridge I just use that
if I want to see the the animation
presets that already came with After
Effects because they have like little
previews on them you can see what they
actually are it seems like kind of a
hassle to do it through bridge to just
put on like your own years or preset
wouldn't all you have to do is come over
here and just like double click on it or
something like that so another thing
that I'd kind of like to show you while
doing this here where we're at putting
presets on is I'm just gonna check some
of these and in a preset adds animation
or things like that to your layer it
doesn't replace everything so if I a let
me add an effect on here I'm sure my
layer selected
and I'll add one that I know I haven't
used yet just put on this echo and let's
add our preset the blur and bulge to it
it added the presets on there instead of
overriding the presets that were already
on there so that is a plus and will help
you out when you're using that so there
you go
zombies eat my brains so let's end the
tutorial there it seems good enough you
know how you know all the different ways
well seems there's a total of seven
different ways to add your animation
preset remember that ctrl alt shift F is
the hotkey and I mean that's a pretty
ridiculous hotkey but if you like using
hotkeys like that then go ahead be my
guest so see you guys later in the next
tutorial hope you guys keep on watching
and thumbs up if you liked
see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
