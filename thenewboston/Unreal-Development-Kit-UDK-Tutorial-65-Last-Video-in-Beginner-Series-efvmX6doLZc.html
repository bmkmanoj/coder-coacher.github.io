65th and last tutorial for this UDK
beginner series now before you guys
start freaking out trust me we are
nowhere near finished learning the UDK
we have so much stuff to go over however
every tutorial after this one is going
to be rather advanced so what I wanted
to do on my website is I'm going to
split all these videos up one through 65
in the UDK beginner series and then
instead of making this series like 500
videos long I'm just going to be making
another series that is going to be you
know my intermediate in advanced series
that I'm going to be putting the rest of
the videos in so I just think that's a
better way to organize these videos look
like I said instead of having just one
series that's super long I'm going to be
putting the rest of these videos that I
make in an intermediate and advanced
playlist so trust me guys we are nowhere
near finished learning the UK this is
basically just a way that I can organize
my videos better because like I said
from here on out things are going to get
a little more advanced so if you're
saying alright what exactly are we going
to be learning because a lot of people
have been messaging me and wanting to
know I'm going to be going over things
such as and this is just a few things
physics particle systems I'm going to be
teaching guys how to create user
interfaces I'm going to be teaching you
guys like when you have a character that
we're going to bring in how to animate
him make his arms move walk around jump
and after all of that I'm also going to
be making another series that is called
unreal script now this is pretty much
coding you know how kismet was kind of
like visual coding well unreal script is
unreal custom programming language so
I'm going to be teaching that in another
series so again the plans for the UDK
are I'm going to finish up this series
in this video and then we're going to be
teaching intermediate concepts and
intermediate UDK series and then after
that we're going to be teaching unreal
script and if I have anything to teach
after that it's probably going to be in
advance so anyways I'm out of breath so
that's actually why I made this video I
wanted to explain that but I guess since
we're already here I might as well teach
you guys about you know I might as what
did you guys something since this is a
tutorial so
I know that I told you guys that I was
going to be going over these volumes but
a lot of these volumes kind of have
concepts that go behind them that I
can't really explain now for example
physics volumes I can't teach this
because I didn't teach you guys about
physics yet
level streaming of course we need to
know about level string which is a kind
of a way to optimize your game light
mass deals with lighting basically but I
again so a lot of these volumes the
concepts that go behind it I didn't
teach you guys yet so I can't really go
over all of them in a way that you can
understand however one of the most
common volumes if not the most common
volumes is blocking volume so I guess I
can finish up the series with that
blocking volume is just basically a
volume that deals with collision and we
already know what collision is so let me
go ahead and right-click my Builder
brush and I'm going to set this equal to
512 and 512 and 256 for height looks
pretty good so just go ahead and build
that and now if I pop B and open my
builder brush actually I want to bring
this down right there I'm trying to make
a force field around this object right
here so I'm just going to Center it in
all my hey might as well move my stack
mesh if I need to and right there so
this volume is pretty much surrounding
the static mesh I just want to get
somewhere in the center just I can
demonstrate so now we have to go ahead
and add a blocking volume so if you go
ahead and select your builder brush and
right-click on your volumes just go
ahead and hit blocking volume and it's
going to add a blocking volume so if we
go ahead and slide up our builder brush
or we can just go ahead and hit B to
delete it or excuse me hide it rather
then we can see that we now have a
blocking volume around the static mesh
so we're saying alright so does this
block everything or only vehicles or you
know does it block bullets well in order
to tell it what we want it to block go
ahead and select it and hit f4 this is
going to bring up the properties for
that blocking volume now under collision
this is where we tell it what we want it
to block now no collision
is worthless because if it was no
collision it basically we wouldn't even
had to make a collision whatsoever or
volume so this is pretty much means
anything can get through it
block all blocks everything well I can't
explain it better than that so the two
most common volumes you probably want to
use or excuse me types of collision is
block all which means nothing can get
through it and for this example I'm
going to go ahead and just choose block
all but weapons so what that means is
whenever we play our level our character
is going to bump into it and not be able
to get through it
but it can shoot through it if it wants
to so let me go ahead and hit play from
here and I'll show you guys and let me
go ahead and rebuild my lighting since I
did move that static mesh so I guess
that now I can I was getting cottonmouth
so that's a nice little break from that
but yeah like I said I can't teach you
all these volumes yet because I need to
teach you guys the concepts and once I'm
done teaching the concepts the volumes
will just make sense to you so let me go
ahead and hit play from here and now my
static mesh is lit up remember we have
an invisible force field around the
static mesh now what if we try to run
into it look my user stopping right
there he can't get to that static mesh
because that their invisible boxes
behind it
excuse me around it so now let me go
ahead and try to run into it from this
side not happening Hoss so what I can do
is since I set up block all bo weapons I
can shoot through it and check it out my
weapon still hits it and leaves a mark
right on the aesthetic mesh however it
does block my user from getting to it so
again this isn't really useful and you
probably wouldn't set up a volume that
actually did this because by the way
static meshes already have collision
built into them by default so I just
want to explain you guys what a blocking
volume was because you know it's
probably the most common type of volume
that we were using
I just mumbled it that you're going to
be using so I thought I'd get that out
of the way but anyways that's all I have
for you guys for this story thank you
guys so much for watching and thank you
guys for completing my UDK beginner
series so from now
what you need to do is move on to my UDK
intermediate series to get all the rest
of my videos so again one last time
thank you guys for watching and I trust
me we are nowhere near done learning the
UDK we have so much to look forward to
so with that being said I guess I'll see
you guys in next year's</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
