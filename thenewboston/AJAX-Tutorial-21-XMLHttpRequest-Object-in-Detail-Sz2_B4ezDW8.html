to your 21st ajax tutorial and in these
upcoming videos what i'm going to be
doing is i'm going to be giving you guys
a detailed understanding of the xml
httprequest object now this is the
object that's at the heart of pretty
much every ajax program and before i
showed you guys how to use it you know
pretty much how to set up your functions
but there are a lot of things that I
didn't cover because I wanted to give
you guys a quick taste in now you can
you know maybe look at a program and
figure out how it works but instead of
just you know copying me I want to give
you guys the understanding of why each
piece works because then you know first
of all your brain is going to be
jam-packed with tons of useful
information and you're going to learn
how to create a program that you want to
create from scratch instead of just you
know copying mine so that's what I want
to do and all this program is going to
do is it's going to read a text file and
spit it out on the screen but I'm going
to be going over everything in detail so
this example it's going to look stupid
and you would never use a program like
this on your real website but more
importantly you're going to learn
concepts that are going to make you an
AJAX
pro so let's go ahead and get started so
the first thing I want to do is well of
course I created three files I already
typed all the basic HTML for this one my
JavaScript file has nothing in it in my
text file has nothing in it and by the
way I named them all bacon bacon HTML
bacon JavaScript bacon text so now what
I want to do is explain you guys how
this program is going to work the first
thing we're going to do is we're pretty
much going to go to a website on the
Internet so as soon as we go to the
website we're going to see like okay um
you made it this far so if we see this
then we know that we are connecting or
we are connected to the server we didn't
run any Ajax yet but at least we're
connected to the server so that's why I
want to type that lone line right there
after that let me just go ahead and add
a break and then I'm going to add a div
and this div of course is going to be
where all the cool Ajax stuff is
happening so go ahead and set this ID
equal to the D
and save that so this is basically the
only thing that we need to you know set
up this HTML file so this means we're
connected with a server and this is
going to be where the HX is happening so
right now it's just going to be blank so
actually let me just go ahead and upload
all this crap to my server right now and
if we refresh it we see that they say
that I didn't even freakin up a little
bit
fresh enter okay it's uploaded now now
let's go ahead and refresh and it says
okay you made it this far so as you can
see we are now connected to the server
step 1 freakin complete nice but now
let's go ahead and work with the HX part
because you know that's what we're you
know kind of focused on so in the text
file that we're going to read in this
text file is going to sit on your server
it's just going to say you can have
actually say anything just put like holy
crap or carp whatever this actually
worked so if we see this and guys this
is all you need to type in the text file
just type anything you want if you see
this then our program ran successfully
so of course nothing should show up if I
upload it to the server now we need to
do all that through Ajax so now let's
get to the heart of it spent three and a
half minutes in you know most of it was
just me rambling but now let me go ahead
and teach you guys basically how to set
up every Ajax program and not just how
to set it up but why to set it up the
way you do so the very first thing that
people do and this is kind of you know
not my way but this is standard across
the Ajax community is you want to create
your Ajax object now you just don't go
ahead and set it equal to you know
something and you can't do this because
different browsers create the object in
different ways so go ahead and name your
object I'm just going to name it XML
HTTP
create so basically you name your object
and you set it equal to the function
that's going to return the object for
you so this helps you know clean it up a
little bit helps clean up your code and
organize it properly so create XML HTTP
request object and guys this is
basically the only time you have to
create this function this one time the
rest you can just go ahead and copy and
paste it or if you you know are creating
a big programming you want to use like
like classes or anything you can do it
but anyways that's you know kind of
getting advanced so function and if you
think I'm going to type this all again
you are wrong so the cool thing about
JavaScript is we don't have to
explicitly you know say what return type
and we also don't pass any parameters
because it doesn't need any additional
information so this function is
basically going to be responsible for
creating and returning the xml
httprequest object and remember this is
the object that works in backgrounds
communicate with your computer and the
server so like I said the very first
thing we want to do is we want to create
a localized variable of this so XML HTTP
and this pretty much means that we're
using um the local instead of this
global right here because we want to do
this because this function is going to
work with this and</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
