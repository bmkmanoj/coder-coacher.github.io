programming language to use these stupid
things called arrays we're pretty much
like a list of items other than just
making a simple string type where you
can store a string into and the reason
for that is because you can actually do
really awesome things when you have a
list of items so the first thing I want
to show you guys is just that how to
access an individual item in that list
or the array now in order to do that you
just go ahead and type the name of your
array which is name proper a name
is something else because I'm saying
name like 80 times a second it's
probably confusing but you get the idea
so type the name of your array which is
name and then in the Prag in the
brackets you can type um it's pretty
much the position of the element that
you're looking for and I'll go ahead and
put two now we want to mention this
whenever you create a list or an array
and see or any programming language it
always starts with zero so you would
think that okay arm B is 1 U is 2 so
this is would print out you well
actually it goes B is 0 U is 1 C is 2 so
this little piece of code right here is
actually equal to C so then we can do
something stupid like set it equal to Z
and of course whenever you're using
characters put them in between single
quotes and what this is going to do now
is say ok get the character that's it to
position which is 0 1 2 which is C and
set it equal to Z so now my name is
going to be B you zky so buzz key which
is actually a pretty cool name we think
about it alright so let's just go ahead
and print this out now and see if it
worked
all right so the first one of course the
original thing we wrote is just my name
is Bucky Roberts
simple enough now whenever we changed
the second element in the array and of
course like I said each item in your
array is called an element technically
but up
a say item just because I know it like
makes it sound more like a layman's term
or whatever so of course or replaced it
and it says buzz skew robbers now
another thing I want to teach you guys
how to do is an alternate version of
having to type these manually so what
you can actually do is you can define an
array kind of like you define a variable
you can set its definition earlier and
then you can give it a value later on
now whenever you do that you need to
explicitly say how many bytes of data
you're going to be holding in that array
because whenever your program creates an
array it needs to set aside memory right
then and there so if we define it say
hey take up this much space on the
computer however when we just um define
it and then give a value on the same
line we actually don't need to
explicitly say how many bytes and the
reason for that is this so let's go
ahead and make something else up put
food and I'll set this one equal to tuna
greatest food ever now like I said the
reason that you don't need to explicitly
put five right here is because whenever
it runs this line it can just go ahead
and count the characters for you
so a council says okay store 5.5 bites
bites of tuna anyways and it's going to
store tuna in food so now I'll show you
guys cool little tricks so this line
right here is going to print out tuna
and I'll prove it to you guys nope it
didn't because I put name instead of
food and we actually pretty change this
um best food is tuna
pretty awesome program so far my name is
Bucky Roberts my name is buzz ski
Roberts the best food is tuna gonna sell
this bad boy to Microsoft for millions
now the last thing I want to mention
that I wanted to show you guys is
whenever you want to assign a new arm
string to this array then what you do is
a little bit different than a variable
if it was just a variable you put on the
variable name and set it equal to a new
value or whatever however when you do it
with an array what you have to do is you
need to use a function called STR C P Y
now this is going to take two pieces of
information the first one is it's pretty
much you have to tell it what array do
you want to change well let's just go
ahead and change the food array now put
a comma in the next piece of information
is what string you want to store in this
array now well let's just go ahead and
change it from tuna to bacon so now the
food array equals bacon instead of tuna
so if we print out this line print that
bad boy of course you can see the
original one the best food is tuna and
it changed the best food is bacon
because we switched or pretty much we
gave the array of food a new value so
hopefully you guys understand about
string terminators in how your computer
actually needs to set aside memory and
how we can take advantage of those by
creating arrays and doing some cool
things with arrays so again I know it
was kind of confusing and if you have
any questions ask me I'm going to forum
I can answer you or bunch of people are
also willing to help you so for now
thank you guys for watching and well so
you see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
