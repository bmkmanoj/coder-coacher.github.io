Robertson welcome to your very first
tutorial in html5 now in this tutorial
series what I'm going to be doing is I'm
going to be taking you from a complete
noob in html5 to a seasoned vet teaching
you guys all little tricks all the tips
giving you guys all the information you
need to create awesome websites so for
you guys who are like okay I don't even
know what the heck html5 is well I kind
of just gave it away it's basically a
way where you can create awesome sweet
epic websites so if you're saying okay I
thought I learned about web development
before but maybe not well I want to tell
you guys this if you are completely new
to web development and you never made a
website before then I would highly
recommend you check out my XHTML and CSS
videos and then my JavaScript tutorials
once you do this you're going to be
ready to move on to html5 if you kind of
skip over these and this is the very
first video you're watching on what
development I'm going to be moving kind
of fast and you might get kind of lost
so I just want to tell you guys that
first now if you're like okay what the
heck is all this crap I'll give you guys
a five second introduction XHTML is
basically the core basic elements of a
website it's basically like your
foundation CSS is how you make
everything look pretty at some colors
arrange the pictures nicely and
JavaScript provides functionality
interactivity it lets the user interact
and basically makes your webpage a whole
lot smarter so with the basics with
making it look pretty in by making it
smarter you guys might think okay so
that's basically everything I need to
make an awesome website well html5 is
kind of like an XHTML CSS in JavaScript
burrito it ties all of it together makes
it a whole lot better and it's just
going to take your web development to
the next level so that's what you guys
have to look forward to it's going to be
awesome and amazing so as we can clearly
see from just browsing the web that the
website isn't like it was in like the
1990s it's no longer just static
and information like reading a book
online but it's becoming more
interactive in media based so that's
where we're going to be learning to do
with html5 kind of like I said taking
our websites and web pages to the next
level so before we begin before we start
typing a whole bunch of code I want to
mention a few things we need a couple
tools in order to write html5 the first
tool we need is a text editor now you
already have a text editor probably
already on your computer called notepad
however this is a really dull and boring
and simple one it's not the best so what
I would recommend doing is downloading
this one right here this is called
notepad plus plus if you go ahead and
type that in Google you can find it and
download it for free but this is a text
editor that I would recommend it's the
one I always use and you guys are going
to thank me so much for telling you guys
about this did I mention it's free oh
yeah it's free so aside from a basic
text editor you also need Google Chrome
now that's kind of lie because you can
test your html5 websites in any web
browser but Google Chrome is a web
browser that's always up to date with
the latest html5 stuff so if you're
using Internet Explorer or Firefox then
I would recommend switching over to
Google Chrome because like I said it's
always up to date and aside from that
I'm going to be testing all my sites in
Google Chrome so if you want to follow
along and do exactly like I'm doing then
it's probably best you get the same
tools that I'm using so anyways those
are the two things you need actually
three things you need a text editor you
need a web browser
hopefully Google Chrome and you need
some ambition but hopefully you guys got
out that already so anyways once you are
all set up and ready to go you're ready
to move on to my next tutorial where we
are going to be creating the basic shell
of an html5 website so it's going to be
awesome and amazing thank you guys for
watching don't forget to subscribe and
I'll see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
