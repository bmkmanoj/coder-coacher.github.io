I'm glad you're still the one giving the
orders good luck out there if I find
anything that can help you I'll let you
know we're ready for pickup
Shepherd good work on freedoms progress
the quarians forwarded their findings
from vitos debriefing no new data but
it's a surprising olive branch given our
history you and I have different methods
but I can't argue with your results do
you ever think about playing nice once
in a while diplomacy is great when it
works but difficult when everyone
already perceives you as a threat but
more importantly you confirm the
collectors are behind the abductions
why do I get the feeling you knew about
them already I had my suspicions but I
needed proof the collectors are
enigmatic at best they periodically
travel to the terminus systems looking
to gather seemingly unimportant items or
specimens usually in exchange for their
technology when their transactions are
complete they disappear as quickly as
they arrived back beyond the unmapped
omega for relay until now we've had no
evidence of direct aggression by the
collectors why is the Omega for relay on
man what do we know about it only that
no ship passing through it has ever
returned our best guess is that the
relay reacts differently to collect our
vessels allowing them safe passage if
they can manipulate relays that's just
further evidence of the connection with
the Reapers the collectors are
definitely a human enemy but how do we
know there's a connection to the Reapers
their focus shifted to humanity only
after you and the human fleet destroyed
sovereign the abductions are related
even if the Alliance and the council
refused to believe it I won't wait until
the Reapers are on the march we need to
take the fight to them if this is a war
I'll need an army or a really good team
I've already compiled a list of soldiers
scientists and mercenaries you'll get
dossiers on the best of them finding
them and convincing them to work with
you could be challenging but you're a
natural leader I'll continue to track
the collectors when they make their next
appearance I'll notify you and your team
be ready keep your list I want people I
trust the ones who helped me stop Sarah
to the game that was two years ago
commander most of them have moved on or
their allegiances have changed whereas
garrus vakarian the turian disappeared a
few months after you were declared dead
even we haven't been able to locate him
where's liara t'soni she's on ileum my
sources say that she's working for the
shadow broker if so she can't be trusted
where's Ashley Williams she's still with
the Alliance promoted I believe her file
is surprisingly well classified what
about tally she already helped us on
freedoms progress that was unexpected I
need more Intel before I'll commit okay
I get it they're not available you're a
leader Shepherd you'll get who you need
you worry about the collectors I'll make
sure my teams ready good two things
before you go first head to Omega and
find mordin solus he's a brilliant
solarium scientist our intelligence
suggests he may know how to counteract
the collectors paralyzing seeker swarms
sounds good what else I found a pilot I
think you might like I hear he's one of
the best someone you can trust
hey commander just like old times huh I
can't believe it's you Joker look who's
talking I saw you get space got lucky
with a lot of strings attached how did
you get here it all fell apart without
you commander everything you stirred up
the council just wanted it gone team was
broken up record sealed and I was
grounded the Alliance took away the one
thing that mattered to me hell yeah i
joined severus you really trust the
Illusive man why don't trust anyone who
makes more than I do but they aren't all
bad saved your life let me fly
it's good to be home huh commander I
guess we'll have to give her a name</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
