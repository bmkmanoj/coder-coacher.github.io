video and in this video I want to talk
to you guys about a couple more physics
vocabulary words specifically work and
power because my guess is that you may
have different definitions fro or excuse
me for working power than scientists do
so whenever you may talk about work you
might talk about what you did during the
day to earn a little extra cash but
physicists say that work is actually
equal to force times displacement
interesting and you may measure how much
work you do by how much your paycheck is
but they actually measure it in a unit
called a Joule so they say that one
Joule is equal to a unit of force in
this case one Newton times the unit for
displacement they chose is a meter so if
you took an object and you moved it one
meter with a force of one Newton then
that would mean you did one Joule of
work so let's go ahead and take a look
at a real quick slightly better example
say that you have a big brick and that
was sitting on the ground but you
decided to lift it up and you lifted it
up I don't know two meters now how much
force was needed to lift this brick up
whoa a force of five Newtons we
calculated so again if you lifted a
brick up off the ground two meters with
a force of five Newtons then when you
multiply those together you would figure
out that you did ten joules of work how
awesome is that now hello okay take a
deep breath Bucky concentrate how
awesome is that now you can brag not
only about how much work you did but you
can also throw some physics into there
so that's what work is simple enough now
let's go ahead and talk about power now
scientists say that power is the work
done divided by the time it took to do
it so whenever you talk about power they
use P and of course work over the time
it took to do it and we symbolize time
with a lowercase T and mighty looks a
little bit weird so I'm going to draw
again T so power equal equals work and
we already know what work is overtime
now power is actually measured in
something called watts so W a T TS now
you hear watts a lot a lot when you're
talking about electricity and especially
lightbulbs so what exactly is a wah well
one watt equals a Joule which is the
unit they chose for work and their
favorite unit of time is a second so
let's go ahead and take a look at this
and actually I'm running out of space
right here so I'm going to put on a new
slide so let's say that okay let me just
draw a ground right here and you have a
big block this time and I'm going to say
that this block is cheese because I wish
I had a big block of cheese right now
now what you did is you got bored one
day so you decided to push this block of
cheese here's you used a little arm
pushing it you decided to push this
block of cheese um I don't know let's
say that you pushed it a total distance
of 16 meters and I guess we don't even
need that so you push this block of
cheese a distance of 16 meters why I
don't know you're kind of weird you do
weird stuff sometimes now how hard was
it to push this block of cheese well it
was so difficult that you actually use
the force of 20 Newtons that is a lot of
force you must have some muscles there
and how long did it take you to move
from point A to point B well the block
of cheese was like way over here 16
meters away but you're pretty quick and
moving cheese so you did it in 8 seconds
so what we want to do now is we want to
figure out how much power it takes to
move a block of cheese 16 meters when
you use a force of 20 Newtons and it
takes 8 seconds well let's go ahead and
think of what we know already we already
know that power equals work overtime
however
we do know that work equals Force Times
displacement so before we can calculate
the power we first need to calculate the
work now since we don't have this work
right here because we have distance
force and seconds we need to calculate
that so let's just go ahead and
substitute this W right here for what
work is equal to in other words force
times displacement so in other words
power not only equals work overtime but
power is also equal to force times
displacement over time it's pretty much
the same exact things except we
substitute force times displacement for
work so let's go ahead and figure out
that right now using this final formula
we can say that the power what you're
trying to figure out equals force of 20
Newtons times displacement which is how
far did you move it 16 meters over a
total time of 8 seconds so now if we go
ahead and run some calculations 20 times
16 and I'm going to throw ahead and go
ahead and throw it my units right now
power equals 20 times 16 which is if I'm
correct 320 over 8 seconds I'll just go
ahead and write 8 right now so since we
use the correct units of Newton meters
and seconds we're going to end up with
the unit of power which is watts in 320
divided by 8 gives you a final power of
40 watts so fun fact whenever you move a
brick of cheese with a force of 20 moves
and you move a distance of 16 meters and
it takes you eight seconds you do 40
watts of power how is this useful why
would you ever need to calculate this
what is the purpose of this at all well
in the next couple tutorials I'm going
to show you guys some useful
applications other than you know just
calculating how hard people work
whenever they move cheese and I'm going
to show you guys how to use these
formulas in a useful manner but for now
that's all you guys get hopefully you'll
understand the concept and the
difference between power work and all
that good stuff so thank you guys for
watching
and I'll see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
