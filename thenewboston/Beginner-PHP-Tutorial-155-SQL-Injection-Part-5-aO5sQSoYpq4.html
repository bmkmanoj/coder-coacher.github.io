we project again protect against this
let's turn magic quotes off and save our
PHP dot ini file and come into our xampp
control panel and restart apache once
more okay so let's now refresh and cause
this SQL injection okay so we've caused
the SQL injection once again now what we
need to do is think of another way that
we can protect against SQL injection so
if magic quotes by default is on I also
recommend you take this next step in
order to secure the variables that you
pass into your into your query string or
into your query itself so what we can do
is we can use a function called MySQL
real escape string now what this does is
it acts very much like the magic quotes
and it turns in it and it escapes
specific characters I'm not sure what
characters in particular it does escape
but it does escape single quotation
marks and I think apostrophes as well so
let's go ahead and in cap enclose our
username and password variables in this
function so to do this we need to end
our output and concatenate on our
variable so you should be comfortable
with doing this we're just ending the
output concatenate on the variable
concatenate in the end of the output on
there so now what we can do is we have
room to say MySQL real escape string and
we can enclose the username variable in
that and MySQL real escape string and we
can clean close this password variable
in that as well so now although we have
magic quotes turned off and last time we
refresh the page we have this login
success because of the SQL injection now
let's refresh again and click continue
and you can see it says invalid username
password combination so we haven't
actually escaped the form data that's
been sent
but what we have done is inside of our
query we've escaped this data so let's
go ahead and echo out the query so we
can see what's going on here
okay so let's refresh and continue so
what we've got is we've got select ID
from users where username equals and now
you can see that this function has
escaped these characters here so even
though it's not escaped the post data
its escaped it inside of our query so
it's highly recommended problem that you
have magic quotes GPC on and you also
use this MySQL real escape string now
there's another problem with our code
let's just under scape these and we'll
return to our original state of this
okay so let's go ahead and not echo this
query out and we'll refresh ok so we're
back to the state that we have SQL
injection possible now what we're going
to do is we're going to make a small
modification to how we check the number
of rows in our database so now at the
moment we've got if MySQL num rows query
run run a greater than or equal to one
then then we say login success now we
can make a small change here and because
we're saying greater than or equal to
one remember earlier when we looked
inside and we performed an SQL query and
on in here we perform the query and the
same query let's copy and paste that so
we can put it into here so we're
performing this query but what we're
doing now is we are saying equal to this
or this equals this and we're doing
exactly the same for password by sewing
this or this equals this okay so let's
copy and paste that so we can use it
later let's go so what you can see here
is we've returned two rows because this
query will actually the way we've
structured it we've returned two rows so
now what's going to happen
inside of this we're going we're
checking for greater than or equal to
one row returned so what happens if we
just check for one row being returned
then in this case of this this query
this is why you can't apply this rule to
every query because you may be doing
different checks inside your program so
with specific regard for my program just
changing this operator to is equal to we
have to return only one row for login to
succeed because the nature of our
database is that we're only ever going
to return one row if the username and
password match because we're never going
to have the same username in our
database because the way we program our
user systems you never find that on
websites you have the same username
twice so therefore this will never ever
return more than one row if if done
properly so now just by changing this to
equals one we can see that by refreshing
because we've returned two rows it
doesn't equal to one therefore it's an
invalid username and password
combination however when we supply it
with the correct data we return one row
and we have a login success so combining
these three I mean this ones are loosely
related to my design
only so by using a MySQL real escape
string when passing variables through to
a query that's being executed within PHP
so MySQL real escape string on that one
as well by doing that by making sure you
make the relevant checks inside once
you've made your query and also changing
this magic quote GPC to on rather than
off and by using a combination of or the
majority of these methods and there are
other methods so you can go away and
research here but hopefully you've taken
away from this that doing all these
three things can somewhat protect you
against SQL injection</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
