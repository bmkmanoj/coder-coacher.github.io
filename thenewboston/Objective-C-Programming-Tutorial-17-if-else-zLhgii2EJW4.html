welcome to your 17th program tutorial I
think it's a 17th and you know I never
know what to toriel it is but anyways I
got my air conditioner on so I'm in a
good mood I'm ready to make tutorials
now and in this tutorial we're gonna be
going over a decision making now one
cool thing about programming is every
computer program that we're gonna build
has the potential to make decisions so
it does this using a special statement
called the if statement and how this
works is you give it a statement that
can either be true or false if it's true
it runs a bit of code if it false got a
cheeseburger and my teeth if it's false
it either runs another bit of code or it
doesn't do anything at all so let me
give you guys an example and then it'll
all make sense eeeh trust me so say
you're making a dating website yeah
that's what we're gonna do
so I'm see what time it is so say we
have the first person in will say we
have this girl Hannah and she's 15 and
say we have another person maybe their
perfect match maybe not so we have
Hannah who's 15 that's a variable we
have in Tim who is let's say 37 so we
have two variables right now one for
each person on our website and our boss
comes and he's like alright I want you
to check to make sure the girl is
younger than the guy say we say alright
let me use my new syntax that I'm about
to learn to make this happen
what you need to do is there's a special
key word in objective-c code if and as
you can see the outline right here you
put if and right after it in parentheses
you write the condition in the condition
is what do you want to test for so let's
go ahead and write parentheses in right
all right if Tim is less than Hannah so
if the guy is less than girl actually
let's go ahead and write this
if Hana is the girl is less than the guy
what do you want to happen
well now you give a statement so NS log
yeah just put like game time so if the
girl is less than the guy then it's good
to go even though in this situation 1537
I should probably write something else
but for now let me just build this and
show you guys what happens save all and
it says game time right here so in this
situation what happens well you give
your computer a test using the if
statement and this is a um condition
which could be either true or false
Hana is less than Tim since that
statement is true or since that
condition is true the statement after it
executes so fully now let's go ahead and
change this up a bit
if Tim is less than Hana let's go ahead
and build and run this save all and now
you see running zero nothing happened so
in this case scenario Tim was greater
than Hana so this evaluated is false so
that's why this didn't run so this is a
really basic way of using the if
statement to give it a test and if the
test is true you output a bit of code
but if the test is false then nothing
happens but there are certain situations
where you're gonna say all right I'm
gonna give you a test if it's true I
want you to do this if it's false I just
don't want you to quit working I want
you to do something else so that gives
you a little bit more freedom so let's
go ahead and do that so let's go ahead
and change this if Hana is less than Tim
let's change this to something a little
more appropriate 27 I mean it won't
matter but you know it just makes me
feel better inside all right so if Hana
is indeed less than Tim we want you to
say game time now
if Hana is greater than Tim instead of
just quitting the program altogether
we're gonna give you another option this
is called the else statement and what
the else statement is is it's this if
this first test evaluates is true run
this but if evaluates is false then
instead of just going on we're going to
give you something else to run right
here so in essence either this statement
or this statement that we didn't make it
is going to run there is no possible way
that both this statement can be true and
false really there is it unless you're
like what is life
is it true hmm true or false
don't know anyways I'm just kidding
don't even that probably just confused
there so let's go ahead and do this NS
log that's very something not funny here
and that's not funny
computer errors are not funny so if Hana
is less than Tim then right game time
but if the guy is older than right no
way old man
easy enough so let's go ahead and build
and run this and we'll give it both
situations do what happen
it says game time and why does this
happen because it said re I'm gonna test
this since Hamma is indeed lesson Tim
I'm gonna output game time but let's
switch this up a little bit using a
greater than sign
if Hana is greater than Tim dude game
time and since this is false then it
says all right
so this this is false I'm gonna run the
code in the else statement and say no
way old man so let's run this save it
and now you see no way old man
so one last time let me explain you guys
what is happening right here you give it
a simple test right after the if and it
can either be true or false if it's true
then it's going to run this if it's
false it's going to run your else and by
the way these little brackets anytime
you'll have one line of code you don't
need these brackets even though they are
optional with the only one
but most people prefer not to have them
for example if you delete these brackets
your program is still gonna build and
run fine just like that no way old man
the thing is whenever you have more than
one line of code say you want to output
three things control V control V let me
make that nice and neat
you need these curly braces and what
this means is a block of code so let's
say if Hannah is less than Tim you're
gonna write like game time go get her
and she's single that might be something
you have on dating website so now if we
build and run this that way you can
output more than one line of code so
pretty cool right there and so again
just to make that point clear whenever
you have more than one statement you
want brackets if you only have one it's
optional or not you know just to be safe
put brackets all the time and then you
won't even get confused about that but
check this out if you have three
statements right there without your
brackets and then when you try to save
it and run it it's gonna say failed
right here
epic fail I'm gonna send that to fail
blog right now but anyways the basics I
want to teach you guys is if the if
statement and you give it a test if it's
true do what's under if if it's false do
us honor the else so in the next
tutorial I'll build a program that
actually makes sense
and is a little bit more useful than
just this makeshift dating website that
we made but for now thank you guys for
watching you go ahead and make your own
dating websites and I'm gonna go ahead
and watch Dateline to catch a predator
so again thank you guys one last time
