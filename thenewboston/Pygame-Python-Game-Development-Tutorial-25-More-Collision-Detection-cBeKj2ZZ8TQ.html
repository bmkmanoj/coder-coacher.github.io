video for a pro game series I'm just
going to hop right into it we're right
in this if statement and the question is
if we've got so far if the X is
basically that lead X so if we've got
crossover not in this sense but you know
if the snake is actually over here we've
got that covered so if the snake is
crossing the Apple like this we've got
that covered but if the snake continues
on this path going down we don't have
that that covered so now we want to
cover that and it has to be an or so so
this line you should already have I'm
going to now append and or here and
we're going to keep coding so it's going
to go right off the screen so I'm going
to move over a little bit and so we've
got or and now the question is if the
other side of the snake is is grazing
the Apple so this would be or lead
underscore x+ and how do we get the
other side well just like we got the
other side of the Apple the other side
of the snake edge is just lead X plus
block size because that's the width of
our snake let me turn off Skype for you
that's the width of our snake so or lead
X + block size um and then we ask sort
of ish the same same grouping of
statements here so if lead X + block
size is greater than R and Apple X and
then and it has to so it's greater than
the the left side of the the apples so
now we're at we're posing the question
if the snake is over here crossing over
is this part of the snake greater what
we just typed is if it's greater than
this point here so if it's greater than
that and now we're going to ask if it's
less than this point here so if or lead
x + block size is greater than R and
about X and it has to be ants both of
these conditions must be met
and lead underscore x+ block sighs
whoops not a capitalist block size is
less than R and Apple X plus I think its
capital a Apple thickness so the other
side of the Apple so if that's the case
we have some sort of X overlap inch
happening right and that's it for our if
statement um the let me go back to that
just in case somebody wasn't caught up
and I will make the font slightly
smaller just for anybody who wants to
see it got most of it so we've got this
for this this part was from the previous
video and then here we've got a lead X
and basically that was all the stuff we
just coded now so that and pause it here
if you want it so I'm not gonna hang
here for long now now that we finished
that the next that's X cross over
so let me configure it I'll make it big
again so we can all see what I'm typing
now let's go ahead and run that and
we'll just we'll just have it print um X
cross over here will seem to run that
and let's see I'll put this and this
over here so we'll see some printouts
here as the exit hopefully has new X's
cross over so so basically we saw
there's a bunch of X cross over like
this that's about that's all pasting X
cross overs on us which is to be
expected because we are having X cross
over so that's why we now have to do y
cross over basically the entire the flip
side of everything we just wrote so the
Y statement is going to be very very
similar to the X statement that we just
wrote so now the question is if our Y's
are in between so we would say if lead
underscore Y is greater than R and Apple
a so if that Y is greater than so like
that's basically this exact verbatim
just for why so if that's the case and
lead underscore why is less than R and
Apple y plus apple thickness again
verbatim for this line here we could
have copy and paste and just replace the
letters then we've we've definitely got
some cross over there but that's not the
full thing we can do the rest of the or
statement now just to show you two ways
of writing this I'm going to instead of
using Oregon and going way off the
screen I'll show you with an elephant
just in case I know other people might
have different they might like doing it
one way or the other so that's fine I'll
show the other way as well so if that is
the case we would say uh print Y cross
over actually we'll say x and y cross
over and then we're going to just
comment out this X cross over because
that's just going to make a lot of spam
so if this is already the case then this
if statement will run but this doesn't
cover everything because remember we
have this the other side of this or
statement that we have for X before so
we still need to write that and we're at
this time we're going to write it in L
if statement but we'll do that in the
next video so stay tuned for that thanks
