you guys how to add images and icons to
your GUI of course images your going to
add those whenever I don't know you want
to display image happens all the time
and icons you're actually all over more
than you realize
see all these right here you always see
the little printer icon the Save icon
all these crap right here these are
actually icons so even this logo
probably going to want to splatter your
logo all around so let's go ahead and uh
well let's get started so I just have a
couple images here I'm going to use ping
and make sure that you drag them in the
same directory that your main Python
file is and if not you can just saw I
know it's just easier that way for this
tutorial but if not you can just you
know change the file path up whatever so
go ahead and make your object name since
this is a photo of my face actually show
it to you guys this is a photo that I'm
going to be using this guy is
good-looking
oh my handsome McGee all right so take
your object I'm going to call a photo
and set it equal to photo image now in
here the parameter is file this is
probably the easiest soro ever and set
it equal to the name or a file path now
since this is in the same directory I
don't need to add any weird for folders
and just put my face ping and now I have
this file basically stored in the object
photo now here's the thing I guess this
isn't the easiest story lover
you just can't display photos in your
GUI with Kinser what you need to do is
you need to set them in side a label so
you take the photo you put it in a label
and we already know with a label you can
just place it anywhere like any other
widget so for a label set this equal to
if you forgot is actually from the first
story so refresh your memory label now
of course your label you can stick in
your route which is your main window
and another parameter that you can add
the label is this you can set image
equal to and then give it an image
object which mine is photo so I know
that this is kind of a weird way of
doing it you might think okay might as
well just throw this photo right in my
route but you can't you need to set this
photo equal to a label and then what you
can do is place that label in your
window and it's essentially the same
thing
so now the only thing we have left to do
is of course if we wanted to show up on
the screen
pack it in so we'll just position it
wherever it decides to go run this and
check it out so that is how you use
photos and graphics pretty sweet and
also I want to show you guys this thing
I actually have this uh like a little
advertising network on my website and
I'm always like trying different ads I
actually tried like um just a green box
just a green box with no images or
anything and just said click and I tried
a red box that said don't click and I
ran them for like ten thousand
impressions and for some reason people
want to click the red one that says
don't click like five times more than
the green one but I'll show you guys
what my most successful ad was why this
is I have no idea well let me run it
real quick it's this thing right here so
pretty much if you have any stupid image
and I just have a random image of I
think this is Tom Hanks like sweating or
I don't know what he's doing I hope you
still like working now not to another he
looks like he's doing but here's a
little key for advertising take any
image surround it with a red border and
put one of those little finger icons in
there for some reason it gets people to
look at it and click it so why this
happens I have no idea but you know this
isn't like part of the tutorial or
anything I just want to show you guys a
nice little tidbit of information that I
learned so if any advertiser advertising
experts out there please explain why
people want to click
that stupid thing but for now I thank
you guys for watching don't forget to
subscribe and I'll see you guys in the
next story</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
