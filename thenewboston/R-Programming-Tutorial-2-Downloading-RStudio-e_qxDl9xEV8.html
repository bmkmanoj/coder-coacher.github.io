tutorial and in this video as promised
I'm going to be teaching you guys not
really teaching you guys showing you
guys how to download our studio the
program that we're going to be using
that I promised you guys was incredibly
cool so the cool thing about this is not
only is it an awesome IDE for
programming art and building cool charts
and graphs but it's free
boom roasted how awesome is that so of
course here's the homepage right here if
you just click download our studio of
course we want the desktop version there
are different versions on that you can
pay for like this one commercial license
and of course that's if you're going to
be like making software that you're
going to sell but for now let's just go
ahead and download the our studio
desktop and what do we want alright
these are the installers and just go
ahead and pick your operating system I
am running Windows 7 so click that and
now this is downloading and no time to
tell a story thank God because it was
probably going to be awful alright so
once this is downloaded it's just
executable you can go ahead and double
click it and just hit yes and of course
this is also an incredibly easy
installation pretty much stick with the
defaults next next care everything looks
good install wow this is going to take a
while ok storytime one now
okay so the other night I went out and I
got chicken wings and I usually get
barbecue but they usually just dump a
whole thing of barbecue in it so I
decided to get hot instead because
they're less saucy and then I got an
eyelash in my contact so I had to wash
my hands real quick and then I had to uh
let's just go ahead and finish this and
then what I did is I didn't get all the
hot sauce so I was like fiddling around
with my contact and I basically got hot
sauce in my eye so awful story but hey
we now have our studio downloaded so if
you go into your programs you can see
our studio folder right here and if you
click this you see our studio and
uninstall what we wanted to do is we
want to put an icon of this on the
desktop so if you right click it and put
where yet we're yet send to desktop what
it's going to do is is going to create a
shortcut actually like to rearrange
everything so you know all my programs
are in one space and folders are in
another but anyways we now have our
studio installed so double click that
and sorry you guys can't look at a Megan
Fox anymore and check it out this is it
our studio so um I'm pretty much I think
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
show you guys different parts of this as
we need them because if I just you know
start talking you guys about um
different kinds of packages we can
install you're like what the heck is a
you know lattice graphics I don't even
know lettuce graphics what is this who
freaking knows so instead of just
overwhelming you guys and talking to
guys about every detail of the interface
I'll show you guys the things as we need
them and it'll make sense it'll be a lot
easier and fun or to learn as well or
more fun however you say it so uh thank
you guys for watching and we can
subscribe and in the next video we're
actually going to be getting our hands
dirty and seen with this bad boy can do</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
