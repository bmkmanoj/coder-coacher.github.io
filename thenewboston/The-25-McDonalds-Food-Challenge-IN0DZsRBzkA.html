the $25 McDonald's challenge where my
buddy Gerard here is attempting to eat
$25 worth of McDonald's food here's what
we got on the lineup we got as you can
see there's a total 25 28
we got five piece chicken meal ten
McNuggets one Big Mac a double
quarter-pounder with cheese meal a
double cheese beer and four medium and
as you see he's getting started right
now and how we'll be filming and the bet
is if he can eat this then I have to
give him a 100 dollars but if he is
unsuccessful then he has to pay me $100
so Gerard good luck
