another PI game tutorial video in this
video we're gonna be building on what we
started in the last one and that is
making these buttons in our game intro
so right now all we have are these
rectangles that are filled in with the
colors and now we want to put text on
the rectangles so how might we do that
well I propose that we make another
function that is basically a text to
button function and that function is
going to allow us to put text in the
location of whatever that button happens
to be so I'm just gonna come down here
and basically what I like to do a lot I
think we did it in one of the previous
videos but when I I know I need to make
a function for something I try to work
backwards so how do I want that function
to work well I want that function to
work the following way so we would say
text to button then that's like the
function name right and then what text
do we want to go to that button play
what color do we want that text to be
black and then we specify the location
of the button so in our in our case the
location is basically 150 500 150 so
I'll just copy that and paste that okay
so let's just say that that is pretty
much how we want that function to work
so we want to take the word play and
make it black and put it in this
location so how might we do that well
let's go back up to the top and we'll
put it right underneath text objects
let's put it right here and we're gonna
say define text to button like that and
let me scroll down a little bit and
we've got our parameters so if you
recall we had the message whatever the
message was then we had color and then
we have basically the buttons X Y width
and height so got but in X button
y but in width
and but in height and then actually we
want another parameter and that'll be
like the size of the text so for now
we'll just make it a default of size
equals small that way like if you had a
huge button you could specify a larger
font size but otherwise it'll just be
small so that's easy enough the next
thing we want to do is we basically do
the same thing that we didn't here right
message to screen so we'll come here and
we'll just say text surf and then text
rect and that's gonna equal texts
objects and really that's all the same
so I'm just gonna copy and paste that
 that earlier obvious color size and
then this part will change this will be
a text Rex
dot Center equals and this Center is
gonna be slightly different but it's
gonna be basically button X plus button
width divided by two that's gonna be the
X location of the center and then button
Y plus button height divided by two so
this might be a area of confusion for
some so let me go ahead and well first
of all hold on okay so the text wrecked
at center is basically saying where is
the center of the text rectangle so
you've got our button right and we want
to Center the text on that button so how
do we find the center of that button
well first you want to have the like say
button X right is that top left corner
so that's the button X and then how do
we find the center of that well we find
the center of that by saying okay well
we know what the button X is we know how
wide the button is so then to find the
center of it it's just X plus half of
the width boom you have the center same
thing with button height so to find the
Y's
on the button we take the button why and
then we add the button height so that
much but then we divide that much by two
and then we find the center and so that
will be the center of our rectangle and
then finally we're just going to blitt
this and we can do that with this line
right here so I'm going to copy and
paste that line so game display dot blit
text surface text rectangle and that
will or should put the text or button so
let's go ahead and test that really
quick there we go so now you see we have
play on the center of our button so we
can close out of this close out of this
and now we can go ahead and add the
other phrases here so we've got play I'm
just gonna copy this paste paste play
we've got controls and then we have quit
and then all of them are black but then
controls is this yellow one so these
this is the location for controls paste
and then this will be the location for
quit paste save and run it now and now
you can see that we've got you know play
controls and quit obviously the buttons
still don't work I mean we can click the
hell out of them nothing happens but
we've got now some boxes some words on
them if they're starting to look like a
button so we still want to make them
somewhat responsive to the mouse rolling
over them then obviously they need to be
clickable so that's what we're gonna be
working on in the coming videos so stay
tuned for that as always a thanks for
