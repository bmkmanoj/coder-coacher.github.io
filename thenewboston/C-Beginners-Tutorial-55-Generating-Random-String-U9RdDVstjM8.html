tutorial when I'm making for the New
Boston and in this tutorial I'll be
showing you how to generate a random
string so all you're going to need for
this tutorial is about once you have
done I informed just double click on it
so the first step in creating a random
string is creating a character array
that will hold all the possible
characters that will be in your string
for example if you wanted to have your
random string only be letters well then
you create a character array that would
have all the letters of the output in it
you want to numbers and letters and you
just have a character array that will
hold all letters and numbers so to get
started here we're some free character
array and we'll just call letters and
our random string will only have letters
in it and then we're going to study go
to a string mail contain all the letters
of the alphabet then we will use the two
character array method to convert into a
character right easiest way to type out
all the character all the letters of the
alphabet is to just go straight across
your keyboard and hit every letter since
lick and then it doesn't really matter
what order they're in so just do that so
it's gonna go I just want right across
on keyboard and now even though it
really doesn't look like it since
they're out of order I have all the
letters of the alphabet and now we're
just going to use the true care of your
array method and now this will convert
it into a character so now this letters
character array has all the letters of
the alphabet now obviously we're going
to need to be using a random class here
so it's going to do random I'm just
going to call it R will study equal to a
new entities of the random calls and
basically what we're going to be doing
is using this random class to generate a
random number that will then be the
index of the character array that are
going to use it for example to generate
a random number and then we get the
character that is in that element
end up with a random character so if
we're to go right here and just do you
just get a random character I'm just
playing it in the message box to them do
that so we could do like we'll just do
like the letters and then we'll use off
brackets to access an element in that
array and then we're going to our dot
next shift to generate or random index
and then since there are 25 care if
you're not there are 26 characters in
the alphabet we're going to set the
minimum to be 0 and then the maximum to
be 25 and then we're gonna a closing
bracket on laughs and now just give the
to string method to convert into a
string so basically what this would do
here is it will generate a random number
that will then be the index of this
letters array so if we get to a random
index let's say it's like - well it'd be
0 1 2 and again it was up the generator
the - so see it just generates a random
character and then we should just get
that in a string so we'll get on one
character string that will be random see
that age so see it's random and then
you're saying well how do I make a
string well what you can do is you can
use a for statement to loop through this
code right here and just add it into a
string so pretty girl right here just
come for stated and then we're going to
say is less than 10 because we want to
loop through 10 times and then we'll
this thing alright so now what we're
going to do is we're just going to
create a string or a to add the random
character - so it's going to be string
let's call it random
all right so now to do a random string
plus equals so we'll be adding a
character each time and then we'll be
doing letters and then we'll just be
getting a random character so let's do
our next again 0 &amp;amp; 5 so they'll just get
on any random one in here it's weird
that it is strange
so basically what this will do is it
will loop through this code ten times so
we'll just be getting a random letter
and then adding it to this string now
we're going to display in the message
box and make sure that it actually got a
random string all right so now every
time we click this button we should get
a 10 character lon
random string yep and they're different
each time and if you wanted to add
numbers to this all you would have to do
is just add all the numbers to this and
since we're adding 10 more characters
and add 10 to this so link is 35 instead
of 25 and now we should get a random
string of characters turning with
letters and numbers if we got three in
there again 1 5 9 or 8 in there so yep
that's pretty much it for this tutorial
on generating a random string so see you
