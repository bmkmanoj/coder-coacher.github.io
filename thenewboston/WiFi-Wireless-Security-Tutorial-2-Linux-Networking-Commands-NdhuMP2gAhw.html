into the really awesome tools what I
want to do is I just want to go over
some really basic Linux commands related
to networking so now all the other Linux
commands like changing directories and
stuff specifically a tool called if'
config now this is a tool that lets you
view and configure your network
interfaces in other words all the cards
that allow you to get online on the
internet now I'm going to hit enter and
I'll talk to you guys about the setup
I'm on right now so I'm on pretty much
just like a normal laptop in I'm in my
back room and I have an Ethernet cable
plugged into the side so that's one way
took him up to the Internet and this a
laptop it also came with a wireless card
but it was kind of crappy so I bought
another one the one I showed you in the
last video off of Amazon so now that you
guys know about this you can probably
understand a little bit more clearly
what you're looking at so all of the
devices put on how come I always
coughing write tutorials I never coughed
and then as soon as I start filming
immediately good whooping cough it's
weird
anyways you can see the names of the
devices on the left so this is my
Ethernet that's where it's plugged into
and a little more information about each
card is on the right-hand side this one
right here is not an actual interface or
not physical interface in the sense that
you can't hold it in your hand
it's a loopback interface and this is
just saying that whenever you type in
127.0.0.1 then it's your own computer
it's a localhost so if you guys you know
try to open your computer and try to
look for this you're not going to find
it this one like I said this is the one
that was pre-installed came with my
laptop and this is the good one so
that's the one that we're going to be
using for most of this tutorial and all
of these other interfaces we really
aren't going to worry about another
thing I want to mention is whenever
you're looking at this information you
really are only gonna probably need
these top four lines right here these
button four I don't want to say that
they're not important but you really
don't
them that much this top four line lines
of info this is where all your MAC
addresses and you know your IP address
you can see if your card is up or down
and I'll talk to you guys in detail
about what that means later on but there
you go now let me clear out of here and
another thing I want to show you guys is
this so what we just looked at is
ifconfig there's also an optional
parameter called ifconfig a so I have
config the normal one that we saw before
it's going to show you all your active
interfaces now if you throw that - a in
there it's going to show you your
interfaces whether they're active or not
so if you know you have a card but you
can't see it that's because it's not
active and you need that - a - the exact
same because all my interfaces are
active I just want to mention that in
case you guys have any trouble now you
saw whenever I typed ifconfig then I
listed all my interfaces however during
these tutorials like I said we really
don't care about most of those so what
I'm going to be doing is something like
this I have config W LAN one so if you
run this command then it just helps
clean up the clutter and it only shows
you information about W LAN one which is
the main wireless card that we're going
to be using now if you ever just want to
bring an interface up or down and that
means whenever you're bringing an
interface up it means that it's enabled
in other words it can now send and
receive info and get online pretty much
so if I type ifconfig you can see that
these are all up right now so you can
tell by this keyword right here if you
see up then it's up it's working it's
enabled if you ever want to bring one
down for any reason let's say we want to
disable this Ethernet then what we can
do is I've config if I say etho but it's
actually easy row down
so now if I do ifconfig again you can
see that all right
it is indeed down so let me bring that
back up I have config in boom look at
that back up so there you go that's how
you bring interfaces up or down enable
them or disable them now of a couple
other things actually want to show you
guys is if you ever want to change any
of the settings for a specific card then
what you can do is this so I have config
let's say we want to change the IP
address of e0 my ethernet card all you
have to do is type that and then type in
the new IP address so we'll 192.168 v
dot you know whatever you want it to be
and you can actually I'll show you this
too if you want to change your MAC
address then you type H of you ether and
then your new Mac dress whatever you
want if you're running all right I have
you know some basic networking knowledge
and I know that my MAC address is
already brought burnt into my card my IP
address gets assigned to me through DHCP
so pretty much whenever I go to
someone's house and get on their Wi-Fi I
automatically get a new IP address so
why would I ever want to assign one
myself well what we can do is say that
we got hired by some company to you know
find vulnerabilities with our Wi-Fi
network now we try to connect our laptop
to attack it
however we were firewall doubt so that
means their network says you know what
only certain devices are allowed the
CEOs you know the janitors and the
secretary now the way it verifies that
is by IP address so what we can do is we
can just view their IP address and then
change ours to theirs same thing with
MAC address and it's called IP spoofing
Mac spoofing and it gets a lot more
detailed than that but it's you pretty
much can change it to pretend to be
someone else or just for anonymity if
you want to you know how
the identity of your computer then there
you go but uh yeah so video is getting
kind of long so that's all you guys get
for this video actually one more thing
so you know the commands i've been
talking about where ifconfig there's
also IW config now this is going to show
you all of the settings for your
wireless cards so that's why it says
like Ethernet this card doesn't have any
wireless extension so there you go
however whenever we need to change one
of our wireless settings then we're not
going to be doing so through iw config
we're actually going to be using a
special tool that's built into Kali and
it's one of the tools from the aircrack
suite and the reason that we do this is
because it's a lot faster and easier and
you guys are going to be seeing all the
cool things that we can do later on but
for now there you guys go you now have a
basic understanding of networking
commands in Linux
pretty stinking awesome I will see you
guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
