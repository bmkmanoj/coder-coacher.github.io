Effects tutorial in the store on when
teaching you guys how to make a mask now
what a mask is is pretty much it covers
up some of your video so you only see a
specific part of it and this is how like
um people make like fake you elf UFO
videos and videos of them jumping over a
car when they're really only jumping in
front of a green screen or something
like that so I'm gonna I'm not going to
show you guys how to do that so if I'm
going to show you guys the basics behind
it the first thing we're going to want
to do is go ahead and drag out a movie
clip to our composition panel and I'll
just put that right there now there are
a lot of different ways you can make
masks but the easiest way is to open
your entire composition in your layers
panel so go ahead and to do this double
click your composition name right here
and now you want to expand your layers
panel for here until you can see the
word render that little checkbox right
here now what this is going to allow you
to do this layers panel this is going to
allow you to make a mask of this layer
so to do that there are a bunch of
different things you can use like the
pen tool I'm just going to make a basic
let's use an ellipse so go ahead and
start and drag your ellipse now as you
can see the first problem with this
whenever we're going to want to work
with this is going to be kind of hard to
a make a mask when we can't really see
the entire area we're working with so if
you like it this way with black in the
background then don't do anything but if
you want to see the total area you're
working with go ahead and click render
and this will show you everything you're
working with now real quick as you can
see in our final composition panel it
masked only what's in between the yellow
circle and again what it does just like
mask it shows you only the parts that
you want to see and blocks out the other
parts so now again if we played our
movie
the entire scene is blocking out the
parts we don't want to see and only
showing the parts we do want to see so
those are the basics of our masks but
now we I want to teach you guys how to
edit the mask now again
you edit it with mostly the selection
tool but if you just start editing it
you're going to get to know if you want
to try to move this mask around it's
going to be kind of hard you don't use
this this is your anchor point and
anytime you try to drag it on the side
it's just going to move one of these
little nubs so what you have to do if
you want to move this mask around is you
need to highlight the mask layer mask
one and press or excuse me hold down
control and press T this is going to
give you a free transform box around
your mask again that's hold down control
on your keyboard and press T and this is
going to allow you to move the mask
around your scene and it's also going to
allow you to shrink and also rotate your
mask so again anytime you are want to
use that control T and anytime you want
to get out of it just double click and
you'll get out of it so now you can see
in our final composition we now have a
sideways egg-shaped mask let me go ahead
and click this and you play it for you
guys and again as we touch on before any
times you anytime you want to edit one
of these specific notes just double
click anywhere on your um I don't know
it's called paste board and hold down
one of these nodes and you can edit
those individually so if you want to
make a beam shape mask or banana shape
or actually I don't even want to say
what that shape looks like but if you
want to make this shape just hold down
one of the notes and again if you want
to do free transform hold down ctrl and
press T ctrl T there you go
so those are the basics of working with
a mask and how to block out some of your
scenery and this is how people make like
take one portion of a scene and combine
it with another portion even though
they're non the same camera or anything
like that so that is how you make a mask
those are the basics and those are basic
editing tools well in the next tutorial
we're going to be going over more on
masks and it's a gonna help you out a
lot so get comfortable with the basics
of masking a scene and the basics of the
free transform tool and once you learn
that you're ready to move on to the next
tutorial so see you then thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
