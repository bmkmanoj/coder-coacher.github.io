welcome to another update video um it's
been like a week since I made the last
update video so a couple things have
changed since then so I just want to
keep you guys updated about what's going
on with the new and improved the new
Boston so the main things that have
changed is I've been busy this week not
only making tutorials but I also hired
three new people so we have three new
employees to help us make tutorials so
we're going to be making of course I'm
going to be sticking with my XHTML
tutorials for now and they are going to
be making let's see if I can remember
all this um they're going to be working
on one subject at a time but the first
subjects that we decided to cover our
biology chemistry pre-algebra geometry
and statistics and I think that's it for
now but you know they're going to be
working on one of those subjects um so
three subjects plus my XHTML and after
my XHTML I decided that I'm going to do
JavaScript so I know a lot of you guys
um wanna dive into Android but I owe it
to the people that have been following
me for ever been following my JavaScript
tutorials to finish that series to be
honest I messed up and I should have
finished it a lot a long time ago and
I'm sorry but I owe it to you guys to
finish what I started so as promised
that's what I'm going to do that's what
I do with my XHTML toros that's what I'm
going to be doing my JavaScript
tutorials I'm going to get them done as
fast as I can um since I owe it to you
guys at least that much so I know you
guys write oh this could be like months
before I get into the topic that I want
to learn well actually I started with my
XHTML tutorials this month I mean this
week I'm already like halfway done with
them so the topics that some teachers
take like four and a half months or an
entire semester to cover I'm going to be
covering it in like a week so I'm
guessing once I start teaching
JavaScript or anything that's going to
take like a week or two maximum
and then I'm going to be on with
something new and hopefully that's the
same um once you get rolling and once
they get familiar my employees how to
make tutorials and how to make them good
then hopefully it will be written for
those as well in trust me the quality is
still going to be amazing we're going to
be covering everything in detail so
don't worry about that
and I I read a lot of you guys comments
but Bucky you don't have to make these
tutorials for us
um you already done so much for us guys
I love making tutorials for you guys
I love reading all the comments I love
getting the feedback so I mean don't
feel sorry for me at all because I enjoy
it more than you guys can even imagine
so I just want to get that out of the
way so I don't feel sorry for me at all
because I enjoy doing this
aside from men recently and I didn't
even notice this until people started
leaving comments I guess I hit my
hundred I mean a thousands of video on
my xhtml tutorials so I should've done
something special for my thousandth
video but I also zoomed in on making
tutorials that it kind of just passed me
by so one of those tutorials was my
thousands video so congratulations to us
all we finally made it to a thousand
videos and hopefully it's just one of
the milestones on path to the new boston
empire so we are doing it guys I'm so
proud of you guys for sticking with me
watching this tutorials so anyways the
main thing I want to go over is that we
got three new employees so um yeah
that's it so anyway I got one more other
small thing to show you so uh just hold
on one second now shut it all right guys
now don't get too excited because this
surprise is pretty much thumb a surprise
everybody I just want to show you guys
we finally got my bookcase yeah I
finally figured out how to squeeze it in
my car so yeah I finally have completed
my awesome furniture section for the
office so here's what we got going on
here is going to be for our employees
and the bookcase where we're going to be
a you know keep track of all the
subjects in my office and actually I'd
guys that that was what I wanted to talk
to you guys about but I got one more
thing and maybe you guys can help me out
with this see on my walls let me try to
zoom in here on my walls I got these
hooks and I think that paintings or you
know probably a lot of people who went
to college put all their degrees and
fancy stuff there but I don't have a
whole lot of you know pictures of me
shaking hands with the president so if
you guys have any photos or paintings
even if you made them yourself I don't
care but I need something to put on my
wall because it feels kind of empty and
also there's another one right here
right there so anyways I got all these
hooks on my walls and I'm supposed to be
I'm supposed to be hanging and stuff
from them but I don't have any paintings
or photographs or anything so if you
have guys if you guys have anything you
can send me I have my address on my main
youtube channel youtube.com slash New
Boston and I also put it in the section
below so if you guys have anything you
can send me my walls are naked and
they're lonely and they have nothing so
put something and I'll hang them up even
if it's stupid I'm gonna hang it up
anyways who the heck cares so thank you
guys for watching this update I tried to
do update every week but that's not a
promise I'm just going to try so thank
you guys and I look forward to getting
all your stuff in the mail so I guess
