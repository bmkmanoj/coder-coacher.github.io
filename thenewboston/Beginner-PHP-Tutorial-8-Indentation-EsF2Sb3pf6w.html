and this is a PHP video tutorial for the
new Boston now in this video tutorial
I'm going to be talking about code
indentation what code in tentation is
and why it should be used now for an
example let's take a look at the
following file
I've got index 2 PHP now this file works
it works perfectly in fact apart from
one thing I've just spotted and named it
was STR to lower this needs to change
SCR to lower ok so I always forget
something ok so the file that we're
looking at now works perfectly let's go
ahead and open our browser and test it
okay so let's open up ok so it says
you're over 21 yes 1e is equal to 1 so
let's go back to our code and see why so
if the name the string name to lower
blow of it doesn't really matter what
the code looks like as equal to Alex
then do this echo this part of the code
otherwise say you're not Alex so if we
change this name here to say Dale and we
refresh it says you're not Alex so the
code works that's essentially we need to
move for now now the problem with this
is the way that we have not indented it
so there's no code indentation therefore
it's hard to see where an if start if
statement starts and where an if
statement ends so if we needed to make
modifications to a program it's going to
be a lot harder if we don't use code
indentation now there's 14 lines to this
program can you just or this code this
page or script if you like imagine if we
had 1400 lines and we didn't use
indentation you can imagine how often
it's going to look
how messy is going to look so let's go
ahead and look at index.php which is a
duplicate of this however I've created
line indentation for each where it's
necessary okay so what I've done is
after the first if statement I've
indented to make a new if statement so
if and then inside here we've indented
and now inside this if statement I've
indented all the code here okay so the
estate and everything by default starts
on without being indented we've made the
first if statement so the block I can
already tell it's just from the start of
this I here down to here so this is the
start of the block and this is the end
of the block here and this is the start
of the top block and this is the end
then we say else so inside of this block
here where we're saying is age greater
than or equal to 21 this is inside and
we can also politically tell that
because we've got straight down here
straight down here and straight down
here and then we've indented just the
echo inside of here so you can sit so
you can see how code indentation makes a
whole lot of difference when you're
trying to view a file so for example if
I want to say if age does not is you
know saying if age is greater than or
equal to 21 I won't say well maybe I
want to create an if-else statement
rather than just an if statement let's
go down and we can also likely see
that's the end of the block and we can
start typing on here my text editor
automatically indents for you I think
notepad plus plus is a lot better at
this than context as well as a variety
of that of other editors but now we can
just type in something here not over 21
for example and when we change this to
say 16 we know that our program is going
to work because we've already seen the
indentation and we've created the code
we've created the program to to work
according to these and the indentation
makes everything a lot easier to see so
always use indentation in your code it's
part of the coding standards which is
very important when you're looking at
code especially when you're going to be
distributing code or you need other
people to read code you may understand
how your code works and it may work in
fact so you might think why do I need to
indent and everything like that well the
answer is is that if other people do
need to see your code or if you need to
make quick modifications to your code
it's going to be a lot easier to see if
you've used indentation</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
