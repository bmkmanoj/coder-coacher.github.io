tutorial but I'm making for the new
Boston and in this tutorial I'm gonna be
showing you how to use the mask text box
control so all you're going to need for
this tutorial is a button and a mask
text box so just go over to your tool
box and drag a mask text box over and
what the mask text box will do is it
will only allow users to input on
certain types of information for example
if you wanted users to only be able to
type in numbers you could apply a number
mask so they can only type in numbers
this is very useful when you only want
someone be able to type in numbers and
you're trying to convert that string
into an integer or something and if they
had letters in there or symbols or
something like that it would throw an
error but if you use a mass text box and
then they only be able to type in
numbers so there would be no way that
you get an error right there so I'm
going to show you how to apply the mask
just go over to the properties panel
with the math or the math text box
selected and scroll down until you see
masks and then just put the civil off
button right here and here we displayed
with a dialog and inside of here we can
select a mask we can choose numeric five
digits so they can only type in five
numbers so we debug here type in only
numbers if you try to type in like
letters or symbols then you it won't let
you do it you can also apply a mask like
phone number a date or something like
that so if we did a phone number right
here it also has like symbols are here
so it tells you that this is where you
put the air area code so like the area
code and then the actual number and you
can have like so you want to make it so
like a dollar sign it appear at the
beginning you could do that as well
there are a few other one your masks you
can apply such as zip code or some of
that but you can also create your own
custom masks and in order to know what
to type in this mask right here just go
on google and type in max text box
ask property and then click on the first
link right here should be
msdn.microsoft.com and when you click
that link you should be displayed with a
page similar to this one and as you can
see right here you have a nice little
table on telling you what each one of
these things does so if we were to type
in a 0 and the mask right there it would
say a it would represent my digit and to
be required so you must type in digit
there and the ELINT list says this
element will accept any single digit
between 0 and 9 so you can type in any
number between 0 and 9 so go back to
c-sharp right here type in a 0 and yeah
they have to type in a number there but
and then you can see they put a 9 there
because for the time because you may not
need a number there it may be like 3
o'clock in the afternoon would want to
put a 0 and then a 3 there are some
other ones there are slashes for a date
separator and stuff like that and it
says all the other characters it says
they're literals and that means that
they will stay wherever they are so
that's why when they had the UM the zip
code and like the phone number ones
there's this dash and over the
parenthesis right there and that means
that you cannot write over them or and
you cannot like move them around or
they're literals they must remain where
they are so let's just create your own
right here so we type in like a couple
9s the beginning that means those are
optional like then a bunch of zeros
again that means that they are required
now we type here don't need to have two
one to the beginning so there's type
number at the end or okay oops so that's
pretty much all there is to the mask
textbox so see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
