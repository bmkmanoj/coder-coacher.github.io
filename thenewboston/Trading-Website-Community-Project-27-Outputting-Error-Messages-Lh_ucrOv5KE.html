and in this video what we're going to be
doing is working on handling the
information whenever the user fills out
that register form so the first thing we
did was we basically validated all of
the information we made sure that the
user name was empty and it was only
letters and numbers did the same for
email and password so now they should
have good information however if they
did make a mistake and they did cause an
error in the example maybe you forgot to
enter a username then what we did is we
took an error message and we stored it
inside an array called air so we want to
remember that because this is how we
know do we want to handle this
information and throw inside our
database or do we not want to well if
anything is stored inside that array
then that means that they have generated
an error so if the array is not empty
and there's something inside it then we
don't want to store anything in the
database because obviously the f
something up so let's go ahead and test
for that right now in order to test if
in array has something in it then just
go ahead and use the keyword empty and
now go ahead and type in the name of
your array which is air and what this is
going to do is this bit of code is going
to run hopefully this is good info if
they didn't generate any error messages
this is the bit of code that's going to
happen because their array is empty no
errors however if they did go ahead and
they made a mistake maybe you know they
didn't enter a password or maybe you
know they had a weird symbol in their
email then they obviously have generated
some errors so it's our job now to
display the errors on the screen and let
them know hey this is what you did wrong
so let's go ahead and just make a
variable and I'm going to name this air
underscore message and this is the
variable as you can see right here that
displays at very top of the form
whenever you make an error and I know
got it right there hold on it's on my
other we just go
and yo arm 1986 org and go to that
register probably should have had this
up before but this is basically right
here the error message that's going to
display so that's where we're going to
be building right now so in order to do
that like I said go ahead and first
store this in a variable span and you
can just use single quotation marks we
aren't using any variables span in the
class for that styling for the red and
the white lettering is air we already
made that class if you can't remember in
our CSS file so actually made that tag a
little bit wrong so that's where our
span is going to be now the last thing
that we need to do is we need a closing
span so let me just go ahead and
actually i'm not even going to copy that
so let me just copy this a little bit
lazy here but you know nothing wrong
with that error message instead of just
setting it equal to something else you
can't do that because that'll change
variable we want to go ahead and append
an additional span on here I guess
doubles from single quotes it doesn't
really matter which is the ending span
and two breaks definitely kind of type
that but I'm Way too lazy so basically
as you can clearly see any text that we
type in here is going to be in between
two spans thus making it white lettering
with a red background it just looks like
an error message so then you're saying
so how the heck are we going to type all
the error messages in here are they
stored in another variable well all of
the error messages are stored in this
array called air and it's our job
whenever they do cause an error message
to loop through that array and output
each message so in order to do that the
easiest way that we can loop through an
array is this for each
air which is of course the name of your
rate as key values now hopefully you
understand this from my PHP tutorials if
not go and look under for each loops and
obviously you understand but what we
want to do was we want to take each of
those error messages in output it to the
screen now each of the thing in your
array or each of the strings or error
messages is going to be stored in this
values variable so go ahead and copy
that because we're going to need it
later on and actually before you do that
just copy this it's a little bit easier
and then go ahead and copy this and I'll
tell you guys what I'm doing in just a
second and this it needs to be in
between double quotation marks because
it is indeed a variable so basically
what we're saying is this we want a span
class because anything we put inside
this class is going to look like a error
message it's just going to you know
visually prompt the user to say hey you
mess something up and then once we have
that we need to loop through our array
of error messages that the user did
because they messed something up in each
error message it's going to output it on
the screen and therefore you know there
you have it obviously I don't even
really need to explain just go ahead and
look you see what's happening so that's
what we're going to do for the error
messages now whenever they don't have
any error messages then what we want to
do is this we're going to have it set up
where we want to validate their
information by email you know whenever
you sign up for a website and it says ok
you signed up but in order to use the
Site you need to confirm or we sent you
an email click on the link and then
you're good to go that's a really good
way to prevent spam inbox from signing
up for your site so here's how the site
is going to work in our database we have
two tables temp users and users
temporary users are the people who first
sign up but then in order to get in the
real database the users they need to
click on a link in their email so in the
next sauriol what i'm going to be doing
is we're going to be inserting their
temporary information into a table and
then once they click that link in their
email then they're moved into the
permanent
users database where they can begin
using all of the features of the website
so there you go thinking as for watching
I'm going to subscribe and I'll see you
guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
