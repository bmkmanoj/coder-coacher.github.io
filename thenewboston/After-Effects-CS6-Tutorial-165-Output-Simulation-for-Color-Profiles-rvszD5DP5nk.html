Effects cs6 video
I'm your host of buddy Blackford and it
is a gorgeous day outside today and I'm
in here doing tutorials well I like
doing these tutorials it's awesome it's
like really cool to be helping everybody
out and doing all that kind of stuff so
today I'm gonna go over more about color
management but I'm going to show you how
to preview an output for your color
workspace or your color profile what I
mean for that is you can come up here
and into the view go to simulate output
and then you can see what your actual
footage is gonna look like in these
different types of outputs so I'll put
it on no output simulation right now and
we're going to be working off of this
video video here which is has a
resolution of 4096 by 2160 so this
originally was a red footage and I
converted it into DPX so I could use it
inside of After Effects and it has
trillions of colors in it so that's all
it's a lot of color information so we'll
be able to see the differences here now
I want to move this over a little bit so
I'll use my hand tool so we can see
because you see if you keep an eye on
this side over here on the right you can
definitely tell the differences of
what's going on so we this footage
should be meant for HD TVs so what I
want to do is come up to my view here
and go to simulate output and I'm gonna
put it on HDTV and this is what it's
going to look like on an HDTV so that's
pretty good it looks pretty clean and
the colors are pretty decent here so
let's go and check out this and
something like NTSC so NTSC is way lower
resolution than HD TV obviously so let's
check it out and see what it looks like
now you can see it changed the color
over here on the on the right and it
changed the dark spots a little darker
and everything like that so let me go
back let's go to view and then I'll go
to HDTV and just keep an eye on the
right there and you can see how it it'll
change the color so you can see that
let's check out it
what else is going on here we'll go to
custom down here and then we can convert
everything to whatever we would like to
so we can convert out output profile
convert to srgb and then the simulation
will be srgb so that's nice let's hit OK
and that's what the srgb looks like it's
it's not much difference but when you
have like a really nice monitor or a
really nice really nice TV maybe maybe
you own a 2k TV if you're lucky I think
those are like 5000 or maybe even
$10,000 for those well if you own one of
those you'll be able to see these kind
of differences and hopefully you can
catch the different differences I mean
I'm recording my monitor so it should
show the differences it's not I don't
have like the top-of-the-line he best
monitor ever but I have one that's good
enough to work with today's standard
video and everything like that so that's
just a tutorial on how to view your
different outputs if you want to preview
them and see what they're going to look
like a TV or
a on the web or on like a tube TV or
whatever so thanks for watching that one
is just a quick tip and I'll see you
guys the next in the next tutorial see
you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
