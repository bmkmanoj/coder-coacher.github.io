tutorial for this little mini series and
how to create a platformer game and the
last thing I want to teach you guys is
actually a really important concept
especially when you're making platformer
games and that's how to make an actual
platform that you can jump through so
right now if we play the game we can see
that sense this land right here or
whatever you want to call it is a solid
object that it has solid behavior
whenever our player tries to jump
through it he just hits his head and
comes back down however if he ever
played Sonic the Hedgehog or Super Mario
Brothers you know that sometimes there
are platforms where you can jump in your
player actually goes through them and
lands on them like a well most of the
platforms in platformer games so let's
go ahead and learn how to do that right
now so what we're going to do is we're
gonna actually select one of these and
if you right click it and hit clone
object type object type there you go we
can just uh actually let me put it right
over here so right now instead of a
instance of it we have a clone of it now
the reason that I did this is because a
clone pretty much can have different
behaviors in different properties than
an instance of it so now go ahead and
select your new clone and now what we
want to do is turn this from a solid to
a jump through platform so in order to
do this in your behaviors click add an
edit behavior and get rid of this solid
because solid basically means like you
would think a huge chunk of stuff that
you would hit your head on so delete
that and it says deleting ant with the
leave and behaviors yes and the one we
want to add is jump through right here
and if you look at the explanation it
says it better than I can a solid the
platform well that doesn't really make
sense a solid the platform should be a
solid platform behavior maybe I don't
know it's pretty much a platform that
you can jump on from the bottom and I
didn't even add it jump through add so
now what you can do with this is you can
actually jump through
from the bottom and land on the top of
it instead of just hitting your head and
another thing is that you typically want
to make these look different than just
your solids right here so what I can do
is I can actually set this equal to
another initial frame like I know that
I'll 135 looks good and if I see how
BIG's my guy right around there we'll
give him a letting jump on it so now
let's create hold on for you make sure
that this baby is good to snap control
give them you know some more space to
work with
all right so now as you can see every
one of these now halves now has the
behavior jump through which means that
I'll show you guys right now
so unlike this one where it's just a
solid hunk of crab we care mice now what
we can do is we can now have a platform
where we can jump on and we don't hit
our head we jump and land on it so we
can either do it from the side and we
can actually jump on solids from the
side well with this one just like Super
Mario Brothers or Sonic how freaking
awesome is that
and actually let me see if I can do
something cool real quick I'll leave
that right there you know put that right
there
put this right here and now let me run
this and see just now okay jump on that
jump on that jump in that and kill my
snail with a mega death drop so how
awesome is that this game is actually
mmm actually kind of fun believe it or
not so that's how you make a very simple
platformer game and remember if you
watch my other tutorial series you guys
are gonna know how to make a heads-up
display like it shows you how many coins
are collected how many enemies you kill
and maybe give you guys some health I
also tell you guys how to like take your
health away if you want to so uh yeah I
mean thank you for watching and I like
set in the last video I said I'm not
gonna promise that I'm gonna make
another series but I really hope that I
can and if you have any questions at all
check out my website
Bucky's room work slash forum and uh
well that's it I'm glad you guys stuck
with me and I'll learn how to make games
and hopefully I'll be seeing you guys in
future have a good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
