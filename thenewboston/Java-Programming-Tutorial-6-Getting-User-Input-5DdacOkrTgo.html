java tutorial and in this tutorial I'm
gonna be showing you a real quick way to
get input from a user so one way that we
can get input from a user is to use
something that's already built into Java
and this is called a scanner and what
the scanner does is take information
that the user types in from their
keyboard and stores it in a variable so
let's go ahead and get the scanner first
and how we get it or tell Java where we
need to use it is we need to import it
so go ahead and write import on your
first line Java jav au TI l dot scanner
and this is how you're going to be
inputting excuse-me importing stuff from
now on so I'm just get used to that
syntax if you don't know exactly what
this means it's pretty much just getting
the scanner and telling Java we're going
to need it so of course in our class we
need that public method again so in our
class body go ahead and type public
static void main and in your arguments
type string Arg s with a square brackets
what's good good enough now in your body
of your main we need to actually get
programming so we need to make a
variable that's going to hold the input
from the keyboard before you use it so
to do this we need to go ahead and write
something out scanner SCA and NER this
means that we're going to use the
scanner next you need to give your
variable a name and I'm going to name
mine Bucky and then you need to set it
equal to whatever they enter from the
keyboard so to do this you need
follow-on new scanner and in your
parentheses right here a man my
semicolon first you need to type system
dot in so here's what's going in right
here or excuse me going on
we told Java we need to use the scanner
which is a way to get information from
the keyboard we have a variable it's a
scanning variable called Bucky and the
Bucky variable is equal to whatever and
formation that's in the keyboard and
system n stands for system input and the
only input we have in the computer right
here is the keyboard so this pretty much
is short for whatever we type in for the
keyboard hold it in our Bucky variable
and we're going to tell you what to do
with it right now so now we have input
whatever that's going to be from the
keyboard and it's going to be stored in
our Bucky variable what we want to do
now is just print it out on the screen
so you remember from the last tutorial
how to do that system.out.print line and
in your parenthesis you need to type pay
attention the first thing you need to
type is the name of your variable and
that's going to be on whatever you made
up here again this Bucky you don't have
to write Bucky of course you can write
anything you want now press Bucky period
next line and what this is going to do
is allow you to pause and wait until you
get input from here so again let me run
this program and I'll show you guys what
it does go ahead and press ok and now
down here is going to say a now press
ENTER and it's going to output hey now
so remember it had a blank cursor said
hey now once you press Enter it just
repeated it again and I'll show you guys
what happened right there again one last
time we imported this scanner if we
didn't import it we can never use it
since Java doesn't really like to just
gather everything it only uses the
things it needs it's very um I don't
know
Noba like it's only takes what its needs
very courageous a programmable age but
anyways what we did in our main function
these are the only two lines you really
need to look for
we made a variable called Bucky and it's
a scanner variable we said we're making
a new scanner variable that's going to
be equal to whatever the user inputted
in this example hey now now hey now
equals Bucky or Bucky equals hey now
so what do you want so anytime you print
out Bucky is going to print out hey now
so instead of system.out.print line with
text in here we actually change that
text for Bucky next line and again what
that did is pretty much take that hey
now variable and put it in here and
that's why it printed out hey now
so that's your quick tutorial on how to
use the scanner to set it equal to
variable and then use that variable to
output on your screen using the print
line method so that's your basics on how
to gather input from the keyboard and
we're going to need this input to use in
functions later on say we want to make a
mortgage calculator or just a shopping
cart that's how we do that so again I
practice this just copy the source code
as I do remember you don't need a name a
name your function Bucky so go ahead and
practice this and thank you guys for
watching hopefully check out my next
tutorial don't forget to subscribe to my
channel and thank you and I'll see you
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
