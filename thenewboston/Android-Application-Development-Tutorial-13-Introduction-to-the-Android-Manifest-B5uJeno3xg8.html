13th Android tutorial again with me
Travis for the new Boston what we're
going to do in this tutorial is
basically work with Android manifest to
get the splash activity to launch first
now if we run a activity or application
right now it's just going to show this
activity that we created a few tutorials
ago and it's not going to recognize our
splash activity and our splash activity
is going to get super depressed if he
never gets recognized so we're going to
hook him up in the Android manifest so I
want you guys to open that up and if it
looks like this I want you to go over to
this write tab where we go into the
actual XML code and as you can see
here's our application bracket and
within our application bracket we have
the activity bracket this basically
defines our activity and gives it some
action names within an intent filter you
guys probably don't care or you don't
even really need to know what intent
filter is for the moment but basically
add some reference points and some you
know stuff to it for the most part so
what we're going to do is we're going to
copy that activity and paste it below
and we're going to change some things
around because we want the splash
activity or a splash class to start
first so what we're going to do is we're
going to change the Android name from
starting point to our class name called
splash this does this is case sorry this
is case sensitive so make sure you spell
exactly how you spelled your class name
and now this is going to be what
launches first because we have this
launcher intent for the most part or
within the intent filter under our
category name so that's what it's going
to look for when our application starts
it's going to look for this launcher
item and then see where that is what
clot what activity that's located in
it's going to be like oh the splash
activity let's start that up yeah that
sounds like a great idea and so that's
what's going to happen but the problem
is right now we have two launcher items
one for starting point and one for
splash so we need to get rid of the
launcher
on our starting point and just let the
starting-point chill a little bit
just relax wait till he needs until we
need them for the most part so we're
going to say default from launcher to
default and you guys need to spell that
correctly all uppercase and that's
basically just going to recognize that
our activity is there but it's not going
to do anything until we tell it to do
anything so that's what that is the
action name we're also going to change
because when we want when we actually
want our starting point to start or
starting point activity to start we're
going to call the action name and start
it that way so a good way to keep track
of all of your action names is type out
your package name so comm dot the new
Boston
dot Travis and then dot and then
basically your class name in all
uppercase so starting point starting to
lose my voice I'm sorry but that's how
we're going to define our action name
and again we can refer to this action
name to start up our starting point
class or activity when we want to so
there we go now pretty much everything
is set up hopefully you guys kind of get
an understanding of for the most part
what the action name is I shouldn't
refer to this one this is just kind of a
this is kind of what the phone is
looking for as well when it starts up
the launcher item but as for the action
name and setting it's either default or
a launcher item so there you go that's
basically the end of this tutorial let's
check it out make sure it works so we're
going to run it on it on the emulator
real quick and hopefully we'll get our
splash screen to come up instead up
instead of a starting point it looks
like we did so mission accomplished and
I'll see you guys in the next tutorial
have a good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
