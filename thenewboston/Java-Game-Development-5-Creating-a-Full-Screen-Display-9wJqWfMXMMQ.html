your fifth java game development
tutorial and in this tutorial we're
going to be working with our main method
here and actually building some stuff to
actually display what we've been working
for in the last couple of tutorials so
the first thing that I'm going to teach
you guys how to do is use this it's
called the display mode method that I've
been talking about and in order to do
this we need to set a variable equal to
a display mode object so go ahead and
put display mode and name it diem or
something simple and set it equal to new
display mode just like that now display
mode is going to take four parameters
the first two parameters are your
resolutions and this is going to be 800
by 600 and this is your X&amp;amp;Y
now your third parameter is your bit
pretty much your bit depth and this
means it's either can be 8 16 or 32 to
be safe just go with 16 right here it's
not too many colors but it's a lot
faster than it would be if it was 32 and
the last one is your refresh rate and
this means how many times your monitor
refreshes and what you commonly do here
is put display mode dot refresh rate
unknown just like that and it should pop
up if you're using the clips and this
means I don't know where my refresh rate
is and you know it says it right there
value of the refresh rate if not known
and we don't know it's it's not going to
matter really and now what we want to do
is get an object of this class and I
named this class Bucky so I'm going to
name it Bucky B equals new Bucky and we
need the object of this class because
aside from main we're going to be
building another method and that's B dot
run and that run method is actually
going to take ear to spoil a mode as a
parameter so that's why we need to put
the display motor right here so let's go
ahead and tighten this up and build that
run method right here and let's go ahead
and end this run method we're going to
be pretty much setting the stuff what we
want to appear on the screen so public
void run and of course it takes a
display mode as parameter so we need to
make it take it display mode DM and we
need this display mode because we pretty
much need it to pass on the set full
screen in here and I'll go over this
later on this display mode in this run
method it's actually going to call set
full screen and you'll see why right now
but first thing what we're going to want
to do is set the background foreground
and font of our window so set back
around right there and what do we want
to set this background to color pink
looks good and now that we got our
background is going to be pink let's say
our foreground right so set foreground
hopefully ispotter right to color dot
white there we go that's a little better
and now we pretty much have is a pink
background with a white foreground so
now all we need to do is pretty much put
font on it so set font I mean we need
something to read so that's why and what
do we want to put for fun let's put new
font let's make it takes three
parameters Arial and font plain and 24
and if you don't know how to use any of
these things then check out my other
Java tutorials but you guys should know
how to do this that's what I'm gone
through it kind of quick scroll up and
now after this what we need to do is we
need a screen variable and what the
screen variable is going to let us to do
is right here you see we have the screen
class right here that we built so the
screen variable is going to pretty much
be a screen object to let us use the
methods in here so
and put screen s equal to new screen and
now we can call any of the methods in
our screen class right here so let's go
ahead and do that the first thing we're
going to want to do remember is set full
screen remember we built this method
over here to set the window and turn it
into a full screen window so let's go
ahead and we actually need to
encapsulate this in Tri blocks one of
those silly little things and let's go
ahead and catch exception e^x and we
won't handle it because I don't plan on
messing up and let's go ahead and call s
dot set fullscreen and for your
parameters remember it takes a display
mode in a jframe window and instead of
window you can just put this and in case
you don't know that this keyword means
it's pretty much a reference to whatever
object you're working on so it's pretty
much a reference to this right here and
that's what this keyword means so inside
this try block you actually want to have
another trap block so if this works
let's go ahead and put the thread to
sleep and what this is going to do when
we put the thread to sleep remember when
we put a thread to sleep it does nothing
so once it sets it the full screen right
here we want it to do nothing
for five seconds that's five thousand
milliseconds in here if we're saying all
right why would you want it to do
nothing for five seconds well if we
didn't have it sleep at all um it pretty
much would just set it to full screen
and down here we're pretty much going to
go ahead and put let me find my finally
where's my first try
try right there catch actually this is
going to be finally finally
s dot and what do you name it
restore there we go resource screen so
here's what this is going to do and we
need to catch this catch exception e^x
and don't handle it so here's what this
run method is doing in essence what it's
doing is it's changing on font that's
all nice and neat but it's changing it
to full screen and then it's waiting for
five seconds and then it's returning it
to regular screen and if we didn't have
this at all it would change it to full
screen and then restore it back to
normal size so fast we couldn't even
tell that what was happening so that's
why we need to wait we say all right
once you get to full screen
just wait pause let us look at it a
little bit make sure we didn't mess up
anything and then after five seconds you
can go ahead and restored the normal
screen so I only got three minutes left
so let me hurry up and write my last
method and that is going to be right
here public void paint and his parameter
graphics G and for here let's go ahead G
dot draw string and three parameters
first what do you want the string say
this is going to be awesome and two more
are positioning and we'll put it 200 and
200 so appear somewhere in the middle of
screen and now what we need to do is and
that and let me just run this to make
sure it works and I know you guys can't
see right now but my screen just turned
pink and it says this is going to be
awesome in pretty much the middle of
screen and after five seconds is stopped
and here is a preview of what it looks
like and I actually before I made this
story I took a screen capture and I just
wanted to test it on my own a real quick
to make sure I didn't mess up I encode
for this tutorial but this is what's
going to look like when you do this
exact same thing on your computer it's
going to be a pink screen with no title
ball or zip top no scroll bars inside
and it's going to say this is going to
be awesome and now you
have just taken over your entire screen
and now we are ready to move on to the
next step so in the last thing if you're
wondering why is this paint method
happening if we didn't call it anywhere
in our program actually we did not
explicitly though whenever you make a J
frame it calls the paint method
automatically and this is because it
knows what to paint in it so and even
though we didn't call paint or repaint
it does this once automatically anytime
you want to call it again manually you
have to call something called a repaint
but for now I just wanted to build this
run method to show you guys here's how
you do stuff with the window in our
other class we're changing it the
fullscreen making away for a little bit
then restoring it the normal size so now
we got all of our screens built we can
begin doing some actually cool stuff
that makes a lot more sense so thank you
guys for watching I promise this is
going to get better don't forget to
subscribe we're well on our way to
making awesome games
thank you again don't forget to
subscribe and I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
