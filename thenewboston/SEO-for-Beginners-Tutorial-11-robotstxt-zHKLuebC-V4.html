welcome back and in this video I'm gonna
start talking to you guys about Google's
webmaster guidelines now Google's
webmaster guidelines are essentially
just guidelines made by Google obviously
for making a quality website and they
have a couple different guidelines and
I'm going to talk to you guys about all
the different ones but for right now I
just want to show you guys this real
cool tool I found online and this is VA
rvy com VAR v com I guess that's how you
pronounce it and what you can do is you
can actually just paste in the URL of
your website and test it and what this
is going to do is it's going to look at
your website and it's going to go
through and test for every single
guideline so this one's good this one's
good whenever you see a X it's basically
saying hey this website doesn't follow
this guideline so my website right now
it doesn't have a sitemap and we'll talk
a little bit about what that is but
essentially it's a really useful tool
and it's free so that's pretty cool so
as we can see there's a bunch of
different guidelines robots.txt on a
sitemap make sure you have alt tags in
your images yada yada so let's go ahead
and break it down and we'll just start
with the very first one for this video
which is robots dot text so basically
any time you make a website you should
have a robots I say robots robots dot
txt file now what this is is it's
basically a plain text file and it goes
in the root directory or right after the
home directory of your website so
whenever you're making one just go ahead
and right click new file and just name
it robots dot txt all right so what the
heck is this this is basically a file
that essentially instructs bots on what
they're allowed to crawl and what
they're not allowed to curl so usually
by default what's going to happen is
you're going to have some you know
search engine BOTS whether it's from
being Yahoo whatever and it's just going
to start crawling your website every
single page that it can possibly find
however
chances are that you have some resources
or webpages that you don't want it to
curl for example like the admin page or
maybe the moderator panel or maybe just
some I don't know like nude pictures
that you have online by K this is
actually for me so can you leave these
out of your search results so basically
the way it works is is really simple you
only need to remember two things the
first is user agent so what you can do
is you can write star and that means
that these rules that I'm going to tell
you they apply to all search engine BOTS
however you can also do something like
this say that you only want to do make
some rules for like Google's search
engine BOTS well the name for that is
Googlebot so you can do that but the
majority of the time you just say user
agent star so this means I'm making
these rules for all search engine
crawlers or BOTS whatever you want to
call them now after this line let me
pull this up again you essentially have
a bunch of these disallowed this allowed
disallow now disallow basically says all
right you're allowed to crawl every
single web page except the ones I'm
telling you now if you just wanted to
have the search engine mods ignore an
entire directory or folder what you can
do is write it like this so whenever you
write this this means hey don't look at
anything in my private directory those
are like my personal things I don't want
them indexed on your search engine now
if you only want to say hey can you
ignore one specific page you can do
something like this
private new pics the HTML or you can say
like a admin the HTML and if you have
multiple rules say we wanted to disallow
admin and the entire private directory
and I don't know like a personal
password text then this would say hey
whenever you're on my site leave these
out so again it's just basically
instructions on what the search engine
but is not allowed to crawl now one
other thing and this is actually a
really important thing that I want to
point out is that keep note that this
file is actually used a lot by hackers
and malicious people why is that
well basically whenever someone goes
your site they say hmm I wonder if they
got any you know sensitive areas any you
know web pages on here that they really
don't want the public to know about well
what they do is they just look for a
robots.txt file and again the majority
of the time this is just going to be
used by search engines but it's actually
readable by anyone so if they see a file
or you know some directory in here like
passwords or database or you know
personal stuff then they're pretty much
just going to go to it so again make
sure that you never upload any sensitive
information and also just be aware that
hackers may look for these pages and
these are pretty much um I know for a
lot of people who don't know this it's
basically like giving hackers the
blueprint to what to attack on your
website so holy moly
Hot Tamale so there you go robots that
text and since we have a little bit of
time I'll show you guys this
I created a patreon account I think
that's how you pronounce it so this is
basically for donations if you guys feel
like donating my goal is for the end of
the week I want to raise $25 and by the
end of next week I want to raise 7
billion dollars so yeah we'll see how
that goes and also a cool little thing I
did this interview for a website called
human fox and they basically just asked
me you know how I got started
programming um asked me about like
education and what my dreams my passions
are and you know some pretty cool stuff
so if you guys want to check that out
feel free human fox comm slash capsule
slash
bucky so there you go we learned a
little bit about robots.txt files and in
the next videos we're going to be
covering the rest of these guidelines
it's going to be shweet so i'll see you
guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
