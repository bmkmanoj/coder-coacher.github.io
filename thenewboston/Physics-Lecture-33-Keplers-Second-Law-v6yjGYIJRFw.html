number 33 and in this tutorial I want to
talk to you guys about Kepler's second
law so in Kepler's second law he pretty
much is saying that a line joining a
planet and the Sun sweeps out equal
areas during equal intervals of time
easy enough okay ready to move on to the
next video now I'm just kidding I know
that whenever you read this law in the
textbook or on the internet it's really
hard to visualize so let me go ahead and
try to make an example that is a lot
easier to understand so we already know
from Kepler's first law that planets
orbit the Sun in an ellipse
now ellipse is basically like a potato
shape and let me go ahead and draw the
Sun at one of these points so the Sun
let me actually make it yellow because
you know the Sun okay right here so here
is the Sun right here it's a pretty good
actually I can't even lie that Sun looks
terrible but you know it gets the point
across so during one year we'll say it's
the earth the planet Earth makes one
revolution around the Sun in this
direction so is it all of these points
on the white line during the year
however it's a different point so we'll
say in January it goes from point A to
point B and we'll say that this is a
30-day time frame now maybe during May
this earth would be over here so this is
C and this would be D still 30 days but
at a different location so why is this
important and why do we care where the
earth is in relation to the Sun well
it's because Kepler said this if you
were to put a point directly in the
middle of the Sun and you were to
connect a line from C to the point and
also D to the point and you calculated
the area of this right here it would be
exactly equal to B to the point and a to
the point and I know wow I was way off
on that one see if I can draw a straight
line
and no but anyways not important so this
thing that looks like a piece of is they
say Pizza Pizza is actually area that
Kepler said was exactly equal during any
period of time so even though the
distance from A to B is different than C
to D now aside from the distance the
speed of Earth between C and B in a and
B it's going at different speeds during
these 30 day time periods this one in
January in this one in May or whatever I
said the area this blue area will always
be the exact same so basically even
though that this pie a B pie in C D pi
maybe a different shape the amount of
pie is always going to be the exact same
pretty sweet huh
so then Newton came along in of course
knew in always had something to say
about something he wanted to explain how
earth could orbit in this particular way
so okay messing up already so here is
our path of the earth and let me go
ahead and draw my son again since you
know I'm pretty good at drawing Suns not
to brag but I mean I never seen anyone
dress on that good so now we have our
earth right here and I might as well put
a big blue in it so you guys know that
this is the earth now a lot of people
were wondering all right first of all
why didn't the earth get sucked into the
Sun if the pull of gravity is always
pulling on the earth and why is this
able to orbit in you know not a perfect
circle because it would be it might make
more sense of the earth orbit in a
perfect circle with a relation to the
Sun well no one said that you know what
there isn't only one force acting on the
Sun there isn't only gravity but the
earth since it's moving in everything
that's moving with mass also has another
force acting on it inertia now inertia
remember pretty much says that
things are going to keep moving in the
direction that they came so gravity is
pulling it towards the Sun and inertia
is pulling it in the direction that came
so it came from here in this direction
inertia wants to keep pushing it or
pulling it in that direction so whenever
you add these two forces of gravity and
inertia that's what causes it to pretty
much average out and move in this
direction right here now no matter where
the earth is in relation to the Sun
whenever these two forces are combined
whenever you take the average of that
that's how you get this kind of
elliptical shape right here which
whenever you add the force of gravity
and the force of inertia it calculated
to perfectly make this elliptical shape
so that is how Newton basically verified
Kepler's second law
so just remember Kepler's said that in
this very first law that the pieces of
the pie are always going to be the same
size or have the same amount of area in
a given time frame and Newton says that
when gravity and inertia these two
forces that are acting on the earth are
combined it's going to cause this
elliptical shape around the Sun
verifying what Kepler said in his first
two laws</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
