video I want to talk to you about
pushing and pulling now this is a cool
little trick that you can do to make
your columns appear in different orders
depending on which device you're using
so for example on a desktop your columns
are going to appear in completely
different order than if you're looking
at it on a phone and I'll show you guys
why it's handy and why you would ever
want to do this so I already have a row
and we'll just make a single row with
like three columns in it for this little
example so I'm gonna make three
different columns so class I'll just say
Col md5 and let's give them each a
different background too so background
this will be light green and we'll just
say like a column a and the first one
column a will just say that this is our
main banner I'll know maybe it's like a
cool image we had made up but this is
the main banner for the homepage now we
also want to have two other columns so
I'll keep this 1 to 5 and put this one
into it although it really doesn't
matter just make sure that they all add
up to 12 so this can be column B and
this can be column C let me change the
background for each one so light green
lights coral and lights same in all
right so right now as you'd expect
whenever you run this this is going to
be first this is going to be second this
is going to be third let's check that
out all right so a B and C and now
whenever we shrink it a B and C but
here's the thing our boss came in and
he's like Bucky um this is the main
banner so don't you want to put this in
the middle for desktop sites
I can't that would actually be a good
idea but the thing is if I were to stick
this in the middle then anyone looking
at on a phone would you know have a
little column above it and it would
appear right here so somehow we need to
figure out
how to get this banner to appear in the
middle whenever you're looking at it on
a desktop and also on the top whenever
you're looking at on a phone pretty
tricky eh well that's where pushing and
pulling comes in so whenever you push
and pull
you can add another push and pull class
and basically what you're saying is I'm
going to add a condition and if the
condition is true move this column and
it's really easy so call MD push 5 now
whenever you see the keyword push it
means move the columns to the right so
what we're saying here all this class is
saying is whenever you have a screen
that's MD or greater and that means just
laptop you know a desktop basically any
regular computer screen then take this
column and move it five to the right now
what that means is since we move that
one to the right this one that's there
right now we got to move it 5 to the
left so pushing means move it 5 to the
right and pulling means move it 5
columns to the left so now what happens
check it out it usually was a B and C
since this is a desktop right now
whenever I holy Hot Tamale refresh it it
said okay since that condition was true
I'm going to take a and move it five to
the right so a is now here and I'm going
to take B and move it five to the left
so it pretty much was at that starting
point now whenever we look at this on
mobile look what happens since mobiles
are smaller than MD this condition
doesn't run at all and it just follows
these rules right here so it's like
these ones don't even exist until you
get to MD or greater in other words
large screen devices so just remember
whenever you want to add conditional
rules that's what you do
pushing means move it to the right and
pulling means move it to the left if you
remember that you'll be fine so thanks
for watching see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
