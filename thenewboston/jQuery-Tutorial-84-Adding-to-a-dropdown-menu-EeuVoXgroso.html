with a video tutorial for the new boston
now in the last couple of videos we've
looked at append and append to however
now we're going to take a look at an
example application which is going to
use append to append things to a
drop-down list an HTML drop-down list so
essentially what we're doing is we're
creating a series of links so three
links and when these links are clicked
the value of these links will be added
to the drop-down box to create each
option as we go so this is an example of
the script when we click on bread sugar
or tea
so if we click on bread it will then
become available in this drop-down list
when we click on sugar it will also
become available in this drop-down this
because we're appending an option on to
the end of the select element in HTML so
let's take a look at the code now we
have append is included in our file
that's extremely important we're going
to be writing out the code inside of
there it's extremely short but it's a
much better example than just showing
appending Nall text
it makes the you know overall use of
this seem a lot more useful in everyday
applications
ok so let's first of all create our
links so I'm going to create these just
inside a paragraph tag
we can copy and paste them so the first
one I'll just put bread and the href is
nothing the class of this is going to be
linked as is all the others so we're
gonna keep the same class name but we're
going to use the this keyword to
reference each object so the next would
be sugar and then we have tea so we've
used the class link and what this is
going to do is it's going to identify
all of these as clickable links we're
gonna call an event handler in append is
to check for the clicking of these links
we're then going to use the text
attribute to actually take the text
inside from this link and then we're
gonna add it to a drop-down box just
here let's go ahead and create this
drop-down box I'm gonna say give it a
name of list and then end the selection
there now we don't need to provide any
options in here because what's going to
be happening is these up or these
options that you would usually usually
specify are going to be appended on for
us so eventually we're gonna end up with
a list that looks like this
with bread sugar and tea however we're
gonna let jQuery do this for us as we
click the list
so essentially what the user is doing is
defining their own list okay so let's go
ahead and look at the code we first of
all need to create an event handler for
each of these links so we've called this
link this class link so for each one of
these links we can use dot link and when
we click on one of these links we want
to carry out a function
let's bring that down a bit so inside of
this function we want to first of all
take the value from the link itself so
I'm going to create a variable called
item now we need to go ahead and
reference the actual link itself however
we can't use link because I'll show you
what happens let's go ahead and choose
link and then we use the dot Vala
function to grab the value from oh no
sorry we use the dot text to grab the
value from this link now you'll see what
happens in this case when we click on an
element oh let's see what we've done
wrong here oh okay yeah so we need to
alert out item for debugging okay so now
that we've alerted that out let's go
ahead and click on a link now you can
see that we've got bread sugar and tea
combined this is because we can't refer
to this as dot link because we have the
same element name for each one on the
element class for each one and therefore
we just use this and this just takes the
currently clicked element so now what we
do is when we click sugar we have the
value sugar
when we click tea we have the value tea
and we click bread we have the value
bread so now that we know that this item
holds the currently clicked this item
variable holds the currently clicked
value we can go ahead and do something
with it
so obviously what we want to do is
append this to the options inside of
this select list so we're going to need
to use the append manipulator in jQuery
so we're gonna go ahead and say list
remember we called our list list then
we're gonna say dot append
and what do we want to append on well we
want to append on the item however this
isn't valid HTML if we were to use the
list like this click sugar nothing
really happens because we haven't chosen
the option tags around it so what we
need to do is we need to create some
option tags so we're appending on the
item after this option tag here using
the plus and then we go ahead and plus
the ending option tag so earlier I
showed you like this code here inside
this code here and what we're doing is
every time we click on a link this is
appending down until we have filled the
list ok so let's go ahead and test this
in our browser let's just bring that up
a bit
when we click bread now you can see that
the element has been added or the option
element has been added inside of here
and we now have bread in the drop-down
list
when I click sugar that's added to the
list as well and then when I click tea
that's finally added to the list we can
obviously then go and add the same one
over again
however you could probably kind of try
and come up with a way to check the
current elements in there and then maybe
put at times two on the end of it that's
not for this tutorial but that's a more
useful example of the append
manipulation in jQuery</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
