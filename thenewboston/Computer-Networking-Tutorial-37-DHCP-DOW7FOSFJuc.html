videos we've been talking about IP
addresses and subnets and right now we
basically know that whenever we have a
network any device on our network it
needs to have its own IP address and
that's just essentially what it boils
down to is a unique identification
number so we can identify and manage
every device
alright so that's easy enough but here's
the thing how did these numbers get
assigned I mean I learned about subnets
and I know that we're only allowed a
specific range of IP addresses but I
mean how do we determine which IP
address gets assigned to which computer
well we actually have a couple options
of how we can do that one of course is
just to do it manually so if we wanted
to whenever we're starting a network we
can actually sit down every device this
laptop and say ok whatever IP addresses
I'm allowed you can have this one
like 1.2.3.4 alright go to the next one
alright you can have one at 23.5 alright
well if I ever you know sell this
computer then I have to say ok um so
free that IP address up and I can you
know use it somewhere else while all
that is going to take a long time and of
course whenever we just you know want to
get on the Internet at our house most
people you know don't want to have to
learn how to assign IP addresses to each
device so instead what usually happens
is all this is taken care of through a
method code eh CP you guys have to
excuse my handwriting because I haven't
used this tablet and I don't know a few
weeks and these things are actually
really weird once you start like using
them after you haven't used them in a
while but uh nonetheless alright so DHCP
this stands for dynamic host
configuration protocol now long name but
it's actually really easy all this
protocol does is whenever you have a new
device on your network or a device
leaves it assigns it or what's the
opposite of a sign design now unassign
is it an IP address so basically all of
this work that we would have to do
manually assigning
an IP address manually is taken care of
automatically using DHCP now just as a
side note you can actually have an
entire server devoted to just this but
you really don't need that unless you
know you have a huge humongous network
arm you know maybe if you had like a
college or something that you would have
a server just for DHCP most server
operating systems have DHCP built in so
if you want to just you know enable it
then you can do that however just for a
simple home network DHCP is built into
most routers and usually users don't
even have to worry about it because you
know you plug in your adder and it just
works
but I'm gonna be showing you guys in
this example of you know how a home
network communicates using DHCP and how
automatically gets an IP address so let
me what color am I going to use over
this cool little red orange one all
right so here my computer's already in
my house these already have IP addresses
already hooked up however I just got
this computer at Best Buy
so I bring it home I boot it up turn it
on and right now my computer knows
nothing about this network right here
it's a brand new computer it doesn't
know where the heck it is it doesn't
have any IP address assigned to it
so the very first thing that it's going
to do is it's gonna I'll write this down
so it's going to send out a broadcast
packet and it's called a DHCP discover
message now you know how I talked to you
guys about the special broadcast address
that's assigned whenever you have you
know your range of IP addresses that
you're allowed to use what this address
essentially does is it takes a message
and it sends it out to everyone it
possibly can now it only needs to talk
to the router but it doesn't know that
yet it you know pretty much knows
nothing about the network so this
discover message it's pretty much the
equivalent of your laptop shout shouting
out hey someone I'm here I need an IP
address someone please help me so that's
what it is and for the source it uses
0.0 does you
zero to zero so your default IP address
before you have an actual one to sign is
just zero zero zero zero that means
whenever anyone gets this message and
send it back just broadcast that out
shout it out to anyone so that's the
return address and the next thing that
happens let me pick a new color here all
right so whenever your router hears this
what it does is it sends back a DHCP
offer so it says okay I heard that
someone said they need an IP address
what I'm going to do is this I am going
to look through all of the IP addresses
that I have and if I have one that's
available then I'm going to say okay
here's an IP address that you can use
let me know if you want it so that's
what the offer message is basically the
router or whatever DHCP system you have
is going to find an available IP address
and it's going to send it back and
remember your laptop it doesn't have a
valid IP address so this is going to be
sent over broadcast to so right now you
know these computers are pretty much
just shouting at each other back and
forth that's the you know digital
equivalent of it but that's what's going
on so whenever the hardest part of this
tutorial is actually just picking the
colors I want to use all right getting
kind of sidetracked here so your laptop
receives an IP address let's say 1 not 2
dot 3.8 this one's available your
laptop's going to look at it and it's
going to send back after it reviews it
something called a DHCP request message
so it looks at the available IP and it's
pretty much saying yeah that looks good
can I have it please now the last part
of this equation and kind of running out
of space here but once the router hears
that's ok the laptop looked at the IP it
said it was cool it said you know it
wanted to use it it's going to send back
an ACK so a CK so the router is going to
say ok I'm sure it's all yours and also
here's some other information that you
can use to
and it sends it not only on the IP but
also things like the subnet mask and how
long the IP can actually be at least
four and you know the routers IP and
just a bunch of other information then
it needs to be configured on the network
so the laptops receives it and
configures it to connect to the network
and boom you're good but essentially all
of this happens behind the scenes and
that's why whenever you just plug in
your Wi-Fi router usually good to go so
again any time you're at home and you
connect a device to get on the Internet
what's going to happen is it's first
going to say hey anyone who's listening
I need an IP address someone help me out
and your router is going to go hey I got
this available one let me know if you
want it and your laptop's can go yeah
that looks cool I'll take that one and
then your Wi-Fi router goes okay here's
all the information that you need to
connect and it also takes care of some
other things like whenever a device
disconnects from the network then it
automatically frees up the IP so someone
else can use it but there you go now you
guys know the basics of a DHCP
incredibly thrilling
I know but yeah hopefully you guys
enjoyed see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
