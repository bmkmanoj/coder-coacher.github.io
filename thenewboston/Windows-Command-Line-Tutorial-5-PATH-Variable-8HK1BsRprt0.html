this video I'm going to talk to you guys
about some random things the first thing
is how to change to an absolute path so
you know before we learn the command CD
we can change your directory and we can
basically move depending on where we are
so right now inside Bucky there's a
directory inside here called desktop so
we can do that well this is actually a
relative path the path desktop is
relative to wherever you are but you can
also change the directory to an absolute
path so say that you want to go to some
directory in your hard drive and you
don't want to type CD CD to get there we
can do is you can actually go CD you
start typing in the absolute path so I'm
going to write C which means my hard
drive program files now before I even
continue I want to bring up this point
so take note of what Windows did so
usually whenever we use Tab
auto-completion what it does is it just
pops in the directories name but now
what it did is it popped in the name
with double quotes around it why did it
do that
well with Windows whenever you make a
directory you can actually have a space
in your directory name so a lot of the
times whenever you're using the command
line what you do is you write in
something like a dir
slash a in this space actually means ok
this is the command and then I'm going
to separate it with a space and then
give you some options or maybe you're
changing to the desktop so you're going
to write the command name space and then
you know another part of the command in
other words the folder you want to move
into however if you just do this so for
example CD C and there's a space in your
directory name then if you don't use
those double quotes then what your
command line is going to think is that
this isn't one directories name you just
want to change your directory into C
program and then files is actually like
some weird option or something so
anytime you have a directories name or
path with a space in it you need to
surround it with double quotes and
that's your way of telling Windows hey
this is one
single path so from here let me just go
to Wireshark and then it's going to move
me to Wireshark so again that is how you
use absolute pass and now let me clear
this because I want to show you guys
this so if I just go dir now just show
you guys this real quick all right so
inside here I have executable named T
shark now this is oral isn't about T
shark I just knew that this was one
executable that I can show you guys real
quick what it does isn't really
important but you know how I said that
whenever you type the name of a file
like T Sharky XE then what it's going to
do is it's going to open in the default
program so if you were to do this with
image it would open it in your image
window if you were do it with a text
file it would open it in notepad how
however what you can do is you can
actually just type in the name of
executable and it's going to go ahead
and start running whatever the program
does so if you ever want to stop it you
can hold down control and hit C but
again I just want to point out that you
can run an executable by typing the name
of the executable all right that is
interesting I guess but why don't we
really care about that because what
didn't it be cool if you could actually
run that executable from anywhere on
your computer so let's say that you
wanted to go to a user's Bucky alright
so let's say that we were in Bucky right
now and we want it to run that t-shirt
program or some kind of executable that
I don't know maybe we made in C++ or
whatever well instead of having to go
all the way back to Wireshark there is
actually a way that we can run that
t-shirt program right from here now that
brings up this right here if you type in
path and hit enter what this is going to
do is it's going to give you windows
path so what is windows path basically
whenever you type the name of a program
holy crap can't type like t shark what
windows is going to do is it's going to
first look through your current
directory and it's going to say
nope I can't find that so if it doesn't
find it it's just going to freak out
however we can do is you can actually
take the executable and add it to your
path so your path is pretty much your
way of telling Windows hey whenever I
type in the command and you don't
recognize it first look through my
current directory
whatever directory I'm currently in if
you can't find it then go ahead and look
through all of these directories that I
give you in my path so this path
variable is a bunch of different paths
file paths separated with semicolons so
then it's going to go through and look
through each one of these for a program
called T shark so I'm just going to type
in T shark in again whenever I do this
it's going to look through my current
directory not find it and it's starting
it's going to start looking through my
path now since there is a path C program
files Wireshark it's my last one then
it's going to work just fine just like
before
so CLS clear out of there so again any
time you want to be able to run an
executable from anywhere in your
computer add it to your system path now
later on I'm going to show you guys how
to add paths to your variable through
the command line but for now I want to
show you guys just how to do it through
your GUI environment so whenever you
need to add a path to your variable then
what you do is if you right start and
you right click on computer and hit
properties you can go ahead and click on
advanced system settings in environment
variables so here you're going to see a
variable for path and if you edit this
then you can type in all the paths where
you want windows to look whenever you
type in a command so since I have
Wireshark right in there that's why I
was able to type T sharp from anywhere
on my command line and it knew to look
right here
so pretty cool and I think we're kind of
running out of time for this tutorial
but in the next tutorial I have no idea
what I'm going to cover hopefully you
guys learned something in this one if
not
I don't know what to tell you but yeah
thanks for watching and I'll see you
next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
