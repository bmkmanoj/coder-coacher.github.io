Photoshop cs6 tutorial
I'm your host buddy Blackbird and today
we're just going to go over the single
row and single column marquee selection
tools and those are up here in the top
left of our tools panel we if you click
and hold on it we've got the single row
marquee in the single column marquee and
these don't have hotkeys right now
unless you assign them to them
yourselves so let's go ahead and just
pick either/or doesn't matter so I'm
just going to pick single column then if
you go ahead and take a click into your
canvas here it will select one single
column of pixels it's a 1 1 pixel wide
so it's just selecting one row of pixels
so what can this be used for why is this
any good well one thing that it's good
for is creating anything that you want
that's one pixel obviously so if you're
working with like some pixel art
something that's like 25 pixels by 25
pixels and you're going to use that for
a video game or something like that then
this might be helpful for you and if
you're using something like you're
trying to use these guides here you
realize that these guides only go up and
down so maybe you want to start using
these guides in a like an angled fashion
that's where this comes in and it's
about pretty helpful so I'll show you a
quick way to make guides real fast so
what we want to do is you want to have a
nice dark color or something that's
really bright so maybe I'll go with this
light blue are this really light blue so
whichever works in your picture now when
you have a selection if you press o and
then backspace on the PC
it'll fill in your selection with that
color so now if I go to I should have
done this on a different layer so I'm
going to undo I'm going to step
backwards so the fill isn't there
anymore and I'm going to create a new
layer
and do this on a new layer so click on
this paper down here right next to the
trash can and it will create a new layer
for you and now we're going to create
our guide on this new layer so now I can
hit alt backspace and now I can go to
select deselect and then you can see
that there is a line there and you can
see that the guide is right there now
all we need to do is just transform this
going to edit and then let's go to
transform and we'll go to rotate and
right here on the rotate is the angle so
then you can change it to say like a 45
degree angle if you would like and there
you go
now you have your guide at 45 degrees
and since we put this on a separate
layer I'm able to move it around as I
please so you can see that this light
blue kind of has a hard time in the
inside of this really bright background
so you might want to change the color up
sometime but here it is right here so
that's just a I guess that's a quick tip
for you on how just one way on how to
use the marquee tools so the single row
if you just click it just does one
across like this so you can make the
guides either way with either of these
it's up to you so thanks for watching
this tutorial about the marquee column
tools and the Rope column or in the in
the role marquee tools hopefully you
guys can use these to help you out so
have a good one everybody</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
