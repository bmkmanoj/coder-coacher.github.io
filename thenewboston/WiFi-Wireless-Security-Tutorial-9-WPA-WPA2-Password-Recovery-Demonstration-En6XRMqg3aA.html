the concept behind cracking a WPA
password let's go ahead and perform this
attack and see if it actually works
now before this video started what I did
is I changed my Wi-Fi settings to use
WPA encryption and I also changed my
Wi-Fi password to bacon one two three so
if we get bacon 1 2 3 then we'll know
that this actually works so my card is
already in monitor mode and just so I
can actually target my own network and
not everyone else's around me what I
want to do is I just want to run
airodump-ng and WLAN 1 Mon that's the
card and I'm just going to get the MAC
address so let me stop that of this
network so this is my network Bucky's
Wi-Fi and again I'm just doing this to
target my own network so we don't
actually try to crack anyone elses by
accident and I'm broadcasting on channel
1 so let me clear out of that and run
this command again alright so - - bssid
I can say I want to target that network
which is mine and I can also specify the
channel so it's not listening on any
other channel and whenever I start
capturing these packets I actually want
to save them so to do that right - -
right and what file do you want to save
them - well I just want to save it to
desktop and I have a folder called
captures and you can name it anything
you I'm just going to name my WPA sample
whatever it looks good so now whenever I
run this what this is going to do is
going to start listening on this network
and then whenever we stop listening it's
going to write all of those results to
WPA sample so there you go I started
listening for traffic so what we need to
do right now is we need to wait until a
handshake takes place now the handshake
like we saw in the last video that's the
authentication process basically a
device proving to the access point that
it does know the password now whenever
this happens we can look at that traffic
pull all of the useful data that we need
out of it and plug it into the formula
where we can perform our dictionary
attack
so we pretty much need for some legit
person to log into the networks like an
employee a teacher whatever now if
you're like a huge office building or
like a university or something people
are going to be logging into this
network all the time however if you're a
smaller establishment or maybe just like
someone's home it may take a while for
someone to actually you know login to
the network so if you don't want to wait
what you can actually do is find someone
that's already connected and just send
them a DI authentication packet so then
you kick them off and they're kind of
logged back in right there so that's a
cool little trick but take note of this
I'm picking on my tablet and I'm not
connected yet and I'm about to type in
and password and login and watch what
happens in this top right area as soon
as we capture that authentication which
is called a handshake is going to give
us a little indicator so it's really
awesome you don't have to like guess did
I get one yet that I get one it's going
to tell you so I picked up my tablet and
we'll just pretend like I'm a teacher
like someone legit that knows the
password go to my settings choose this
network and then let me type in bacon 1
2 3 now I'm about to hit connect and
again keep your eye on that and check it
out so it says WPA handshake and this
means that we did capture one so now I
can just hold down ctrl C to stop that
we got the information that we need it
now just I can show you guys real quick
if I go to my captures right now you see
that this is the data we collected in
all these different formats I'm going to
right click this and open in Wireshark
and check it out rearrange and so you
guys can see all right so this is all
the packets that we caught and if we try
to read any of these not going to be
very successful so it's pretty obvious
that right now even though we can look
at some data it is all you know
encrypted this is useless to us so what
we're about to do next is we are going
to loop through the passwords and we're
going to plug them each into a formula
and we're going to see what one works
what you need is actually a list of
passwords and they are all over the
internet I'm going to show you the one
that I got I actually got this off of
github so these are just the top 1000
common ones one two three uh you know
password one two three four yada yada
yada and let me show you guys something
so I put my password online where yeah
where yet all right so online 420 that's
my password right here so it's going to
try all of these and then whenever gets
mine bacon one two three it's going to
go dunt-da-daaaaa well it's not actually
going to make that sound but you know
it's going to be thinking about it it's
gonna make hey I found the right
password I found something that works
and this is incredibly easy so for this
we're going to be using a tool called
aircrack-ng now I'm going to talk to you
guys about a little rant the entire
suite of tools like the collection of
tools that we're using for Wi-Fi it's
called air crack and one of the tools in
here is actually called air crack and G
so the name air crack isn't the name of
the collection it's also a name of the
tool so it gets kind of confusing but
you know don't let it throw you
so aircrack-ng that's what we're going
to do to correct the password and then
it takes two pieces of information the
first one is the capture file the one
that we just opened in a Wireshark and
mine is in desktop captures and it was
called WP a cap now the next thing it
needs is alright what are all the
passwords that you want me to try and
that was that file I just showed you
guys and it was desktop list and I
believe was called no top uh passwords
and 1000 so again in order to find the
right password all you need is a capture
file that has the handshake in it and a
list of possible passwords I'm going to
hit enter and it's going to start
looping through those in how quick did
that take like a second a second and a
half maybe and what it says is okay I
found your key bacon one two three I'm
in a blink of an eye and by the way I
just want to say that it doesn't usually
take that quick sometimes people have
like millions millions of passwords
sometimes it can take quite a long time
but I mean this is a computer just ran
through four hundred potential options
and you know like half a second and I
mean if you ever looked at anyone's a
password on their Wi-Fi they're usually
not that complex like the majority of
people so that is how you perform that
now what I'm going to do now that we
have the password is we now have all the
pieces that we need not only can we log
in to the network just using this
password but we can also start
decrypting all of that information so
now let me move over to my captures file
and what we can do here is we can run a
tool called air D cap ng and this is a
tool that you use to actually decrypt
those packets so now that we have all
the pieces what we can do is we can
start looking through these packets and
decrypting them pretty awesome so the
formula takes a couple pieces and we
already have all of them the first thing
is what's the name of the network so it
was Bucky's Wi-Fi simple enough now if
you're right - P another piece that it
needs is the password for that network
and we just figured that out was bacon 1
2 3 and the last thing you need to give
of course is a file that you want it to
decrypt so mine was WPA sample cap and
check this out so keep an eye on this
because what it's going to do is it's
actually going to build a whole new file
but this is going to be with decrypted
so the file names are kind of similar
it's going to name the same thing as
this but put a - Dec at the end so keep
your eye on this whenever I run this
command I'm going to hit enter and you
see that it generated a new file well if
I let me just open that up and Wireshark
look at that all right so now check it
out
this was our starting point all of the
encrypted
you know packets over Wi-Fi and what we
did with that password is we pretty much
use it to reverse engineer key and we
now got some beautiful decrypted
information that we can look through so
how beautiful is that
and that ladies and gentlemen is the
basic theory behind the WPA key recovery
or password recovery and also how you
can crack a password if you don't know
it and also use that password to decrypt
WPA packets so there you go then guys
for watching I will see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
