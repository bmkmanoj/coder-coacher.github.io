welcome to your third iPhone development
tutorial and in this tutorial as
promised I'm going to show you guys how
to take the icon for your program and
actually make it into a pretty sweet
icon so you probably already have icons
in here you know if you've been on
messing around with you know other
create and other programs and stuff and
if you want to get rid of every other
icon in here start out with a blank
homescreen go ahead and in your finder
what you need to do is make sure you're
in your home directory click on the
library folder alright and now click on
application support and now click i
phone simulator and move this iPhone
simulator to trash and this will pretty
much clean out your iPhone simulator and
started out brand-new so now and trust
me this is alright it's not gonna affect
your program or your interface builder
at all so anyways let's go ahead and
exit out of your iPhone simulator and in
order to get a sweet icon instead of
that dumb white one here's what you need
to do now the first thing that you need
to do is use any photo editing or you
know any image editing software I use
Photoshop when I create mine but you
need to create a 57 by 57 perfectly
square ping PNG file and that's all you
need to do I'm not going to show you how
to do because you know if you know how
to use Photoshop or paint or anything
then you know how to do this but anyways
here's what you need to do after this go
ahead and make sure your resources
folder is available in Xcode and in your
finder go to wherever you save that file
now I went ahead and I downloaded it
because um I have this file I have
Photoshop on my other computer so I had
to download it from there
but anyways wherever your ping file is
and make sure it's fifty seven by fifty
seven go ahead in from your finder drag
it over in your resources folder and now
go ahead and what you usually want to do
is
a copy of it and then go ahead and press
add and now check this out under your
resources folder now you now have that
file of what you want to do is your icon
and you know how like on your iPhone the
corners are rounded and it looks like
it's kind of glassy your ipod is going
to do this automatically so don't worry
about you know rounding out your corners
or making it try to fit in anyways what
you want to do from here now that you
got your image loaded is go ahead and
click on your files plist this is the
property list of your project or pretty
much your app now here are all the
properties that you can change but what
we want to do is change that icon file
now by default it has nothing in it
that's why I blank white icon file was
shown up go ahead and double click in
this box with the value and as the value
type in whatever your file name is named
so mine is named my icon dot ping just
like that so now when you run your
iPhone simulator you're gonna have a
suite file and while we're in here
reminds well do one other thing for your
bundle identifier this is pretty much a
unique ID for your iPhone app go ahead
and worse as your company unless your
company is actually named your company
go ahead and actually type in your
company's name and if you don't have a
company and just you know type in any
name besides your company so you know
once we're done with that we are ready
to go ahead build and run this and save
and check this out we get our app but
now when you click on the home screen oh
yeah no more boring white you know old
crappy icon week it's new sweet custom
made icon just like that and again you
can make this in any program 57 by 57
ping I like to make mine in Photoshop
because you know how like Photoshop big
deal and yeah I mean that's pretty much
how you clear out icons again if you
want to clear it out
go to your home directory a library
application support and delete
iPhone simulator file but that my
friends is how to make your own custom
icons for your iPhone apps so uh thank
you for watching this tutorial I don't
even know what I'm gonna be going over
in the next hour but trust me it's gonna
be awesome and again if you have any
questions talk to me in my forum below
I'll be happy to answer any of them for
you so thanks for watching and don't
