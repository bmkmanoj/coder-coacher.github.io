video I actually want to show you guys
something real cool and actually don't
even mind this code right down here cuz
whatever I teach you in like the next
minute I'm going to be applying two
changes to the program that we made in
the last couple tutorials but for now I
don't want to delete it all so um just
pay attention to what am i betta type
so before what I showed you guys is how
to have your computer make a simple
decision if and then you tested
something and if it was true it ran this
bit of code but if it was false then it
just pretty much skipped over it didn't
do anything well what if you want to say
okay actually I want to give you a test
and of course if it's true run this bit
but if it's not true then just don't do
nothing if it's not true then run
another bit of code by default
well the syntax for this is else and
then the code that this is going to run
by default is in between another curly
bracket and another thing I want to
point out is for the else you don't need
any tests because it's not testing
anything it's just the code that runs by
default if this test is false so what
the heck am I talking about how can I
use this in actual program well check
this out what we're doing right here is
basically saying okay this is the code
that runs if the users age is above or
equal to 18 and this is the code that
runs if they're under 18 so really don't
need to be testing 18 a bunch of times
you really only have two choices are the
18 or greater or are they not simple
enough so this is an instance where
actually we can actually use that else
statement so I'll just go ahead and copy
this code and delete this right here so
what we can do now is whenever this if
gets done right after it type else and
add two brackets and put that code right
in there so this is basically saying
right now is okay is the users age
18 or greater if it is run this bit of
code else that months mean that they're
not 18 or greater run this bit of code
so now we can run this and it says how
order you of course I'm only 12 hit
enter what is your gender I'm a male and
of course nothing to see here
now another way that we can do this is
we can actually use this else statement
on male or female because excuse me that
else statement is awesome whenever you
have two decisions so 18 or not 18
male female perfect so let's go ahead
and copy this right here or soon I'll
just cut that and delete it
so if they are male do this else if
they're not a male and that's false well
then they must be a female so we can go
ahead and type milady
so again if they're not 18 then they
must be under 18 though if they're not a
male they have to be a female duh so if
the test is true do this if not do this
simple enough so now we'll just go ahead
and check for bugs one more time if I
can move my rack in a window and let's
get to a old lady so how old are you of
course I'm 541 and I'm a female the
oldest female in the universe hit Enter
you may enter the website or mate you
may enter this website m'lady and of
course the path we took on that one is
18 and milady simple stuff but you know
how to teach you to you guys and like I
said this is the key concept to take
away the if-else statement is really
good when you have two decisions 18 or
older or excuse me 18 and above or
younger male female but now you're
saying okay what if I have a like more
than one option what if I'm selling
t-shirts and I have small medium large
extra-large
I can't just use if-else that won't work
or like what if I'm making something for
grades and it's like
ABCD what the heck do i do then well in
the next tutorial that's what we're
going to be talking about and we're
probably going to be building coolest
and most useful program yet so um well
that's all I got to say hopefully you
guys stick around and I'll see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
