Photoshop tutorial last time we talked
about fills and how to work with
gradients and this time we're actually
gonna be working on our first image
we're gonna be fixing and repairing a
simple image so the tools I'm gonna be
talking today with you guys about are
the Healing Brush tools and the clone
stamp tool
so let's first go to this first tool
called the Spot Healing Brush tool and
select it now what the Spot Healing
Brush tool is allows you to highlight a
portion of your image and it replaces it
with the surrounding pixels and this
works pretty good with small scratches
or pieces of dust on your image that you
don't want where the surrounding area is
similar to the area you want to replace
so for this scratch right here all you
would do is highlight the entire scratch
Leko and as you see Photoshop replace
the scratch where the pixels are
immediately around it again just
highlight the entire scratch or portion
of the image you don't want let it go on
Photoshop automatically replaces it
now this doesn't work so well one say
you want to replace a complex image or
area immediately surrounding it as law
such as a cereal box
as you see when we highlight it and
deselect it you get a lot of fading from
the pixels around it and it doesn't
quite work out so well so only when the
area immediately wrap immediately around
it is similar can you use this tool the
next tool is the Healing Brush tool what
this brush tool is a lot different than
the last what we talked about it allows
you to define a source and it allows you
to paint beginning with that source and
blend in it's a lot easier said to them
so let me show you to do this you hold
down the alt tab and as you see your
cursor now turns to little crosshairs
simply click and this will define your
source now I'll go to some spot where
you want to copy that image you just
clicked and simply begin painting as you
can see this image is now duplicating on
the portion of the new image that you're
painting and when you release it
attempts to blend it in with a
surrounding image so again just use alt
click
and then wherever you clicked it will
begin painting from that portion of the
image
now you may might say all right how is
this actually useful well say you wanted
to get rid of object like this corner
right here you would go to a portion of
the wall that was in the corner alt
click and as you see when you paint it
over this corner and now blend it in
with the rest of the wall and that's one
way to remove simple background objects
from your image another way is to use
the clone stamp tool now what the clone
stamp tool did does is exactly like the
healing brush I'll click and then you
can paint exactly what did before but
instead of one in when you release it
doesn't blend it in at all as you can
see the area where you stopped painting
it still has hard-to-find edges and this
is useful when you want to repaint an
area but you don't want it to blend in
and you want to keep your hard edges
such as we're moving a portion of your
image to another image and you don't
want the edges to fade now the last
section or two lon
talk to you about it's called the patch
tool what this does is totally replace a
section of your image with another so
once you have a patch tool selected say
we wanted to get rid of this corner now
here's another way to get rid of it
just go and select the entire corner
with your patch tool or any section that
you want to replace now as you see I
have two main options right here source
and destination what the source does
when you have that selected is the
portion portion of the image becomes the
source so once you have that selected
I'll move it to a blank spot and when
you release it you can see that that now
has become the source so let's go back
and select destination now when ever you
listen when you deselect and now becomes
that portion of the destination and
attempts to blend in with a photograph
and this is useful when you want to
replace certain background images it's
just another way of I guess using the
Healing Brush door or clone stamp tool
but it's more useful on larger areas so
now that we covered how to repair a
basic photograph and remove small
background objects we're ready to move
on to the next subject and if you missed
anything I went over today you can
always go to my website the new Boston
comm and I'll have a step-by-step
tutorial for better following along
