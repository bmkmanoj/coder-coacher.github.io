slash on live gamer for the new Boston
and in this tutorial we're going to be
taking a look at nested if statements
now in the last tutorial we covered else
if statements and else and now if you
don't know what an if statement is I
would suggest you move on back to one of
my earlier earlier tutorials and learn
from that note and once you know what an
if statement is then go ahead and move
on to this tutorial so basically what a
nested if statement is is that you take
one if statement and then you put
another if statement inside of this and
what that does is it makes it to where
both values have to be true for the
condition for the program inside of the
inner loop to run so let's go ahead and
create a little example of this so we're
going to go ahead and declare a variable
and this variable is going to be their
age so dim age as integer and we'll set
it equal to nothing so just in case they
don't type anything we won't get an
error when we try to print out their age
now we're going to create insurance so
we're going to dim has insurance as boo
lien and we're going to go ahead and set
that equal to nothing too so now what
we're going to do is we're going to ask
them what their age is
so we'll do console dot write line what
is your age now we're just going to set
the variable age to whatever they type
in so H equals console dot readline
now we're going to ask them if they have
insurance so we'll do console dot write
line
do you have insurance true or false and
will do has insurance equals console dot
read line now this will not work if they
type anything other than true or false
your program will get an error and it
will crash but this is just for the
second visit of a tutorial so now we're
going to create our if statement so if
age equals 16 then we want to do
whatever is inside of this if statement
so now we're going to create an if
statement side of this which is called
the nested if statement so if has
insurance equals true then we want to do
the code inside of this will just type
console dot write line you can drive
legally
now what we're going to do is we're
going to cover the case of them not
having surance so we're just going to go
ahead and type else so if age is equal
to 16 and has insurance is equal to
false because the only other option we
have for has insurance is false we're
going to type console.writeline you can
drive but don't get pulled over or you
are screwed ok so now if we run this
it's going to go ahead and say what is
your age so we'll type in 16 and I'll
say do you have insurance true or false
so if I say true it's going to say you
can drive but don't it'll say it'll say
you can drive legally now you can see
that it closed out right after we did
that so we'll just console dot readline
so it gives us time to read that before
we can close the program and I'll say
what is your age so I'll say 16 and I do
have insurance so it'll say you can
drive legally now if I type in 16 for
age and false for do you have insurance
it'll say you can drive but don't get
pulled over or you are screwed and now
if my age is not equal to 16 let's say
12 then I'll say do you have insurance
true or false
I say false it's not going to say
anything because the first value is not
true so it won't move on to the next
stuff inside of the nested loop so what
we're going to do is we're going to add
a simple else right here so if H is
equal to 16 then do the stuff in here
and else console dot write line you
cannot drive
so if we type in 12 here and then type
in false it'll say you cannot drive now
there is a better way to do this by
using what's called conditional
operators and logical operators but I
wanted to you guys I wanted to teach you
guys how to make nested if statements in
the next couple tutorials we will be
learning conditional operators and the
use for this is that age has to be equal
to 16 and if they are any older than 16
then it won't work so if I say 21 they
can legally drive but it says you cannot
drive so the way to get around this is
to use conditional operators so make
some nested if statements get used to
them and once you've got those nailed
down go ahead and move on to the next
