tutorial and in this story I'm going to
be going over some more string stuff but
is actually some more interesting stuff
so pay attention
so in this story I'm going to show you
guys how to format a string first of all
so let me show you guys with what that
means
it means how you plug in variables into
your string and I'm probably a little
different than you think so
pay attention let's go ahead and get a
string named Bucky actually let's change
it up a bit let's name it a Bucky sucker
I can't think of anything so um let's go
ahead and start writing something to put
hey there in any time let's go alright
hey there
Bucky um how's your head but any time we
want to change one of these things we're
going to need a variable and to write
variables when working with strings all
you have to do is use the percent sign
and then write what type of data it is
so instead of say we want to write a
program that says hey there and then
your custom name and then how's your and
then a custom body part so instead of
Bucky we would delete that because we
don't know what their name isn't that
yet press % s and what S means is string
so percent s together means alright you
don't know what's going in here yet but
it's going to be a string variable
instead of head press percent s and this
means all right also are present or
excuse me a percent variable next we
need two variables so just put VAR b or
something like that and now we have to
enter two variables so the first one
we'll write is something like betty and
the second one we'll write is let me
format that right and how is your foot
so now we have a string with two
variables missing from it and
another variable or another list excuse
me that has two variables so how do we
add these two together now to form a
string using this variable syntax we
have to write print to print it out on
the screen and then write the name of
your string that's missing the variables
and mine is Bucky after that use the
percent sign and using the percent sign
tells the RA we have a string with
missing variables before the percent
sign we're going to tell you what the
string is after % we're going to tell
you what the variables are so go ahead
and write Bucky percent of RB and this
means take the variables from here and
plug them in here now once you're press
Enter
hey there Betty has your foot you can
also um write something different like
VAR c and change it up a little bit like
um either tuna how's your fin
well I'm clever and now you can print
Bucky % VAR c hey there tuna how's your
fin so again this is a way you can write
a program to like customly greet
different people using the values the
input or something which I might just
show you later if I get ambitious
another thing that I want to find or I
want to show you guys is how to find
stuff in a string and this is using the
find method so let's go ahead and make
an example called example and let me
just write um hey now Bessy nice chops
and go ahead and create that
and now our example is hey there bessie
nice shops say we wanted to find one of
the words in here what we do is use the
find function and this is built-in
string method and I use a word function
when I should be using method alot but
just bear with me so go ahead and type
example find and your parameters define
any of the words in here is just that so
say we want to find
see go ahead and press enter and we're
going to get a 8 in for saying WTF does
8 mean well here's one means it searches
all along here until it finds where that
string starts so H is 0 just like on
your listing array 1 2 spaces actually
count so this is 3 4 5 6 7 and Bessie
starts at 8 again type in your name of
the string fine and the parameters of
whatever you want to find so chops let
me guess a 15 Oh 20 I was way off so
again this is 0 1 2 3 4 5 7 8 9 all the
way and chops starts at 20 that's where
the sea lions in the less Oh method I
want to talk to you guys about is
something called join now what a join
does is pretty much um takes two strings
and joins them together so say you have
one string says let's make a separator
first PE RA TR make sure I spell it
right and that our separator can be
something like that's right Hoss
so our separator is HUS now our sequence
is pretty much our sentence so let's go
ahead and write actually I think I want
to tell you save this for a next
tutorial so um and next door oh I'm
going to be talking to you guys about
joins I'm running out of time now and I
want to get in detail with this so don't
forget to check out my next tour where
I'll be showing you guys how to join or
well you'll see in the next order
but thank you guys for watching this one
hopefully you learned how to format
strings and also how to find stuff in
your string so again thank you guys for
watching and I will see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
