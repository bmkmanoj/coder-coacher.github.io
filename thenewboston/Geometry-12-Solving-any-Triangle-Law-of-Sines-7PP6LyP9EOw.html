of sines and using this law to solve
sides of a triangle and angles of a
triangle so in any triangle ABC sign a
over a so sine of this angle over this
side is equal to sine B over this side
equals sine see of this angle over this
side so now that we know what the law is
lets you do some examples so they want
us to find C so just so you know that
when we do these problems we don't have
to have all three things equal as long
as we have sine of a over a equals sine
of b over b and then we can cross
multiply to solve for them so i'm just
going to set up to eight to two equal
fractions to cross multiply so sine of
25 oh no not sign of 25 okay we only
have the measure of this angle so that
means we have to use this angle pair in
this side pair so we're going to have
sine of 35 over 20 is equal to sine of
this angle
but we actually have to know what the
measure of this angle is so say the
measure of this angle is 62 so sine of
60 to oversee now we're going to cross
multiply sign of 35 times C is equal to
20 sine of 60 due to self recei we're
going to divide sign of 35 over and
we're going to plug it into our
calculator just like that so we're going
to put parentheses around 20 sine of 60
to tie and then we're going to divide it
by sine of 35 and if you plug it in the
calculator you should get 30 point 787
remember we're always going to round to
the third decimal place so let's do
another example so we know
okay so we're trying to find C and we
know this angle and this side in this
angle so we're going to say sign of 10 /
6 is equal to sign of 150 / c multiply
both sides by C sign of 10 is equal to 6
sign of 150 because we cross multiply
and we're going to get c is equal to 6
sign of 150 / sign of 10 let me put it
in the calculator we're going to do
parentheses 6 sign of 150 parentheses
parentheses divided by sine of 10 and if
you do that you get c is equal to 17
point 276 and since we're given units
17.2 76 meters and that's all we're
going to do for today but make sure you
come back because we're going to move on
to proving that a parallelogram is a
parallelogram</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
