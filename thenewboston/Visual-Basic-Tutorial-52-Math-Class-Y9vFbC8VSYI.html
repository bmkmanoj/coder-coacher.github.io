slash on live gamer for the new Boston
and in this tutorial we're going to be
taking a look at the math class now the
math class is built into Visual Basic
and it allows you to use a bunch of math
calculations that other you would
otherwise have to create yourself so
let's go ahead and do a couple
demonstrations with what the math class
has to offer so we'll go ahead and
create a new project we will select
windows forms application and we will
call it math class and go ahead and
click OK so here's our form 1 we're
going to go ahead and shrink it down and
we will add two things we will add a
list box and we'll add a couple buttons
here
okay so we'll go ahead and rename button
1 2 pi will rename button 2 2 square
root so we'll just go ahead and type
square root and we'll name button 3
power so let's go ahead and change the
name field of some of these so we'll
type button PI button square root and
we'll do button power and we'll just
leave list box 1 as the same name so
we'll go ahead and double click on form
1 to open up our form 1 class and now
what we'll do is we'll create events for
each one of these buttons just by double
clicking on each one of them which will
make a click event so now what we're
going to do is for button pi click we're
going to create a variable so we'll
declare diameter as in integer and we'll
set it equal to 6 and we'll go ahead and
type this box 1 dot items
dot add and what we're going to do is
we're going to start by typing the
keyword math which will let us access
the math class and it says provides
constants and static methods for
trigonometry ethnic and other common
mathematical functions so what was type
math pi times 6 so what this is going to
do is going to add the number in the
list box that is pi times 6 now I'll
take the square root so well declare num
as integer and we'll set it equal to 64
then we'll add we'll type list box 1 dot
items dot add and we'll go ahead and
type math dot square root and we'll take
the square root of 64 and for the power
we will go ahead and declare another
another number so dim none as integer
we'll set that equal to 10 and then
we'll type list box 1 dot atoms dot add
math dot POW and for our arguments we're
going to have excess double and why is
double so for our x value we're going to
use num and we will just take num to the
power of 2 so if we go ahead and run
this you can see here's our form 1 and
if we click PI we're going to get 18
point 8 4 9 and you see it's a really
long um decimal number and if we click
square root we're going to get 8 because
our number was 64 and a times a equals
64 and then if we click power we're
going to get 100 which is 10 to the
power of 2 now let's go ahead and just
add another button here and this is just
something I wanted to throw into this
tutorial so we'll go ahead and add it
there and we will set the text value to
clear now we'll come up here and we'll
set the name value to button clear list
now double hit and we'll go ahead and
double click on this and we will type
Luke's box one dot
items dot clear so what this is going to
do is going to clear everything out of
the list box so if we go ahead and run
this we can click power square root of
pi we can do that as many times as we
want and then with and then if we click
clear it will clear everything out of
our list box and it will give us a clean
list box to start with so go ahead and
play around with the math class there's
a bunch of stuff you can use in there
such as you can use logs you can use min
max if you're if you know trigonometry
or anything like that then you'll be
familiar with some of these functions or
constants that are inside the math class
so go ahead and play around with those
find something that you might think is
useful later on in a program you want to
make and once you're done with that go
ahead and move on to the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
