Photoshop cs6 tutorial
I'm your host buddy Blackford and we're
gonna keep on going over the preferences
and might as well start now we're gonna
go over cursor preferences first so
let's go to edit preferences and cursors
now we've got our different cursor
options here obviously and there's not
too much so we should like blast through
this now the these cursors here are for
painting and then you just got some
other cursors and pretty much they're
for like I don't know they're pretty
much the other ones so you got the
standard here over on the right for
other cursors which is they just look
like they're icons over here and if you
hit precise you won't see the icon it'll
be a crosshair so that's what you can
use instead if you would like and then
over here we have the painting cursors
they're gonna either show like brush
tips or you can show them as their tool
box icons if you want so a standard is
going to be the toolbox icons precise
over here is going to be the crosshairs
again normal brush tip tip is going to
be this the shape of your brush tip so
this one would be a circle or if it was
a square it would be a square so
whatever you select as the brush tip
full size it shows that like the full
size of it including the feathered edges
and then you got show crosshair if you
would like and then she'll only cross
there so those should be pretty
self-explanatory then you got your brush
preview here where you can choose a
color for the preview if you would like
anything is fine really that shouldn't
really matter too much so let's head
over to the transparency and gamut
sections I'm honestly I wouldn't really
mess with anything in here but I'll go
over it a little bit with you so this
section is going to control how
Photoshop shows the transparent areas of
the document so this would be like the
background or anything yeah basically
it's going to be the background when
everything is transparent so let me X
out of this real quick and this is what
it's going to be so nothing is selected
or nothing is showing right now so it's
showing the background we go back into
the preferences here and we can change
how we want it to look that we want it
to be large squares do we want dark so I
actually prefer light and I've never
seen anybody change it to anything else
so anything here is it's up to you and
then you got your gamut warning here and
that just means when one of your values
when you're using the CMYK color space
when it goes over or out of the color
space range it's going to turn into this
color so change that to what you want um
if you're using this color then I
suggest that you change it but I mean
this isn't used this colors not use it a
whole lot so that's why they said it as
a default so I'm just used that for your
transparency this one was really quick
that's pretty cool I got 30 minutes
until they do the next sale on Steam
it's twelve twelve twenty nine right now
so I'm really looking forward to see
what they have on there actually it's a
623 so we're right in the middle of it
pretty cool I already got a few games
let's see we can come down
in two units &amp;amp; rulers that'll be our
next one so when we use our rulers which
are these things up here right now the
rulers are in inches and the type is
points so I can mess with these so we
get centimeters pixels so I mean it's
helpful to change this depending on how
you like set up your scene so if you're
working on something that should be on a
TV or monitor maybe using pixels would
help most of the time I just keep it on
inches I don't really use like
measurements on it too much but every
once in a while I do need to measure out
something so I like create a marker and
then create a marker and make sure that
they're that far that far away so
hopefully that makes sense
so pretty much we got our column sizes
here and these column sizes are used for
things like that have columns and them
such as like a flyer or like a newspaper
or magazine or something like that so
this is how the column sizes are
determined when it like makes them so
you can change those if you would want
and then you got your different
basically units of measurement that you
can use here's our new document presets
pretty easy oh um I guess I better
explain what gutter is gutter malonic no
it's the and to think of it it's the
space in between columns so that's what
the gutter is and then we can come down
here new document preset resolutions so
the this is like the printing resolution
which is like your dpi there
and then you got your screen resolution
which is for like web and stuff like
that so keep these at what they are I
would that's what I would say for now so
you got your print resolution and in
your web and TV resolution here that
those are the main two ones that you'll
use and then we got our point pica size
so this does the like the type tool so
just leave it on the PostScript that way
you don't have to deal with the point
two seven lets it really really want to
get into the traditional way there so I
guess we'll end it there seven minutes
in and let's see yeah that's all I you
know that's all I want to talk about in
this tutorial so thanks for watching
this tutorial hopefully you know it
looks like we should finish up in the
next tutorial so we'll see you guys in
that one see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
