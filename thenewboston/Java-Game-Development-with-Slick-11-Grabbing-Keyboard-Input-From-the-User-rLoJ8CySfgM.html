selectivity tutorial and now that we
understand how to get Mouse input from
the user
I'm going to teach you guys how to get
keyboard input from the user because
every cool computer game uses the
keyboard in one way or another so as you
probably notice I cleaned out everything
out of my menu class right here I pretty
much have no variables nothing in my
methods the only thing I have is this
one line because of course we still not
need that identification number for this
state right here so the first thing I
want to do well actually let me tell you
what program I'm going to be making just
for you know demonstration purposes I'm
just going to have an image on the
screen and whenever I press up down left
or right on my keyboard this image is
going to move around the screen now
obviously this isn't a very fun game but
once you understand how to use the
keyboard and get input from the user you
guys are going to understand how to do
anything with the keyboard so you know
pretty boring example but it's going to
teach you a lot of cool concepts so the
first thing I want to do is declare my
face image right up here now the reason
that I don't want to declare in any of
these methods is because whenever you
declare inside a method of course only
that method has access to it so if I
declare up here every method can access
it and we're going to be using it
actually in a bunch of different methods
as you're going to see so now what I
want to do is I want to make variables
for the x and y-coordinates I'll just
stick it at 200 and 200 to begin with so
face y-coordinate equals 200 and the
reason that I'm not just coding hard
core values and I'm actually want to use
variables for my coordinates is because
whenever we want the face to move we're
going to have to change the coordinates
now of course whenever we change
something it's easier to change a
variable hence the name variable it
varies so now that we're pretty much set
up all the variables what we can do is
we can hop over inside init and declare
the or pretty much I don't want to say
declare because you know declare means
declare variable create the initial
value for the
because well that's what it is for
initial values so the initial value for
the face and pretty much the only value
for the face is going to be new image my
beautiful face re s my face dot ping all
right so now we have my beautiful face
and it's equal to the image of my face
instead of you know an image of a banana
or a dumpster or anything like that so
after that let's go ahead and hop over
to render and inside render is basically
where we're going to draw the initial
face itself so in order to draw
something on the screen use your
graphing object draw image what do you
want to draw the face where do you want
to draw it at face x and face Y so now
if we go ahead and run this game check
it out our face well my face not ours
hopefully you don't have that same face
feel bad for you appears on the screen
pretty freakin sweet but check it out
I'm pressing the mouse button I'm
hitting you know buttons on my keyboard
nothing is happening
not a very fun game and we just are
sitting here looking at my ugly face the
whole time so let's go ahead and change
that so like I said what I want to do is
pretty much get input from the keyboard
or from the user and with that
information I'm going to determine okay
depending on what key they're holding
down determines where I want to move the
face so the first thing we need to do in
order to complete that is grab the input
from the user so input input equals GC
get input now all of the input from the
user whether it's from their mouse or
their keyboard it comes from the input
class and I'm just going to store that
all in an object called
input so now this object right here has
all of the information that we need so
we can extract the information and do
some cool things with it so even though
that this input has all the information
from the mouse
the keyboard we are only worried about
four buttons on the keyboard up down
left and right we basically want to say
first
whenever you're holding the key up then
move the face up so let's take things
one at a time and determine how to do
that first well we do that using an if
statement and we need to say okay if
input is key down obviously this method
is you know self-explanatory but it's
pretty much saying okay if the user is
pressing a certain key down then you
know do something so each key on your
keyboard has a specific code and you'll
probably see that hopefully it'll pop up
yep right here
each of these keys that you're looking
at is a code for a button on your
keyboard now you know if you want to
know anyone then know any of them
specifically then just go ahead and you
know look at the documentation online
but I'll give you guys a quick little
run-through key underscore up is the up
arrow on your keyboard and they're
pretty much all self-explanatory if you
just look through them so now we're
saying okay when the user or I should
say like this if the user is pressing
the up arrow I set up weird up arrow on
their keyboard what do you want to do
well what we want to do is we just want
to update the coordinates of this image
so once we update the coordinates of
this image it's going to look like it's
moving so let me scroll down and find
where I'm working okay so up is of
course Y vertical so face Y and the
shorthand is minus equals and I'll just
I'll just move it one pixel in this is
pretty much saying okay whenever we're
pressing up on the keyboard move the
face one pixel up or move the
coordinates one pixel up and this one
right here is going to move it 1 pixel
and if you want to move it faster then
give it you know a bigger value like 5
we'll move it 5 pixels at a time so it
would appear to be moving faster but I
only want to move it one pixel and this
is probably going to be pretty fast
itself
so now that we took care of the crap
quits Highline freakin computer now that
we took care of the up-arrow on the
computer we need to do this three more
times for down arrow left arrow and
right arrow so since this code is going
to be very similar what I'm going to do
is just move this all on one line so I
can manage it a lot easier so copy this
paste paste paste okay that one's for up
so let's do down left and for the right
arrow now of course tell any other
things we need to change is these
coordinates right here so instead of you
know moving up whenever you're heading
down if you add one to it it's going to
move it down in the Y direction now left
and right we need to change these to X
and minus and plus so now we're pretty
much saying okay when you hit that well
this is self-explanatory don't explain
that so let's go ahead and run the
scheme and get to the good thing look at
a freaking example so I'm going to go
ahead and hold upright now moving up
hold down moving down move left move
right up down left right up down left
right guys I can do this for hours
probably the coolest game in history
moving my face around the screen awesome
sell this for billions so there it is
that is how you pretty much get keyboard
input from the user and probably
whenever you're making your game you
want to do something a little more
interesting than moving my face around
the screen but that's the basics of it
so thank you guys for watching remember
to subscribe and I'll see you guys in
