and if he starts barking from there then
I'm probably going to go dropkick them
but anyways now that we understand what
a LAN is it's basically the smallest
network in this classification system a
network of computers within let's say a
single building so the next one I talked
about is a man so what is a man well we
know what it is but let's go ahead and
talk about it in computer networking
terms
it's basically bigger than land then a
LAN and another thing that you could
easily remember is that these computer
networks often span large cities so you
know if you live in a big city all of
the computers connected in the city and
this by the way is a city all of these
computers could be connected these blue
things are computers by the way computer
in this building computer in this
building all across the city different
buildings and you know different homes
too can have computers draw a computer
in they're connected these would be a
man a metropolitan but I write that down
metropolitan area network so remember a
it's bigger than the land and be it
spans large cities or maybe an entire
county so why on earth would you want a
man well for example it isn't that
everyone in the city just decided to you
know connect their computers say that
you had a hospital on this side of the
city in a hospital I don't know maybe
it's a Children's Hospital on this side
of the city and way over here I don't
know maybe you have some college doing
research well these hospitals would want
to communicate with this College so what
it would do is it would form a huge
computer network but since they aren't
in the same building what they would
need to do is they would need
to span this computer network across a
very big distance perhaps the size of
the entire city so this computer network
made up of a few hospitals and perhaps a
college or two could form a computer
network and interconnect their computers
so they can you know share research or
maybe the hospitals I just want to share
patient information but basically
whenever you have a computer network
which is just a bunch of computers
connected to one another and it spans an
entire city or you know maybe a county
this would be a man metropolitan area
network and the types of media that they
use to transfer data again
it used to be cable just you know
regular telephone cable or copper cable
that you use for your TV way back in the
day but now they use either high-speed
fiber optics if you know you have a nice
college or they sometimes just use Wi-Fi
but basically those are the two types of
cable they'll use um again it used to be
just you know copper cable and telephone
wire but now they're advancing to faster
and you know better technology</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
