position we don't need to do that
anymore but we still need to keep this
offset here in order for us to our
program to work correctly well we don't
need the line break on the end so now
what we need to do in here is we need to
use the substring replace function to
replace from a certain part of this so
we need to create a new variable or we
don't actually we need to update the
text variable using the dollar not the
pound sign substring replace remember
we're searching for the string and this
is equal to text researching in the text
substring replace inside the text what
we're looking for is replace we're
looking for the word replace at what
we're not looking at the word replace
but we're looking for what the user
specified to replace now we need the
start and the length so where are we
starting at obviously we're starting at
the offset that nore sorry we're
starting at the string position and the
length is the length of the search
character so we're starting at a string
position that's been beep that we've
been found and we're ending three
characters later for example if it was
cat so now let's check this work so
we'll come down here after this while
loop and will echo out text so let's
give this a try the cat sat on the mat
we want to search for cat and we want to
replace it with monkey so I'm going to
click find and replace the monkey sat on
the map say little clacks now we're
going to type the cat sat on the cat
search for cat and replace with monkey
find and replace you can see it's
updated both</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
