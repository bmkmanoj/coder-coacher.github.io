mouse over just to see if that makes any
difference
oh yeah we have we've got that okay so
let's try this yeah okay right okay so
let me just explain how I fixed that and
then I'll tell you how stupid I am so
we've got focus in here we'll change
this to mouse over which I guess is a
better event handler for this here focus
in would be for something like a text
field or a text area you know sort of
anything like that that we focus in
either by clicking on or tabbing to
mouse over is obviously we using our
mouse and we're going over an element
the other thing I didn't do is I set
well we'll see with just changing mouse
over we don't have any div displayed and
this is because using var here this
title variable is belongs to this
function here and when we apply it in
title in another function it's not
globally available so by removing the
var we just have this title equals
something which means it's globally
available to be used here so when we
refresh is you know available and it's a
happily working again so yeah that was a
bit long-winded and we had a couple of
problems with obviously dealing with the
code and I moved things around and
changed things around but you know it
goes to show that you've probably got
annoyed you know some of you might be
shouting at the screen but eventually we
fixed it and it's just goes to show that
fiddling with things and and thinking
logically which I'm obviously not you
know just goes to help so essentially
now that we've created our plugin that's
it you know we've we've outlined our
plugin and we've used this and etc etc
etc we could go on to for example change
some kind of setting
I'm not going to go too much into
defining session settings of you know
normally but what happens if we want to
create a say boolean parameter which you
would fade in effect or not fade in so
we could supply say true to fade in or
folks not to fade in or just not supply
it at all so inside of here what we want
to do is we want to take a parameter and
our function so we could say for example
fade and what we could do is we could go
ahead and instead of using show here we
could get rid of that and we could
create an if statement which would
supply so for example if fade equals
equals true then we would want to say
hash hover text dot fade in and then we
could fade it in say fast or something
otherwise we could go ahead and say hash
hover text dot
so so now what's happening is we're
allowing the user to sort of submit this
parameter foot fade which he that can
either true or false if it is equal to
true then we fade in otherwise we could
say if fade is equal to false then show
or fade equals equals undefined so fade
equals undefined would be to not supply
it we could say false
anyway and that would mean that we don't
fade in so let's just try it out first
of all with nothing in here its refresh
and hover over and something's gone
wrong once again let's just double check
there fade is equal to true oh no sorry
I've supplied this in the completely
wrong place no I haven't so function
fade fade it was it was true maybe we do
need to supply in here so lots of things
are going wrong no not at all let's just
go back to plug in and let's double
check this stopped fading don't show oh
sorry
else if okay right so you can really
shout at the screen now okay so now
we've just got our normal showing you
know no animation going on if I was to
change the to false we would also
obviously get the same effect where
nothing nothing fades in but if we
change this to true the promise that
we've taken which is fade is obviously
set to true now so we fade in fast
rather than just showing so when we
refresh we actually just you can see if
sort of fading in so it looks a bit
nicer so that's an example of just basic
parameter passing or argument passing
inside of your plug-in there are much
more advanced technique so go ahead to
the jQuery documentation and have a look
at how you would pass you know more
advanced option option variables to your
plugin but for now that's just a simple
plugin we've spent you know longer than
we should have probably debugging it but
then again that's just life it does
actually happen so I hope you enjoyed
creating this kind of plugin
go ahead and feel free to start making
your own plugins it's quite fun and I
hope that that you know sort of helped
you with the fact that I couldn't
actually write the code out and I was
you know messing around a bit but there
we go that's that's it but yeah your
first plugin or you know something
that's a bit more advanced than you
might usually create but nevertheless it
works and it's</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
