tutorial for the new boss in what we're
going to do in this tutorial is a theme
pretty simple tutorial pretty quick but
I'll show you what a theme is real quick
as we hit our menu item gives us two
menu our I'm sorry our menu inflator for
the most part gives us two menu items
set up this about us and this is what a
theme can do it just makes transparent
background and displays this thing that
says Travis is the coolest person I know
if you want to send him a cement truck
full bacon he would love that if you
can't afford to do so he'd also love if
you checked out his website my bring
back com2 say what's up and you know I
didn't write that that just came with
SDK Android knows me pretty well but so
yeah that's what a theme is basically
gives you a transparent background makes
your application look a little bit
sexier and that's for text activity for
the most part so what I want you guys to
do first is set up a new Android XML
layout called about and it can only
include text so just say one textview
and then type whatever you want
for the most part doesn't really care
about don't really worry about how it
looks here because it's going to kind of
wrap it and give it a theme but you know
just write some text one textview
something simple i believe you guys can
do by now i have a lot of faith in you
guys so just set that up exit out there
then create a new class called about us
a capital a capital u and set your text
view to your xml layout that you set up
again extending activity and on create
set content view set those up get that
reference going then what we need to do
is go into the Android manifest set up
our new activity and you guys want to
probably copy one that has one of these
intent filters already make sure it's
the default that's what I did I just
copied this pasted it right here which
will shift format said shift ctrl shift
format and you know copy and paste it
here change
your class name which is called about us
and change your action name to about
capital about after a package name and
again make sure it's default nothing new
so far but you know basically all we
have to do now is set this up in our
menu class again once our button about
us is pressed then we're going to do it
the old-school way the first way you
guys learn to open an activity we're
going to call intent I new intent and
then just reference our action name
which is comm dot the new Boston
dot Travis thought about or whatever you
guys decided to have your action name be
within the manifest now we have our
intent set up we're going to just say
start activity I which is the intent we
just set up nothing new so you guys are
like okay how do I get that theme going
well it's pretty simple actually all we
have to do is define that in the
manifest so we're going to open the
manifest up again and within our opening
basically a clause of our activity here
we're going to add one line to this so
I'm just going to kind of separate that
we're just going to add one line and
it's going to be referencing something
called a theme so we need to set that up
by saying Android theme and then that
equals and we're going to say at Android
because we're referring to the SDK
Android at Android and then colon and
then at an up so I'm sorry style as you
can see you can have some other things
here but we're going to say style
forward slash capital T then theme dot
capital dialogue or just dialogue with a
capital D so dialogue and I'll give us
that slick sleek and sexy theme to our
little application which is our about us
now if you guys set up like a button or
something within your XML file called
about us it's going to give you an error
because it's working with dialogue it's
working with text
so make sure you only have like one
textview or something in there no
buttons otherwise you'll get in there
but basically that's the end of this
tutorial guys pretty quick pretty simple
and adds a lot of value to your
applications for like about us or
whatever you guys want to use that theme
for but I'll catch you guys in the next
tutorial have a good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
