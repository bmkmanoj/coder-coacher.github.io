to just a random little project I
thought you guys would enjoy um today
I'm going to show you how to make it
look like a house is burning with after
effects and also i'm using andrew
creamers from videocopilot action movie
essentials he has some nice uh things
like bullet holes blood splatters I'm
going to be using a smoke thing to make
it look like this smoke coming from the
window so what I did is I already have a
project setup or excuse me footage and
it's right now it's 1080 high def and I
want to switch it to 720 so a lot of
people ask this in order to do it you
need to go ahead and change the
composition settings we do is
composition composition settings then
click unlock aspect ratio then put 1280
by 720 that's a 720 high def so now your
composition is that put your footage is
still 1080 so we need to do is select it
on the timeline and click layer
transform excuse me layer transform fit
the comp there we go right there so then
your footage becomes perfectly 720 high
def so now we got this footage of this
house just chillin here and you see if
you go ahead and here's my little smoke
thing right here you can go ahead and
drag it right there and go ahead you're
good to go but if you notice that my I
didn't use a tripod when I was doing
this in my camera was kind of shaky
because I was kind of moving around so
we need to set up a motion tracker and
what this is going to allow us to do is
to track this flyer exactly by the
window so let me just play this one more
time for you you see that the Flyers
staying in one place in the house is
kind of moving around not the effect
we're going for so in order to do this
here's what you need to do first of all
you need to click layer new null object
and this is the object that's going to
hold the tracking data so now after this
go ahead and select the house footage
right here and then go ahead and click a
track motion now from here go ahead and
grab this little I always mess up on
them grabbing it
alright this little um track motion box
and go ahead and set the point to some
place with high contrast I'm going to
set it on the corner of a window that's
black and white right like that and
remember we don't have to track this
whole footage this is 30 seconds long
because the smoke is on the eight
seconds long so we only need to track it
to length of that probably 10 seconds so
go ahead and once you got yellow
tracking point go ahead and extend that
and that's probably good right there so
go ahead and press play and as you can
see your points going to begin to track
and you can stop it as soon as it gets
to about 10 seconds probably so let's
watch it looks like it's a good track so
far and now go ahead and press stop
that's enough data for us so now what we
need to do once we have that tracking
and make sure you don't have any weird
keyframes all over go ahead and click
Edit target now we want to set it to no
one because we want tracking data to
apply to our null object so go ahead and
click OK and then you're going to need
to click apply and set it to x and y so
now you have this null objects if you
minimize these and you can look and see
all the keyframes that I've made and
they applied it to the null object so
now what we need to do is if we have a
little smoke thing on the screen right
here what we need to do is parent this
to the null object so go ahead and under
your parent tab click null one so now
your smoke is going to follow that
window just like that how awesome is
that so what we want to do now is
probably zoom in move this you know
somewhere over there maybe maybe we can
make it grow a little bit and move it a
little bit better a like that and now
you see since we put that tracking data
even though my camera shaking that fire
is staying right on there so I see one
problem with this fire already and that
set its kind of thick and smoke isn't
usually that thick so we're going to do
is go ahead under your smoke movie and
go ahead and lower the opacity just a
little bit and make sure you don't press
any key frames because if you lower the
opacity without
frames it lowers it for the entire movie
so let's go ahead and see what looks
good maybe uh somewhere around 90
because that way the smoke becomes kind
of transparent and you can usually see
through smoke a little bit so now we can
see through the trees a little bit and
that's kind of the effect we're going
for and aside from this the one other
thing I want to notice is that this
smoke you see the edges on it they are
really defined and smoke isn't really
usually that fine it kind of fades out
on the edges kind of a little gradient
so what we want to do is highlight or
smoke layer and go ahead and click
effect and blur and sharpen and might as
well go to Gaussian blur or however you
say it's not important as I say just
born how you use it so now let's see
what it looks good for blurriness let's
go ahead and turn this up to three
three-and-a-half looks pretty natural on
mine but I guess it depends on the size
of your flyer so now let's scroll out
and we see our final project so remember
the two things you want to do to the
smoke is lower the opacity and also put
a blur effect on it so let's go ahead
and watch this play and now you see our
smoke follows our house perfectly
perfectly opaque and also the nice
amount of blurriness on it so there are
a couple things you might want to do
with this like color correct the house
play with levels a little bit but for
the basics this is pretty good so thank
you guys for watching now you know how
to catch a house on fire without using
matches so don't forget to subscribe and
I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
