steering gear so this obviously uses a
steering wheel to control the direction
of your go-kart but let me go ahead and
take you guys through what each piece
does so we might as well start with the
easy part the steering wheel right here
this is of course what you hold on to
turn the left you're going to go left
turn right you're going to go right so
on and so forth now the steering wheel
is connected to this long piece and
we'll talk about that in a second but
it's connected through two u joints one
right here and one right here now the
reason it's connected between u joints
instead of going directly to this thing
is because this needs to hit exactly
into in the center of that bar you see
how it's in the middle and of course the
steering wheel is on the driver side and
not in the middle so that's how it gets
to the middle now let's talk about this
crap right now this steering wheel it
uses something called a rack &amp;amp; pinion
system P ini awone so what that means is
it's probably better if I get on this
side point the things easier this pretty
much has two gears in it right here the
pinion is a circle gear and inside this
black casing is pretty much one solid
track or one solid gear so whenever you
turn this wheel it's either going to
spin this way or this way now
essentially what that does is whenever
the gears are spinning that's either
going to pull on this or expand it
basically so therefore say you wanted to
turn I'll show you guys a real example
of prep should have done that earlier so
we're pretty much in the middle right
now now look at my hand and look where
the gears ago say I'm wanting to go left
so I'm going to spin this so what's
going to happen is the right side is
going to expand and the left side is
going to contract so if we turn right it
does the opposite thing and that's
pretty much how it works the gears
inside although you probably don't need
to know the definitions of all that so
these ends right here are ball joints
and they're going to be connected
- your steer knuckle right here now of
course whenever you pull on this our
go-kart is pretty much facing straight
right now whenever you pull on this okay
I can it's a little bit too hard but
this is going to go this way or this way
depending on if you're pulling it this
way or that way so pretty much that's
essentially what the steering column is
again steering wheel you joints the
pinion is the circle gear and the rack a
beautiful feat by the way is the long
here and it uses ball joints to uh
attached to the steering knuckle and the
steering spindle so there you go in the
next video we're actually going to be
putting this baby in</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
