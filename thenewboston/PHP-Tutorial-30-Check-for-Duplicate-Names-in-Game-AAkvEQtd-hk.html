30th PHP tutorial and in the last
tutorial as you can see we had a
function to test whether the user's name
only contain letters or numbers so if we
had named Bucky with a dollar sign or
something when it registered we gave
them the error message user name must
only contain letters or numbers so we
check for that but in this tutorial I'm
going to show you guys how to check if
the username has already been taken so
once your trying to register for
something on any website and you click
register and it says we're sorry but the
username is already in use that's what
we're going to be testing for today so
by the end of the tutorial we're going
to be checking if the username only
contains the letters in number and also
if the name was already used again and
don't forget to watch these quality
these videos and high quality and again
for the last time if you have any
questions on your code or anything you
have to post it in the forum on my
website the new boston.com I never check
my youtube messages so post it on the
new boston comm and I can help you there
now here is our old tutorial that you
guys already learned from last time this
is the function that tests whether the
user name is alphanumeric which means
contains own the letters and number if
this is true and it passes this test we
want to make a different test to test
for duplicate names like I just showed
you so let's just add a comment so we
know what we're doing test for to kid
names I know I spelled it wrong don't
comment me the first thing we need to do
is look in the database to see if the
name has already been used or not so the
first thing we need to do for this is
make a query or an action to check the
database so in our query we're going to
put select I put asterisks and what the
astrick means is select all since we
want to select all of the names in the
database to check
select all from users and remember I
told you guys to make a table called
users where username and remember I told
you guys to make a field in that table
called user name select all from the
table users where username equals oops
um where the username is equal to and
we're going to look for this right here
since this is on the variable that the
user posted this is the input whenever
they entered in that form right here is
going to be their name so I entered
white blue 19 42 is going to say all
right select all of the data from the
table where the username is equal to
whatever name they post it so it's going
to look for white blue 1942 in my case
and the next thing we have to make is
just pretty much an action that says my
SQL underscore query and in our and this
pretty much means perform the action
what action do we want to perform we
want to perform query um since whatever
you name this variable right here that's
what goes in this variable so if you
name this variable applesauce you put
apple sauce right here so this is pretty
much saying all right what action do you
want perform go ahead and perform that
action and what this is going to do is
this result is um well I just told you
guys I don't need to tell you guys again
the next thing that we're going to want
to do is make a variable called num and
this is going to be actually a number
and this is a built-in function called
my SQL underscore num underscore rows
and in your parameter type in the action
where you want to test and what this is
going to do is get all of the rows that
your action arm found so if there is one
username called white blue 1942 the
variable number is going to be set to
one if there's none then it's going to
be set to zero if there is two then it's
going to be set to two so we need this
information so we can test whether or
not we should allow the user to keep
going in a register or not so let's go
ahead and say if the variable num is
equal to zero then we want you to build
the rest of the code but if else and why
do we need a else statement because this
is the code that's going to execute if
there is already a name and use so um
when it whenever there is a naming use
what code do we want to execute um we
can echo on the screen but I'm going to
have you take it to another website I'm
going to have to say name in use HTML
and let's go ahead and put that in
double quotation marks so here is what
we have built so far the first thing
it's going to do is test if your the
name that I entered only contains
letters or numbers if it doesn't and it
contains letters or numbers it's going
to take you to thing that says invalid
name the next thing we want to do if it
passes the test then we go on to the
next step test for duplicate names and
it's going to select all it's going to
run through the database and look for
all of the instances of the name you
posted and if there are no instances
then we're going to execute this code
right here which we didn't type in yet
this is going to be for the next
tutorial
um it's going to be a next step but if
there is
name already in the database then we're
going to want to select name in use so
again right now we have to test the
first thing we're going to want to do is
test the thing is alphanumeric and the
next thing we're going to want to do is
test for duplicate names and again to
remind you guys one more time all of
this information right here is on my
website the new Boston comm so if you
don't feel like typing all this just go
to my website the new Boston comm copy
paste it in a your website BAM there you
go
so again thank you for watching make
sure to watch these videos and high
quality and make sure to subscribe to my
channel so last for the 18th time thank
you for watching and I'll see you next
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
