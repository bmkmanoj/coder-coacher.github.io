welcome to another After Effects cs6
tutorial my name is buddy Blackford and
today I'm gonna give you a little
introduction to keying and what I'm
talking about when I'm talking about
keying is taking like something off a
background like a green screen and
isolating it so the real meaning of key
is what you're actually doing is you're
creating an alpha channel that isolates
the object or whatever is going on in
the scene and you're isolating it from
the background that they're originally
shot against most of the time people are
going to shoot against a green screen
and that's because Green has less noise
in its channel that and blue is a little
bit noisier when you have someone with
like blonde hair or something like that
usually people will use a blue screen
because blonde hair kind of mixes in
with green pretty well and so they'll
use a blue screen for that it's a green
screen or a blue screen it all it is is
just a backdrop that is a solid green
color or a solid blue color now there's
different types of green screens that
people or blue screens that people will
shoot on and for example in this video
here we zoom out a little bit so this
person has pretty much just taken a
sheet that and just set it up and the
sheet is a solid color and he wants
people to pull the green screen off from
this sheet now there's problems with
this and there's good things about this
the good thing is that it's really cheap
and it's portable if you're just using
like a piece of cloth or a sheet that's
this color the bad things about it is
that you can see creases and folds in
the sheet and the worst part about this
is this person it looks like they folded
the sheet instead of rolling it up
so there's creases that'll basically
mess with your color King and not make
it so great as great the folds create
these like little shadows and you can
see that this part of the green right
here is different from the green that's
right underneath it so this is brighter
and this is darker and same with all the
folds another thing about using the
sheet is that if you don't hold it down
the wind can blow it around and that'll
definitely mess around with things and
you don't want that so another kind of
green screen that you can use would be
like a studio green screen and all you
just type in green screen studio this is
what will come up in Google Images and
it will be something like something like
this and the background is all solid
there's no creases or anything like that
which is nice and then you can put
lighting up around the bad thing about
these is that they're huge and some and
they're going to be expensive you need
to repaint these every once in a while
because they'll fade and usually people
just don't have these you have to go
like pay for use pay for their use or
something like that like companies when
I lived in California would just have
like a place where people could go and
shoot green screen and people would rent
out that place for the day now there's
other types of green screens that you
can use like ones that pop out and give
you it's kind of like a combination of
the sheet in the background
the backdrop but definitely not as big
but it's just like another type of
portable green screen that might not be
as wrinkly and stuff like that
that's pretty much if we're those kind
of green screens and a little bit about
what's going on for green screens now if
you're thinking about keying it doesn't
always have to be off of a green screen
or blue screen there is color king which
you basically is just taking out a color
so if I wanted to take out all this
green color that and just leave all the
other colors
that's called color king there is also
something called luma King which it
works well for stuff like white
backgrounds or black backgrounds pretty
much our like white text on black or
something like that which is easy to
take like the luminance values of and
keep them out and something like if
you're trying to like key out some smoke
out of like a shot that has like no
green screen background or a black
background or anything like that you're
just trying to keep out some smoke you
can use Illumina keys for that also
there's a different techniques and
different types of keys and those are
just a few of them there's three
different steps you should consider when
you're using green screens sometimes you
don't have control over every single
step but if you do consider these three
steps there is shooting your video
footage in the best quality that you can
and using a bet the best backdrop
quality that you can so you want to make
sure that you want to iron your green
screen you want to make sure that you're
shooting in the highest resolution that
you can and make sure that your lighting
is correct the next part is the actual
keying and that's what we'll be going
over in the later tutorials and the
third part is a compositing so you're
not just going to key this out and just
leave it there
and have it over a transparent
background you're gonna want to put it
into your scene so we're gonna end up
going over that also and that is called
compositing so when you take another
element and put it into another seat an
element from one set of footage and put
it into another set of footage that's
called compositing and there's ways to
make it work so that it actually looks
like it's in there obviously so those
are what the ways we can talk about
green-screen
and color keying and all that stuff is
so I'll end this introduction and let's
head on and start doing some tutorials
about what's going on just wanted to
give you guys a basic background
information on color key so see you guys
later in the next tutorial goodbye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
