with a video tutorial for the new boston
in this video we're going to look at the
button selector in jQuery so the first
thing that we're going to go ahead and
do is actually create a button on our
page let's go ahead and say input type
is equal to button our value can just be
a button and now with this we can
actually specify the button selector
inside our selector zjs file so we've
got selectors jeaious included in our
page now let's go ahead and actually try
and select this button so to select this
button or to reference this button at
any point we could either add an ID or
we could select by button so let's go
ahead and use this colon here and button
now what we've done is we've
successfully now selected all buttons on
a page so now what we could say is dot
click and we can create a callback
function in here in this event handler
and we could say alert an alert for
example hello so now for every button on
the page that's clicked remember this is
an event handler here we carry out this
function inside of here so let's go
ahead and test that we've got the button
here when we click on it we have this
hello appear here okay so because this
is an event handler that's specific to
all buttons or own or for all buttons
when we duplicate this button on the
page
okay so we've created three buttons now
we've got this one this one in this one
what our jQuery handler or selector is
going to do here is it's going to pick
up all buttons on the page so it's only
selected button or elements with the
type button so we can have a look at
this when we click here we have hello
when we click on this button we also
have hello and when we click on this
button we also have hello so for example
if I was to go ahead and change this
first one or the last one to submit this
is going to make all the difference
because when we click on this button
here and this button here this third one
is not does not match the set that has
been selected with jQuery the element
isn't a button so when we click on it
nothing happens because this is a submit
so let's take a look at this the jQuery
submit selector which is exactly the
same using a colon however we just use
submit so now what's going to happen is
when we refresh our page the first two
buttons aren't going to work but the
third one will work so we've selected
all buttons on a page so how would this
be used in a practical real-life example
well let's just say you have a lot of
buttons throughout your website and you
have this j/s file selector zas let's
just say you have a lot of submit
buttons that when pressed you want to
disable them and then go ahead and wait
for the form itself to load you might
have these submit buttons as part of a
form now if you were to create say an
inline function for each of these
buttons this is extremely inefficient so
if you reference just all buttons on a
page and carry out an action just for
them buttons this makes a first of all a
lot easier for yourself because you only
have to write a few lines of code but
not only that it actually creates a more
efficient application so let's take a
look at what I've just spoken about as
an example okay so we've got the input
type button
here let's just say that when we press
the button we want to go ahead and
create an okay so let's go ahead and
we've created our button here we've got
a type of button and value is let's just
say register we might also have a button
somewhere else on our website that's
called just submit for example a contact
form or something so we've got these two
buttons now what we want to do is when
the either of these buttons are click or
when any button on our website is
clicked we want to display the text
please wait
so let's go ahead and say submit which
we haven't got that button let's just
change these to submit so when a submit
button is clicked somewhere we want to
change the value of the the text in the
button and you could also disable it but
we won't be looking at that in this
tutorial so you can reference the the
button like submit and then you can say
atre this is a and the attribute of a
function so for example the value we can
change to please wait so don't worry if
you don't understand this functionality
just yet but essentially we're just
changing the value to please wait so now
for every button on our page when we
click on it it changes to please wait
now we do have another problem here and
this was created on purpose we have
please wait now on the buttons so what
if we had two of the same button on the
page well what we can actually do is we
can use this selector here and what this
will do is it will only change the text
for the button that was currently
selected so now let's go ahead and click
register you can see that that just that
one has changed when we click on this
one just that one there has changed so I
took this a little further than I
planned to but just for now that is the
selector the submit and the button
selector in J quick</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
