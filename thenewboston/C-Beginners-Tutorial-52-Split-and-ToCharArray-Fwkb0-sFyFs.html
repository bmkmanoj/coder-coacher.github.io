tutorial that I'm making for the New
Boston and in this tutorial I'm going to
be showing you how to use the split
method and the two character array
method so all you're going to need for
this tutorial is a button once you have
that on your form just double click on
it so here we have this string called
names and inside this name string you
have six names and each name is
separated by a semicolon well say we
wanted to create a string array where
each element inside of the string array
was one of these names well there are a
few different ways we could do this but
the easiest way is to use the split
method so the split method returns a
string array so we're going to go ahead
and create a string array right here for
it to put all the information into there
is going to call this name array then
we'll study equal to its splitting this
names so we're going to names dot split
and a split method will read until it
finds a character we wanted to split at
so we'll read these and since our
character that's separating each one of
these is a semicolon first enough of
semicolon right here
semicolon and what it will do is it will
read until it finds a semicolon I'm
going to find that semicolon it will
stop reading and then it will put it
into this string array right here then
it will skip over it and continue
reading again so I'll read Bob since it
finds a semicolon and then put it into
the string array we'll continue doing
that over and over until it find the end
of the string so what we'll be left with
is a string array that has an element
for atom Bob Jones so on that's exactly
what we wanted and you can make a
separator character any key wanted for
example if you wanted to separate by
like a period or like a parenthesis like
that you could do that but I find the
easy easiest one into a semicolon so
once you have that all set
just close the parentheses and now we'll
have a string array with atom op yo
Steve Allen and math inside of it now
we're just gonna use a for each data to
loop through this name array and make
sure that it works for each
string in this name right here and then
we're just going to print it out into a
message box so now when we bug you
should get a message box for atom Bob
Joe Steve Allen and Matt yep we own for
all and as you'd see right there we
didn't have like atoms semi colon or
semicolon Bob it just skipped over this
and that's really nice about the split
method so we don't have to worry about
fixing that up later on so that's pretty
much it could be a split method you're
now going to be moving on to the two
character array method now basically
what the two character array method will
do is it will take all the characters
inside of a string and put them into a
character array and this is very useful
when trying to get all the letters of
the alphabet or something like that so
say wanted to create a character array
for each letter of the alphabet all the
selected letters well we could or we
have to do this we'd have to do and
create an element for each one of
characters which is very time-consuming
so what we could do instead is use the
two character array method we're just
going to go up here and create a string
call letters will step is equal to all
the letters of the alphabet babies so on
now we can use the two character array
method to convert this on string right
here into a character right so it'll
create an element inside of this
character array or each character inside
of the string so we'll have an element
for a B or C and so on so now we can
just do under four letters dot two
character right and it says copies the
characters and missed instance to a
Unicode character array so it just
converts it into a character right and
now just use a for each statement to
lose character array and make sure that
it worked
all right so now we should get a message
box for a 4b proceed so on yep so that's
pretty much it for this tutorial so see
you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
