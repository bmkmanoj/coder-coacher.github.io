and in this lesson we're going to be
working in the main chat window the chat
window where everything gets displayed
all your you know little prompts that
says closing connections waiting for
connection and also when you're having
the conversation this is where all of
your messages are going to appear such
as you know client hey Bucky what's up
server not much you client um not much
just going to the movies later Juan comm
server sure what time and it says you
know stupid stuff like that so pretty
much the entire history of your
conversation is going to appear in this
chat window area so the way that we code
this is a little bit different than you
may think so I'm just going to make a
method right now that updates chat
window and guys like I said the chat
window is the main area that you can
view everything and of course this is
called show message so private show
message looks pretty good and final
string text is what we want to add in
there alright so whatever we pass in
here is basically going to be treated as
a string and it's going to arm of course
appear in our chat window I guess is the
easiest way I can explain it so I want
to mention this usually whenever you
build a GUI what you want to happen is
you build everything and say ok this is
their GUI this is what they got so
whenever we built this first we said um
let's see we gave them you know a text
area that they can type stuff into the
screen and we also gave them a chat
window that you know everything gets
displayed in and we also give them a
title bar because you know we were that
nice but what we want to do now is we
want to say ok you know that we just
built that you know GUI
well actually we want to change
something in it we want to change the
text that appears in the chat window so
instead of having to build our entire
GUI again and show it to them show the
brand new GUI what we can do is we can
actually
Update parts of the GUI instead so the
only thing we want to update is the chat
window because that's the only thing
that's going to change so in order to
update a part of your GUI what we need
to do is we actually need to use swing
utilities class and there's a method
called invoke later now what this does
is it basically allows you to create a
thread let me go ahead and make sure
everything is a there we go what this
guy does is it allows this method to say
okay I'm going to set aside a thread
that's going to update the GUI so now
anytime you want to change the GUI you
don't have to close it out and create a
new entirely new GUI you can just have a
thread that updates parts of the GUI so
why am i saying you want to update the
GUI well you want to update the part or
you want to update the text inside the
chat window so this is how you do that
so again we need since this you know
sets aside a thread we need a thread new
runnable and the method that gets called
is public void run all right so
basically what we did now is we created
a thread and whenever we want to update
the GUI then this is the method that
gets called which is run so what do you
want to update well the only thing that
we want to do is we want to add a new
line of text at the bottom of the chat
window so chat window go ahead and call
the method a pen which pretty much means
add something on what do we want to add
on
well whatever string we pass the in
which we named text and that's all what
this does is this one line of code is it
adds a message to the end of the
document and then once that message is
appended to the end of the document it
updates chat window using this bit of
code right here so again one last time
anytime that we want to send a message
for instance we type something into
on our text box right here well first of
all we type something in there it got
that text it called okay send message
and I'll say I typed in you know oMG WTF
BBQ so I type that in it calls okay send
message so it Scrolls down here it says
okay send the message oMG WTF BBQ so
what it said is except okay I said set a
lot okay take a deep breath bulky it
created a thread and it said okay I'm
going to append that text on the end of
the chat window because there's already
text that appears in there as of now and
what I'm going to do is I'm only going
to update the portion of the GUI that is
the chat window so instead of having
create an entirely new GUI that's what
you guys get an updated portion which
makes it appear flawless fluid like
you're having a nice simple conversation
and everything run smoothly so there you
go that is how you show a message on the
screen by updating that small portion of
the GUI in the next tutorial what I'm
going to be doing is I'm going to be
taking care of this one last error and
guys this is the last method that we
have to take care of in this program
which is able to type and what this does
is basically sets the text fields so
that it's editable and you can type
stuff in it
so anyways think ask for whatching
number get subscribe and I'll see you
guys in next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
