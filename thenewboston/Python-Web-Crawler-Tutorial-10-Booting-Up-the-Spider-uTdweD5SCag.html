very first spider boom look at that guy
we gave him all the information that he
needs now he's gonna go ahead and call
this boom method so death boot passing
self and before he actually just starts
crawling pages I need to say that the
very first spider that you create even
though that it's created just like all
the other ones that has a little special
job so check this out
right now in our program we don't even
have a project file we don't have those
data files so what we're gonna do is
we're gonna say hey if you are the very
first spider then you have you know kind
of an extra task what we need to do is
we need you to first go ahead and create
the project directory now after you're
done creating that project directory go
ahead and create those two data files so
again just an empty folder at first and
the name is going to be whatever the
user passed in and then just to empty
text files so once we have those created
then all of the other spiders just
pretty much just act the same just crawl
like normal now again we already created
those functions right in here so
whenever we want to create a new project
we just call this function and pass in
the name of whatever trying to create so
I'll just say create project directory
what is the name of it well whatever the
user passed in for the project name boom
roasted now once it has that folder
created let me get rid of these then the
next thing it's going to do is it can go
ahead and make files and add them to the
folder so I really just like playing
around in Photoshop so that's why I keep
going back to here
alright so create data files and check
this out it takes two pieces of
information what is your project name
and the base URL so the project name is
of course the project name and the base
URL is spider base URL now again why do
we need to throw in the bay
URL because whenever we create this
waiting list for the very first time
we're gonna go ahead and add the
homepage to it so then the spider knows
hey um what links are waiting to be
crawled
well the homepage first and then it
spiders the rest of your site for you so
actually when I said you created an
empty text file so that was kind of why
it's almost empty so after those files
are created what I'm gonna do is again
once we have spiders created we don't
want to just be reading from the files
the whole time we actually want to take
these links convert them to a set and
that is what the spider is gonna use
those sets in memory instead of reading
from the hard drive every time so
anytime you want to do that we just go
file to set take a file of links and
convert it to a set so again a spider
your queue your waiting list that you're
supposed to be working with is file to
set is this set right here so the very
first time that it boots up or a spider
is created it's going to go ahead and
get an updated list of links and save it
is a set for faster operations now again
for the spiral spiders card set set this
equal to spider
crowd file so there you go now if you
notice something I got a little it's not
really a warning it's just uh or it's
not like a err it's just a little
warning it says method boo
may be static so whenever you get this
little warning what it means is hey you
see this method right here it really
doesn't need to be a class method
because whenever you usually use class
method class methods us a sample what
you do is you use instance variables so
I'll say this spiders name for example
equals something like that however since
we made a bunch of class variables and
we aren't using a lot of instance
variables or variables that are specific
to individual spiders it's saying hey
you actually don't need to put this in a
class however send
this is actually really related to you
know spiders functionality that's what
we need to do so whenever you have a
static method in here you can't just go
ahead and run this and your program is
gonna run fine but it's just proper
coding convention if you add a static
method decorator so that's just a little
indicator to Python that says hey this
is a static method and of course we
don't need to pass self in because self
is a reference to this class yeah how do
you have it tomato tomato but now we
don't got any issues so again it's gonna
work fine before but now you know proper
pep a Python coding convention as well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
