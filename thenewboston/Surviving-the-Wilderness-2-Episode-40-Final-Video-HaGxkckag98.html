don't know if you guys just heard that
but I can finally hear a road vehicles
cars people and actually this path I'm
walking on right now it looks like cars
have driven up on it before so about
vitamins actually I see the road right
there you do that sounds beautiful well
look at this an actual road with actual
people just saw the first person I saw
in a very long time this is one of the
best feelings ever so now I either got a
flat one these people down to use your
cell phone or have them dropped me off
at a gas station but uh I'll probably
just keep walking along the road and I
don't know I'm so happy right now well
I'm at a rest stop right now there are a
couple people here some lady let me use
your cell phone and I called Joby but
evidently he's having some family
emergency so I guess Tim is gonna pick
me up I told him where I am
and he said he's gonna be here in a few
hours so
I guess until then I just got to hang
out here and wait well look who it is so
worried about you I figured it would be

I feel like crap oh yeah there you go
