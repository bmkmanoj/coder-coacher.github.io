c-sharp tutorial that I'm gonna keyboard
the new Boston and in this tutorial I'm
gonna be showing you how to use comments
so we basically know opponents are
already just to make like a simple
comment all you have to do is to forward
slashes and then following that you can
really click anything you want and this
code won't be compiled and you can
obviously put these two forward slashes
after your existing code so we just put
two forward slashes and then whatever
but what if we wanted to do multiple
lines of comments we could just do
forward slash and to achieve forward
slashes and just repeat that process
over and over but there's an easier way
if you want to have like 4050
lines of commented code so you can just
do a single forward slash and then put
an asterisk and then following that
everything will be considered a comment
now if you want to end this commenting
you can just hit enter or another
asterisks and then another forward slash
and that will just end the comment now
everything inside of here will be
considered a comment so can't think
anything out there and anything like
that
in order to add another line to a
comment all we have to do is they enter
it so now we can have 50 lines of
commented arrow comments very easy well
what if you want to comment out existing
code you could do two forward slashes
two forward slashes over and over again
or you can do forward slash and
asterisks and then end that down there
or you could just select what you want
to comment out and hit this little tool
right on the toolbar up here and it will
basically just comment out that code and
then if we want to uncomment that I'll
go to sit this button right here it will
uncomment the selected lines all right
now I'm going to show you how to
basically give a description of your
method or really anything so we were to
just create an integer right here it
would give a yeah and so if we were just
create a new integer right here it would
give us a little description of what it
is it says
represents a 32-bit signed in to do well
how do we do that it doesn't give us a
description if we were to let's say
create a new client down here it just
says class well what we can do is just
do 3 forward slashes and then summary
should pop up and basically this is just
XML and inside of here we're just going
to want to put our description for this
client class so I'm just going to say
represents many properties all right so
that's not the best description but you
get the idea so now if you want to see
this in action all the way it is for
your client right here and then right
under that give us a brief description
of what it is every other person many
properties about the person that's just
so he wrote up here
all right somehow for the client is fine
and we could do this for these
properties as well so if we wanted to
say for a summary about this we just say
represents the person's name so now if
we did see name see right there
represents the person's name and I think
it's good practice to give the
protection level if it's not public so
we could just say and I like doing this
because I write off with that know that
it's internal whatever dot name and then
it says the a for internal use only
so that we know that its internal if you
have a method you can also do that as
well but there's other things that go
along with methods so here just create a
new method called
I don't know name right here and just
have a pass through a string parameter
then if we do summary of that we'll also
get something for the parameter so we
can give a description of what this
parameter is right here and I'll just
say
name and this is this fixed I don't know
fix me fix the person's alright so now
if we do see dot oh you make these
public dude say public all right so now
could you see dot name or here you see
that it says fix the person's name and
then we're gonna click enter on that and
do it parenthesis it gives us the
description of what this string s is
says the person's name alright and then
if you were to have multiple parameters
like leave this right here we're gonna
have another parameter like int a then
we do two comments or to automatically
show up with that or you could just type
this in yourself
alright so that's pretty much it for
this tutorial so see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
