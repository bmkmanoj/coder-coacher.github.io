tutorial in this tutorial I'm going to
be teaching you guys how to get
information from the user and one of the
most popular ways to do this is by use
of the prompt command and how you do
this is with this in text anytime you
want to use the prompt command you type
in the word prompt and then inside your
parenthesis you type in whatever you
want to say in the prompt box so I'm
going to say what is your name and just
to show you guys what a prompt box looks
like it's this right here and it does
exactly like it sounds it prompts the
user to enter some kind of data and
submit it in that as you can see
whatever you type in your parameters
shows up is the question or statement so
I'll just type in Greg and then I'll
press ok and it doesn't do anything
because we haven't told JavaScript do
anything else yet so as you can see this
is one way where we can get information
from the user but now we actually want
to do something with that information
and 99% of the time what you do is set
the prompts equal to variable so I'll
set mine equal to a variable name name
now whatever we type in that blank text
box that I showed you is going to be the
value of name so as you can see whatever
I I'll just alert it which is so you
guys can see
so now it's going to ask us for our name
and it's going to tell us to type
something in and whatever we type in is
going to be the value for a name and
then it's going to alert our name
another box
I'll have it say hello and then I'll
have it say hello plus whatever our name
is using this syntax so now if I save it
it's going to ask what is your name and
I'm going to say actually I'll say I'm
like Jones and then type ok and then
it's going to say hello Mike Jones as
you can see asks us for to input some
text and then it spit out hello plus the
variable which was the prompt so now
that we got that basics down and how to
use the basics of the prompt let me
teach you guys something else you can do
and that is how to make a basic prompt
using numbers so say we have a variable
name number one and we want to set this
prompt
and we want to say enter number one now
what this is going to do is just give us
a blank screen that says enter number
one and it's going to allow us to enter
a number next we want to have another
variable called num - and we want it to
prompt us
and what we want this to say enter
number two
so now we have two text boxes and I'm
going to make this last one in the Lert
box and it's going to say alert whatever
number one times number two is so now
here's what we're telling JavaScript to
do we're going to give you a 1 number
and we're going to give you a second
number and what we want you to do is
tell us what the answer that is in an
alert box so let's save this refresh our
page it says enter number one I'm going
to enter 42 then it says okay
enter your second your second number
we're going to enter 67 and then it
gives us the answer by multiplying that
in an alert box so this is how you can
make a basic calculator with the user's
data that they enter in and this is also
how you can take the you take data from
the user and store it in a variable for
use later in your JavaScript so study
this is a very useful technique and I
don't know what we're going to be
learning in the next tutorial but it's
probably going to be fun see</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
