my SQL returned an empty result set so
now let's go ahead and search for Lily
for example so Billy on the left hand
side and then a wild-card for the rest
of the content sorry don't mean to that
click on go and you can see it returns
Billy Garrett so you can see how we can
chop and change this wild-card around in
order to produce specific results from
specific places and use well basically
using the wild-card so now let's take
this example of this now let's search
for G and our wildcard is on either side
so G can be contained anywhere in our in
our field name so let's click go you can
see it's returned Alex Garrett Dale
Garrett and Billy Garrett
but it hasn't returned Alex Malcom
because Alex Malcolm doesn't contain a G
anywhere in it so if you were to create
say a search feature in PHP which we'll
be doing a bit later on in the tutorial
and you were to be you were to be
searching for a name you would probably
use the wild-card on either side because
if the user was to search for Alex for
example and they were to click go you
could see that there produced with all
results that the first name is Alex or
Alex is found anywhere in this string
now if they were to search for say Alex
Garrett on its own then they'll
automatically be returned with the value
that equals Alex Garrett because the
wild-card is on either side leaving the
middle content as the result found so
now we can also do we can also say where
we're not like so we're not like G as we
explained as I explained before the only
result that with a wild-card on either
side and G that wasn't returned was Alex
Malcolm so this essentially reverses our
condition so if we could go where was
we're given the result Alex Malcolm okay
so that's using the not keyword with the
like or the not operator with the like
condition what we can also do is we can
say like and we can specify an
underscore so like I said before we
could say we're like equals Alex
and then we could say G underscore a RR
et TT so we know that so wherever like
is this and then we fill in somewhere
with the G so let's click go and click
go copy and paste this inverse the
clipboard and you can see we've returned
our X camera so you can see that we can
either search using a wild-card on
either side or we can use the underscore
to specify exactly the character or the
amount of catch so we could we can
double up this we can double or triple
up this underscore so we could say that
as well
let's click go you can see that that's
also returned Alex Garrett so you can
use them an underscore to search for a
specific character as well so now let's
put this into practice we want to inside
PHP create a small search engine if you
like that it's going to search these
names so what our user is going to do is
they're going to be presented with a
text area a text box rather an input
field where they can input a name and
then they can then they can be returned
the results based on what they've typed
in so let's go ahead and connect to our
database first of all we have this
connecting dot PHP which we've used in
previous examples so let's go ahead and
require that into our code okay so let's
double check that everything is working
by refreshing we've connected to our
database successfully now let's come
down and before we actually start on the
PHP code we'll create the form so form
action equals and Method equals
something so the method is post and the
action we're going back to index dot PHP
so it's basic form submission if you
don't already know how to do this then
there are tutorials on it for myself and
other people so we want that name and
then we're specified we're giving the
user an area to type in a name so the
text the input type its text and the
name we're going to say a search
underscore name let's also give them a
submit button that they can press when
they when they're finished so value
equals
and because I search in this case I
guess okay so now what we need to do is
pick this value up from PHP so let's
just double check that everything works
we've got our name we've got a text area
here where we can type a name to search
you can click search and that submits
straight back to index.php so let's go
ahead and check if the form has been
submitted first of all then we're going
to check whether the search name field
is empty or not and then after that
we're going to actually process our
query inside of our database</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
