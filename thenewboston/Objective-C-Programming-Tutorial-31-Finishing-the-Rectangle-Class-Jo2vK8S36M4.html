amazing objective-c tutorial and this is
Aria we're gonna be finishing up the
mini program that we're building a quick
recap from last time we went ahead and
we built in an interface we went ahead
and we built an implementation for this
class rectangle now it's begin now it's
begin what now it's time to begin adding
some stuff in the main method give this
program actually up and running so let's
go ahead and save some space for our
object I'm going to name my object R
because I'm too lazy to type anything
longer than that and again just
housekeeping stuff here nothing new
rectangle Alec and it's being set aside
some space for our rectangle object name
R and now that we have our object
created let's begin and start using the
methods so in R we made a method to set
the width and height so let's go ahead
and it was called set wh and look at
already filled in for us and the first
thing that we had pass in is its width
and this is 6 and then the height which
is let's go ahead and put 8 you can put
anything you want I'm just like 68
yamaraja if anyone knows what that means
then I'll leave me a comment if not
don't worry about it use any numbers you
want so now we already set the width and
height and one shebang and I'll go over
the methods later but anyways that's
what we did so now let's go ahead and
print out some stuff on the screen or
else we're just going to be you know
guessing that our program around
correctly what she need that
verification so the first thing that
we're gonna write is rectangle is let's
put percent I by percent I and what are
we going to print out for those two
variables the width and height of the
rectangle so our dot with an r dot
height pretty cool eh and now let's go
ahead and print out we need to verify
our area and perimeter
I mean we already set the width and
height that's nice no but how do we know
if our methods for area and perimeter
are working correctly
well let's print out C NS log and there
we go
make sure I have all that stuff first
there should be one button to do all
that you know so if anyone's writing
objective-c compiler use one button to
do the all that and I will love you
forever area equals percent eye and
let's go ahead and put perimeter equals
percent eye and now for our arguments
you want to pass it in just put our area
and this will call the method area
calculated and filled and proof percent
eye and I guess you bet you can't guess
what I'm gonna do next our perimeter
yeah there we go
and this is going to calculate the
perimeter and pass it in for this
percent I
so now after we're done calling all of
our methods and print everything now we
have to go ahead and release our give
the memory back to my computer because
you know it let us borrow I think it
deserves it back so let's go ahead and
build and run this and see what we get
build and run that in my little console
it down here and check it out rectangle
is six by eight
that works good that's exactly with pass
in area equals width times height and
that happens before to eight that's good
parameter is six plus 6 which is 12 8
plus 8 which is 16 and now as of 28 so
it looked like we have a nice dandy
little program here so let me I recap
one last time what we did I remain what
were you pretty much did is we've set
aside some space for this object R which
is pretty much our rectangle next we
call this method set width and height
and what did is we passed it in 6 and 8
so it took six treati is w said it is
width it took a said it is height and
it's set equal to height now what I just
said and
and it just printed out and then we
called these properties the our width in
our height and since our rectangle now
has a width and height thanks to this it
was able to print those out and last but
not least it calculated the area and the
perimeter using those values by taking
the area and returning width times
height which is 48 and I calculated the
perimeter taking the width in the height
and you know how to calculate premiere I
don't need to walk you through that but
that's pretty much what it did now that
we have this awesome program here we're
going to be doing and then next tutorial
is we're going to be building another
class to inherit from this rectangle
class by over saying oh I gotta type all
that again no no no my friend
inheritance means that all you have to
do is write one little word right here
and all of this work and all of this
work is already done for you how amazing
is that so you are going to be thanking
me ten times over in the next tutorial
for saving you time and time again
that's the Counting Crows song by the
way so for now thank you guys for
watching don't forget to subscribe to my
channel and if you want all the source
code for this tutorial I'm gonna be
posting it on my forum there's gonna be
a link below it's free for you guys my
gift to you for sticking through me for
this tutorial so one last time thank you
don't forget to check out my forum and
I'll see you guys in the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
