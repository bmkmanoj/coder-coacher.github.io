your seventh tutorial in C and this
tutorial I'm going to be going over
assignment operators encounters and
showing guys a an easier way to work
with loops so in our last tutorial I
showed you guys whenever you wanted to
increment like to counter anything you
could have counter equals counter plus
one and what this would do is add one to
the old value of counter since if it was
six before it would now make it seven
and set it equal to counter so this is a
way that you could go through while
loops and stuff like that but there's
the easier way to do just this and I'm
going to show you guys right now instead
of writing this over and over again
another way that you can do this is
write counter plus equals one and what
this would do is the exact same thing as
this it's just the easier way to write
it and another thing you can do to
increment it by 1 is equal Cantor plus
plus in this actually you would need it
like that counter plus plus right after
that and all of this means the exact
same thing in case you still don't know
what I'm talking about I'm going to show
you guys right now sorry got whooping
cough still so let's make it integer
variable and let's name it counter and
we'll set it equal to 1
got to get my cursor out of the way and
so let's make a basic while loop and in
our test condition or right while
counter is the less than 10 what do we
want to do all counter is less than 10
um let's print F let's just print on the
screen
the variable counter actually may add a
new line to this and as you can see
before um before if we wanted to go
through the loop since we need a counter
is the less than ten we need to make
this value of counter more than ten at
some point so it actually ends so let's
go ahead and write counter equals
counter plus one and as you can see what
this is going to do is loop through the
entire while loop it's going to go one
two three four five six seven eight nine
and then it's going to terminate so as
you can see you wrote one two three four
five six seven eight nine and then the
counter got more than ten so it
terminated but an easier and alternative
way to do this again as I described you
guys is write counter plus equal um
let's add one to it each time and again
this doesn't have to be one it can be
anything like three so let's add three
to each time so this should execute
three times since it's a three six nine
and then it gets more than ten so
execute compile and run come on come on
hopefully it works one four seven so
that's an easier way to go through your
counter I'm using this little operator
right here and this is called the
assignment operator what it does is take
this value and add it to this to get a
new variable and that's a neat little
trick that you can use in another thing
that I want to teach you guys why on the
subjects of loops and assignment
operators is something called the for
loop now what the for loop does is if
you know exactly how many times you're
going to want to do your loop you can
use the for loop syntax and the syntax
for this is the so pay attention
the first argument it takes is called
the initial initialization and for this
you need to set your counter equal to a
number to start just like we did up here
we're going to do the exact same thing
right here and make sure you're going to
have three arguments in here
make sure your separating them with a
semicolon and not a comma the next
argument it takes is the condition so
we're going to say all right well
counter is less than 20 let's mix things
up a bit so it's going to say all right
you're going to start at 1 you're going
to go to 20 and we in the less argument
is going to say how much do you want to
increment it by and remember we can use
any of the syntax we've used before but
plus plus makes it really easy to
increment it by 1 each time and you
don't need a semicolon after your last
one and then after all that you need to
enter your body text so in the body of
this for loop let's just put what can we
put that's really easy printf um % D the
newline um should write anything I'll
just show you guys what this means right
here and then I'll explain to you
execute compiling to run hopefully this
works and then I'll explain you guys
what was going on one last time you can
see 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 our 30 40 50
60 70 80 19 work perfectly
so to recap one more time what went on
for the for loop you can have a certain
bit of code run as many times as you
want in that and how many times depends
on what your argument is on the for loop
since it takes three arguments what you
want the number to start it is 1 what
you want the number to go to or its
limit is the second argument and how
many you want the counter to increment
by is his third argument and in case you
guys are wondering I'm going to be
posting all this code on my website the
new Boston comm so make sure to go to my
website subscribe and check it out there
in I don't know what I'm going to be
teaching in the next tutorial probably a
switch statement so make sure to learn
in this tutorial copy my code and check
out my next tutorial don't forget to
subscribe
thank you for watching now see you guys
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
