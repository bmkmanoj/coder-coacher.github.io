another PI game tutorial video in this
video what we're gonna be working on is
making our buttons responsive so we want
the button to feel like a button when we
hover over it so right now we've got our
buttons or our tax but when we hover it
it does nothing so now we want to
discuss how might we make these buttons
react to the mass going over them well
what I wanna propose is that we take you
know the the color and just make it
lighter so in the sense of green we can
make green we could have a darker green
and a lighter green the darker green is
inactive lighter green active so close
out of this close that is and the first
thing that will do it to is play so
let's scroll back up to the top here and
look at our colors so we've got white
black red yellow green and clock and
green to make a light green we can just
call this light underscore green well
say like green equals since it's red
green blue 0 255 0 so that's the
brightest green possible so then we'll
scroll back down where the heck are we
here we are and now we want to change
the color of our button depending on
whether our mouse is over the button or
not so how might we do that well we do
we know that there is if you recall from
the event loop for event in pygame dot
event not get we can free event so we'll
save and run that you don't have to type
that if you don't want but I just want
to show you guys before oh no this is
all tabbed over improperly but that's
okay we'll just have this from now deal
with it hopefully that'll work
okay so when we have the game up we can
put this down here and we can see that
it's giving us the location of our mouse
this is position and that is the
location actually my face might be over
that that is the location of the mouse
right so you can see these are all
locations this pulse so let me close out
of this so we know we can find the
location of the mouse so then we can
just throw in an if statement that is
like well if our mouse is within the
borders of our button then let's let's
go ahead and light up the button so come
back down here right before we draw the
rectangle so basically we're drawing the
rectangle here and we can say first of
all we can say the position of the
cursor so let's take her cursor equals
pie game mouse dot get underscore
position and that will be the position
of our mouse and it'll be the XY so for
example we could print the cursor and
let me make sure we're not printing
event let's stop that that's too much
spam for my tastes and let's go ahead
and save and run that and you should see
here that wherever the mouse is it's
just constantly updating the location of
mouse even if we hold it steady it's
gonna continue updating so anyway we'll
close out of this and we don't need to
be printing the cursor anymore
but it was a tuple so then we can ask
the question if the mouse is within our
like cursor area so eventually we're
gonna pack all this stuff into a
function but I just want to take it one
step at a time here so we've got first
of all what are we asking so we're
asking if if this number plus this
number so if X is between this number
and this number plus this number then
cool and then we need to ask if Y is
between this number and this number plus
this number if all those are the true
of the case and we know that the mouse
is within the boundaries of a button so
for example it would be if 150 plus 100
is greater than you could do greater
than or equal to but let's be honest the
person that's gonna be like one pixel so
we'll just use greater than four now /
zero so X and while Kiersey row is
simultaneously greater than 150 again I
recognize we're hard coding we're hard
coding a lot of this and I we we're
going to end up just turning this into a
function but I just want to use the
these for now to save us some time
because we will just convert this in a
little bit so we're asking here if the
Kiersey row is that X if it's within
those batteries and 500 plus 50 so this
number and this number so y plus the
height of the box is greater than cur
one where it is simultaneously greater
per one it simultaneously greater than
just straight up to 500 then what would
we want to do well we'll do this and
then we'll just throw an else statement
here and then we'll do the same thing
and then this is if the but if the mouse
is within the boundaries so we want to
use a light green I can't remember if I
use an underscore or what some yeah it's
a light underscore green is what we use
so we would do light underscore green if
the mouse is within those boundaries so
we can go ahead and save and run this
and we pull it up and now when we hover
our mouse over the button we see that it
gets lighter so now this looks and feels
a little bit more like a button to the
user because it is somewhat interactive
so now we have the impression that hey
this might do something let's click it
right obviously it doesn't do anything
yet
but we have an idea that it might so
cool but now we know that well we have a
slight issue here and that is that well
first of all there's a lot of hard
coding here that's a lot of code and
really we want to have like a button
function here
so that's obviously something we have to
look forward to and do but that'll have
to be in another video so that's going
to be it for this video as always thanks
