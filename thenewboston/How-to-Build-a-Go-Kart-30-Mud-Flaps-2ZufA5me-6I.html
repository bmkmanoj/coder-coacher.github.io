the mud flaps to the frame
now mud flaps of course if you can't
tell by the name what they do is they
sit over your tire and they pretty much
protect the model they act as a shield
so whenever your tire spinning and
flinging up mud then it just make sure
that doesn't get in your face and all
that so these types of mud flaps right
here they slide on to a pole that's
sticking out from the frame and that's
how they are melted itself course if
that's the case and the first thing we
need is a pole that sticks out from the
frame so go ahead and this frame right
here art it has a spot for it which is
nice and handy now that the Mountain
pole is nice and secure we're ready to
mount the mud flat now this mukluks
right here has three different places
where it kind of mounts to right here
these two brackets slide over the pulp
and it has one space for a bullet the
bottom where just bolts right on to the
frame so first what you want to do is
you want to loosen up your brackets so
make sure that they're nice and loose on
the back hand side and now slide those
over the pole first and whenever you're
going exciting I guess this only applies
to this specifically but whenever you do
little help getting things uh slid into
place just go ahead
oh love this thing
now in order to determine where it's
positioning these top two brackets the
easiest thing to do is actually screwing
your bottom bracket first because this
doesn't have a lot of leeway but as you
can see these brackets can slide a
couple inches to the left or right so
once you put the bottom bracket on your
top bones are pretty much fallen into
place and online all of these bolts use
an 8 millimeter and a 10 millimeter and
look how tiny this thing is my finger is
bigger than this why they make the bolts
this time you have no idea but they did
it still a man now since these are such
little bolts you don't want to play them
as hard as you can but tighten them snug
enough where your mouth clap isn't going
to be falling off so with the shake test
and now that passed the test
it's good to go go ahead and do the
exact same thing on the other side and
then I was you're done with this you're
ready to move on to the next step</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
