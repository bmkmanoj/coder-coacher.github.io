tutorial in this tutorial I'm going to
show you guys how to create a visual
table with our multi-dimensional arrays
that we made in our last tutorial so
let's go ahead and let's just go ahead
and make a whole new method to do this
since it'll be a lot easier and go ahead
and write public static spell it right
void main and actually it's not main
give it a name like display or something
since it's displaying your red and in
your parameters since is going to be
taking in a multi-dimensional array just
have it take one parameter in a
multi-dimensional array easy enough now
in the body of this display method we're
going to need to write two loops one
loop is going to loop through the rows
and one loop is going to loop through
the columns and actually the UM loop for
the column is going to be inside the
loop for the rows so go ahead and write
your first for loop and put in a row or
something so you can see that's looping
through the rows and just set that equal
to zero and then put Rho is less than X
length or whatever you use up here and
then just put incrementing by one and
now inside this for loop we want another
loop to loop through the columns so
let's put four and put int column pull u
n n there we go equals zero since we
want to start at the 0th index then you
want it to be let's see column is less
than X because that's what we passed
into it row and then we want just the
length of that so what this would do is
loop through on the exact length no more
no less that's a neat little trick so
anytime you're making a for loop to do
this inside instead of just X length
because you don't want the length of
that you want the length of the row so
that's how you do this so and then just
put increment by one
CEO Lu men can't spell column there we
go and this is your syntax for your
inside loop set equal to zero have it go
until the end of the row and just
increment it by one
so now for the body of text we need for
this is we just want it to input or
excuse me
output the rows on the screen so
system.out.print make a simple print
statement not a print line because we
don't we all want to have it in a rows
and we don't want a new line every time
where that would be a new row so let's
go ahead and just print X row column and
what this is going to do take the index
of row which is going to start at 0 and
this is going to start at 0 every time
and this is going to print out our rows
and so let's just add a little spacer in
between a new tab and this would just
give us some space between our numbers
so now that we have another row let's go
ahead and just make a new line so let's
put system.out.print line so here is the
end I forgot a semicolon right there so
here's what this method does the first
argument it takes is the row number and
the second argument it takes is the
column number it loops through in and
what this does right here
is it just prints a row and what this
does is when you get to the end of the
row it's going to move down a new line
so you print a new row if I didn't have
this it would print everything all on
one row and I don't want that so that's
why I added this so now we have a couple
arrays and we have a method to print out
those erased let's make sure I got my
curly brackets and right
there we go should be good so now I have
a race a method to print out those are
race now let's actually call that method
so all we would do let's say I make a
print statement so we see what's going
on print line and just put something
like this is the first array
and to call this what you would do is
simply put display since this is the
name of our method and you want to pass
it an array so let's go ahead put first
array and again you don't need I spell
array with 3 R's
yes I did and again you don't need to
put any number of elements since it
already knows so next let's just do our
other one
system.out.print line and then just
write this is the second array and then
just display that to not the Splatt
display second array there we go
should be good so now let me run this
make sure it works and I'll show you
guys and take note in my first array
there are two rows the first row has 8 9
10 11 second row has 12 13 14 15 and
then my second row I have three rows
with all different column lengths so now
if we look at this visually in my first
array what sex ed firts array spelled
that wrong has 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 in
this row and again that's this in the
first row and this in the second row and
in my second array let's see what I got
30 31 32 33 4 values in the first row
this one in the second row and 3 in the
last row so again that's 4 1 and then 3
so that's how you print out visually on
your table in a multi-dimensional array
so let me explain you guys one last time
how this works and hopefully this will
clear some things up we went and we had
ahead and made some multi-dimensional
arrays using our two square brackets and
kind of putting arrays in an array
that's what multi-dimensional array is
this calls the function or the method
excuse me and what the method is or how
it works is this um this is just
housekeeping stuff we wanted to pass a
multi-dimensional array so we
make a multi-dimensional array we just
named X so we can use it in our method
so the first thing we do this entire
thing is a for statement right here and
this is loops through the rows or the
first ones and inside that you need to
loop through the columns or the second
one and then we went in head and just
printed it out with spaces in between
and once we got to the end of a row we
just printed a whole new line so that is
how you do that and again what we did
right here was called making a visual
table using a multi-dimensional array so
again just copy exactly as I did and
once you type it for yourself you'll
understand a lot better but for now
that's all I got for you for this
tutorial in the next tutorial um I'll
probably do something a little bit
easier but just as useful so thank you
guys for watching I hope you subscribe
