tutorial that I'm making for the new
Boston and in this tutorial we're going
to continue working in our hangman
project and basically what we're going
to be doing is generating a random word
that will be used in our game so we're
going to go over to the coder here and
create a new method that will return a
random word since it's going to be
returning a word we're just going
community return type string so string
and I'm just going to name this one I 50
get random word and since we don't need
the user to pass through any parameters
we can just leave this applying all
right now there are many different ways
of going about getting a random word but
we're going to be doing is downloading a
web page it has basically a big list of
words on it and then we're going to
convert that into a string array using
the split method and finally we're going
to use the random class to generate a
random index of that array so we're
basically getting a random word from
that array all right so first we're
going to have to actually find that big
list of words so we're just going to go
on Google right here and type in handy
word list and just click the first link
right here and basically they're just
like different categories of words just
pick one that has its relatively big
don't pick something like this 27000
because that's going to take a while to
actually download the web page so I'd
say around a thousand is a good size so
I'm just going to choose just adjectives
extra right here alright so here we have
this big list of words and we're just
going to be using a web client to
download all these words or this huge
string right here so we're going to go
back into c-sharp and say using a system
that met so that we have access to that
web client class so system net alright
and then we can say web client I'll just
call it WC and set it equal to a new web
client and then we're going to create a
new string called word list and study
equal to that webpage downloaded and
what is going to download the string and
we're just going to need the address and
the you are
l of that webpage and I'm just going to
paste right in there since I already
copied it and basically this string word
list now is equal to all of these words
and since we want to make it into a
string array we're going to use the
split method so we're going to say
string array words equals word list dot
split and the character that we're going
to be splitting at is a newline and to
represent a newline you're just going to
want to do a backslash and then an N and
that represents a line and the reason
that you can have two characters in here
is because this is considered one
character since it's just a newline or
represents a new one so I'm just going
to finish that off with another symbol
quote right there and now inside of this
string or a words will be an element for
each one of these words so the first one
will be appreciable and appropriate
artificial and so on all right and then
we're just going to want to create a new
instance of the random class to generate
a random index for our words all right
so we're going to say random all this
all brand instead of equals three new
random and then we're going to say
return words words and then the index
that we want to return is going to be
random so we're going to use our random
class right here and then I'm going to
say random dot next and then the minimal
or the minimum that it will generate
will be a zero and the maximum that I
can do is words dot length minus one
because the words length will return
like if there were let's say five in the
entire array it would return five but
the maximum index would be four since it
starts at zero so that's why we have to
do the negative one right here all right
now let's just call this method when I
guess I'm just draw hang post method
since this is called when the form is
shown it's always going to call it and
here we're just going to say get random
word and we're just going to display
this random word and
message box message bar show just random
word right here just to make sure that
actually did get a random order so now
Nikki bug we see it got weaker if your
daddy book again it should get something
different
true yeah so there we go just generates
random words
in the next tutorial we're going to get
into actually drawing like the
underscores inside of this screw box
right here so see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
