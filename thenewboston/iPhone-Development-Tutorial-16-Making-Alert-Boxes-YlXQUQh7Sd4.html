16th iphone development tutorial and the
story i'm going to be clearing up any
confusion you may have about protocols
delegates action sheets or anything like
that so check this out we went ahead and
we adopted this protocol in the last
oriole and by doing so we pretty much
said all right we know you already have
a bunch of built-in methods to go along
with that action sheet so then later on
we built this method called a button
pressed and inside it we said delegate
self and what this means is it pretty
much said all right for those bill and
methods that we already imported to go
ahead and handle the action sheet where
are those methods and we said whoa there
in the same class is our class but if
you want a head and looked around there
are no methods to handle this action
sheet well that's where we're going to
be building in this story last part
sauriol so let's go ahead and do so so
the method that we want to happen to
handle this action sheet is void that's
what it's going to return and go to type
action sheet and we don't want cancel
its action sheet and the first parameter
is you I action sheet asterix and action
sheets and there are a bunch of
different parameters you can have what
we want to do is will dismiss with
button and next make sure I didn't type
anything around and as a parameter it's
going to type NS integer and just going
off the screen here button index all
right now before we go ahead and build
body let's go ahead and talk about this
header what's it mean all right so these
are action sheet methods but what's this
parameter will dismiss with bun minix
well there are a lot of different
methods you can use but what this one is
going to do is it's going to run this
bit of code automatically when you
dismiss the action sheet and what that
means pretty much click a button and get
rid of the action sheet server saying
all right so what's this this button
index is each button on your action
sheet has an index either I think cancel
is negative 1 and then the rest of buns
are like 0 1 2 3 I don't know I don't
know the indexes by heart but doesn't
really matter so in order to see what
button you clicked to appropriately
handle your code you pass it a bun index
so every saying alright if you've has a
negative 1 cancel the program something
like that so anyways this bit of code we
type in here is automatically going to
run whenever we dismiss our action sheet
so with that being said let's go ahead
and type something in here so we pretty
much already have a built-in I mean it
automatically cancels whenever you click
that cancel button we don't need any
code for that but what we do need is a
bit of code to run if you don't click
that cancel button so let's go ahead and
make an F and oh yeah there we go
condition already popped up so we'll say
if that button index if the button we
clicked is not equal to action sheet
alright so here's what we're saying all
right if the button we click is not
equal to the cancel button then by
default it must have been the go-ahead
bun so what do we want to do when you
click the ok button well what we want to
do in this case is just create a basic
alert so if you're saying all right how
do you do that in by the way I'm
creating an alert because I show you I
want to show you guys how to create an
alert you don't have to create an alert
you can put anything in here you want to
do you can make your screen turn
different color you can I you know go to
another view you can you know pretty
much give them a hot dog but I want to
create an alert so you I alert view
here's how you create an alert by the
way and i'm going to name mine alert and
what you need to do is you need to say
it equal to a bunch of stuff and a bunch
of crap is going to pop up you i alert
view allocate some space for it and
again a bunch of crap is going to pop up
just like when you created your um
action sheet so initiate with title I'll
say ok here it is now let's go ahead and
give some space to work with alright for
the message this is what's going to
appear well it's pretty much going to
appear in the middle of your alert say
so let's go ahead and say bacon is good
mmm I mean why not you can say anything
so in the delegate for this is just like
before you can have a delicate but go
ahead and press self and for the cancel
button title this cancel button is of
course what do you want to appear on the
cancel button and go ahead and press
done and other button titles we don't
have any other buttons so go ahead
and press no right here get on my way no
all right really other bun as soon as I
type something me move all right so go
ahead and after this what we need to do
is be able to show this alert on the
screen so go ahead and type the name of
your alert alert show and you also want
to release it alert release all right so
I mean that's all we need to do so what
we're saying is all right we know that
this method is automatically going to
get rimmed ran whenever we click
anything on the action sheet so we're
saying is all right if we click the
cancel button of course cancel the extra
sheet but if we click the ok button then
we want to show this alert so let's go
ahead build and run this see if we got
any airs and we succeeded so all right
switches we know what this does the
button once you click it now an action
sheet pops up and it says want to see mm
er we can click cancel and that cancels
out a bit but check this out if we click
the so-called destructive button which
is really not destructive at all another
pops up that says bacon is good um and
let me just see one thing let me just
quit this and I think that if you for
delegate um if you go ahead and click an
ill then I know it's going to happen
here but I think this is what I commonly
do so let me see if this still works fun
I'm bun yep good okay all right so I
think if it doesn't have a delegate then
you can go ahead and pass and no and
remember a delegate is code that you
want automatically to run at a certain
point of time but you know we don't want
any bit of code to run so we can go
ahead and pass in no for right there so
one last time what we did and by the way
well let me tell you guys through this
sense we needed this method right here
this was a built-in method we all we
needed to do is build the body and since
we needed this
method for our program we needed to go
ahead and adopt it in our protocol and
by adopting it it pretty much made the
header for us and said all right all you
need to do whenever you need this method
is to create the body so let me set all
right whenever we click our button what
do we want to happen we want to build an
action sheet and we want to tell that
action sheet that that method that we
adopted is in the same class so it
showed the action sheet and did
everything like that and now once you
exit it out of the action sheet it
called this method right here and what
this method did is pretty much looked at
what button you click if you click
cancel to cancel it out of action sheet
but if you click that ok button then
what it did is pretty much just created
an alert using these parameters show the
alert on the screen and released it for
a memory so what a couple of tutorials
now you know how to create action sheets
and alerts as well and now you know a
little bit about protocols which is
pretty much built in methods that we can
use and also delegates which is pretty
much code that runs at a specified point
automatically so that's that for this
tutorial I hope you guys enjoyed and uh
I mean if you need any help just ask me
in my forum please don't send me a
message in my inbox because I never
looked it so thank you guys for watching
I'm going to go take a nap or something
and I'll see you next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
