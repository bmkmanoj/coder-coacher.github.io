method to pretty much drop the balls
from the top of the screen we just have
to make a real quick animation
essentially saying how often do you want
to do that and we'll set it so we're
like two seconds and see how that plays
out so we're going to put it right
inside in it shooter scene because as
soon as the user pretty much opens the
scene we want the balls to start
dropping as soon as the level begins so
I'll add a comment say drop the balls
from the top and I'll make a drop balls
variable looking good all right so of
course it's action so SK action and we
actually want to create a sequence now
we want to do this because what's going
to happen is we're going to call the
method and part two of it is we're just
going to wait for a certain duration so
drop the ball and then wait for two
seconds so I know it's kind of weird
sequence really short one but it is a
sequence so for the actions SK action
run blocks since we're running a block
of code and inside here put your little
curly braces as well clean this up a
little bit show you how do I want to do
this
all right so create ball node right
there now make sure I got my crap in the
right place
clean this up a little bit all right so
that's the first section and the second
one is SK action wait for duration how
long do you want to wait for we'll just
say two right now even though it's
probably going to be pretty slow now
actually let me just tighten this up so
many braces and brackets and grab all
right so now what we did is we just
created a sequence what we have to do
after this is actually just kick it off
or run it so self run action SK action
repeat action so we're going to drop the
balls and we're just going to repeat
that and first of all what action you
want to repeat well how about that one
called draw balls that we just created
how many times you want to repeat it and
remember up here we added an enemy camp
that's how many enemies we have in other
words that's how many times we're going
to repeat it so we can just throw an
enemy count right there now after this
I'm just going to call completion nil
all right so everything is looking good
created the method to drop the balls or
this pretty much creates a ball this
pretty much is a really simple sequence
that says call that method then wait two
seconds so they are just appearing all
at once and this is just animation that
kicks it off so let's go ahead and run
this now and hopefully fudge anything up
probably did though tap it and as soon
as it happens the balls start falling
and of course our dude can fire them all
right so pretty sweet and since they
already have collision detection set up
if you guys notice whenever he hits one
I'll get one eventually they are
impacted but it would be cool if we had
them explode or something like that and
another thing I want to point out is
this if we go to did move to view the
very first thing we can call
I saw that those balls were falling kind
of quick and that is well realistic in
the real world but I'm going to slow
down bed since I can you know it's just
a game this is my world so in the fix
physics world in other words the world
that we're creating we just want to
change the gravity of it and of course
the gravity is a force and that is a
vector make oh I'm on it and zero we
don't want to change it in the
x-direction but we do want to tweak it
to like negative 1.2 we'll see how that
is now again negative is down actually
if you have a vector like um if you set
it like it 1 they're actually going to
flow up we don't want that so make sure
your Y Direction is negative so they
actually fall down and that might be a
little slow but it's actually pretty
good just for teaching I don't want them
too fast all right so we are now
shooting these balls pretty awesome but
of course I want these balls to start
blowing up in some cool effects ton of
stuff to do so for now that's pretty
good so uh yeah I'll see you guys in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
