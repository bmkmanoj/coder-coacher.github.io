buddy Blackford here with another
Photoshop cs6 tutorial today we're going
to be working with the magic eraser tool
and that can be found in the eraser
section of the tools if you click and
hold down we've got the magic eraser
tool here at the bottom hockey is e the
magic eraser tool works a lot like the
paint bucket tool and it's kind of like
has the opposite effect so with the
paint bucket tool you can click in an
adds color to the image with a magic
magic eraser tool you can click and it
takes away color from the image we put
this back at 100 because I was the
default so if I click in this sky it's
going to take this color from the sky
way too much weight took way too much
color out of that let's try to mess with
our tolerance here so I can show you and
you can with enough tweaking and
everything you can take out certain
colors of your image so i just got to
end up bringing this down and tweaking
this more and more until I can get the
correct color going on here so this is
kind of close and then I could have got
if I wanted to I could go in ahead and
put a new whole new color in there and
that's like kind of like how the that's
how the magic eraser tool works so I'm
going to go back to the magic eraser
tool real quick and bring our sky back
in here so we've got a couple options up
here and tolerance you should know by
now if you've been watching to the
tutorials it's the amount of color range
that you're going to be erasing so a low
tolerance takes a low range of colors so
there's a whole bunch of different
colored pixels in this sky and I'm
taking a range of 30 pixels going from
me each side of the color that I
selected now anti-alias here you want to
have that checked to create a visually
softer erase so yeah it smoothes the
edges we've got a contiguous here which
when you have this box checked
it selects the adjacent pixels within
the document when you have sample all
layers checked if you have multiple
layers on here it's going to treat treat
it like the layers have been merged so
it's going to treat it like a composite
document in which you can click anywhere
and it will take from any of the layers
that you have on there so if you have
have you had just this image here with
no sky and then another layer with the
background that's a sky and you just
clicked on any of the layers while you
have sample all layers checked it'll
erase from anywhere no matter what layer
your selected already so that's a pretty
much how the magic eraser tool works
it's a lot mostly it's just messing with
the tolerance getting the tolerance that
you need to erase this and basically
just fiddling with the tolerance a lot
so if I was if I like finally like fine
tweet this and got all this stuff out I
could use my other eraser tool my
background eraser tool and I want to
only erase this blue here that's around
the Sun so I can keep on erasing and
just work keep on work got work on that
then I can have like some really
nice-looking images if I take my time
and go in and manually erase some of the
stuff that I don't want anymore so all
that comes like the tools they all go
hand in hand with the eraser tools you
can use the regular eraser tool to do
though some rough editing and then the
magic eraser tool as well to do some
rough editing and just you can use the
other ones to go in and do some fine
tuning where you need to so that's all I
need to show you with the magic eraser
tool it's basically like the paint
bucket tool but it does the opposite it
takes away color instead of bringing in
color so thanks a lot for watching this
tutorial and I hope you learned
something and I say in the next one have
a good one everybody</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
