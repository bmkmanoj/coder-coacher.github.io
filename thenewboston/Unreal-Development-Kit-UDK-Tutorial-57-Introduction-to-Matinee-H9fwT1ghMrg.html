57th udk tutorial and in this tutorial
we're going to meet TG and guys about
something called matinee now matinee is
basically the you decays animation
program now I'm going to be doing things
a little bit unorthodox for me I usually
show you guys the program and you know
give you guys the pieces of it and tell
you guys how it works but I'm going to
be doing something a little bit
different like I said I'm going to be
building a simple program using matinee
and demonstrating how matinee works and
then once you guys get a good idea of
what exactly matinee is and how it can
be used I'm going to be going through
the pieces so it's definitely a better
way of learning matinee so let me go
ahead and do that right now so what I'm
going to be doing is I already have this
map open remember this is the map I
taught you guys how to use static meshes
on and what I'm going to be doing is
adding a door right in front of here now
whenever our user walks over the bridge
it's going to open that door and I don't
know maybe close it later on I haven't
decided yet I really don't plan out my
tutorials so let me go ahead and open my
content browser and I'm going to go
ahead and clear everything out and look
for static meshes I'm just going to go
ahead and look for a door and find kind
of a square one I guess I'll use this
one right here so go ahead and
right-click and make sure it's fully
loaded just like me which it is and go
ahead and select it right there and
we're going to want to be bringing this
in as an interp actor so go ahead and
right click and hit add interp actor
right there so looks pretty good i just
want to position the first thing i want
to do is grow this so maybe 1.5 and not
quite big enough so 1.65 alright looks
pretty good so all right so that blocks
our players sufficiently so now all I
want to do is Center this bad boy right
here
and that looks centered and also maybe
bring it out just a hair so let me go
ahead and push it forward oops grab the
wrong thing Lee Roth go ahead and push
that forward okay so that looks pretty
good right there that door position so
eventually like I said what I want to be
doing is having our user walk over this
bridge and once they had a checkpoint on
this bridge I'm going to be sliding this
door down just like that however I'm not
going to be doing it right here in my
perspective view i'm actually going to
be doing it in a program called matt
name so let me go ahead and do that
right now and position my camera a
little better and that's some good
position and you can see a statue and
background and everything so the very
first thing we need to do is add a
trigger on this bridge so whenever our
user clicks this trigger it knows to
send a message to this door so in case
you guys forgot how to add triggers you
go ahead and right click where you want
to add it and we want to add an actor
and add a trigger so right now the
radius is a little bit small so I'm
going to go ahead and move that to the
center and if I hit f4 I bring up my
properties for this in under collision
under collision radius just go ahead and
change this to like 100 or something
like that and now you can see I have a
huge closing radius and actually my
collision height might as well change
that to 102 just so you know they can't
hop over the trigger or anything so now
check it out whenever my user walks
across this bridge they're going to hit
this trigger and then that's going to
send a message to this gate eventually
saying hey gate you need to do something
so now let's go ahead and start
programming this is in kismet so we can
go ahead and X out of this and select
your trigger right here and open kids
map and what we want to do is with our
trigger selected make sure it's selected
right there go ahead and right click and
hit new event using trigger and we can
just make a touch so whenever they bump
into that trigger in any kind of
way it's going to send a message out
through here this touch but what exactly
is the message that we want to send well
what we want to do is we want to create
an animation of the skate sliding down
and remember I said animation is
basically called a matinee in the UDK so
go ahead and you're going to want to
select new matinee this pretty much is
like a little movie that's going to play
so the first thing I want to do is
actually position this right there and I
want to say all right whenever I touch
my trigger I want to play my animation
or play my matinee so says all right so
Bucky you made this game it's awesome
game whenever they touch the trigger on
the bridge you want to play movie but
what the heck am I supposed to play am I
supposed to move this light up and down
am I supposed to rotate this bridge am I
supposed to you know flip this panel
upside down I don't know what movie you
want me to play so in order to give it
that information what we need to do is
this go ahead and double-click matinee
and then we got this huge beast that
opens up so again like I said I'm not
going to be talking guys through the
pieces in this tutorial I'm just going
to be giving you guys a real quick
demonstration of how matinee works and
actually I think I'm going to be doing
that in the next tutorial so my video
file doesn't get too big so in the next
tutorial that's what you have to look
forward to so for now thank you guys for
watching don't forget to subscribe and
I'll see you guys then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
