would like to do is continue making our
navigation bar and what I was actually
going to do is I was just going to add
each item to the bar as we need it but
then I was like you know let's just go
ahead and design this entire thing and
even though we don't have an ad album
section or a song section we'll just
make those dead links right now no just
link them to the proper sections
whenever we make them so I figured as
long as we're in here might as well just
go ahead and design everything so I'm
going to copy this and paste in
everything I need in our I so we already
know this is this is just boostrap and
this is just a link to our static file
our CSS file now these other ones are
just really easy these are just external
files kind of like bootstrap that I'm
included this one is just for the font
you see this cursive font arm and that
is from Google so if you go to google
fonts go ahead and check out all their
fonts they're actually awesome and
they're all free so you can use them on
your website and this one in this one
these are just jQuery and bootstraps
javascript file so bootstrap actually is
not only a design framework it actually
comes with some cool functionality and
the reason that I'm cluding this is
because our menu just like this one is
going to have a bunch of items albums
songs this form at album logout and a
cool part about bootstrap is you can
actually set it up where if your website
actually gets too small like this
actually it works better on mine so if
we have a bunch of items in we're
looking at this on a device that doesn't
have room to display all those items
then instead it's just going to make a
little icon where you can click it in a
menu appears with all the items on there
so usually that would be a pain in the
butt to design writing all the
JavaScript for it but that's one cool
thing about bootstrap it already comes
with that functionality so yeah that's
what all those files are and also I'm
also going to change this from navbar
default to navbar inverse so if i
refresh this you guys can see it just
pretty much
changes the color to a dark theme rather
than a light thing because if I just
have everything like a little shade of
light gray I think I'll look a little
bit weird
alright so navbar header so right now we
just have our logo in there which looks
our right but we actually need to add
one other thing to this and this is that
conditional button so again this is the
button that's actually going to appear
if the device doesn't have room to
display all of our items it's going to
turn into a menu instead so let me just
get that in all right so this button is
just going to be a type of button whoo
what a guest in the class for this is
actually navbar toggle and again these
classes aren't classes that we have to
write ourselves these all came with
bootstrap if you want to know more about
bootstrap I made another tutorial series
about it but there you go so this data
toggle is just collapse in the dead
Target you're going to set this equal to
in this actually doesn't even matter
this name but mine is top nav bar so
basically all of your items in here such
as albums songs you're going to surround
in a container and I just going to name
my container top navbar and that way it
knows alright whenever you click this
button it's supposed to toggle those or
make them visible or invisible all
bootstrap stuff and now some weird thing
about bootstrap you actually need to
make let me show you this alright so you
know in Google Chrome it has this little
hamburger icon and has three lines boom
boom boom and also like an Android and
I'm pretty sure I phone has it to this
button with three lines well for some
reason in bootstrap you have to make
every line on that button individually I
have no idea why they made it that way
but whatever alright so the class is
icon bar oh no I guess some people only
wanted one line on it so if you only
want one line on it then just go ahead
and do that but I want three lines on
mine like a normal human being so there
you go
and I don't know if it'll even pop-up
now since we don't have any items
alright so check it out so what we're
doing is whenever our screen is too
small it displays this button and
whenever we expand it and it has a room
for all of them that button disappears
and later on once we have items in our
navigation menu whenever we click this
it's going to display those but we don't
already so or not right now so that's
why nothing happens so that little
section is taken care of
boom roasted and let me change this to
the header since it's not only the logo
anymore it includes those buttons so now
right under this or start making those
individual items alright so what do we
have on our menu
this album's button a songs button and a
form so this entire thing is a search
form and then we have two buttons off to
the right and add album and a logout
button so I actually want to put those
in the div and this div is just going to
have the class of collapse
navbar collapse so this little section
that's going to hold all of our
navigation items is going to be
collapsible so that's what's going to be
hidden unless we click that button on
smaller screens so let's go ahead and
add those two buttons first and to add
those we just make an unordered list and
the class of this is nav nav bar nav and
now we just make our list items so the
first one is the album and how am I
going to do this right now I know that
they aren't actually going to work right
now so later on we're going to have a
class but yeah I'll talk to you guys
about that later
art so basically inside every single
list item what I'm going to have is a
link
and this one can just link to the
homepage so we can just copy that now
inside this first one I'm just going to
have span class glyph icon and then
glyph icon CB alright so this is just
the icon for this seedy little icon the
record icon and the next one is called
glyph icon music and that's this little
music note in case you guys want it to
know so there's that and you also even
make area
it didn't true all right icon looking
good
alright now I actually want to add
another space and i preffer should do
this through CSS but the reason i want
to do this is because if I didn't then I
just thought the icon in albums the
texts were a little bit close together
so I don't know just personal preference
but now I just want to add albums and I
think everything should look good so
alright so you see this is our brand our
logo and then this is the elbows button
we can actually just copy this to make
it really simple so copy this entire
list item and let me condense that a
little bit so copy this
and paste their right under now of
course this next one isn't going to link
to the same place so we'll just make it
a dead link and worry about that later
and the glyph icon for this is music now
instead of albums I'm just going to have
songs and check it out albums and songs
now another thing I want to mention real
quick is you know this list item class
that I said oh don't worry about this
later the reason I said that is because
whenever we set this to active look what
happens the item that we are currently
selecting or kind of viewing is lit up
so the background is a little bit darker
and also the text in the icon is white
now the reason I say don't just include
it is because later on I'm going to show
you guys a cool way where it's pretty
much going to recognize what page you're
on and it's going to say okay have
active here or there now just to make
sure that you guys don't forget it you
might want to just put it in there right
now but that's basically what we're
doing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
