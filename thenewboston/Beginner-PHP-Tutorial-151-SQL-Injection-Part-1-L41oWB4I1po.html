and this is a video tutorial for the new
Boston now in this video we're going to
be talking about SQL injection but first
of all going to be talking about what it
is and we're going to be creating a
small program that's going to check a
user name and password so we're going to
be creating a program that's going to
select a row from the database where a
username and a password both match
therefore logging a user in successfully
so if you haven't already looked at the
user system tutorials go back and have a
look at how we log users in otherwise if
you don't really want to do that you can
follow through anyway and have a look at
what I'm doing here
so I'm going to be explaining what SQL
injection is and then I'm going to be
giving some small tips to predict
protect against there so we're going to
have some server-side tips and also tips
in our code that we can use to help
prevent at least against SQL injection
there are obviously many methods that
you can use based on form validation etc
etc adding slashes where quotes are but
we won't worry about that for now we're
just going to chop it about what SQL
injection is now if you've already
looked at queries you'll know that a
structured query is something that we
use to retrieve information from a
database or inserted data we can also
delete data etc etc so when you're
supplying a command or an SQL statement
for example to say select data from a
database we do something like this so
let's open an SQL tab here now you see
that we've got let's just go back so we
can see you can see that we've got user
name and password now if I was to select
a row from this table we've got a
database called a database and a table
could users we've got an ID field a user
name field a password field in an email
field which isn't relevant to this
tutorial nor is so much the ID field
here so user name and password let's go
ahead and create an SQL query that's
going to select a username and password
so we start with select and then we say
select
we can select the ID from we supply the
table that we're selecting from so users
here we're so select ID from users where
username make sure that's in apostrophes
user name equals Alex and password
equals past 1 2 3 for example so I'm
going to copy that into my clipboard so
I can use it later on when I click go
you can see that we've returned one row
we've retained the ID of the row where
the username and password both match now
for example if I was to copy and paste
this back in here but change the
password slightly so la for example as
the password you'll notice that we won't
return any rows ok so MySQL returned an
empty result set now in PHP we handle
this using the MySQL num rows function
and what we do is we say if if our query
so based on the users input of the
username and the users input of the
password if the MySQL query or the
result are the numbers that are returned
the number of rows that return are equal
to 1 or greater than or equal to 1 we
know that we've successfully logged the
user in because they've supplied
information which makes this query work
so if you like I said if you don't
understand at this point it's a good
idea to go back and check on the the
username and sorry the login and
register tutorials where we where we set
sessions for our users we perform this
kind of validation but what we do need
to do is protect against SQL injection
now let's take a look at what SQL
injection is let's just browse our
database and we can go back to our text
editor so let's um let's say get rid of
these tags and let's construct the query
that we've just done so we've got to
select ID from users where username is
Alex and password is blah let's just say
up here we have username equals and
dollar underscore post username and we
have
password and exactly the same thing but
this time we are selecting password now
these are presumably two fields that we
have in an HTML document that are HTML
on the page that tip that a user can
enter their username and password so
they can enter absolutely any value they
want into here be it an alphanumeric
characters just numbers we can have
characters anything we want so the user
has submitted their own data which then
goes into this query and we've seen this
by just literally substituting in
variables here and here now this query
will then select a username and password
from the database that her user has
supplied so let's say that they enter
username I'll just put it here so let's
say the username they enter is Alex and
the password that they enter is passed 1
