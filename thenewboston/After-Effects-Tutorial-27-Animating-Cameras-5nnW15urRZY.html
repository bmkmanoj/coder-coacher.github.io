27th After Effects tutorial and in this
tutorial I'm going to be showing you
guys how to move the camera and After
Effects now this is the last camera
tutorial I'm going to be going over
probably or maybe I'm not got to keep
you guessing and um again like I said
we're going to be able to animate the
camera in this tutorial and it's going
to be awesome
trust me so the first thing I have is
two layers here's my active camera or
front where you see this one's in the
back of one of me and behind that is one
of my friend being a newscaster or
something and if you see both of them
and this is from let's see one go this
is the right one this is the one of me
and this is my friend and back of it so
I just want to let you know they are on
the same layer that this one is actually
in front of this one right here so
that's going to be useful when I'm
showing you how to animate the camera so
in order to animate the camera we need a
camera
so again layer new camera defaults oh
good again I don't think I have um
we won't enable depth of field because
no need for this tutorial don't want to
confuse you so if you go ahead down here
and look at camera properties the
transform properties actually it might
as well go ahead and open all of them
you're going to see two things we're
going to be working with today point of
interest actually we don't need that one
and position now let me try to tell you
guys in pretty much plain terms what
this means if you were holding a
camcorder in your hand the position is
where you are holding it like how far
away how close to the subject the point
of interest is where you are pointing it
so you can be holding it anywhere you
want but if you weren't pointing in the
right place you wouldn't get your
subject so the position in After Effects
is this make sure you don't grab any of
axes see you can hold the camera
anywhere you want but the point of
interest right here is this little
anchor point and as you can see this is
where you point the camera
so the position stays the same but
you're pointing it in different
directions therefore giving you a
different clip so in order to animate a
camera we first need to set the point of
interest I mean you don't need to but
it's what you usually do so let's go
ahead and grab this little thing right
here and we want to bring it behind our
two subjects again this is our first
layer right here this is our second
layer so we want to be always aiming
kind of through them if we aim up here
or down here as you can see on the
camera doesn't get all of the subjects
so we want to aim through it and behind
it so let me minimize this and let's go
ahead and now that we got our point of
interest where we want it we can animate
the position of the camera to give us
some cool effects so as you can see now
want to grab the position we can do
under and over and it always gives us
that appearance of kind of um well the
appearance we're going for I don't know
what it's called probably not called
anything but so let's go ahead and start
animating this baby let's go ahead and
click keyframes make sure these are on
3d and we will bring our first position
probably um somewhere down there to the
bottom right there now let's go ahead
and move this to two seconds and we
probably want it somewhere um up here
and again if you know let me zoom up on
this if you see this little X Z Y if you
grab that then it's only limited moving
on x axis and we don't want that what we
want is to grab this camera freely so
make sure when you select it none of
your things are selected and then you
can move it anywhere around you want
like this in the easiest way to move it
on let's see whatever ways back and
forth just to go to the top view and
then you can move it back and forth so
let me go ahead and move this to four
seconds again clicking a little position
box and you probably want it somewhere
around there and then for the last one
move it to six seconds and put this even
through
the camera right there so as you can see
if we took our point of interest and
moved it like right around here then
what would happen is take a look at my
camera when our camera got through our
animation stuff going through it it
would flip back and look at our inch
what's it called point of interest from
different direction and we don't want
that we want to keep going in the same
direction the whole time so that's why I
move this point of interest through our
animation like that
and another thing you want to take note
of if you well let me show you what this
guy is what this does take a look at
this box right here let me get my camera
selected so you can see what's going on
our camera first goes up and then down
and then up and gives us a sweet
animation so that's one thing that you
can do with cameras up oh my god that is
animation galore
so that's your intro to a camcorder
again a point of interest is where
you're aiming make sure to go through
unless you want it to flip around and
your position is where you would be
holding the camera and again like I was
going to tell you before if you go to
transform auto orient auto orient oh got
a little hiccup there if you orient
along the path it pretty much sucks make
sure you're always orienting towards
point of interest let me show you what
happens if you orient along the path
pretty much all your hard work look at
the camera over here actually I'll give
you a dual view if you see that it
pretty much no one ever wants that
unless you're just making a completely
odd animation so again what you want to
do 99 percent of time is go transform
auto orient orient towards point of
interest and that will give you the
effects you're looking for so bam bam
that's how you animate camera a point of
interest where you're in position where
you are awesome tutorial as usual thank
you very much for watching if you have
any questions just send me a message and
hopefully I can answer them if not move
on to my next tutorial it will be
awesome as well so thank you don't
forget to subscribe and I will see you
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
