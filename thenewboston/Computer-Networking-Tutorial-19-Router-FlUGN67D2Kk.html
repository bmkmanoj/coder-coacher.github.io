learned about modems in this video I
want to talk to you about routers the
very basics so this is a wireless router
right here and remember in the scenario
where the dude he gave us the cable and
he told us the basics of how to hook up
our own home network he said take this
cable plug into the modem and then from
the modem take a Ethernet cable stick it
in your router and then all your devices
can connect your router so let's say
that we have a laptop and we wanted to
you know connect it with the ethernet
cable and also maybe our iMac can
connect to our router and the router can
also sense this has wireless
capabilities connect to wireless devices
such as phones tablets whatever now just
by looking at this and not understanding
anything else about routers we can
already see the basics of what's
happening now we see that these devices
all of the devices that we have inside
our home our laptops our Macs are you
know phones tablets whatever all of
these devices aren't communicating
directly with one another they're
communicating through this central
device called a router now there are
actually two main types of routers that
are popular nowadays whenever you see a
router and it has antennas on it like
this that means that it has wireless
capabilities and wireless devices you
know like tablets phones and even
laptops they all have wireless cards in
them and also let me see if I could pull
another one up alright now this is
another type of router and this is only
a wired router so you can only connect
devices that have an Ethernet port in
other words like I don't know maybe you
just have a bunch of pcs that are all
connected through Ethernet and they
don't have any wireless cards then maybe
you just want to get a router like this
and we'll talk about the benefits and
drawbacks of each one in the upcoming
tutorials and I'll actually show you
guys this so this is the router that I
bought for my upcoming tutorials
whenever I show you guys hands on how to
you know set everything up and configure
all your different devices and as you
can see since it has
these little antennas right here it must
mean that it supports both wired and
wireless devices which it does and if
you look at the back of it I'll talk you
guys through this real quick this black
little plug that's just for the power
this first the blue port the reason that
you have one blue and four yellow ones
is because the blue port is where you
take the ethernet that's coming from the
modem and you plug that into the blue
port on your router and the yellow ports
these four different ports right here
that is for let's say you have four
different pcs that are all wired through
Ethernet and you want to hook them up to
the internet that's where you plug those
in so again there you go that's a real
basic overview I don't want to you know
give you guys too much information and
spoil up but that's the basics of what a
router is and again there are a lot more
two routers than what I'm demonstrating
in this video but for right now I just
want to give you guys a real broad
overview and later on whenever we take a
look at more complex networks other than
you know just a really simple home
network you're going to see that another
job of a router is actually to decide
the best route for your data to travel
so between your computer in your home
and let's say Google's web server that
data can take a bunch of different
routes and whenever it gets to a router
and it's going to come across a bunch of
them you know whenever it's whenever
you're just going to any website that
router has to decide what path that data
is going to take and it's actually
pretty cool how it decides and I'll
explain all that later on but for now
just remember that a router is what all
of your devices are going to connect to
and also routers join networks together
that's a key point if you understand one
thing take that away so in other words
in this example your router is joining
two networks together your home network
and the internet which is the biggest
network of all so whenever you buy
internet from whatever company you
decide to buy it from what they're going
to do is they're going to come to your
house they're going to give you a cable
and it's going to hook up to a modem
you're going to take an Ethernet
and connect that to a router and all of
your advices are going to be able to
connect to that router and eventually
get internet however there are some
other devices for some more complex
networks that I want to talk to you guys
about but those will wait for the next
tutorial so I will see you guys then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
