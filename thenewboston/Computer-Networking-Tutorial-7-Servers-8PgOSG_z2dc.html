computer networking tutorial and now
that we understand what a server is I
want to explain exactly how it works and
also it will help me explain this thing
called clients and hosts because you
guys have probably heard about hosts
before but you may not know exactly what
they are so hopefully I can clear that
up so a very simplistic model of the
internet would look something like this
we would have a bunch of pcs will say
that this is a Windows PC and I will say
you know this is a laptop I'll draw it a
little differently it's pretty
good-looking laptop and I don't know
maybe we have a Mac over here alright
and I don't know maybe a MacBook later
somewhere else or something like that
but basically all of these things you
may hear them refer to as workstations
workstations are basically home
computers laptops Mac's whatever you
want to call them now we already know
aside from that that servers let me get
a good color for it servers are special
computer will say that this is a web
server we'll see that this is my server
for my website the new Boston the new
boston org
now believe it or not my web server is
actually in Texas there is a special
computer in Texas that's storing all of
my web files so whenever you go to new
Boston that org basically what's going
to happen as this server is going to
give you some files so let's go ahead
and talk about that process right now
say that this is you and you're watching
this YouTube video on a laptop right now
now you decide that you want to go to my
website because you heard about in this
video and you want to check it out so
basically what you're going to do is
you're going to type in the new Boston
org in your browser hopefully you're
using you know Google Chrome so you're
going to type in the new Boston the org
in your browser is basically can go
through you know your internet provider
it's going to go through your modem
routers all that stuff but it's finally
and we'll talk about you know exactly
how your router knows to talk to my web
server that's a complicated process but
basically you're going to eventually get
to my server right here and what your
computer is basically asking is
can I see the new boss end org or
basically can you send me some files
from this server and send them to my
computer right here so that I can see
this website in my web server hopefully
you know if it's not down or anything
it's going to say yes here you go so
it's basically going to take those files
which is basically data and send it over
wire or Wireless and you're going to get
those files on your computer right here
now those files are just a bunch of text
and random computer symbols that are
easy to transfer over this
communications media but you can't
really understand them and that's the
job of your browser the job of Internet
Explorer or Firefox or Chrome whatever
you're using it's the job to interpret
those files in the in pretty much
interpret them from you know computer
text to symbols such as pictures and
texts and videos whatever it is that you
can see so basically one more time
servers are special computers that
everyone in the world can access now
whenever you want to see my website for
example you send a request to my server
then you basically ask can I see your
website can you send me the web files
and then my server automatically takes
those files and sends them to your
computer so now your computer has those
files and your web browser interprets
those files and turns it into text and
pictures and all the cool stuff that
makes up a web page so that's basically
how a very simple server works and I
know I was good I said I was going to go
over client and host in this tutorial
but I'm going to wait to the next
tutorial because it'll make a whole lot
of sense so thanks for watching and make
sure to check out the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
