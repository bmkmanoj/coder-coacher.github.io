Illustrator cs6 tutorial and in this
tutorial we're going to learn how to
create blends using the blend tool which
is on the tools panel and then we're
also gonna start getting into the
options that you can use to modify your
blends it's a pretty helpful to know the
options because you can start modifying
and know you can you know what you can
do with your object and once you know
what you can do you can think of more
creative ways to use it alright so let's
start out by using the blend tool and
it's really easy to do the blend tool is
over here under the eyedropper tool so
you'll get this like a little square
with a bunch of with like a trail coming
off of it as your cursor icon all you
need to do is click on your first fill
color of your object and then go ahead
and click on the second one and it'll
blend them right together now if you
want to bring these or bring another one
in all you got to do is just click on
the next one and it'll bring it in and
then you can close it off together if
you bring in a mall if you click on the
very last one so as you can see the
blend tool created a path in in between
all these and connected them by a path
and that's how it's making the tool so
I'll go back and I'll just make it so
that we've got three of these together
now the now I can get into the options
there wasn't a whole lot of there's not
a whole lot other than just blending two
objects together like that to do with
the blend tool so we can get into start
guns there's some options so the first
thing we want to get into is what's
called the blend options so select your
blend go to object and we go to blend
and go to blend options now if you're
using a bunch of circles it's not going
to work too well what I'm going to show
you so if you want to follow along make
sure you have something like like a
one of these a polygon or like a square
or triangle or something like that you
can see the movement so the first thing
we've got is our spacing smooth color is
just going to create a smooth blend and
that's the default that always happens
click on your preview button to see what
we're changing the next one is specified
steps and you can put in the number of
steps here if I put in something like 10
and then click here you can see that
you're making like kind of like a steps
thing and this would be cool if you're
making something like a caterpillar or
something like that and there's also
other things and if this goes up to a
thousand oh the higher up you go the
more smooth it's gonna be but as you
start going higher you'll you might
notice that the edges get a little bit
jagged and that's not usually what you
want so keep it somewhere where it's
like smooth and crisp on the edges the
next one is specified distance and this
is gonna enter the distance between the
objects in the blend so if I put it down
to maybe like one pixel we can check out
what's going on it's the it's the
closest together and it's gonna be the
smoothest but once again you're gonna
get these jagged edges by bringing it up
to something high like a thousand you
know see that it's barely got anything
you can see that there are two different
colors that are in between it so you
want to keep it as something like around
five to get a nice smooth without like
jagged edges
the other thing that I want to show you
I'm going to go back to smooth color is
the orientation so the left one is
aligned to page and that's just what you
had before and then the other one is
called a line to path it's gonna align
it to these path lines and if you watch
this polygon up here if I click on this
the polygon is gonna switch and it's
gonna align to the path so depending on
which one you want to use go ahead and
try the different things different
options
now there's even more options if you go
to the blend tool here we've we've got
different options let me go back to the
blend tool we've got different options
here we've got our opacity we can turn
that down if we need to and then we've
got recolor artwork and in this you can
change the different kind of coloration
that you're getting here you can change
the colors you can add a new row of
colors in there and you can pick these
well actually that one didn't work too
well well you can go ahead and change
these if you want you can change the
different tints and everything like that
we've got custom our presets I mean you
can see what that did made it all into
one color
well I'm just gonna hit cancel you can
go ahead and mess around with that and
when you mess around one thing sometimes
you learn a little bit better than me
trying to explain to you what what they
do sometimes and I think that's one of
the things that we'll be better off
you've got here which is a light -
selection or align to artboard which we
went to before and these are just
transformation values here and scale
values there's more options if we go to
object and then we with make sure our
object to select our blend is selected
go to object and then come down here to
blend we've got some more things we've
got our blend options that we had before
the other one is a reverse spine and if
I click that it's gonna switch these
blend River spine will switch it back
and the other one will be reverse front
to back if I click that you can see that
the colors have been changed and that
they blend in a reverse way
the last thing that I'd like to show you
is using the direct selection tool so if
we pick the direct selection tool here
and we can start modifying things I want
to modify this anchor point here so I
can move it along and I can move the
shape of my path and also move out
points of my path to get a different
kind of blending so that's how you can
modify different things in your blends
you don't have to use stick with these
shapes you can make any kind of shapes
that you really want and start blending
them together so that's all I'm gonna
talk to you about with a blending you
should be pretty good with it within
this tutorial and the tutorial before
that and you should be kind of like a
little bit a little bit expert on
blending now so just mess around with it
get used to it see different techniques
and everything and see what you like so
thanks a lot for watching the tutorials
guys have a good day have a good day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
