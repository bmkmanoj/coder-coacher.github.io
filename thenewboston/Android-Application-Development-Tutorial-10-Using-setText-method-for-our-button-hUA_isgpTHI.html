got to make these tutorials we'll play
afterwards just get my room
what's up guys welcome to your tenth
Android tutorial for the new boss and
again my name is Travis
we're going to do this tutorials
basically finish up our Java class get
our application running for the most
part and you know let's just hop right
into let's do a quick overview of what
we want our application to do basically
we're gonna have this textview change
according to whatever counter variable
is and our counter variable is going to
be added to or subtracted by one whether
the sub button is clicked or the add
button is clicked so let's set up or
whatever is within our on click for add
button so we're going to do that within
this onclick method again these two
brackets and when our application starts
or counter starts at zero so what we
want to do is when the add button is
clicked we want to add one to this
counter object or this counter variable
for the most part so we're going to say
is we're going to say counter and we're
going to set this equal to and you can
do this a few different ways you can say
counter plus one which is a bad way to
program but basically what this is
saying is whatever our counter variable
is which is zero we're going to add 1 to
it and then that's what our counter
variable is now going to 8-ball
it's kind of confusing especially if you
guys are huge in math you're like what
is this that's impossible so yeah we're
going to do it a different way you can
also say plus equals 1 like that and
that will just add one to the counter
variable or you can also you know this
is beneficial for them like you know if
you wanted to add 10 that and add 10 to
the to the counter integer variable but
also we can do if we're just going to
add by 1 which we are we can use plus
plus so basically that's going to add 1
to our counter variable again counter
starts at 0 so every time the add button
is clicked
it's going to add one to the counter
variable so let's develop or go into our
unclick for the sub and do the same
thing except subtract so we're gonna say
counter - - and that's going to subtract
by one all right the only other thing we
need to do is we need to change the
display again we have a textview called
display and it has the reference for
basically that text within our XML so we
want to change that what we can do is we
can again since we imported the textview
class within Java we can use some of
those methods from the textview class on
our text menus so what we're going to do
is just type out our variable name which
was display and we're going to hit dot
and again you can use all these methods
and there's a method called set text
that we're going to use and that's going
to change the text or basically set
whatever the text is going to be I
wasn't going to scroll to it but okay so
that's what we're going to use we're
just going to click this and within here
we can do something like your total is
space and then end your end your
quotations and then hit the plus symbol
and put counter and basically that's
going to convert a counter into you can
think of it as a string again strings
are for words and such like that so
basically it's going to say your total
is plus whatever the value of our
counter is so that's that's pretty neat
and that's what we're going to use so
now that's going to change the text or
set the text of our display that we we
have set up hopefully that made sense I
know I'm kind of going quick through
this as well but you know that's that's
how it's going to work that's how our
application is going to work it's going
to set the text to quotations your total
is space and then whatever our in
terrible called counter is equal to now
I just want to quickly just say if you
guys try it like this
just to get the number
it's not going to work I mean this set
text won't work like that you need to
have some quotations in there and then
like a plus like that so just make sure
you guys are doing the actual crap
the way that this way with some text in
there in quotations plus whatever our
variable counter is so let's run the
application real quick and make sure it
works I'm going to save it run it
quickly again I had the emulator pulled
up oh okay yeah there mind all right so
here's our activity let's let's test it
out so if we click click add one button
it's going to add one to our counter
object and this is going to reset this
whole text each time or subtract works
as well so you know we can sell this
application to your little brother for
like ten thousand dollars and we're
pretty much done I mean if we if we make
ten thousand dollars off this app by
selling it to your little brother we are
golden alright well hopefully you guys
kind of understood that tutorial for the
most part again I know it's probably
foggy and we're jumping into stuff
pretty quickly but trust me we're going
to go back and kind of cover some of the
stuff you guys don't understand but uh
thanks again for watching I'll catch you
guys in the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
