another PI game with OpenGL with
synthetics for bucking the new boss in
this video already talking about is you
we've already defined our edges and our
vertices or nodes and now we actually
want to pass through some OpenGL code
that will start to render our cube
before us so we're gonna go ahead and
come down here and let's go ahead and do
define draw cube
empty parameters and this function is
gonna do exactly what it says it's gonna
draw cube so some of the first things
that you'll see when looking at OpenGL
code is you're gonna see something that
says geo begin and geo geo and and the
official terminology for this is you
have again in jail and are used to
delimit vertices that define your
primitives so basically your 3d stuff
okay so geo begin is going to take an
argument which is used to sort of define
like what type of or really the argument
is like how should these vertices be
interpreted and then in our case we want
to have it interpreted as lines so we're
going to use GL underscore lines of geo
lines geo begin is a function that's
part of OpenGL and statement with Jaylin
and then also this is a parameter that
is part of OpenGL so geo begin or ton
OpenGL we're going to be doing some
vertices with some lines here today and
then basically pass through all that
code right in here and then when we're
all done we're like okay OpenGL we're
all set so done so now what is exactly
the code that won't pass through well
the way that this works is you basically
define your vertices and you draw some
lines and that's that's about it so what
we're going to say is for edge in edges
so for each of the edges that we have
here so we've got a like this tuple of
tuple of edges so for each of them what
do we want to do well we're gonna say
for the
Mirta c or c vertex will go with that
vertex for the vertex in edge so for
each little part right so this is a
vertex this is a vertex so these are
corresponding to the number in this list
basically so for each vertex in edge
what do we want to do and we want to we
want to pass these through the GL vertex
function and what geo vertex wants so GL
vertex 3f V what this wants is the XY
and Z location right of a point which we
have our loops we have our X Y Z here so
we want the X Y Z so how do we get the X
Y Z well since we've all sinned so we've
kind of defined all the way here we've
got edge and that specific vertex in
there so we would say vertices Bert GL
end and we're done
we've drawn a queue crazy so generally
like this stuff can get kind of
confusing we could have like draw cube
could have been a lot more complex than
it was just simply because what we've
done is we've seriously shortened this
code since we've got edge and edges
we've got all our nodes already
specified like where we're gonna draw
lines via these nodes 0 to 1 0 to 3 and
so on and so then we do that we draw the
lines using OpenGL and we're all set
so now we're ready to do is we we've
kind of like rendered this but you have
to understand it's basically like in the
back end so the draw cube is what's goes
it goes on in the back end just like any
graphics just like pi game where you
drew everything but it doesn't show up
until you like just update the display
so then we have to actually draw stuff
and then just because we've drawn this
cube this is a 3d engine right so so we
need to not only do we need to draw the
cube but then we have to kind of draw
sort of the environment and what's our
perspective in this environment
where are we going to start and then how
might we modify
later on because that's where OpenGL
really shines it's like if we just need
to draw a cube well that sucks because
we could do that in 2d but what where it
shines is when we can rotate that cube
or rotate ourselves around that cube and
now we're cooking so that's what we're
gonna start talking about in the next
video is how to get ourselves in the
environment so anyway stay tuned for
that and thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
