slash on live gamer for the new Boston
and in this tutorial we're going to be
looking at arrays now let's say you have
a bunch of values that you want to be
stored as the same name such as classes
or clients or something like that but
you can't create the same variable over
and over again so what you can do is
create an array which has one name but
it can hold a bunch of different values
so let's go ahead and create a little
demo project to take a look and see how
arrays work so we'll go ahead and click
new project we will select windows forms
application and we will set the name to
arrays and we'll go ahead and click OK
now we will make our form a little bit
bigger and we'll open the toolbox and we
will add a button and a list box so
we'll stretch out the list box a bit
we'll close out of the toolbox and then
we'll make the button a little bit
bigger so we will set the name width of
the list box to list arrays so we'll
just type list arrays and we'll set the
name of the button to button add array
now inside the text value to add array
elements so we'll just go ahead and
double click on add array elements to
open up the click handler for that so
now what we need to do is come down here
and create a sub that will clear the
list so private sub clear list now
inside of this will type list arrays dot
UM's
dot clear so this will clear all the
items in the array and we're going to be
using a clear list a lot and it's easier
to type clear lists than it is to type
all this out right here
so whenever the user clicks button
an array we want to go ahead and clear
the list just in case there's anything
else in there and now all we need to do
is declare our array so to do this we'll
type dim and then we're going to specify
a name for our array
so string classes and then we're going
to have two parentheses and inside these
parentheses we're going to tell the
compiler how long we want our array to
be so if we type five it's going to be
six elements long because when you're
counting it starts at zero so it'll go
zero one two three four five which is
six items now we have to specify what
data type it's going to be so we'll just
type as string so each one of the items
in there is going to be a string so now
I'll type string classes and now I need
to reference an index of this array so
the item at the index of zero we're
going to set that equal to web design
and we'll go through and do this for
each one of the items in the array now
you can name them whatever you want I'm
just going to do classes here so we'll
type Spanish and we'll just keep adding
more
okay so now that we've set a value for
each one of the items in our array so
I'm going at zero going through five
we're going to go ahead and use a for
loop to add all those items to our list
so we're going to go ahead and start off
by type typing for num1 or let's just do
num as integer now you do not have to
use as integer at because integer is the
default for the for loop but I'm just
going to go ahead and do it anyway so
for number one as integer we're going to
set it equal to zero because the
starting point is going to be zero and
then we're going to do two so let's say
that we don't know the length of this
array so what we can do to get around
not knowing the length we can just do
string classes dot linked and this is
going to get the length of it now we
have one problem here it goes from zero
and then the length of string classes is
actually going to be six because there's
six items in here so to fix that we can
just do string classes dot length minus
one which will go from zero to five and
so now what we need to do is type list
arrays items dot add and we'll do string
classes and now for the index we're
going to use num so the first time this
loop is run num is going to be equal to
zero so it's going to access string
classes and then at the index of zero
which is web design and then next time
it goes through it's going to be one
which is Spanish and it's going to go
through everything until it gets to
calculus and then it's going to stop so
if we go ahead and run this program you
can see here's our form and here's our
list and now if we click add array
element you can see that adds web-design
Spanish chemistry English history and
calculus now if we were to take out one
of these lines right here and run it we
would get an error because you cannot
reference a null value so if you're
going to go ahead and practice and make
some arrays make sure you populate the
whole array and before you try to put it
out and
listbox or else you're going to get an
error so I'm go ahead practice make a
couple arrays you don't have to they
don't have to be strings they can be
doubles in floats long whatever you like
just make sure you know how to make a
race you know how to set the values to
it and you know how to access different
parts of that array and once you've got
that down and you know you're not going
to forget it go ahead and move on to the
next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
