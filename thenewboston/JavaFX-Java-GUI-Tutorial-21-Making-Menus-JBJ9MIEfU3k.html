video I'm going to show you how to build
these menus at the top of your
application and before we get started I
actually just want to go over some
terminology or real quick and explain
exactly how we're going to be putting
this together so what we're going to be
doing is we're going to be building the
individual menus so for example this is
a file menu this is an edit menu this is
a view menu you of course usually have
you know maybe like five or six menus in
every single piece of software so after
we create the menu we're going to start
adding the items so all of the options
in this little drop-down list these are
called the menu items so we have a menu
made up of a bunch of different menu
items and then once we have a bunch of
different menus built we're going to add
them all to the menu bar and that's this
entire area at the top of your screen
and for this little demo I'm actually
using a border pane layout and I like it
because whenever you use a border pane
layout it gives you the top left center
right and bottom and you can just take
your entire menu bar and stick it right
on top and it works perfectly so anyways
the first thing that we need to do is we
actually need to create a menu before
you can actually stick any items in it
so I'll just say file menu I'll just
kind of make a little clone of this but
I'll like make my own custom ones
alright so this is type menu and you can
name anything you want I'm going to name
it file menu and you set it equal to new
menu and for the constructor it takes
one parameter which is a string and
that's what text do you want to appear
right here so if I just write file then
what's going to happen is this button
right here is going to say file not the
individual items didn't get those yet
just this button so that's what that
does and now once we have a menu we can
start sticking items into it so I'll say
menu items alright so how do we add
items to this menu well you first need
to get the menu which is File menu and
then
you call get items so just like before
it needs to know what items are already
in it before we start sticking any new
ones in and even if it's your first item
you still have to call get items doesn't
matter and then the next thing you call
is ad now ad allows you to add one menu
item to this menu so what we can
actually do is we can create a new
object and name it something or we can
just do this really easily in order to
create a menu item you just call a new
menu item and then you give the title so
what was the title of this first menu
item new project
so new project data so there you go we
now have a file menu and we have one
item added to it in was the other ones
new module import project new module
import project alright so we have a file
menu and we now have the first three
items added to it so I will show you
guys some other cool stuff in just a
second but for now I just want to keep
things really simple so whenever you
have a menu set up and you have all your
items added to it what you have to do
now is you need to add it to a menu bar
so say the main menu bar alright
now you guys can probably because what
the object this is I just named it menu
bar and you set equal to new menu bar
now this doesn't take any title or
anything because again no text appears
on here it's just the text that's on
your individual menu so don't need to do
anything to that now after this we need
to start adding the individual menus to
it now typically we're going to have a
bunch foam-like file menu edit menu View
menu however we only have one menu right
now so it's going to look kind of goofy
but whatever
so menu bar get menus add and I'll just
write at all even though I just have one
for right now and what is the name of
the menu that you want to add to the
menu bar well it's File menu and I
actually have to layout I don't think
that all right this is just for my
border pane layout set the top equal to
menu bar so basically what I'm saying is
I have a border pane layout I'm gonna
build this menu bar and then I'm going
to stick it in the top section of this
border pane so let me just go ahead and
run this real quick and show you guys
what's going on so look how awesome this
program is the plainest program ever but
basically we have a file menu and we can
click it new project new module import
project of course when we click these
nothing happens yet because you know we
didn't add any functionality but I'll
show you guys how to do that right now
and actually before I continue
I want to mention one thing you see how
whenever I create a menu I added these
three little dots these actually mean
something if you click any menu in any
piece of software you see that some
options have dots and some don't for
example exit whenever a menu item has
dots after it it means whenever you
click it a new window or a new dialog is
going to open whenever it has this arrow
it means there's a submenu and whenever
it has nothing it just means that that's
um the only option so again for example
whenever you hit exit it just closes
your program and there's nothing else to
do so that's mean there's something else
to do arrow means a submenu and no dots
or no arrow just means that's it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
