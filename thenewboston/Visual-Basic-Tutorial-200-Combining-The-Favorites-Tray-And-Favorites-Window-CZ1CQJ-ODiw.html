youtube.com/scishow on live gamer for
the new Boston and in this tutorial
we're going to be combining our
favorites viewer in our favorite viewer
tray into one application now the credit
for these two application goes to the
authors of beginning Microsoft Visual
Basic 2008 and they are theorem Willis
and Brian Newsome now I've been using
these applications to teach you guys
some object-oriented programming
techniques and now what we're going to
do is we're going to use my method of
combining these two applications into
one so what we need to do is we need to
come over here to favorites viewer
YouTube and we need to add an existing
item so go ahead and go to favorites
viewer YouTube and go to favorites
viewer tray YouTube an AB add web
favorite menu item so I'm just going to
click cancel because I've already done
that so once that's in there you need to
right-click on it and click view code
now you will see the import statement
right here that says imports and it will
say internet favorites so you can just
go ahead and delete that because we
don't actually reference that dll in
this project so now that we have our web
favorite menu item let's go ahead and
change some properties of our viewer PB
so we need to come over here to the
properties and we need to not show it in
the taskbar so it will find show and
taskbar and we will set that to false
now it should be set to true for you and
I already set mine to false so now that
we've done that let's go ahead and come
over to our tool box and we'll add a
notify icon so we'll set the text of
this to right click for favorites so
when they hover over it with their mouse
is going to tell them to right-click for
the favorites and for the name will set
it to icon favorites and now we need to
do is we need to set the icon to the
star that
we had so I'll just go to my desktop and
select this favorites icon okay so now
we'll come into viewer Beebe and you can
see that when the viewer loads it loads
to the favorites so what we need to do
is come out here and we need to edit our
load favorite sub so you can see that it
uses object favorites as a new favorites
so if you notice here uses a for each
loop to go through each of the favorites
in our favorites collection now if we go
back and look at form 1vb from our
favorites viewer tray you can see that
it also uses a for each loop to go and
search through each of the favorites in
the collection so we can use this to our
advantage we can use this existing for
loop that's already here and now one
thing you need to make sure that you've
done before you edit your code is
right-click on favorite view viewer
YouTube and set it as the start up
project okay so let's come up here and
whenever we load the favorites we'll
just go ahead and declare object menu as
a new context menu so now that we have
our context menu context menu what we
need to do is come down here into our
for each loop and we need to declare a
web favorite menu item
so we'll just call it object favorite
item or it will do object item as a new
web favorite item or web favorite menu
item and for the arguments it's going to
take a web favorite and you can see that
in our for each loop it has object web
favorite as a web favorite so we can use
that in this argument
so object web favorite so it creates
that object item and so now what we want
to do is want to add that to our list
so we'll do object menu dot menu items
dot add and we want to add our
item now if this is going to be called
for each of the favorites that are in
our collection so let's come over here
back to form 1 DB and see what else we
need to do well we've done this right
here so now we need to add the separate
separator and the exit menu so we'll go
into viewer VB and we'll come down here
below our end using and we'll just type
object menu dot menu items ad and then
we'll add a separator and now what we
need to do is type object menu dot menu
items dot add and we'll create a new
instance of an exit menu item so instead
of declaring a variable of X a menu item
and creating that outside of this that
would just be a waste of memory so what
we can do is create the new instance of
it inside of the arguments of the object
menu menu items I'll add so the exit
menu item is inside of our class or
inside of our file I should say our web
flavor item VB you can see we've got the
class exit menu item and it inherits
from menu item and it sets the text to
exit and when they click on it it will
exit their application so we'll come
back into view or VB and let's make sure
that we've done everything right okay so
now we need to do is we need to set that
context menu to the icon we need to
attach those to each other so we'll type
icon favorites dot context menu is going
to be equal to our object menu so once
we've created our menu and we've added
added it to the icon let's go ahead and
have this program minimize to the system
tray so if they double click on icon
favorites will type if me dot visible is
equal to false then it will type me dot
show
so if the application is not visible and
it's hidden then we'll just show it
again and instead of testing see if it's
visible let's just type if me dot window
state is equal to form window state dot
minimize so if it's minimized then we'll
show it and then we'll set the form
window state to a normal so meaning dot
window state is going to be equal to
form window state dot normal so they'll
be able to see it so now what we need to
do is we need to access the resize event
for this form so that if they minimize
it it will hide it so we'll go to our
viewer events and we will find resize so
if they resize it let's use an if
statement so if me dot window state is
equal to form window state dot minimized
then we'll just type me dot hide so when
I double click on the icon favorites
it'll show it if it's hidden
and then when they minimize it it's
going to hide it so let's go ahead and
run this and hopefully we won't get any
errors and you can see here that it
loads our form right here and it has our
default link and we can refresh and we
can select these links but you can also
see down here in our tray we have the
favorites icon that says right click
right-click for favorites and when we
right click we get our menu so if we
minimize this you can see that it's not
shown in the taskbar and it just
disappears so in order for us to show it
we'll just double click on the icon and
it'll show it back ok well the error
that we had there
um was fairly simple um it took me a
little bit to figure it out though
because it was kind of strange you can
see here that we've got our sub that
handles icon favorites double click
now what we wanted to actually use is
icon favorites mouse double-click so
when they mouse double click on the
start it will show it I don't know why
this is this is actually very strange
because you would think that icon
favorites double click would run this
code but you actually have to use the
mouse double click so we'll run this you
can see here is our form and let me just
go ahead and come down here to the tray
will minimize and you can see here is
our favorites icon and when we
right-click on it we get the favorites
and let's just go ahead and double click
on it
you see it'll open up the favorites
again and when we minimize it it goes
away
and if we double click it it'll open it
up again and then if we right click on
the star and click exit the whole
application is going to exit so thanks
for watching these tutorials on visual
basic if you have any questions leave
them in the comments and once you're
done with this program feel free to
leave a video response showing us what
you made and all of my projects will
mostly all of them all the big ones are
going to be available for download at
the new boston's website</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
