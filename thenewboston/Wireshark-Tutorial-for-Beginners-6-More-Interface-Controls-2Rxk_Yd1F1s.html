take a closer look at these main
sections right here so this top one of
course if you can't see it then make
sure you go to view packet list you also
want to make sure you're looking at
packet details and packet bytes the
bottom section is optional I usually
don't have it but for this tutorial
we'll keep it up there why not
so first this top section so we already
know that it's a list of all the packets
in hmm oh sorry got whooping cough art
so each of these columns is just a brief
overview and I know it's just like a
real quick summary so they have a number
and these numbers they don't mean
anything special whenever you start a
capture it's just a way that you can
identify each one so each new packet
that comes in you can see that it gets
incremented by one now it's actually
useful whenever you're looking at your
filters so um let's say that you were
filtering by I don't know HTTP you're
going to hit apply so we can see that
okay about every you know 12 or you know
I don't know probably like 11 or so
packets then that is HTTP packet so one
out of eleven everything else is not so
that's a real quick way to do that now
this time right here this is the time
since your first packet was captured so
whenever your first packet gets captured
that's times zero now all of these other
times are in relation to it so if you
actually look at the last one thirty
point three you can see the total time
it took for your entire capture now
personally I don't really like having
you know I don't care if the time is
this specific I don't need it to like
the millionth decimal place so what I
usually do is go to view time display
format and I'll just choose like
milliseconds or something you know who
really cares nanoseconds maybe if you're
you know trying to find a bottleneck or
something but just analyzing real quick
then we can change that so we are
overloaded with a million different
numbers alright so this next one and
actually the rest of these are
easy the source is where it came from
the destination is where it's going to
the protocol the length and the info is
just a real brief info or like a summary
of it basically but the real detailed
info is right here now during your
analysis what you usually want to do is
start out by rearranging these so
they're actually pretty readable so it
usually butts this up right up against
the time so you see how that's really
difficult to read so I like to separate
this a little bit more let's make it
easier to read of course this depends on
you know the size of your screen I'm
kind of limited since I'm filming and I
need to make these videos fit on YouTube
so there you go now you can also
rearrange these completely so maybe for
some reason you want the I don't know
the protocol in between the source and
destination so if you just click these
and drag then you can do that actually
like it as it was so I'll just leave
that right there and you can also hide
these columns completely so say that
okay I really don't care about this
length so what I'm going to do is I'm
going to right click in in displayed
columns in the check box whatever one's
checked that means it's being displayed
so if you uncheck that and I don't know
let me play around with this uncheck
this one oh crap I messed everything up
I just want to go back to normal now
display them all so what I can do is
right click again display columns and
display all and it's going to pop you
back to normal now as you can see by
accident--
I actually sorted this so whenever you
sort a column then just like Microsoft
Excel you can sort it by ascending or
descending hover I usually like by
default which is sorted by numbers in
other words the order that the packets
came in during the capture so now let's
select one of these packets and hop down
in the middle section and actually let
me take care of the bottom section real
quick so I can just get it out of there
so the bottom section there's not much
you can do with it you can pretty much
if you right-click it choose between hex
view or bits view which is pretty much
the binary ones
Xero's so just pick whatever one you
don't want to understand
so I whenever I need to look at it I
like looking at it that way so yeah
there you go but I'm gonna hide it so I
have a little bit more room to teach so
view and packet bytes and so we have a
packet selected and we can see in this
section we can view the details about it
and it's grouped up into different
sections so frame Ethernet IP v4 TCP and
HTTP so whatever one you click of course
is going to give you some more info
about it now you see however whenever
I'm navigating then I do so with these
trees right here well some of these
little sections they actually have a lot
of trees and I'm like okay I want to
view this section but it's taken forever
I have to maximize minimize all that
well what you can do is this say you
wanted to view all the information
that's really to TCP you can just right
click and hit expand subtrees so
whatever group you have selected it's
going to go through that group and
expand all of those little sections and
those are code trees now if you want to
expand all of these sections at once
then you can just right click anywhere
and hit expand all now this is usually
pretty overwhelming so I'm going to
right click and hit collapse all and I
actually like to only expand one at a
time so boom there you go
so now we have concluded you know a real
basic tour of the interface of course
there's a ton of stuff here that we
didn't go over a lot of the stuff is
really specific and you don't use it
every day but now that we got a pretty
good understanding of all of these
different menus and tools filters and
different sections we can go ahead and
start learning exactly how to analyze
traffic so that's going to be actually
the real fun part got the boring stuff
out of the way can't wait see you guys
