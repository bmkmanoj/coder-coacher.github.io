objective-c tutorial and in this story
we're gonna be going over dictionaries
yeah you heard me right but not the kind
that you're probably thinking of see a
dictionary in computer programming it's
pretty much made of a key and an object
now how can this relate to well you know
we'll say in your dictionary that you
have at your house
you look upwards and then whatever word
you look up it gives you the definition
of it well this is pretty much the same
thing with computer programming but they
give you they pretty much just name
everything different instead of looking
up words you look up the key and instead
of a definition it gives you objects so
every key is linked to a specific object
and just like in the dictionary you
can't have the word Apple eight times or
else that'll confuse you you can only
have each key once because if you have
like the key Apple five times when you
look it up and won't know which object
to give you so let's go ahead and begin
the easiest way is just watch me
create one and then you'll see what's
going on so the class is NS mutable
dictionary very good I have to type it
and you can name your dictionary
anything let's give us something
memorable like my dick
I don't even think like that guys you're
gross my dictionary I meant and let's go
ahead and set this equal to NS mutable
dictionary and dictionary now this is a
built-in method
come on crap stop open up see this is
built-in method and what this does is it
pretty much gives you an empty
dictionary now your dictionary is named
my dick and right now it has nothing in
it no words no definitions aka
no keys and no values so what you want
to do is well we can go ahead and just
add them manually so what you want to do
is say what dictionary do you want to
add keys and values to my dick of course
because it's the only one we have in the
object it's pretty much the definition
so set object and let's go ahead and
actually give a definition then you'll
be able to clearly see what's going on
the definition of this word is when you
spray yourself with Febreze and I spout
everything wrong but that doesn't matter
see does anyone know what the key is for
this four key if you guessed let me make
this look good enough so does anyone
know what the definition of that is - if
you guess for breeze shower then you my
friend are correct so let's go ahead and
add three more keys so before I even
continue what we're gonna be doing is
searching for the key which is pretty
much the word and it's going to give us
the object what is in this case just a
definition so pretty cool but let's go
ahead I mean our dictionary needs to
have more than one key in it or one word
so let's go ahead and define some other
stuff what is the word for a gamer who
lacks experience anybody anybody um if
you guessed newb with zeros instead of
O's then you are correct and let's do
one more let's see worst food on the
planet anyone know and make sure you
spell playing it wrong anyone know what
this is if you guess sushi then you are
correct that is the worst food on the
planet so now we have three words or
keys as they're called sushi noob and
for brief shower and no long ago with it
we have three definitions which are
objects worst food on planet gamer and
when you spray yourself with breweries
so let's go ahead and what we want to be
able to do is be able to type in the key
and it gives us the definition of it or
the object or you know whatever you want
to name it it's all the same thing key
object pairs I just name them words and
definitions you know it's all easier
that way improper but you know big deal
so let's go ahead and just output an
object percent a and you just don't type
in the key like sushi like that what you
need to do is you need to call the
method so it knows what dictionary it's
coming from so in my dictionary we want
to get an object for the key we type in
so let's go ahead and type in sushi and
run this and see what we get but you
just don't type it in like that you have
to type in unlike object so now we give
you the sushi object which is a string
object and we want the string definition
so let's go ahead and build and run this
and it says I know what I did I typed an
MS log with a lowercase L always do that
so now let's go ahead and run this for
real and it says worse food on the
planet so we gave it sushi it gave us
the object that goes along with it
so say let's go ahead and type in noob
build and run this save it and see what
we get gamer who lacks experience so
this is pretty much how you create a
dictionary and I know that throughout
the story I said words and definitions
but the correct term for this is keys
and objects I mean word and definition
is for if you're holding a book called
the dictionary in computer program and
objective-c
what you're looking up is the key and
what it gives back to you is the object
and again these don't have to be string
objects they can be any type of objects
but you know for this tutorial written
object was the most obvious because we
clearly gave it a key and clearly wanted
the object back it was pretty easy to
see what was going on so I'm gonna
comment this and post it on the link
below so if you want any of this code
it's all there for you guys for free so
uh thank you for watching and hopefully
you enjoyed the story and hopefully you
learned some new phrases like for brie
shower so like I said don't forget
subscribe check out my forum if you want
and I'll see you next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
