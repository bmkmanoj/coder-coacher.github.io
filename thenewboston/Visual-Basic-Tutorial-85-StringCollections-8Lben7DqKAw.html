slash on live gamer for the new Boston
and in this tutorial we're gonna be
taking a look at string collections now
if you remember from the previous
tutorials we looked at stacks queues and
ArrayList and all of those are
collections now in this tutorial we're
gonna be taking a look at string
collections now string collections are
very much like ArrayList
but instead of being able to store any
data type you want in it subsets such as
using an integer and then the next item
in the list is a string the next item is
a double then maybe the next item is an
object of a class with string
collections you can only use type string
but you can add as many as you want and
it won't run out like an array so let's
go ahead and get rid of this code that
we use in the last tutorial and if you
don't have that project saved you can
just make another one real quick we
didn't add anything to the form we
didn't do anything other than access the
form one load event so we're gonna come
up here and we're gonna declare a string
collection so we'll call it string
collection as new string collection
and let's see here
okay so if you got that same error that
I got in the last where it cannot find
string collection so if we type as new
string collection it's not there so what
we need to do is use the long form of
this so let's go ahead and type system
dot collections dot and now we're gonna
use the keyword specialized and then
string collection so now that we've
created our string collection we can go
ahead and add some stuff to it so it's
almost identical to ArrayList so we can
type string collection dot add now let's
add Sam now we can also come up here and
create an array and add that array to
our stream collection so I'll just type
private my array as string and we'll set
that equal to Joe Jim and Bob and we can
go ahead and add that in there using the
same add range now add range is also
usable in string collections and array
lists so we'll just add the range my
array so it's going to add all the items
in there now we can also use string
collection dot remove and we can remove
Jim now we can also remove at so string
collection dot remove at and it will
remove at the index so let's remove at
index two zero so it's gonna remove Sam
so all we have left in our string
collection is Joe and Bob so let's come
over to our form one right here and
whenever the for more modes let's just
add all the items of our string
collection to a list box so we'll just
go ahead and set the name property of
this two
list string collection so come back here
and after we've initialized everything
for our string string collection we'll
type for each item as string in string
collection then we'll just go ahead and
type list string collection dot atoms
dot add and we'll add item okay so now
when we run this we should get Joe and
Bob added to our list right here so we
can also check to see if our string
collection has a certain value in it
so we can just store this in a baleen so
we'll just go ahead and type dim and
then we'll just call it is there as
bullying and we'll set that equal to
string collection dot and now we can
type contains and says determines
whether specified string is in the
string collection so we'll just see if
it contains Jim and this contains
function right here returns either true
or false which is why we declared is
there as a boolean and now I'll just
type message box is there dot two
strength so we convert that to a string
and it should give us a value of false
because we removed Jim from it now let's
go ahead and close out of this here now
we can see if it contains Joe and this
will return a value of true
so go ahead work a little bit with
string collections if you're familiar
with ArrayList by now string collections
will be very easy for you to pick up and
then once you got those down go ahead
and stay tuned for the next tutorial
and thanks for watching guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
