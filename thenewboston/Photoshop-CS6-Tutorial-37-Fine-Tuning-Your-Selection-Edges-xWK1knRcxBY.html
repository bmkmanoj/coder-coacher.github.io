Photoshop cs6 tutorial and I'm your host
buddy Blackbird and have you ever like
tried to use these selection tools and
they were pretty much not working out in
your favor at all the edges were jaggedy
and you can't get a good selection going
on but you basically have the whole
thing selected you got we want selected
but it's kind of like crappy so let us
show you how to fix that and we're going
to be using this refine edge button that
you can find in like all your selection
tools so what I got over here is this
this thing at the beach it's probably
like a lifeguard station I bet but I
have made a selection on it and I used
the quick selection tool along with the
magnetic lasso tool to make a selection
and if you look if i zoom in to around
here you can see that it's kind of like
bumpy and up here it's not that great
it's like jaggedy and stuff like that
and wavy and that's not what I want I
want it to be nice and smooth and clean
so let's go over here to the refine edge
button and click you can find the refine
edge button basically any selection tool
it's always going to be up there where
you make them or you make the dancing
ants or whatever those kind of selection
tools so the dancing ants are these
lines that's what they're called I don't
know why they call them that it's kind
of money though refine edge so then we
get to this screen when you have the
refine edge pop-up menu open you're
allowed to use your hand tool and allow
to use the zoom tool as well so like
this so that's pretty handy and I like
that about the tool we've got a few
different view modes here we've got what
we originally had which was the marching
ants
I said dancing ants didn't I where did I
come up with that
all right we got overlay which just lays
over lays it over a red background black
white black on white and then over top
of your layers that you have so if I I
can't do that but it's over if it's over
top of the layers then you can view the
layers and then you got your reveal
layer so I'm just going to stay with the
marching ants so we can see how the
selection changes off so we got two
buttons over here we got show original
which is just going to show it with your
original selection then we got show
radius if you click on show radius
nothing's going to happen for you in any
of these modes right now what you have
to do is start using this edge detection
and if I move this radius up you're
going to see that the radius has moved
it and this radius here gives like a
little like tolerance kind of to the to
your selection and I pretty much
everything selected the way I wanted to
I don't need a radius so I'm going to
put this down to zero I'm gonna uncheck
show radius so you guys smart radius
here oops
you got smart radius here and when you
click that it pretty much automatically
puts on like the best radius that it
thinks it should have so if I click on
that now it's going to give me like the
best radius that thinks I should have
not much is changing when I click on it
so I'm not too worried about it if I go
to show radius it pretty much thinks I
don't really need one so it should be
good now this is where we can start
adjusting things right here in this
adjust edge section we've got a smooth
button right here and that basically
smooths out the edges so let's increase
that so usually you want to keep an eye
on keep an eye on this area right here
all the way up to that like little roof
and on top of the roof you can see how
they're top of the
rufus jaggedy so keep an eye on that and
I'm going to increase my smooth let's
increase it to 50% which might be a
little too much
so I increased it to 20 and it's kind of
decent feather here creates like a
feather it's new in cs6 so you know it
creates like a soft edge so if I mess
with that it's going to push out my
selection and make like a feathered edge
which I don't want on this contrast
sharpens the image or sharpens the
selection so it removes fuzziness so I
put that up a decent amount it's going
to start sharpening in the corner so I
got it at 100 this is 100 and then this
is zero I'm going to put it up to 100 we
got our edge which moves the edge moves
the selection outwards or inwards I can
see that my selection is on the inside
of this object so I want to shift it
outwards kind of like what the grow
button does
so a hundred percent looks like it's
it's doing good it's going to capture
everything and it looks like it's going
to get some of the outside but that's
okay when we get some of the outside
because of this next section down here
called output and this checkbox here
called decontaminate colors helps take
away the background bleed off of your
object so if I click on that you can
notice that in some areas let me see if
at the last time I was working on it did
up here a lot so let's increase that
trying to see if it does it anywhere
just turn this up I must not be too much
bleed on this anymore it changes the
color a little bit I don't know if you
guys can see it where did I just see the
color get colors get changed if I bring
this down to zero well they're not
getting changed too much
well um usually this takes the
background color off but we aren't
getting too much background color on
here maybe I have my shift up too high
check that no that wasn't the problem
I'm not getting too much background
color anyway so not too worried about
that what it does is pretty much removes
the background color around the edge by
the percentage amount you have down here
in the slider then down in the output -
we got a few different selections here
new layer we'll just create a new layer
with your selected layer mask we'll
create a layer mask for you we haven't
gone over those yet selection will just
keep your selection and then you got
some other things here like new document
and then some new layers with masks and
everything like that then the option to
remember your settings if you ever
needed to do that again so I'm just
going to go to new layer I'm going to
hit OK and now what we have here is this
cutout with me Z and back off and now
we've got this thing cut out and it's
fairly decent I don't want that fairly
decent looking so that's how you use the
refine edge so use that for your
selection tool make things makes it make
things a lot nicer oh man just started
pouring cats and dogs outside it was
just it was just like super super hot
and super muggy out and all of a sudden
it just started raining really hard so
hopefully it doesn't really hunt
thunderstorm too much
and hopefully because sometimes when a
lightnings my computer like just turns
off but I do have it on a power strip so
I'm not too worried about it so thanks
for watching this one give me a thumbs
up if you liked the video give me a

more so see you guys later have a good
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
