your 19th intermediate Java tutorial and
in this tutorial I'm going to be
teaching you guys how to use a generic
return type in a generic method so in
the last method we created we just use
the void return type and printed
something out but this surah I'm going
to shoot like I said how to return
generic data so let's go ahead and
outside your main method let's go ahead
and just jump right into creating my
generic method so what this method is
going to do first and foremost is going
to take three different items which is
pretty much like it's going to take four
eight and ten and it's going to return
the maximum which would be ten or it's
going to take like three strings like
well you know any three names and it's
going to give you the maximum of that so
the one thing we have to take note of is
we can't just use the greater than or
less than sign to compare different
items because we can use it for number
data like four is greater than two but
we can't use it for string data so what
we need to do is find a method that we
can use for both strings and numbers or
any type of data and one method that we
can use for that is called compare to
and you can plug numbers in this strings
or anything so let's go ahead and make
this generic method first and foremost
public static and as your well let's go
ahead and put T extends comparable and
put T in here and what I mean by this is
only objects that inherit from the
comparable class can be used in this
method so now as your return type
instead of putting void number string
let's go ahead and just put T so
whenever you put this before T this
means that you can only use objects that
extend comparable and this means that
you're going to be returning on the type
of T data or pretty much returning
generic data so let's go ahead and name
our method I'm just gonna name
because it's going to find the max of
three things and put generic a generic
type of added type of data be generic
type of data see so now that we got the
header we can go ahead and start
creating the body so how do we want to
actually program this well we're going
to pass it in three variables a B and C
and it has to find the maximum of those
variables so we first need to start out
and assume that let's go ahead and
assume that a is the greatest so I'm
going to have a variable a generic
variable called M and this is going to
stand for maximum so we start out by
assuming that a is the greatest and
we'll just check it later on so let's go
ahead and write our first if statement
if B compared to it already knows
compared to a is greater than zero what
do we want to do well what this compare
method compared to method does is it
either returns a negative number a zero
or positive if the if it's less it's
going to return a negative number if
both the things as comparing are equal
is going to return a zero or if it
actually is greater it's going to return
a positive number so we're saying all
right if next if this is actually
greater than a what do you want to do
well we want to set that equal to the
new maximum so then the maximum would be
B so we already have one test to see
this pretty much compares B and a and if
B is greater than a then the new maximum
is B so let's go ahead and we only need
one more test to check for C so let's go
ahead and write another if statement if
C dot compare to and we don't want to
compare it to a and we don't want to
compare it to B since we don't know what
the maximum is so if C compare to M
which is the current maximum at the time
and we could have even put em right here
but we're don't really need to if this
is greater than that then it's going to
give you a number greater than zero we
want to set the new maximum equal to C
so now all these do is check one against
the other in
mine's the maximum so from here we just
have to return em which is the maximum
so this method gives you a return
statement but the one thing we didn't do
is have a way to print it out yet or
pass any data into it so in your main
method go ahead and put system.out.print
line and just go ahead and what do we
want to print out well we want to print
out this so we want to prompt the max of
just put like twenty three forty two and
one so now what this is going to do is
print out the maximum of this so if we
go ahead and run this we see we get 42
right there
all right so we know we can pass an
integer data but let's see how our
method does against something like
string data so let's copy this and paste
and instead of three integers let's go
ahead and pass it apples arm tots stand
for tater tots and chicken so now when
you run this as you can see our method
returns tots so this is the power of a
generic method with generic return data
not only can accept generic data but it
also can return generic data and this
not only works for integers and strings
it works for any type of data you can
imagine characters floats on anything
that can crash your mind so I hope you
guys understood that Sora if you have
any questions you can just leave me a
comment or send me a message and I'll
try to respond to you and also when
you're sending me messages send me your
code too because it makes it a lot
easier for me but for now that's all the
time I have for this tutorial so thank
you guys for watching don't forget to
subscribe and I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
