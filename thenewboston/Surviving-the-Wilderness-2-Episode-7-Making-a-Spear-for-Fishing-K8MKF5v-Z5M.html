concentrate on making the fishing spear
right now
I'm not really walking anywhere anytime
soon and I don't want to you know get my
hands full and I guess when I'm feeling
ambitious I'll go make the other one
what I'm going to do is I drag this tree
down to the beach I'll call it there's
only like probably like a 100 square
feet of sand but it's a beach to me so
what I'm going to do is I'm going to try
to take a rock and bang this root off
and then I'm probably going to make this
a point and then it's probably a good
length I'll probably cut it right here
too
so I'll cut it here with a rock and cut
it here with a rock then I can sharpen
it with my knife
so I found this right here which is
freaking awesome it's like a edge of a
rock and I think I'm going to hold on to
it right here hopefully it doesn't tear
up my hand and it has a nice little
point as you can see I'm going to chop
with the only thing is if you can see
it's kind of crumpling in my hand it's
kind of brittle you see so hopefully um
it holds up enough so I can chop this
stick
doing better job on my hand than it is
the stick
all right time to go to plan B it's
working a little bit better this my hand
doesn't get pounded with a rock
oh there's one side well that took a
whole lot longer than anticipated
but I finally grinded this down not
really to a point yet but I grinded it
with a rock and I also bang it with the
other one
and you guys saw me get the other side
so now all I got to do is carve this
into a point
I got myself a spear and also what I
would usually do for efficient spear is
you see how this is probably like I
don't know it's probably like the width
of a nickel for circumference what I
would do is usually cut it in fours kind
of like a pie and then I would have four
prongs but I don't know if I'm going to
be able to do that because I think like
the proper way to do it is to put your
knife in here then hit it with a rock or
something or if you had a hatch it would
be really good and then do it this way
but I really don't want to ruin my knife
right now so I'm probably just going to
go ahead and just carve this into one
point and even though you know it may be
a little less effective than having four
prongs because four prongs would be a
lot easier to spear fish with um I don't
know I just don't want to ruin my knife
and bash it with a rock or anything so
I'll probably just carve it into one
point
so there it is the tip of my very first
spear I didn't want it razor-sharp
because there really isn't a point to it
you know it's it's not like you need it
razor-sharp to go through a fish and a
side if I put like a real fine point on
it I'm going to throw it like this it's
going to go down and it's going to hit a
rock anywhere anyway so I've made it a
little more durable a little thicker
point because then when it hits the
bottom of the river it's not going to
just snap so now let's see if there are
any fish in this river</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
