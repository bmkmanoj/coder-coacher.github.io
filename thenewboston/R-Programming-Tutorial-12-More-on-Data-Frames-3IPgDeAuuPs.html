the basics of data frames I want to show
you guys something a little cooler
specifically how to access each element
in a data frame individually so the
first thing that we can do is of course
access an individual column and they're
actually a couple different ways to do
this the first way that we can do it is
using the dollar pull the dollar sign so
I can type the name of your data frame
with a dollar sign you can just write
after this type the name of the column
such as age and it returns of course the
age column pretty freakin simple now
another thing that we can do is instead
of using the name of the column we can
just give it the column number so if we
type X - ages the second column so this
also is going to return that age column
as you can see now aside from this we
can also access individual elements so
how do we do this well of course just
like you know in a spreadsheet or
something we need to give it two pieces
of information the column number and the
row number whenever X is accessing an
individual element so let's just access
the let me go ahead and print X out
first and then we will access the second
row and the second column so as you can
see age is the second row and or excuse
me the second column in the second row
is 13 so of course whenever we do this
we get 13 and that's the row first in
the column second in case you're
wondering
so aside from this let me go ahead and
delete all this we can also do some
pretty cool stuff like if we want to let
me just go ahead and show you guys
instead of talking about it
if we want to do something like this
what this is going to do remember I said
the first one in these square brackets
is the row so this is going to return
Row three columns one through three so
let's see what that looks like
Row three is of course bobbies um a file
or entry whatever you want to call it
and or row you know probably could just
call that the and columns one through
three age ID number or ID number age and
name pretty awesome so that is how you
get everything or just pieces of
information from a single row now what
if you wanted to return just all the
information in a row like people often
do well instead of specifying just a
range of columns you can just leave this
blank and whenever you leave one of
these elements blank either the column
or the row what this is going to do is
it's going to return everything in Row
three a different way of doing it and
you can also return everything in a
single column by doing the opposite
pretty simple stuff so this returns
everything in the name column which of
course is everyone's name so actually
since we have a few more seconds let me
show you guys something real quick this
is actually pretty cool another thing
that I want to point out is something
that's going to confuse a lot of people
whenever we're returning stuff like this
what we're doing is we're pretty much
saying hey data frame show us a piece of
the data frame whether it's a row a
couple rows a cover couple columns what
it's doing is showing us a split a
specific piece of the data frame so
whenever we do something like test the
class of it what it's going to do is
it's going to say okay
whenever you run this it's going to say
data frame but wait I asked for the ages
and of course this ages is a vector of
numbers however I'm trying to get the
class of it so why are you telling me
that it's a data frame well the reason
for this is because you're not returning
one vector at least not to our what
you're doing in this case is you're
asking it to show you piece of the data
frame so whenever you ask for the class
of course that's a data frame as well
but what we want to do is we want to see
what actual type of data is stored in
this column or this vector so how do we
do that well what we can do is this
instead of X with age in quotation marks
what we can do is do something like this
and now when we return it it says
numeric now I know this is confusing but
right here what we are doing is we're
not returning a piece of data frame
we're returning a specific column or a
specific vector in this case the age
vector now the age vector is numeric any
piece of this data frame is of course
just a smaller data frame so I know this
is kind of confusing and hey don't blame
me blame are the creators of this
language made it that way but a lot of
people often um try to test it this way
and they ended it something says like
hey you're doing something and you can't
because it's not in America and well I
just want to clear up the confusion if
you ever need to treat this as a numeric
vector or any specific column that data
type this is how you do it so again kind
of confusing but don't blame me blame
the inventors of our so anyways that is
some more information on data frames and
how to work with columns how to get
single elements out of columns in the
next tutorial we're going to be kind of
moving away for data frames from right
now and talking about lists so thank you
guys and I'll see you guys the next
