video and in this video now that we
understand all of the different terms
concerning waves we can go ahead and
take a look at some simple wave formulas
now before I actually talk to you guys
about the formula itself I might as well
give you guys the variables that we're
going to be using inside the formula so
the very first thing is V which stands
for velocity which is of course the
speed of the wave the second variable we
use is something that looks like that
it's a Greek letter I believe and this
symbolizes the wave length why they just
didn't use W I don't know blame the
physicists not me and the last one is
just F and it stands for frequency of
the wave so say that you were a surfer
in your sin you know maybe you're in
Hawaii on your surfboard riding the
waves and you got bored so there are
some waves right there and I might as
well draw you hey here's my surfboard in
here's me I love surfing in Hawaii uh-oh
scuse me I got like kettle corn stuck in
my freaking throat or something but
anyways you were bored and you decided
that while waiting for waves you wanted
to make some calculations because not
only are you a surfer but you're also a
scientist so the first thing you did was
decide to figure out the frequency of
the waves so you had a little watch and
you figure it out that five waves came
every minute so you went ahead and you
said you know what that is actually
frequency five waves every one minute
but I'm going to go ahead and reduce
this to seconds so this would be one
wave every 12 seconds the next thing you
did is you wanted to define the
wavelength of these waves so you said
okay from this point to this point point
A to point B I'm going to go ahead and
measure that I don't know maybe you had
a freaking tape measure maybe you were
just judging it
but either way you figure that the
distance from A to B was ten meters and
of course you knew that was the week or
what the heck is wrong my frickin throat
sounds like i'm gurgling pudding or
something
all right so bye anyways you now have
the frequency and the wavelength and
you're like aw crap I want to figure out
the velocity how fast these waves are
coming but I don't know how to do that
actually
lucky for you you watch this tutorial
and you know that the formula for
velocity equals wavelength times
frequency and you're like oh yeah I
remember that now so let's go ahead and
make some calculations so in order to
find the velocity first of all you have
to grab a BB gun and shoot this dog
across from me that's barking right now
and once you're done with that go ahead
and take the wavelength which is 10
meters and multiply it by the frequency
which is 1 over 12 seconds so one wave
comes every 12 seconds now whenever you
multiply this you're going to get 10
meters over 12 seconds so of course what
this would mean is the velocity for
these waves right here is 10 meters over
12 seconds or 0.8 3 meters per second so
again that is how you calculate the
velocity or wavelength or frequency
using this formula right here and again
if you want to you know calculate the
wavelength and you just you know divide
both sides by the frequency but for this
formula this is usually how it's written
velocity of a wave equals the wave
length times its frequency and in this
instance what you do if you wanted to
calculate the wave length or excuse me
the velocity of these waves is you would
first to recap one last time get the
frequency so you said five waves were
coming every minute so one wave every 12
seconds next you would get the wave
length and you would times the
wavelength which is 10 meters by the
frequency which is 1 over 12 end up with
10 meters over 12 seconds and once you
multiply those you get your final answer
which is 0.8 3 meters per second that is
how fast the waves that are going that
you're surfing on</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
