to your sixth tutorial in this tutorial
I'm going to be teaching you guys
something called a while loop now what a
while loop is is unlike the if
statements I've been teaching you guys
we're executing the code once if it if
the test was true in the while loop it's
going to execute the coop the code over
and over as long as the test condition
is true so you can execute a piece of
code a hundred times with only having
type one simple statement and the best
way to teach you guys this is just to
get down and dirty and show you guys so
that's what I'm going to do so the first
thing or in case I didn't tell you guys
yet what we're going to be building
today is I entered a hot dog eating
contest and I'm going to make a counter
so I can enter the average so I can
enter the number of hot dogs at a each
day and it's going to find the average
for me so to find the average we're
going to need four variables we're going
to have int loop count and this is going
to count the number of times we execute
on the code or it's going to be the
number of days I ate hot dogs in hot
dogs since we're going to want to have
to enter a value for how many hot dogs
rate in total since to get to average
you need total divided by total number
of days so we need total and in average
sentence to get average I just told you
guys so the first thing we need to do is
set total equal to zero since right now
I told the computer I didn't eat any hot
dogs it the next thing we need to do is
set loop count equal to zero and this is
because we always want to loop counter
to start out at zero or in most cases
you do and now for what you guys been
waiting for to figure out how to use
this awesome thing called the while loop
the syntax for it is really easy all you
have to do is type while in all
lowercase and the compiler knows you're
going to be working with a while loop
let me move this up so you guys can see
it easier and next the will you enter in
your parentheses right after a while
loop is how often do you want this loop
to continue or
the test condition for the loop so we
say all right as long as loop count is
less than five we want you to keep doing
this and since we have this loop count
is less than five somewhere in our
instructions in our curly braces we're
going to need to change the number of
loop count because if we don't then the
loop count is going to equal zero the
whole time and this code is going to
keep going on and on and on so some time
don't let me forget we're going to need
to change the value of loop count
incremented by one or something so the
first thing we want our program to do is
just give us a prompt to enter the
number of hotdogs we ate and we know how
to do this using the printf function um
enter a number of dogs ate and the next
thing we need to do if it asks us how
many dogs wait scanf give it a value or
let the user enter enter value again you
should have learned all this in my last
tutorials % d and set this equal to hot
dogs and don't forget your hope that's
not a money that's ampersand don't
forget to add your ampersand if you
don't you're going to have a world of
problems and after we entered a value
we're going to run alright alright total
equals total plus hot dogs and what this
is going to do is this is going to keep
a running tally stored in total so the
first time we enter hot dogs is going to
write say we enter two hot dogs it's
going to write all right zero equals
zero plus two so now total equals two
the next time if we enter five it's
going to say all right
total equals five plus two equals seven
next time if we enter three we're going
to write it's going to say all right
total equals three plus seven equals ten
so it's just going to keep doing that
and keeping track of the total number of
hot dogs we ate and our last line we
want to do is we're going to again want
to increment this loop count by one
since I ate hot dogs over a period of
five days we're going to put
loop count um yeah let loop count equals
loop count plus one and this is going to
say alright after you're done entering
the first value this loop count that was
zero is now going to be one and after
you're done doing this a second time
it's going to be two three four five and
it's going to do a total of five times
and this is the piece of code that's
that lets you um exit your while loop if
you didn't have this right here and you
had the loop count the same then it
would be zero the whole time and it
would never be greater than five and if
this was true then you will never escape
your loop and since we want this program
the end eventually we need to change the
value of this somewhere and this is
where we did it so after we're done
entering all the value of hot dogs we're
going to want to do let's see what are
we going to want to do let me tighten
this up a little bit make sure I don't
run out of room there we go we're going
to want to find the average number of
hot dogs and of course the figure out
the average of anything you need the
total divided by the total number so in
this case it's going to be five and then
once we're done with that let's just
print our results to show you guys how
many hot dogs I actually did eat so
let's print total number of dogs was
percent d and what do we want percent D
equal to average so again this is going
to pretty much find the average and this
is going to pretty much print it out in
a varial let's put a number so that
little pants on doesn't feed you so
execute compile and run hopefully I
didn't forget any errors or anything
like that
come on baby come on baby no whammy no
whammy enter the total number of dogs
ate so the first day I a to enter second
day I ate four the third day I ate
fifty-four on the fourth day I twenty
two and on the last day I six press
enter
total number of dogs was
17 and again let me show you guys how
this works one more time we set all of
these equal to variables set the total
number of hot dogs 0 we set the loop
equal to 0 so this and this together
showed how many times we want to enter
the value on the first one it let it it
gave us a prompt and told us to enter
the number and this kept going on for
five times and this was able to escape
the loop because of this loop count
right here again if we didn't have this
piece of code right here then it just
what it kept asking us and asking us and
never what to stop asking us and never
would have moved on to this but once
this loop count became greater than five
we were able to go on with the rest of
the program average take the total
number divided by five and print out the
total number of hot dogs so that my
friends is how you use the while loop so
I'm going to have all this code on my
website the new Boston comm if you just
want to copy it right now that's one
we're going to do and paste it to my
site I'll have it for you for free so
again thank you guys for watching and
don't forget to subscribe to my channel
make sure to check out all my contests
again thank you guys and I'll see you
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
