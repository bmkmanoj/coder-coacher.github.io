is bucky roberts and welcome to your
very first tutorial in ajax now before
we start you know the good stuff of
coding let me go ahead and explain you
guys what the heck is ajax ajax stands
for asynchronous JavaScript and XML so
what the heck is that
well basically HX isn't a new
programming language
it's basically a new way to use
JavaScript and XML together to create
some really awesome things on your
website so let me go ahead and actually
show you guys a couple examples in
before I do that it'll probably be a
better idea to show you guys or explain
the origins of Ajax and I'm not going to
give you guys like a brief history of
the internet or anything because let me
go ahead and tell you a little story
whenever I was in college every single
computer class I took it always started
out with the teacher explaining and even
if you buy a book nowadays you know it's
like the first chapter of the book is
always the origins of the internet and
I'm like dude I don't care how Martin
Luther King jr. and George Washington
founded the Internet I just want to
learn MySQL so I just want to warn you
guys that I'm not gonna you know give
you guys the history of the Internet but
it is useful to learn the origins of
Ajax because then whenever you're
developing a web page you're like wow
you know this problem right here Ajax
was made to fix problems like this and
it would actually help you you know as a
web developer so basically what happened
is way back when they didn't have really
interactive web pages the web pages were
basically like books where they just
gave you a little bit of information so
if you wanted to go to you know like the
New Boston to or you type HTTP WWE new
boston org and it would send a request
for that whip file using HTTP which is
the hypertext Transfer Protocol and by
the way a protocol is just a way to
transfer information over the Internet
so say you wanted to see you know a new
web page well just go ahead and click a
link or type it again and boom it would
send that request again and your server
would say ok you wanted this file here
it is
now this is pretty cool but right now
webpages are a lot more interactive
where the user can actually interact
with them now they can interact with
them in a couple different ways one way
is just going ahead and typing you know
your information in the form and sending
it to the server and it does something
however that's kind of the old technique
before Ajax the problem let me go ahead
and actually show you guys some of the
problems arm this is a social network
that I've been working on and I actually
took all the Ajax out I ripped it off to
show you guys what a new website is like
without Ajax so let me go ahead to my
account and what happens if I go down
you know to this person and I'm like oh
this picture is kind of cool Kathy
single berry maybe if I like your
picture then you know she'll want to
date me so I go ahead and like this but
this web page doesn't use Ajax so look
what happens
I press like and the entire web page has
to reload and if you scroll down now you
can see that I indeed I indeed did like
that photo but it's kind of messy
because all I wanted to do was like a
little photo it should be that only this
link updated but just to update this
link and give me a notification that I
like this picture the entire freaking
webpage had to reload well that kind of
sucks and let me go ahead and let me see
give you guys another example say that I
wanted to leave a comment on this it
says okay a couple comments here and I
wanted to respond to Benjamin Lee he's
like wow Bucky your site is looking
really nice i wantam back oh cool thanks
man
and I go ahead and press ENTER in Wow
the entire webpage actually needed to
reload whenever I sent that even though
you know it happened kind of quickly
that's what happened so another thing
and this is you know the last example in
this little Activity Feed right here you
can see that okay this is what people
are up to here my notifications but in
order to refresh this it doesn't
automatically refresh whenever someone
you know makes a new comment or
something you actually have to refresh
the entire webpage
and as you can see it's not very you
know 2013 ish it's old so Ajax it was
basically invented to solve this problem
it allows you to update certain portions
of your web page dynamically without
having to really look reload the entire
page</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
