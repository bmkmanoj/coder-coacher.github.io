your 39 C++ tutorial and in this story
we're going to be covering pass by
reference with pointers and we actually
have a ton of stuff to cover so I don't
even know if I'm gonna have enough time
in this one store oh I might have to
break it up into two different tutorials
but let's go ahead and get started
anyways so we already know from our last
tutorials that whenever we pass an
argument into a function passing
argument into a function basically means
giving our function any additional
information that it needs like in order
to calculate the square root of a number
you actually need a number so you have
to pass a value into that function but
believe it or not it isn't quite that
simple there are two different ways that
I'm going to be teaching you right now
they're actually more than that but for
now I'm going to be teaching you two
different ways to pass arguments into
functions one of them is passed by value
and one of them is passed by reference
now what do I mean when I say that what
we've been doing is basically passing by
value and whenever we create a function
and we pass it by value we pass a copy
of that variable into the function so
the original variable itself cannot be
changed until we set it equal to another
value so that way the function only has
access to the copy of that variable not
the original variable itself simple
enough
values pretty much mean passing in the
copy okay now pass by reference means
this whenever you pass in a variable by
reference you pass in the variables
address and whenever you do that you
basically give the function direct
access to that variable so in that sense
the original variable can indeed be
modified inside your function so why
would you ever want to do that it seems
kind of dangerous well the one benefit
is it's basically less stress on your
computer instead of passing by value
where every time you call that function
it has to make a copy of the variable
suppose you had 100 variables that would
be pretty stressful on your computer if
you pass by reference and you pass in
the value itself it doesn't have to make
copies of every variable so let's go
ahead
and let me start off by making two
variables int Betty and I'll set this
equal to 13 and let's make another
person int sandy and set this equal to
13 to now what we're going to be doing
is passing this one in by value and
passing this one in by reference and see
how they turn out so we're going to be
needing to create two different
functions first let's go ahead and
create a function that we're familiar
with pass by value so void pass by value
and let's just go ahead and create a
basic function it will take a parameter
of one integer and what we're going to
do is take this integer and set it equal
to 99 so basically we're going to be
doing is Betty pretty much X is a copy
of the variable Betty so then whenever
we set X equal to 99 it doesn't set
Betty equal to 99 it just sets this copy
equal to 99 so that's what's going to
happen now let's go ahead and make a
function pass by reference so void pass
by reference hopefully I spell that
right there are way too many E's and
efference reference for YZ I mean come
on guys enough of these so functions
that receive a memory address they need
to have a pointer argument because they
need to have a pointer because a pointer
is the thing that receives the memory
address so now instead of in X you need
to type int pointer X because the
pointer X is now going to be able to
hold that memory address so now when I
whoa one little extra thing there so now
what we can do is something like this
points or X is equal to 66 or something
like that so now instead of the copy of
X being to 99
and now the variable itself sandy X is
the address of Sandy so sandy is going
to be changed at 66 so whenever we pass
Betty in this one her values not going
to be changed whenever we pass sandy
into this we're basically passing in
sandy directly into this value into this
function her address and everything so
now this is a direct access to the
variable sandy so let me go ahead and
first of all we need to prototype these
functions so copy this and paste got a
copy it or did I just do something weird
I might've had a extra character
somewhere better not get error out so
I'm going to be ticked off so copy that
and then copy this reference and pass
paste this in and now check it out
before we go ahead and well let's go
ahead and just use these right now and
then I'll talk to you guys about the
thing I was going to so let's go ahead
and pass by value and we will pass Betty
into this one so we're going to pass 13
in that but her value isn't going to be
changed now let's go ahead and pass by
reference sandy and we're pretty much
given this function direct access to
sandy so that value is going to be
changed so now what we need to do is
here's what I'm going to talk to you
guys about
since we're passing in the memory
address of course you remember from the
last tutorial we need the ampersand
because sandy is the variable and this
function takes a memory address so the
symbol for the memory address of the
variable is ampersand sandy this is
basically equal to some long hexadecimal
address of where that variable is
located on your computer so now let's
just go ahead and print out the values
and see what we get see out arm
Betty is now and then just go ahead and
print Betty and end the line and now do
the same thing for Sandy is now sandy
and lime so let's go ahead and run this
in I guess I can see if I messed it up
anywhere nope looks good so as you can
see we basically built identical
functions however when we passed in
Betty it stayed 13 and when we pass it
in sandy even though it was 13 it
changed it to 66 so now you can see
whenever we pass let me move this down
right here whenever we pass a variable
into a function we can do it in one of
two different ways we can pass a copy of
it like we did in the Betty case pass by
value and what this does is it basically
makes basically X is a copy of Betty it
doesn't have any access to Betty itself
it's just a variable with the same value
so then we set X equal to 99 it's just
setting 99 equal to that copy not Betty
itself so if we pass by reference what
we do is we take the memory address of
that variable and remember your memory
address is some part on your computer it
doesn't make a copy of it it passes in
that memory address itself that memory
address has the value of 13 and we're
saying alright now take that memory
address and set it equal to 66 so no
copies involved here it's taking that
same address the entire time and
changing the value of it so now you can
see the difference of whenever we use a
function like this it makes a copy and
we get whenever we use a function like
this it works with the direct variable
itself so that way whenever we ran the
two functions right here and printing it
out on the screen that's why Betty stay
the same because that copy had no effect
on the original and sandy changed
because it did indeed change the value
of that one address that variable was
only a one address and we passed it in
so it had direct access to it
so I am out of breath and hopefully you
guys understand at least the concept of
pass by value and pass by reference
just remember when passing by value
you're passing in the copy when passing
in reference you're passing in the
variables address if you understand that
you're good to go at least for now so in
the next tutorial I'm afraid we're not
done well I got like Fleming my throat I
can't talk I just had a milkshake for
McDonald's and anyways moving on so in
the next tutorial unfortunately we're
not done covering pointers yet so yep
more about pointers I'm sorry so thank
you guys for watching don't forget
subscribe and I'll see you guys in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
