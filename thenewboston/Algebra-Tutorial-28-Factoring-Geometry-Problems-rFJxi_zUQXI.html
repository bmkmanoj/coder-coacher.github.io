to use factoring to solve GM geometry
problems so a square had nine
centimeters added added to its length
and 3 centimeters added to its with its
new area is 280 centimeters squared find
its original length and width so first
we had a square that had a length and
width and now we have a new square whose
length is l + 9 + W plus three birds
with so we know that this new area is
280 centimeters squared so to find area
we multiply the length times the width
to get to 80 and since it's a square
that means that this lengthen with are
equal so we're going to represent this
with an X here and not an L and then X
here instead of a w so this is X plus 9
and this is X plus 3 so when we rewrite
the area we get X plus 9 plus X plus 3
equals 280 now we have to foil this out
in order to set this equation equal to 0
so x squared plus 3x plus 9x plus 27
equals 280 we're going to combine like
terms and bring this to 80 over so you
get x squared plus 12x minus 2 53 equals
0 now
when we factor this if you divide 253 by
different numbers you'll get that 2 53 /
2 23 is 11 and 23 minus a negative 11
gives us 12 so that's so we know that a
positive 23 and a negative 11 are going
to go there so now we set each one of
these equal to zero if you subtract over
you get x equals negative 23 and if you
add this ever get x equals 11 since
we're talking about distance we can kick
out this answer because distance can't
be negative so we find that X is equal
to 11 but they wanted to know what the
original length and width was so that
means that its original length is 11 and
its original width is 11 let's do
another example the length of a
rectangle is 5 meters greater than twice
its width
and it's area is equal to 33 meters
squared find the rectangles length and
width so the length of a rectangle is 5
meters greater so 5 plus twice its width
so 5 plus 2w so its width is going to be
equal to just plain w so its area is
equal to 33 meters squared so that means
that its length times its width is equal
to 33 if we distribute this w we at 5w
plus 2w squared equals thirty-three now
we're going to set this equation equal
to zero and i'm going to rewrite this in
decreasing order so then we're going to
have to factor this so this is going to
be 2w this is going to be w so the
factors of negative 33 r 3 and 11 now
since we have a two in front of this w
when I these two numbers is going to get
x 2 in order to make these to add to get
five this has to be a positive 11 and
this has to be a negative 3 and then if
you foil this back up you'd get 2w
squared minus 6 w + 11 w minus 33 and 11
w minus 6 w would give us five so then
we can set both of these equal to 0 2w
plus 11 equals 0 w minus 3 equals 0 so
add 3 over and we get W equals 3 with
this we'd get
w equals negative 11 halves but since
we're talking about length can't be the
answer so it wants us to find its length
in the width so its width is right here
w but its length is equal to 5 plus 2
times W which is three so it's like this
equal to 11 that's all we're going to do
with factoring in order to solve
geometry problems make sure you come
back and check out our next lesson where
we're going to talk about dividing
monomials</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
