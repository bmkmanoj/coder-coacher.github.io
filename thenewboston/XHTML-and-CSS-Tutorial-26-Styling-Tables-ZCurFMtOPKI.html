CSS and XHTML tutorial and in this
tutorial we're going to be styling some
tables it's going to be nice so let's go
ahead and jump right into it so let's go
ahead and make a table let's go ahead
and make like two rows and three columns
nice and simple so table and of course
you need one of those so ending table
and let's just go ahead and make our
rows first typical row terr and a nice
little tear right there and let's just
go ahead and add our cells table data
ending table data and what are we going
to put in here I love Bucky and just go
ahead and copy this so it gives us three
columns so now we have a table with one
row and three columns in it so if we
want in another row to be lazy just go
ahead and copy this and paste it right
underneath there so now if we save this
and take a look at it here is our table
right there if you highlight it you can
kind of see the rows and columns easier
so we have two columns I mean excuse me
two rows three columns looking pretty
good so what now we're looking at this
table and we already know how to add a
border but I mean border I mean come on
we can do a little bit better than that
so let's go ahead and style this up and
I you know make it nice and fancy so
let's go ahead up in here up in here up
in here y'all going to make me alright
anyways nothing me singing let's go
ahead and first of all we want to style
the overall table and whenever we do
this the entire table is going to be
affected so later on well you'll see
what happens later on so let's go ahead
and just give this overall border we'll
use that shortcut so we don't have to
define each one individually just make
it like three pixels on solid blue so
let's go ahead and save this refresh and
see what we got
so now around the entire table we have a
border that's three pixels it's
and it's blue exactly what we expected
but now what if we want to do something
a little bit fancier what if we want to
say alright I want to change these rows
individually to uh I don't know with a
background of yellow or something and
then even furthermore I want to take
each individual cell and around each
individual cell I want to add a border
so we have six individual box looking
things well actually it is possible to
do that and see I says so let me go
ahead and show you guys arm let me go
through and do that for you guys and
then I want to go over a few things so
let's go and for our table row what I
say background color yellow not yellow
yellow that's the old butter yellow you
there get it in certain phone that's
pretty corny joke anyways so now if we
go ahead and save that check it out
refresh and now the entire row is yellow
and this row is yellow too I mean why
wouldn't it be so let's go ahead and
take that table data which is of course
the individual cells and what I say like
add a border so border equals two picks
I'm not solid we are to use solid dashed
red so let's go ahead and save this and
refresh it and see what we get we get a
nice - pixel - red border across each
one of these cells and the thing I
wanted to mention is this even though we
have a style applied to each individual
piece of data and also a style applied
to each row whenever you apply a style
to the individual pieces of data it
doesn't override on the table row the
table row stays in the table data gets
inherited so by that I mean here's what
I'm trying to say whenever you make your
table row yellow
and then you make your table data
whatever you want it doesn't replace the
table role since you did this
everything gets inherited down so
whatever you did table gets affected on
the whole table whatever you did to the
table row gets affected in the table row
and the table data and whenever you do
to the table data affects only that
table data
I mean I probably just confusing you
guys even more by saying on that but I
mean if you just look at what's going on
you can understand how it works in that
it's not really overwriting anything
it's just adding to it that's I guess a
more simple explanation so anyways that
is the basics of how you style a table
and check it out this is a lot better
than you know just adding a border to
the table now you can do stuff like this
and make your table a lot more easier to
read and just give you the idea that you
can in fact style tables just like any
other XHTML element so anyways thank you
guys for watching uh go have fun styling
your tables and when you're ready I'll
see you in the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
