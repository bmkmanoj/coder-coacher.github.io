and in this tutorial I'm going to be
teaching you guys how to create a very
simple HUD or heads-up display now if
you guys don't know what it is it's
basically the part of the game that is
just for the player to look at to see
you know how much health they have left
how many coins they collected um you
know how many lives they have left and
stuff like that so since you have a very
simple game right here what we can do is
the only on piece of information that
I'm going to display in our HUD is the
score
aka how many monsters did that player
kill and typically it would be a lot
more complex like you know what's your
health how much energy do you have left
but for now I'll just teach you guys the
basics I mean get adjusted here it's
going to be doozy alright so the first
thing I want to do is I want to create a
whole new layer for the heads-up display
because the background layer is just you
know the texture obviously the main one
is for all of our sprites right now um
the monsters that move around the player
the bullets explosions I definitely
don't want to put it here because you
know I don't want the player to
accidentally shoot the text on the
screen this is the high score and it
blows up or anything like that so I'm
going to be making a whole new layer and
we can just rename this to HUD which
means heads-up display and also make
sure that you have it selected so it's
your active layer and once you do before
we actually start adding text go over in
the properties and set this parallax to
zero zero now the parallax I won't get
too much into detail because we have a
bunch of stuff to do but it's basically
for heads-up displays and when you set
it to zero zero which is the X and
y-axis it pretty much says stay in one
place in don't um like keep it as a
heads-up display don't scroll it when
you scroll the camera or anything like
that so now that we have our main layer
that we're going to be storing all our
heads-up display information on we can
go ahead and actually create an object
so again make sure you have this
selected in double
click anywhere on the screen that
doesn't matter and whenever you
double-click it just brings up the
insert new object panel and will just
insert a new text object because it all
it's going to do is pretty much display
the score and text so now it gives you
crosshairs pretty much asking where do
you want to put it I'm just going to put
mine in the top left corner and now as
you can see well you probably can't even
see but it created an object in the
default text it's kind of small and it's
black so it's incredibly hard to read so
let's go ahead and change the color of
our text because right now this is what
our score it would be too hard to look
at so click this object the text object
and the first thing I want to do is
change the color so if you click this
drop down to bring it bring like a
really bright yellow just basic yellow
and okay click away and we can still see
that you know it's still kind of small
to be honest so let's click this again
in order to change the size or the font
family just go ahead and click this and
actually if you make it bold give a real
big sighs like 36 not that big yeah
let's go 36 right we've got any cool
fonts and nope not really now let's just
go ahead and give it this is like a
tough decision I'm just like it doesn't
really even matter
Oh font not supported eh all right we'll
just stick with basic Arial and now if
you can scroll away you can't see that
text anymore and that's because you're a
bounding box or the size of it isn't big
enough to encapsulate 36 pixel text or
point text so just make sure your box is
big enough and now any text that you
have is going to appear in here but now
if you play the game it just has the
word text not our high score not the
coolest thing so how do we make this
actually display the high score or
excuse me the score of the user well
what we need to do is
we need to go in our event sheet and
basically keep this high score keep
saying high score it's going to frighten
call high score who cares keep the score
updated so how often do we want to
update it well we don't want to update
it we actually can update it every time
you shoot a monster or kill one but what
I want to do is just store this in on
every tick so pretty much constantly
keep this updated and what action do we
want to perform well the action that we
want to form is just changes text so it
displays the score so add action and it
is what's my object name hold on a
second so this is actually text - it's
called so add action for text - which is
that little box and we want to love
where yeah well there's actually a
couple ways that we can do this now I
think about it but the easiest way would
probably be set text set text right here
and you guys probably are going to like
this if you're not really programmers
but what we can do is in between double
quotes I'll type it all out in between
double clothes just put on current score
and outside of double quotes put an
ampersand which is the symbol above the
7 on your keyboard and then just put
score and hit enter and I'll tell you
guys what this means what this means is
no matter what whatever is in between
your double quotation marks it always
display so it's always going to say
current score with a space after it now
what this ampersand does is it says okay
now after this combined this piece of
text with a variable now this score
right here if you remember it's actually
it's not the word score it's actually a
variable that keeps track of the score
so right now it's going to say current
score 0 to start the game and then when
shoot one it's going to say current
score one whenever you kill two monsters
it's going to say current score two so
this is the part that's going to change
hit done and now everything should be
goes long everything should be good to
go
as long as I didn't mess anything up so
again current score zero to start and
then what's going to happen is every
monster you kill it increases the global
variable of score by one and of course
that global variable is displayed right
here and then you can just like keep
track of your friends who got the
highest score again pretty boring
heads-up display right now but uh it
gets the job done
so that's your very basics of creating a
heads-up display and of course you
eventually want to add some more things
to here like your players health may be
how much energy he has you know how much
food he has left or how many bullets
would be a good one so in the next video
we're probably going to be finishing
things up for this very simple game but
again if you have any questions just ask
me on my forum be glad to answer it for
you so until next video I'll see you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
