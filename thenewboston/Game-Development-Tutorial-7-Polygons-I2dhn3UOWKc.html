game tutorial and in this story i'm
going to show you guys how to draw
polygons now a polygon if you don't know
it's just pretty much a multi-sided
shape it couldn't have like any number
of shapes you want I mean any number of
sides you want so in this story i'm
going to show you guys exactly how to
draw it so the first thing we need to do
is pretty much have a list of points in
what pi game is going to do is take all
these points and pretty much connect the
dots and everywhere you give a point
it's going to draw aside from point to
point from list the list and it's going
to end up with a shape depending on how
many points you give it so let's go
ahead and make a list of points right
now and i'm going to name mine points
and what we need to set it equal to is a
list so in your square bracket you need
to give it as many number of items as
you want and these are going to be the
coordinates for each point so the first
coordinate i'm going to put it like 2120
the next coordinate i'm going to put out
140 x 140 what should be to the right
more in lower more and the last
coordinate let me put the top so 110
over and 30 down so now that we got our
three points these are three points so
of course it's going to be three sided
shape which is going to be on a triangle
the next thing we're going to need to do
is give a color and i'm just going to
you'll see why this is a lot simpler
this way so i'm just going to make mine
I believe yellow is 255 255 0 so now
that we have points and a color we can
go ahead and create our shape of our
polygon so let's go ahead and do that
right now in first thing we should do is
lock the screen after this let's go
ahead and create our shape pygame module
there's a draw
and this is polygon this is the polygon
built-in method or function the first
parameter it takes is what you want to
draw it on and this is screen the next
parameter it takes is the color and of
course you can do to this and then this
and then this but of course we have this
handy little color variable that we can
use just as easy so let's use color
right there and then after this the
third parameter it takes is that list of
points but fortunately we already have a
list of points in that points variable
up there so we don't need to have a
really confusing um function so this is
just a different way where you can pass
variables into these parameters and it
will use that and it just makes it looks
a lot nicer so after this let's go ahead
and unlock the screen screen with a
unlock function and now we should be
good to go something go ahead and run
this module save it and let's go ahead
and as you can see we have our nice
triangle right here with the first
coordinate how to i can t remember what
they are at twenty across 120 down the
second point is 140 across 140 down
right here and the third point which is
right here is 110 across and 30 down so
that is how you get those three points
and make up this nice polygon shape and
this is a simple triangle right here but
you can have yours on any number of
points you want if you added eight
points to it then it would be an octagon
so on and so on so that's your quick
tutorial on how to make simple polygons
or gongs simple polygons with pygame so
in the next story i'm probably going to
show you guys another shape or how to do
it in different kind of way so thank you
guys for watching and soon enough we'll
be putting these shapes to use to make a
sweet game but again thank you for
watching don't forget to subscribe it
and I will see you next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
