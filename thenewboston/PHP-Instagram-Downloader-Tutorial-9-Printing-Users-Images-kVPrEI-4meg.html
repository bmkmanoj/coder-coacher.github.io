video I'm gonna show you guys how to
print images out on the screen pretty
sweet so it's pretty much like one step
away from actually downloading and
saving them actually what I can do is
store this in a variable username and
set this equal to use your name and then
we'll just past it and be a little bit
better save this and make sure I didn't
mess anything up and then we'll get on
with the tutorial all right looking good
so anyways as promised let's go ahead
and learn how to print as out on the
screen just to verify to the user that
you know maybe you want to show them the
images that they are indeed saving and
downloading so we'll just put print show
just put like yeah print out is on the
screen and the function name for this
print images and of course we didn't get
that user ID for nothing so let's just
go ahead and pass that in and we can
actually pass it in right now
user ID is equal to that user ID and
actually we can return this now now that
we know that it works we aren't just
printing it out on the screen
so basically we're going to return these
our ID which is in this case right here
and then we're going to store it in the
variable user ID how convenient is that
and then we'll just go ahead and print
the images out on the screen through the
use of the user ID so you know it
actually knows whose images to print so
the first thing that we need is a URL
and if I copy the first part of this
right yeah right there so let me close
that up it's annoying me alright so the
URL to get images is users slash and
then you type the the user ID and
actually I'll just do all this right now
instead I'm putting those stupid X's all
right so users slash user ID now the
next parameter that we need or the next
directory is media that's where all the
images in photos are and we want recent
and that's pretty much is how you sort
them and now for this you just put your
client ID so recent and then we're just
going to put
one second someone's at my door are told
it we have to do okay where the heck are
you okay recent question mark Lyon I be
to steal this right here and of course
we'll just set this equal to the client
ID which is : ID now one other parameter
that we actually want is how many
pictures do we want to retrieve and for
this we can just append one other
parameter which is count so if you use
an ampersand count if you actually set
this value to negative one it's gonna
get all of your pictures it's not gonna
be like you owe me a picture so negative
one means all your pictures but I'm only
gonna want to return five because if I
download all of my Instagram pictures
every single time then well it's not
gonna be fun so let me make sure this is
right users user ID media recent
customer client ID be clean and with the
parameter all right so this looks good
right here so now that we have the URL
of where the information is and what
information we're requesting we can just
go ahead and do this we'll store an
Instagram info again connect the
Instagram with the same URL and we can
actually use this one right here to
which it's encoded right now so we're
just gonna store the results in this
nice little variable color results and
now here's the thing and here's what why
this is different see before we were
just getting one piece of information
like the user name the user ID but now
we're getting a bunch of pictures which
means that there's a bunch of
information stored in this results it's
not result set so what we need to do is
actually parse through this result set
and handle each of the pictures one by
one so in order to do that I'm just
gonna make a for each loop and the
parameter for this is the results data
because there's actually a bunch of
information in each
and we're just gonna treat it as items
so now essentially each of those images
is now a variable called items and
actually input parse through results or
parts through images whatever you want
to say now the first thing that we want
is the URL of the image so I'm going to
store this in a variable called image
underscore URL and I'm going to set this
equal to the item the items and I'll
tell you guys what the parameters are
images and I'm gonna put lo underscore
resolution right here and this is gonna
give me um a small it's like a little
bigger than the thumbnail it's probably
like 200 by 200 pixels if I'm gonna
guess um there's also standard
resolution and there's one other one I
think I can't think of right now but
standard resolution is a little bit
bigger but you know just for this
example low resolution you're gonna be
able to see it just fine and the last
one is the URL and now what this is is
basically it's gonna go through all my
results which is pretty much my five
most recent pictures and it's gonna give
me the URL of those now eventually what
we're gonna be doing is saying okay PHP
go to this URL save the picture and
store it on my server but for right now
we can just echo it out using HTML so
echo and of course any time you want to
echo out um actually you can just do it
like this let go image source equals
image URL actually I don't want to do it
like that
echo image URL and then I'm just gonna I
don't really think I need to do that in
html5 and then just break that so source
cleaning this up a bit alright so
hopefully what happens now is we already
called this function and we print images
it's gonna say print the images of this
user so it's gonna say okay you gave it
the user I'm gonna go get the images and
for each image I'm gonna give you a list
of them loop through them and print them
out one by one and we probably messed
something up as usual now I got a good
feeling about this but now you have to
go back to the beginning because your
code actually expires from time to time
so it's always good to go back to the
beginning whenever you're testing out
and check it out and since I broke those
at the end using this liner right here
that's why they're printing on a new
line for each one but these are
basically the last most recent five
images I posted I was at a hockey game I
was wearing this with my sister some
random girl sent me a picture and this
funny thing from my Breaking Bad I
posted so those are my five most recent
images so now that it's working and we
pulled them from the instagram database
properly what we need to do now is write
one more function and that is save the
picture on your server so we're gonna
pass it in this URL right here and we're
gonna say okay go to this URL take the
picture save it on the server it's
actually a lot easier than you guys
think so thank you guys for watching
don't forget to subscribe and well I'll
see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
