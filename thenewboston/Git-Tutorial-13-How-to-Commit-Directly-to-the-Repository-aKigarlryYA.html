tutorial and in this video you guys are
going to love me this is probably going
to be your favorite video yet because
I'm going to give you guys a huge
shortcut and that is I'm going to be
teaching you guys how to commit directly
from your working copy to your
repository so the first thing we need to
do before you can commit any changes is
actually make some freaking changes so
let's just go ahead and file open or yet
dogs we're yet oh let's just open like a
index and about all right so this is
index and it doesn't really matter what
you change okay so first of all let's
just say that this comment is a way too
long so I'm just going to make some
changes right here because we don't need
all these equal signs so save that and
in about same thing so these two
comments right here are too long
cleaning up comments so hit equals
hit equals and boom look that we just
make two changes to the website to make
it a little bit better the comments were
messy and now we clean them up a little
bit to be honest the changes don't
really matter just make any changes
whatsoever so now of course before what
we could do is we can go ahead and add
these to the staging area then we could
commit them but if you think about it
there really isn't a need to add them to
the staging area first because we know
that these changes we want in our final
project in our repository or on the
server for everyone to pretty much have
updated files so what we could do is
this go ahead and type git status first
so we know what's going on and set Bucky
you have two files that are different
from your working copy than the main
repository so what I'm going to do right
now is hit git commit before even adding
these to the staging area and what I can
do now is hit - a-m so it's not just the
ordinary mess
it has that - a and now let's go ahead
and press like update it or let you say
clean up the comments I might as well
put HTML comments so now whenever we hit
Enter check it out it says two files
change three insertions three deletions
and basically what we did is we took a
shortcut instead of adding it to the
staging area first whenever we type get
status we can see that our working copy
is now the exact same as the repository
so pretty freakin cool
and now you guys might be like sweet I
never have to use the station here you
hit well not quite this is only useful
in certain situations and I want to talk
to you guys about those situations right
now the first thing is whenever you use
this command let me go ahead and type up
the command again the - a.m. you need to
be careful because it's gonna grab
everything in your working copy so if
there's only one file that you wanted to
add maybe you weren't ready to add the
other file yet do not use this command
because it's going to grab everything
that was in your working copy and any
changes it's going to go ahead and push
them right to the repository so that's
the first thing you need to be aware of
another thing is this is only helpful
whenever you're editing or modifying
files if you do something like um delete
one of these files or if you're moving
them around and renaming a bunch of
stuff do not use this command either
only when you're making very simple
edits - probably a few files that's when
you want to use this command so again
that - a-m which is the regular message
but that - a it allows you to skip the
staging area and commit directly from
your working copy to the repository so
hopefully you guys can utilize that in
the future thank you guys for watching
and in the next video I'm going to be a
mo teaching guys something notes derp
obviously anyways I'll see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
