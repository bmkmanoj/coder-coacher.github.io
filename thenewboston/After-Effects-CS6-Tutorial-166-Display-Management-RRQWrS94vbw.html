Effects cs6 tutorial
I'm your host buddy Blackford and I'm a
little extra happy right now because
last night the chocolate chip cookies
that I was about to eat were really hard
and I was kind of pissed off that I
couldn't really eat them I thought they
were stale but then my bud told me to
put in a put cookies in an airtight
container with like a piece of bread and
that in the morning they would be soft
and lo and behold it worked so I'm not
extra happy and I just ate like five
cookies and I feel like garbage but it
actually made me happy I guess so I was
just more excited that the cookies
actually became soft I didn't think that
was something that was possible but this
tutorial that I'm gonna go over with you
is about the display management for
After Effects and for like your monitor
so you can figure out what is displaying
properly on your monitor so under the
view here we've got a used display color
management system here and what happens
is when you have that checked your
operating system tells after-effects
what it should use to like properly like
calibrate your monitor and everything
like that now I have Windows 8 and I'm
using a PC so it's obviously Windows so
the way that I'm gonna show you is gonna
be on the windows and then up I'll tell
you like the path for a Mac so I'll just
show you really quick so you want to
bring up your control panel for Windows
and you wanted to come to display now
where the heck is that I just had it
it's probably under hardware and display
and so we've got display here and I want
to come down to change display settings
and then advanced settings and color
management and then click on color
management again
so now we've got our color management up
here for our monitor now for a Mac the
the way you usually get to it is let's
see
I think it's System Preferences and then
you go to displays and then you go to
color and and then it'll bring up
something just like this almost that
what that you can use to find your color
of your monitor so I've got the my
display here and if I want to go to the
Advanced tab for Windows and it's got my
device profile and the system default is
the srgb IEC six one nine six six so now
I know that my system is on the srgb and
that's what I'm mainly looking at
through After Effects especially when
it's on like the default now you can
always come down here and calibrate your
display so that the colors show up a
little better and you can do that on the
Mac also so that's how you do that and
figure out what your monitor is the if
you have a cheap monitor then you're not
gonna be able to see most most of the
time you're not going to be able to see
like a wide range of colors and stuff
like that so it is beneficial if you're
doing a lot of work to get a nice high
quality monitor you don't need to spend
a zillion dollars on it because most of
the time if you're working from your own
computer you won't be working on like
really really high profile stuff usually
you'll be going into a studio because
they want to check and see how you're
working and everything like that now the
reason why you want to do this is to
pretty much sync up your computer
monitor and your images and the profile
that you're using in After Effects now
all of this seems like pretty complex
and everything like that
and actually is but it's if you're
working on a project that you're getting
paid like ten thousand dollars to do
then you want to make sure it is correct
and you want everything to be right and
you don't want to mess up and hand your
client something that looks like total
crap on their TV or whatever they're
gonna be viewing it on so this is some
stuff that you need to use for advanced
projects and like really high end
professional projects so if we turn this
off if we turn the use display color
management off then it's not going to be
communicating with our computer and
it'll just load the default what we've
got going on in our product settings so
if we use the shift plus the numpad
slash that is the hockey so that's a how
you use that and how what that means and
how it's related to your computer so
that's about it that I'm going to talk
about that just it's just keep in mind
that using these color management
techniques helps you get closer to
perfection within colors so thanks for
watching this tutorial and I look
forward to seeing you on the next
tutorial we're gonna talk more about
some color management techniques that
are a little bit different than using
profiles so see you guys later at that
tutorial have a good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
