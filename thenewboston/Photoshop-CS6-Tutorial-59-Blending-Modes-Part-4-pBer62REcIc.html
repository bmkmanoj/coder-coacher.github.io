of the blending mode tutorials
I'm your host body Blackford and let's
get into this I suggest that you watch
the first three tutorials before you
watch this one so that this will make a
lot more sense to you especially the
first one so what we're gonna do is get
into these this group here which is the
second to last one the first two here
are called an inversion group and the
second to our cancelation group and
together they're called the inversion
and cancellation group pretty much they
just put them in the same group so let's
start out with difference now one thing
I'll go back to difference now one thing
about the inversion and cancellation
group is that they use complex math
equations to figure out the different
colors and rather than telling you what
these equations are and how they do with
all these words that you might not
understand why don't I just like give
you like some like terms of you like
using these so pretty much the
difference mode here similar colors
cancel each other out and create black
and a math equation does a selective
inversion is what it's called where the
black it never gets inverted white gets
inverted absolutely and then all the
other levels invert based on their
brightness so pretty much all the colors
get inverted and the similar colors
cancel each other out it's kind of
complex and my advice is put your layer
on to difference and see if it looks
good and what you're doing and if it
doesn't then don't use it if it does
then use it
same with exclusion here in this one the
similar similar colors cancel each other
out but they produce gray instead of
that's the difference between exclusion
and difference so exclusion produces
gray now we'll come down to subtract
which is in the cancellation group and
it's like the kind of like the opposite
of difference here the the blacks don't
change colors and the whites drop out to
black so you're not gonna see like
whites in here same thing goes with the
cancellation groups just put them on
your image and if you like what it looks
like then keep it if you don't then
don't use it the next one is divide and
divide is different from subtract is in
that the whites they don't change color
and the similar color turn white instead
of black so that's that for the
cancellation group let's go to the
bottom group here which is called the
component group and the first one we're
going to start on is hue so I'll click
on hue and what it does is it keeps the
hue of the active layer so the one you
have selected and blends it with the
luminance in the saturation of the lower
layer so that's what he does and then
I'll come down to saturation and
saturation keeps the saturation of the
active layer and then it blends the
luminosity and the hue from the
underlying layer and then colors from
the active layer are saturated they're
gonna appear using the luminosity and
hue from the underlying layer so that's
what saturation does now let's go to
color
no color it keeps the color of the
active layer so the one on top that they
have selected and blends the hue and
saturation of the active layer with the
luminance of the lower layer and then
you get something like this
luminosity so that's kind of weird
looking
it keeps the luminance of the active
layer and it blends it with a hue and
says saturation of the composite view of
the layer below so composite view is the
RGB view so that's what comes out to
this and like I said before with the
with the cancellation and inversion
groups that you want to just test it out
on your image I test the blending mono
and if it looks good use it and if it
doesn't does it don't use it if you
don't want to remember all the different
things of how they work just remember
that little piece of advice there I
guess so I thank you for watching the
blending mode series hopefully you
understand blending modes a bit more and
can use them more to your advantage and
you can think of using blending modes
when like in the pre-planning process
you can like expect to use those that
way when you know what they all do it's
easier to pre-plan so thanks for
watching I'm glad you guys stuck around
thanks for the views and remember to
subscribe if you want to see more
