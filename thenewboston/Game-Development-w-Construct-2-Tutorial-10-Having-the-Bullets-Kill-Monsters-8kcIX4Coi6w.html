what we're going to do is well show you
guys so right now our dude has a gun but
whenever he shoots a monster the bullet
just goes right over top of them nothing
happens and what we want to happen is of
course
it kills the monster with a cool little
explosion why the heck not so in order
to do that we need to add another event
basically saying when the bullet hits
the monster the monster destroys in an
explosion happens so if we add an event
what we can do
o is we can oh my god what is wrong with
me as soon as I start making these
tutorials you know it just feels like I
drank like 18 milkshakes all the phlegm
in my throat but basically what we want
to check out for is something to happen
to this bullet so go ahead and double
click the bullet and the exact event
name is on collision with another object
so on collision with another object and
we're basically saying okay you want to
see if the bullet collides with
something well what do you want to see
it if it collides with well the monster
so this event that is checking for is
when the bullet collides with the
monster and now we just got to say what
happens
well we actually want to have a couple
different things happen and the first
thing is this we want the object of the
monster to be destroyed so monster
destroyed that's pretty straightforward
now we on also want the bullet so click
bullet next to spawn another object so
we whenever the monster or excuse me
whenever the bullet hits the monster we
want the explosion object to appear
right where that bullet was because
that's where the explosion happens so if
you go to spawn another object the
object is the explosion and I'll slow it
down a little bit the lair is one
basically we don't want it to happen on
the background but on the main layer and
the image point we can just go ahead and
leave at zero because your
not going to be able to tell difference
between the middle of the bullet and the
tip of it because they're like a pixel
apart so click done and the last action
that we want to make occur is the bullet
itself gets destroyed
so click bullet and scroll all the way
down and under miscellaneous
click destroy and hit done so what we
basically did is we said ok when the
bullet collides with the monster a
couple of things are going to happen
first of all the monster is destroyed
because they got shot
second of all there's going to be
explosion at that point of impact and
also the bullet gets the Shred because
you know you're not going to have an
explosion and then the bullet keeps
going so now let's go ahead and run this
and check it out what happens okay so it
shot the monster the monster disappeared
the bullet disappeared and if I start
that again
you see that explosion but first of all
that explosion looked kind of weird
because in this explosion image that we
have there's like a black arm like a
black background on it so we can go
ahead and actually get rid of that in
the game we don't need a photo editor
program to get rid of that and I'm going
to show you guys how to do that in the
next video so the next video is actually
going to be probably pretty quick we'll
get rid of this black ugly background on
the explosion and I'll show show you
guys how to make your monsters a little
bit smarter so they come toward your guy
instead of just going all in a straight
line like they're in some you know
idiotic military or something something
guys for watching and I'll see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
