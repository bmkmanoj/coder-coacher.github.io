PI game tutorial video in this video
we're going to just continue on what we
were doing and we're building our CX
free scripts so we can convert our PI
game into an executable so we've
completed all of our options and now
we're ready to just do the last few
things that we need to do I'm going to
go ahead and bring my text a little
blogger again um
and now after options we just have we
can put in a couple more things here
there is you can also put in version and
stuff like that but we're just going to
make this pretty simple so well we can
add a description if we want and for
that I'll just say a slither game
tutorial and then we're going to say
executables equals executables
and that's it for a CX free setup also
we need a comma here I forgot my comma
and that and that should be everything
so now we've got our CX free setup
completed and now we're actually ready
to run the procedure so let's go ahead
and save the setup pi and now what you
want to do is you want to navigate your
command line your terminal whatever to
the directory of our script so here is
where we are this is the setup high file
that we just created here's our images
and then here's the actual PI game that
we want to convert so again we can just
double click on that and we can play it
but it requires us to have Python and PI
game installed so we'll go ahead and
quit that now and so what we're going to
want to do is bring our command line
here now if you're in Windows the
easiest thing you can do is come over to
the directory so in this directory is
where this stuff is so you can go to
that directory hold your Shift key right
click and then say open command window
here and that's going to open up your
command window right where you want to
be now this first line is really long as
this is like hidden away um and in fact
just so it's like more clear I'm gonna
go ahead and take this I'm gonna move
this to my desktop
whoops let's copy it to my desktop that
way that open file isn't going to give
us hell so we'll close out of this and
I'll open up this so this is where we
are so again I'm going the same thing I
just did only this time it's on my
desktop so I'm holding shift and I'm
going to open the command window there
that way I have a little bit more space
so you guys can see what I'm typing so
now on Windows what you're gonna want to
type is either Python setup dot pi build
so we can do that I'll hit enter now and
that's going to go ahead and start the
build process or run build and all that
might take a second especially on like
32-bit might be really slow um but
that's it we've got the build done just
as a quick aside if you if that didn't
work if it's a like pythons not like
command then you want to give the full
path to Python so I'm using Python 3.4
so where's that located well if we go
over here hit C I see it C Python 34 now
what actually is Python it's right here
it's Python right so um and we run that
and that's actually like a Python
application right so if it says it's not
a register that means pythons not on
your path so python is not on your path
so then you would do c colon slash
python 34 python set up pi build ok so
just in case python is not in your path
but it wasn't my path so it's all
hunky-dory so now when we go back to our
directory we see that we now this new
folder called build will click on build
will click on this folder again if
you're on 32-bit might look a little
different but anyway and then we see
we've got a bunch of crap in here but if
we scroll down here's our PI game
tutorial so now we can click on this it
brings up this time it brings up a
console window but this is not a python
console it's a game tutorial DXE is what
we just clicked on and here is our game
we can proceed we can play it and we can
have a good old grand jolly ol time so
now what you could do is you could zip
up
this this game and you could share it
with your friends you don't have to zip
it up you could just send them all these
files it's not really that big
for example this file is maybe the
numbers come on just doesn't wanna give
me the number for some reason there we
go wow this one's actually huge
it's a massive game um probably because
of all the packages it's holding in here
let's see how big TCL is and TK what a
huge thing ago or some reason we're
packing inside pie here in numpy I don't
think we use Syfy or numpy looks like
those are the largest things being
sucked up in this game but anyway the
other thing that we can do is well is we
can come over to our slither game and
remember how we did build here the other
thing that we can run is we can build a
Microsoft installer so I'm gonna see if
I can get away with the leading our
current build I can cool now instead of
Python setup hi dot or sub spy build
what we can do instead is be dist
underscore MSI and now we'll run that
it's going to run a fairly similar uh
sequence that we did before this one
might take a little bit longer than the
original though wait for it
um I guess while we're waiting you can
just keep in mind that what I've created
here on a 64-bit machine that means that
this is a 64-bit installer that's being
made and so that's great but what about
a 32-bit folk well to do that as far as
I know the only way you can do that is
you have to be on a 32-bit machine and
build your distribution so just keep
that in mind so now we have our build
and then we have our B dis and all that
out the other it's good that it's empty
but then in here we've got our typical
executable but we have this new file and
it's dist and we click on that and we
see that we've got slither and that's
our game and this is actually 55
megabytes not huge but for the
simplicity of our game that's kind of
comical Oh anyway
we can double click on that and that's
going to open up like an installer so
this wants to install slither to see
Program Files slither and then you know
the user could hit OK next and all this
fun stuff and now it's going to actually
install slither on my machine under
Program Files run through it so we did
that finish and then we can come over a
see Program Files slither and here's our
slither game so as you could probably
recognize it that way you're not saying
something like a big old zip and all
that but anyway they can click on it and
they can play a little slither game so
that is how you can distribute your PI
games all your friends show them how
awesome you are because you made games
so anyway hopefully you guys enjoyed
hopefully everyone's got it working if
you might find that some things don't
work
chances are fonts can give a little bit
of trouble using sis font sometimes it's
better to use an actual font get the
full path to the font like in Windows
for example I want to say it's in like C
80 windows and then fonts
organize here I think that's right yeah
so see windows fonts and then here's
where you have like all of your fonts so
you can give the full path to your fonts
and that might be a little bit better of
a way to share because this will build
these fonts so if someone doesn't have
these fonts it might cause trouble but
for the most part CH breeze is
relatively well updated but yeah
sometimes you're going to come up with
some weird errors but anyway that's it
now you can share your game with all
your friends so hopefully you guys
enjoyed thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
