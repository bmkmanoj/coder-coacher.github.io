Blackford and I'm here with another
Adobe After Effects cs6 tutorial for the
new boston today we're going to be
learning more about animating
specifically keyframing velocity and
speed and a little bit about the motion
path I'm going to teach you a little bit
about different types of keyframes and
we'll go from there so if you look here
I created a motion path by animating the
position and it's just three keyframes
and a covent kind of an arch so I want
to show you about the motion path is in
between each of your keyframes so if you
look at the motion path there's little
dots each of those dots represent a
frame and when you get to the bigger
squares that's your actual keyframe so
between this big square and this big
square there's this many frames now the
closer together the dots are I'll show
you that the farther apart and slower
your animation is going to be now you
can see there's a whole bunch of dots
because I drag the keyframe farther away
from the first keyframe so let's put
that back somewhere close to the middle
now realistically I'll show you the
animation real quick it's just not too
realistic it's just a basic animation so
in real life an object will accelerate
in the beginning and maybe accelerate or
decelerate around this position around
the middle position and then at the end
position it'll decelerate and you can
achieve this in After Effects to make a
more realistic animation to do this
let's go down to the last keyframe where
we know we will be decelerating and
we'll go up to make sure it's clicked
you know it's clicked when it has when
it's highlighted go up to the to the
menus up here and click on animation and
go to keyframe assistant and you can
click on easy ease and when I click on
this
watch the dots at the end how they
change move this all the way you can see
that the dots have gotten closer
together into a decelerating fashion now
I'll show you a real quick another
animation preview if you watch the end
it slowly comes to a halt instead of
like just stopping on a dot this makes
the animation look a little more
realistic now the pretty the hotkey for
the easy ease ki is f9 and you want to
remember that that's the most important
one to make the keyframe not be an easy
escape room anymore
hold ctrl or command on Windows and
click on the keyframe and I'll put it
back to a regular keyframe when you use
the easies keyframes it automatically
figures out which is the best position
for you to or what is the best way for
it to interpret how you want to use the
keyframe so if we put it at the start
and convert this into an easy keyframe
I'll show you another way real quick is
to right-click on your keyframe and go
to the keyframe assistant and click on
easy ease again and you notice that now
it is accelerating so the keyframe the
easies hourglass icon there it show it
figures out what would be best so at the
beginning it will accelerate and at the
end it will decelerate for you so I'm
going to ctrl click on the hourglass
again to change it back now if you want
to be more precise and maybe the
keyframe easy ease didn't work the way
you wanted it to you can also use a
different method if you right click on
it and go to keyframe assistant and you
can choose if you want it to go in or
out so in the beginning if you wanted to
accelerate click on out and it'll do the
same exact thing you can see that it
turns into an arrow pointing to the left
so let's preview it real quick alright
and you can do the same thing with the
end one easy ease in let's preview
accelerates then decelerates now it's a
little bit of more smoother animation
easier on the eye zoom in again that's
pretty good for this part of the
tutorial that basically taught you about
the motion path and the easy ease
remember that these are the frames in
between and remember that in our
composition that we created the go to
the composition settings here that we
are at 24 frames per second for the
frame right you can we pick that it
might be you you can change that anytime
you want
it's a not always smart to change it in
the middle of animating and stuff like
that because it'll might screw up your
previous animations but it's always
better to animate remember that f9 is
the hotkey for easy ease and you don't
really have to remember the easy ease in
and easy ease out keyframe or hotkeys
because you don't use them as much as
the easy to regular easy ease but here
are the hotkeys shift
f9 and ctrl shift F 9 it's kind of not
easy to it's not like an easy hockey to
just use where you can keep your hand on
one hand on the mouse and one hand
hitting the hotkey like this one so
let's head off into the next tutorial
where I'll be teaching you how to smooth
out your animation and and we'll see
what goes on from then hope to see you
guys there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
