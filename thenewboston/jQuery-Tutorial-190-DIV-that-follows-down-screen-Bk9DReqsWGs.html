it's a bit you know away from the edges
the border and the background color so
basic CSS we've that we've made
however it's fundamental that we have
all these you know like the
position:absolute and the left on top 10
by 10 because this is important with
regards to actually making it scroll
down the page so if you were to style
this in any other way the properties
that you might want to change are these
ones here you can obviously change the
top and the left but the
position:absolute is absolutely
necessary so now what we want to do is
go over to ext doc J s which like I
mentioned I have included as an external
javascript file as well as jQuery and we
want to go ahead and start writing this
out so the first thing we want to do is
once our document is ready so we use the
document ready Handler inside here we
want to outline a function and this is
just everything that's going to run once
the Dom has been loaded okay so what we
want to do is go ahead and actually
first of all we'll go ahead and just
fade this in just as a you know a basic
effect so we can go ahead and use a
jQuery selector to select this div which
is called follow and we want to go ahead
and fade this in so a basic animation or
effect in jQuery and I've set this to a
speed of normal but obviously you can
choose a speed in milliseconds or you
can choose slow or fast so we have slow
fast or we can go ahead and give it a
you know a number that we want to a
number of seconds that we want to fade
it in by so I've got a thousand here
which obviously represents one second
all you have something a bit longer like
three seconds and you can see that that
would just well it hasn't faded it in
for some reason let's just go and check
why this might be oh okay yeah that's
because we currently have the element
shown already so back to style dot CSS
we want to go and say display:none and
now when we refresh you can see that
will fade in of a period of three
seconds but we don't want it that far oh
that's low so we'll just stick to one
second
okay so now what we want to do is
actually make it scroll down the page so
we need to use the window selector we
need to select window and then use the
scroll event handler so we use window
dot scroll window is the place that we
are referencing the selector and scroll
is the event handler so essentially what
this means is when we scroll down the
page and inside here we want to go ahead
and create our function and all this
content just here is going to happen as
we start to scroll either down or back
up again so every time we scroll we
perform the set of actions within here
and the first thing we want to do is
actually get the top of you know we want
to get a variable that's the top of the
window so we want to for example say var
top so we're setting a variable called
top and then we want to get the position
of the scroll so window dot scroll top
and this will give the this will give
the top of the windows value essentially
so you know wherever we are we can like
add an amount onto this but you know
we'll just go ahead and and actually set
the CSS of the div so what we want to do
is we want to as the window Scrolls down
let's just say we go ahead and scroll
down to about here let's just say that
that that's scroll down 50 pixels for
example now by scrolling down 50 pixels
we've now set this var top to equal 50
so what we need to go ahead and do is
change the CSS properties of top to the
amount that we've scrolled for example
if we'd scroll down 50 pixels we want
this to be top +10 so essentially we're
just taking this variable top which
represents how many pixels have been
scrolled down and then we want to make
this equal or equal plus ten to the the
relative position
the absolute position of our div so we
can go ahead and again select follow and
we want to set the CSS properties of
follow and this will modify not
obviously not file modify bit or
temporarily modify this top value here
and we want to select the top value so
we're modifying the top property which
we can find here and we want to set that
to top because top is now the current
position that the user scrolled or the
amount of pixels that users scrolled
essentially the top of the script how
much it's scrolled</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
