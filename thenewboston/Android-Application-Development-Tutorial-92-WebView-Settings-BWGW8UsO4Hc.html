Android tutorial for the new Boston and
what we're going to do in this tutorial
we're basically going to use some of the
webview settings to achieve some more
desired results that we want to get for
example one that we were going to
achieve through the settings is kind of
whoa everything's freaking out here
we're going to kind of zoom out and you
know make it match the width here and
then another thing that we're going to
do is we're going to enable JavaScript
so if we use right now example WW
youtube.com/ and we go YouTube uses
JavaScript so right now it says please
enable JavaScript on your browser so
that's what we're going to kind of
achieve in this tutorial with the
settings so we're going to do we're
going to go into our on create method
here we have our webview setup and you
know just right before we load our URL
or I mean I guess you can do it after
that or before that as well this is
where we're going to use our settings so
the first thing we're going to do is
we're going to enable that JavaScript so
what we're going to do we're going to
say our brow for our web view and then
we're going to say get settings and we
can do a lot of things with these
settings I'm just going to show you a
few here such as enabling JavaScript so
we're going to say set JavaScript
enabled and that's true or false so it's
as simple as this true now we can load
websites like YouTube etc websites that
use JavaScript that's how you do it you
get the settings of the web view and
then you set something like JavaScript
simple codes and methods as well but now
what we're going to do is we're going to
kind of define again zooming out and
setting up our our our website to be
zoomed out for the most part so again
we're just going to say our brow then
we're going to say get settings
oops and first the one that we're going
to use we're going to use the load with
overview mode so we're going to say set
up set load with overview mode and you
know the documentation doesn't really
tell us that much so I'll elaborate on
what this means here in a second so
that's the first thing that we need to
do and then we're going to also say our
brow and then we're also going to get
the settings oops and then we're going
to say dot and we're going to say set
set use wide viewport and again that's
true or false we're in south 'true as
well so now we kind of used some of the
settings to achieve some of the methods
that we want to do one other thing that
you guys probably should do anytime you
use this load URL method I know it's
kind of out of order here but we
probably want to do like a try and catch
so we're just going to set that up real
quick and catch and then exception e and
then just a dot print stacktrace
because again it might not always be
able to load so it's nice to surround
that with a try and catch which we kind
of talked about in the past as well all
right so now let's talk about these two
methods is set load with overview mode
and the set use wide viewport mode
basically with this set load with
overview mode it's kind of hard to read
sometimes without spaces for some reason
I don't know why but basically what that
is is this going to say if we want it
completely zoomed out or not so we want
that to be true and then what this one
does is basically that's going to allow
us to kind of set up a normal viewport
such as like a normal desktop browser
for the most part so we want that to be
true as well instead of if we set it to
false it'd be you know constrained to
its own dimensions for the most part so
I don't know if that made too much sense
but again that's kind of what those
things mean because you know the
manifests or I'm sorry the Javadoc
doesn't really describe them too well
but let's just run our application make
sure everything works and that's pretty
much it for this tutorial guys alright
so let's open this up and hopefully it
will be zoomed out when it loads the my
bring back sight and as you can see it
is zoomed out so that's nice and it's
not really constrained to anything so
that's good as well and then let's check
out the website to make sure the
javascript is enabled so we're going to
say HTT p-- http:www.youtube.com/watch v
the web view stuff for a foreigner now
anyways I'm probably done with it so
I'll catch you guys in the next tutorial
