Android tutorial for the new boss in and
we're getting close to actually you know
putting in our our triangle on the
emulator there so we can see it we
basically have set up everything that we
need for a triangle class so we're just
gonna you know go over to a renderer
class because this where all the magic
is gonna happen and what we need to do
is first reference that triangle somehow
so we're just gonna build a constructor
for this class as well because again our
activity is you know calling this class
so we want to make sure we have a
constructor constructor as well that
sets up our triangle so we're just gonna
say public public GL render X and then
all we're gonna do is set up a triangle
with in here and got make sure you spell
it right obviously and so we want to set
up a triangle instance as well we're
gonna set this to be private we're just
gonna say GL triangle DX I'm gonna call
it try something like that then what
we're gonna do is we're just gonna set
our try within our constructor equal to
a new triangle or a new instance of that
class and there we go now we have our
triangle object within our renderer and
again we created a draw method within
our triangle so within our on draw frame
all we have to do is basically say well
I shouldn't say all because as you'll
see here in a second it won't actually
print this to the screen yet but it is
actually drawing it in OpenGL so what
we're going to do is we're going to
refer to our triangle and just say dot
draw and we're gonna pass in again the
GL 10 object that we're being pass in
within this method so you know it's
pretty pretty simple again we get this
geo object that's being passed in and we
just pass it into our triangle to create
our triangle and set it up and all that
good stuff we have that draw method
within there so that's what that's doing
but even if we run the application right
now even if we run the application right
now we just get all red we can't see in
thing we don't know where our triangles
at all that good stuff and the problem
is is let me go back to blender and
again we are drawing our triangle but
you know we might have a different
perspective you know for example our
camera right here is looking at the
square let's say we moved to a mode
where you know our camera is looking and
off into the distance over here instead
of you know a tower at our actual square
so that's kind of what's happening so in
the next few tutorials we're gonna learn
how to glue the camera to look at a
certain position we're also going to set
up our viewport so we know how how wide
it is and set up our you know projection
so it's not all skewed but yeah thanks
again for watching guys I know it was a
pretty simple tutorial where we just set
up our triangle and drew it but again
hopefully you guys understand a little
bit more about the GL just because you
know it seems like it should be printing
to the screen which it is but we can't
actually see it because we don't know
where our camera is looking and all that
good stuff so I'll catch you guys in the
next tutorial hope you have a good one
and see you later alright and also
because we didn't really talk about too
much I'm just gonna add a little bit
more to this tutorial so what we're
gonna do is we're going to basically
when we create a render of some sort or
GL OpenGL you know class it loads it
with some default stuff that might even
hinder performance so we're actually
gonna give us some space space within
our on surface created and we're just
gonna say GL dot disabled because we
don't want you know everything that they
give us sorry its GL disabled and what
we're gonna disable is the dither so we
were gonna relate to the GL 10 class dot
GL underscore dither and that's just
going to speed up or performance a
little bit and you know not worry so
much about the quality but you know
worry a little bit more about the
performance and also we can just
elaborate a little bit more by saying GL
GL hint and we have to reference a
target so we're gonna say GL
ten dot geo underscore per spekt
spective correction hint and then for
the mode what we're gonna do is GL ten
dot GL underscore fastest that's just
going to again booster performance a
little bit more and not worry about the
the quality as much so there's just a
quick you know add-on to this tutorial
again you guys might want to just copy
this this did their line and put it
within your ondraw method there on draw
frame method or something but there you
go and I'll catch you guys in the next
tutorial and hope you have a good one
see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
