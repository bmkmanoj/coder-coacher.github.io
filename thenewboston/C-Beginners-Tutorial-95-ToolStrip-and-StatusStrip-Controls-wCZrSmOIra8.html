tutorial then I'm making toward the new
Boston and in this tutorial I'm going to
be showing you how to use the tool strip
all control and most going to show you a
DC status strip control so we're first
going to be looking up a tool strip
control so let's go over to your tool
box and drag a tool strip onto your form
tool strip right here and basically a
tool strip will just hold on different
options that use you're going to have so
and this right up here is a tool strip
and on this tool strip there's a things
called drop-down buttons and on these
drop down button we see we have all
these different options well we can make
these in NC sharp right here so in order
to add a drop-down button
we're just going to click this little
down arrow and click drop down button
and this will add a drop down button to
our tool strip right here now as you can
see under our drop down button we can
type in items that we want to be
displayed on our drop down button so if
we just want to have open be an option
and say you'd be an option let me just
type those in and just type in a little
boxes right there so now we debug and
click this little down right here we see
we have open and save as options now if
you wanted to have different options for
save like save as new or overwrite and
you have these well so now any debug you
will see that this branches off into
another one with more options right here
now right up here is only displayed the
image and if you want on the text to be
displayed go over to the display style
and change that to text now it will
display the text of this tool strip so
we're going to change that to something
different I'm going to file because
these operations right here pertain to a
file or a file so now you see file right
here so now we see file and you put down
on it you can have open and safe
if you wanted to have the image and the
text be displayed just go to display
style and change that to image and text
and now you see we have an image or an
text if you wanted to have image for an
option on your drop-down button you can
do that just select the drop-down button
that you want to have an image on and
then just go over to the properties
panel and go down to image and then just
browse for image but first we need to
download an image and a great website to
download images is icon finder calm and
once you're on here just search for
anything you would like I just search it
for open so I'm applying an image that
we want to have her open right here this
one seems pretty good let's download it
in PNG format and then we're going to go
back to see sharper here and browse the
image that we downloaded this image
right here click open click open and yep
as you can see right there now the image
for our open button and displayed so not
only do bug click the file open we see
these a little image there which makes
it just look a lot nicer you can
obviously do one first save as well you
don't have to be limited to just drop
down buttons on your tool strip you can
also add other things if you wanted to
add just a single one so if you wanted
to have an image be displayed there or
again you can take it to text so if
wanted us to say about then change its
flow style to text seeing you know a
button about it just says about to get
more information about the program with
this you can also add things such as
progress bars and text boxes and combo
boxes so if you wanted to have a combo
box if you have an options inside of it
to do that as well the other thing is
interesting is a separator and a
separator will can't really do much with
it but basically it just separates
different options on your tool strip and
earn it up here you can see like there's
different beasts the separator just
separates the different tools and the
grooves so all these have to do files
like opening and saving them so that
put a separator after it and they have
to do with other things it is copying
and pasting and stuff like that and the
other control that we're going to be
looking at in this tutorial is the
status tool strip so just go over to the
tool box and drag a status strip over to
your program right here and basically a
status strip is basically just used to
display the status of something and
usually what you're going to want to use
this for is just adding a label to it
status label and then basically is
changing this when something is
happening so if you're opening a file
and you could change the sailor greeting
file if it's saving say saved just
things like that so this basically just
gives the status of what is happening on
or going on in your application you can
also add progress bars drop down buttons
and a split up basically what that means
it is just a button with different
options inside of it so we could just
add another option underneath this
button like save as and this button is
just like a Save button
so yeah those are just examples well
that's pretty much it for this tutorial
on the status strip and the tool strip
controls so see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
