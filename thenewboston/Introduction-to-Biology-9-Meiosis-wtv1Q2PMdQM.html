and in this video I'm going to be
covering meiosis meiosis is also known
as reduction division this means the
cell is going to go from diploid or two
sets of chromosomes to haploid or only
one set of chromosomes this is going to
occur in the sex cells which are also
known as gametes and unlike mitosis
there are two nuclear divisions instead
of just one
you've got meiosis 1 which is the
reduction phase and meiosis 2 is the
division phase during prophase 1
chromatin is going to coil to form the
simple chromosomes the nucleolus and
nuclear membrane disappear homologous
chromosomes pair up forming what is
called a tetrad and these tetrads can
wrap or synapse and something called my
excuse me crossing over may occur
spindle fibers are going to appear and
if the cell has centromeres these
centromeres are going to migrate to
opposite ends of the cell here in my
little drawing you can see that the
nuclear membrane is disappearing you've
got two chromosomes consisting of two
chromatids so you've got four chromatids
total and then during crossing over got
your two chromosomes here sometimes some
of these chromatids can switch over
they're actually going to break off of
one and attach themselves to the same
location on the other chromosome this is
what is called a chiasmata so you've got
one chromatid with part of another
chromatid on it and then one regular
chromatid in each chromosome during
metaphase one the tetrads are going to
move to the center of the cell and
spinder five spindle fibers are going to
attach through centromeres of each
homologous pair you can see you you got
both chromosomes here in the middle of
the cell and all the spindle fibers are
attached during anaphase one each
chromosome which consists of two
chromatids is pulled away from its home
but unlike mitosis in anaphase sister
chromatids are going to remain attached
to each other and you can see in the
drawing you got each chromosome being
pulled apart each chromosome consisting
of the two chromatids
and during telophase one chromosomes are
going to consists of two crew sister
chromatids but only one chromosome from
each of the original pairs is on either
side of the cell
after telophase one sometimes cells go
through a phase called
inter Kinesis this may or may not happen
but if it does they're going to be two
haploid nuclei that are going to be
present and the chromosomes are going to
uncoil but this is a very very short
phase during prophase 2 the chromosomes
and spindle fibers are going to reappear
and if the cell has centrioles they're
going to remind rate to either side of
the cell during metaphase to spindle
fibers are going to form and attach and
the chromosomes are going to migrate to
the center
so unlike metaphase one we're both
homologous chromosomes were paired
together everything is just gonna line
up in the center on its own
during anaphase to each individual
chromatid is going to be pulled to an
opposite side of the cell so they're
gonna be four chromatids each from one
side of one pair of the homologous
chromosome say you got chromatid from
each chromosome and finally during
telophase two four haploid nuclei are
going to be formed each one having one
of the original chromatids and then
cytokinesis is going to form four
