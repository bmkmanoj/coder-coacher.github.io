tutorial in this little mini series and
of course right now what we did is we
went to a web page we got all the words
we have them in the list of nice clean
words without any stupid symbols so now
we just need to create a dictionary a
dictionary of course consisting of each
word and how many times appeared in the
webpage very simple stuff so I'm going
to make a function called great
dictionary and of course we need to pass
it in our nice clean word list right
there and now since we're actually
saying that we're going to create a
function let's go ahead and create the
function so that's our function name
Pesta than that looking good so the
first thing we need is to create a blank
dictionary that's going to store all of
the words so I'm just going to name it
word count and of course the create
blank dictionary just set equal to two
little curly braces right there so now
what we want to do is we're essentially
just going to loop through our list of
words so I'll just put on I'll just name
it forward in clean word list and not
work or war or reset now for each word
it's actually going to be really easy
what we want to do is we want to say
okay if that word is already in the
dictionary then just add one to whatever
the current count is if it's not in
there yet then create an entry for it
and set it equal to one since it's the
first time coming across that word
so we'll say if word in word count then
this means that it already came across
that word before it's already in your
dictionary so all we need to do is take
the word count
so in this dictionary whatever that word
is add 1 to the value of it so if it
came across it nine times before it
would add one to it of course I know
it's self-explanatory so else
this is going to occur if it's the first
time coming across the word so I can
actually copy this and if it's your
first time coming across the word then
add that word to the dictionary and set
the value equal to one or the counter
equal to one whatever you want to call
it so now with this loop we created a
dictionary that stores each word in that
webpage and it also stores the frequency
or amount of times that that word
occurred so that's all we have but right
now our dictionary is just whatever
order it was processed and and it's
unsorted of course what we want to do is
we want to sort our dictionary based on
the frequency of the words that occurred
so I don't want to go and scroll through
everything and try to look for the
highest one I want a program to do that
so how do we sort a dictionary by the
value well all we do is this for there's
actually a bunch of different ways but
this is actually a really easy one so
for key value because we're looping
through a dictionary and sorted now
sorted basically takes the first
parameter is saying what do you want to
sort well we just want to sort this
dictionary word count and we want to go
through each items and this is pretty
much saying arm I don't know it's just
saying you need to give it a bunch of
items to sort now each dictionary item
is made up of a key and a value the key
is the word like we learned and the
value is the frequency so it would be
like - not 18 Bucky
4 so what we want to do is if we just
sort it by the key it's going to sort an
alphabetic order if we sort it by the
value it's going to sort in numerical
order so this is kind of confusing um a
parameter of sorted because it uses key
what it's not talking about the
dictionary key whenever we pass it in
the parameter and sorted function is
saying the key is basically tell me what
you want to sort by so we want to sort
by operator
item getter one so what's this mean well
like I said what operator does is it's
basically something that we import it
and they just allows you to work with
the built-in data types in Python so
it's not really important it's nothing
that we have to memorize now what item
getter is is it basically says okay I'm
going to go to your dictionary and I'm
going to get an item from your
dictionary to survive now your
dictionary each entry only has two
specific items it's composed of a key
and a value so if we wrote 0 it would
sort by key we want to sort by the value
so we're going to pass it in 1
simple enough so now all we have to do
is now that we got a nice sorted
dictionary we just need to print it out
so key and value and this is going to
print out a nice hopefully sorted
dictionary so check that out
so actually you see how this is sorted
by value now so the word a occurred 34
times the word I don't know about
occurred 6 I show you guys what I was
talking about with this if we sort it by
the 0 with item in other words the key
of course that's when it sorts by
alphabetical order and we don't want
that we want to sort by the value or the
amount of times the word occurred so
that's what we get so in this webpage
the most frequently occurring word was a
and if we scroll down all the unique
words or this feature through great
Hungary clearly inch encourage all that
stuff so that ladies and gentlemen is
how you make a word counter or a
frequency counter and Python and again
you can use this for a bunch of stuff
search engines use this to find out what
content is your website related to if
you ever make an ad network then you
would look at this it says and say okay
so this website must be related
tutorials in bacon which pretty much
that's all my web
it is so it would put ads about
tutorials and bacon on there and well if
you ever were just interested in maybe
your own blog saying okay what words do
I use more than I should
okay I should probably start stop typing
a every other sentence you know you can
do something like that so hopefully it
helped you out and also as always if you
want any of the source code from this
tutorial then just go to my forum and
I'm going to be posting it all in the
Python section right here so uh well
that's it and also if you have any tips
for improvements or if you want to offer
any suggestions on how this can be
better maybe taking out some common
words then join the discussion we would
love to have you but for now thank you
guys for watching don't forget to
subscribe I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
