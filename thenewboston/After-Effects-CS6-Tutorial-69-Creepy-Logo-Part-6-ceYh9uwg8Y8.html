creepy smokey logo tutorial that I put
together this is Buddy Blackford and we
are using After Effects cs6 and today we
are having like a major hot and humid
heat wave again which seems to be a
recurring theme every time I decide to
make some tutorials but I'm gonna bare
through it and and just push on through
the Tauri tutorial and seriously I'm
just sitting here and I'm not doing
anything except for talking and I'm
still sweating and it sucks but what
let's do this in the last tutorial we
added some effects onto our text and
made it Crowley and made it cool-looking
so this time we're going to add a reveal
so it doesn't just sit there so what I
decided to do is use a particle system
within after-effects to make a smoke
cloud that comes rushing across and
rills the text if you want to do a
different way like a fade on or anything
like that that's also awesome you can
just animate the opacity well I'm gonna
show you how to use a particle system
and reveal your text it that way so
let's get started the first thing you
need to do is create a new layer and
it's going to be a solid so new solid
we're gonna call this smoke cloud or
something to that effect
and I'm gonna make it like this color
gray just so I have a different kind of
color right there the the color isn't
gonna matter because we're going to put
a particle system on it so let's go to
effect
and I think it's simulation and then CC
particle world and what happens is we it
gives you a new particle system and this
is already 3d as you can tell by this
little cube box here so we don't need to
turn on the 3d box here and we don't
need a camera or anything like that so
let's see I first I'd like to get rid of
all all of this visual cues and stuff
like that that they have on there so I
toggle down the grids and guides and I
uncheck these boxes here I want the grid
off and then horizon can be off and
excess box can be off so I don't I don't
like having all that stuff in my way I
know what's going on and this is pretty
much just a 2d view anyways I'm not
gonna do it anything really in the
z-axis so we can toggle that back up and
now we can come down to the producer
here toggle that down the particle here
and we'll toggle that down I think we're
gonna mess with the particle first so we
don't have this kind of stuff I'm gonna
put it's on 1/2 right now I'm gonna put
this down to 3rd it's gonna look a
little crappy but then I'll switch back
and forth so you can see how different
how nice it looks and whatever so this
is what you start off with and I don't
know why they may start off with this it
looks like junk but let's go a few
frames in or a few seconds in maybe
about you know stay at 2 seconds because
then our particles are already on the
screen
so we want to change the particle type
here to faded sphere which is right here
and what we're gonna do is get all these
clump together and then change them into
a nice-looking kind of cloud now we're
going to change the birth size here to
0.5 and the death size to 0.75
let's change our max opacity to 33 and
we're gonna change our colors here to
some more smoky bluish colors so let's
change this one to like a dark bluish
kind of color like this and then this
one we can change to like a more of a
bluish gray like something like this
so I'm gonna turn this back up to half
so we can kind of see what's going on
you can kind of see the particles in
there so we're gonna have to put them
together and make more of them so first
let's change this to screen for the
composite or for the transfer mode here
we can tore up the particle section you
don't need that anymore let's change the
birthrate up here to something like 45
see now we got some more smoke going on
here and the longevity 2.5 so they don't
last forever we can change the radiuses
here so it can be point three this can
be point one and the radius Z can be
zero since we're not looking at this in
3d
now let's go to the physics here
we can change the animation to Direction
access change the velocity to 0.5
so we got here alright
let's go back to where we can actually
see stuff I probably don't want this
much gravity gravity pulls the particle
system down I'll go over this see see
particle world more in-depth in a new
tutorial that way we can just get
through making it and you can see what
it does in this tutorial so let's set
the gravity to zero now you see we've
got something that's just going straight
across now
so I mean that looks pretty good for
some quick smoke we're gonna make a rush
across the screen so it doesn't need to
be perfect and if you work in a studio
or on a movie or something like that
you'll see that stuff isn't isn't like
really perfect in the movie so you just
get it done especially if it's really
fast so I think that we should throw a
blur on here so I'm gonna throw on a
fast blur and if you don't want to mess
with a whole lot of blur options then
fast blur just does basically blurriness
and the way to way it goes so let's do
that looks good it's gonna rush across
the screen so it's not so we want it to
be a little blurry and now all we really
have to do is animate the the smoke
coming across so we can do that in the
producer thing yep producer and if we
hit the stopwatch on position X
and let's move ahead maybe one second
here what's hit the let's go into our
smoke cloud poverty so we can edit
keyframes and press you to bring up the
keyframe bubble are the properties that
we have keyframed let's hit another
keyframe here now it's a built up the
smoke is already built up so if we click
on the on the layer the red part of the
layer here and drag it so that so that
it's already built up at the start of
the scene like this that way we don't
have to wait for it now let's fix where
the position is which is going to be all
the way off the screen so at that right
there that's off the screen looks like
negative two point zero nine
and then let's make it rush across a
screen
we can test to see if this is fast or
slow enough in a second
so that's 3.17 for me let's render it
let's drag this out so it's all the way
there let's move the work area to like
two seconds here and then we'll see how
fast it goes I'm gonna save it before I
we Ram preview it so it doesn't crash if
it wants to particle systems are
intensive on your computer so sometimes
it may crash if you have a lot of stuff
going on so I always save right before
so Ram preview this should be a fast Ram
preview at least so fast going across
this seems pretty good
I think it's on there for too long so I
might want to decrease the the Y radius
don't really want it to be that much so
what's
no that's not what I wanted
not that one about this
yeah
X radius
so actually I think we're gonna decrease
the longevity a little bit that way it's
not so long which makes sense
Oh point three five maybe and what's up
to birth right so it's a little more
thicker I want to see what that looks
like
ram preview
I think the speed is good
might be able to make it a little slower
but speeds good see what happens if we
make it a little slower
and that's fine there wasn't a whole
difference but just make it to your
preference if you want it faster make it
faster if you want to slower just make
it slower by dragging the keyframe back
back and forth so we'll stick with that
for now
that's our smoke coming across and in
the next part we're going to animate the
a mask on the title so that it reveals
the title and we're also going to do the
same thing with the smoke that's going
over top of the title so it reveals that
also and all of its gonna just appear
when the particle system goes across it
so I will see you guys in the next
tutorial and the next tutorial should be
the final one so we'll we are close to
finishing so see you guys there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
