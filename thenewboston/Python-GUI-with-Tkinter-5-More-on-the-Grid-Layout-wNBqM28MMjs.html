already placed it right there and now
whenever we want to align it to the left
right top or bottom
we need a new parameter called sticky
now what the sticky parameter says is
okay inside that container you want to
place it to the right which means right
aligned left left aligned so on and so
forth well if we want to place it to the
right right sticky e now whenever we're
using the grid it's not going to take
left to right on top of them it's going
to actually take n e SW in that sense
for north east south and west of course
north is on top east to the right south
on the bottom west to the left simple
enough so sticky e means place this to
the right in other words right aligned
this arm you know simple enough so now
actually I'm going to right align both
of those so now check it out how simple
is that we just right aligned it don't
believe me check it out so now name and
password are both right aligned even
though you really can't tell password
because you know it's already nice and
tight this is how I want my text fields
to appear pretty awesome so since I have
a little bit of time left there's one
thing done that I pretty much can show
you guys and that's this now say that
we're making a login for like I don't
know a web site so what we can do is we
can actually add something to the bottom
of this that's a little check box that
says keep me logged in that way whenever
they close out of the software and open
it back up
they're already logged in and they don't
have to type their name and their
password every single time now if you're
saying okay well are we going to put it
in the first column or the second column
oh another neither of them look really
big enough to have a checkbox and keep
me logged in so I'm going to show you
guys what if you want to add a widget
that takes up two columns well what you
can actually do is you can pretty much
do that I'll show you right now
so of course whenever you want to add a
keep me logged in checkbox you need a
checkbox first so I'm going to show you
guys how to create a checkbox right now
now make a variable I'm going to name
mine see just because why not in set it
equal to this check button that's going
to give you that oh wow
I cannot thought come on Balki that
square little box that you can either
check or uncheck now eventually whenever
we actually program this it's going to
be equal to the value true or false
depending if it's checked or unchecked
but for right now I'm just going to show
you guys how to place on your screen so
this creates that box where do you want
to place it somewhere in the main window
and what text do you want to appear to
the right of that check box well the
text we just want to say keep me logged
in or signed in however you want to
phrase it so now we created it the only
thing we need to do now is place it
somewhere on our grid so see whenever we
want to place up we don't use pack
anymore we use grid now remember since
we want this to take up two columns we
need a new parameter called column span
and set this equal to two so it's not
just going to be in one little um field
it's actually going to pretty much take
two columns or two cells think of them
like that merge them together and be
displayed right in there so name is in
one cell password is in one cell this
and this each take up one cell but what
this widget does this keep me logged in
which it is it takes in one row it
merges two cells from two different
columns and it places it in the center
of those so check it out we now have a
name password two inputs and I'll keep
me logged in widget how frickin easy is
that and it's all really simple to
understand say what row do you want to
make it appear in what column boom
we can now make pretty sweet fricken
gooeys so again one more time I'm going
to be putting all of this code on my
forum so if you don't quite understand
anything or if you just want to go grab
it copy it and paste it play around with
it go grab it there but for now thank
you guys for watching don't forget
subscribe and I'll see you guys in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
