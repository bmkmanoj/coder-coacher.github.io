and twenty first Android tutorial for
the new Boston and I've decided to do a
few more tutorials on the SQLite
database because I've gotten so many
requests on my channel so I thought I
should at least elaborate a little bit
more within this series and what we're
gonna do is we're gonna allow the user
to throw in and edit or throw in a
number which is going to be a row ID
then we can get some information and
just gonna fill in these edit text up
here with the information that returns
we're gonna also also going to be
allowed to edit that row information and
change your entries into the database
and also we can delete that whole row if
we want so let's get into it again you
guys just need to set up an edit text
what I did is go into the text fields
and throw this one that says number over
there that way when they select this
edit text the number keypad will come up
for them instead of you know the the
alphabetical keyboard and then we're
gonna do is you know you guys can set up
your references for the most part
whatever you guys you know by this point
you should know how to set up your own
references and it won't really matter as
long as you have the reference bridges
over in and Java set up properly so what
I did is I set up both those buttons
those three buttons and our new edit
text so our whole class can use them and
then I created basically that my
variable names was SQL row which is our
edit text which is going to give us the
the row number SQL modify which is our
button where that's gonna you know
modify that entry SQL get information
again that's going to just return the
information from our row that we insert
SQL delete that's what I named for my
delete button and then I just said all
on click listeners and set up you know
three new cases within our switch in
case for our onclicklistener
so let's get into it the first thing
that we need to do is we're gonna kind
of program or get in for me
so we got to kind of think about what we
want again our application to do the
first thing that we want to do is we
want to refer to our SQL row edit text
that's the new one that we set up and
we're just gonna say get text dot to
string and we're gonna set up a string
variable to equal that so we're just
gonna call this our string or s
something like that and now we have a
string that's going to return whatever
is in our edit text now what we want to
do is we want to convert that string
into like an int or you know a long
let's say let's do a long and we'll call
this long L so what we're gonna do now
is convert our string into a long it's
like variable and we do that by parsing
and so we're gonna do is we're gonna
refer to the long class dot parse long
and as you can see it takes a string
within spur a meters and we're gonna
give that string reference to the s so
again this L variable is just basically
converting whatever was in our edit text
into a long type variable now what we
want to do is again we're just gonna set
up a hot or not variable hot or not
gonna set this equal to again just a new
hot or not instance where we pass in the
context of this class and then what
we're gonna do is we're gonna open our
hot or not so we can write to it and
then we're gonna say like we're going to
get some information back a name and
that hotness of the row so what we want
to do is we want to say something like
string returned oops
turned name equals and then we can say
our h o n or hot or not object dot get
name and we're gonna create this this
method and we're going to pass in our
long so again we're going to create this
method called get name or it takes along
within its parameters so again our long
is going to be which row the person
typed into the edit text then that it's
going to send that off to this method
called get name that we're going to set
up so that's what that's going to do and
then we're also going to set up another
string for our returned hotness pretty
much the same concept there so get
hotness we can call it and again we want
to pass in which row we're looking at so
there we go now we're just going to
close our hot or not you know type
variable and then now we have our
returned name and our returned hotness
so what we're going to do is just set
our edit text up to equal that return
this name and that returned hotness so
again our edit text we're called SQL
name dot set text and we're going to set
it to our returned name and then we're
gonna set our hotness edit text to our
returned hotness so there we go we
pretty much have everything set up and
now we just need to create these methods
which we'll do in the next tutorial but
just to get started we're gonna hover
over and say create method for both of
these so go back into this class and
we're going to create this method as
well so I'll see you guys in the next
tutorial or again we'll kind of talk
about returning some information so I'll
see you guys in have a good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
