slash on live gamer for the new Boston
and in this tutorial we're going to be
covering events now you've seen events
before such as the button click event
that we use in mostly that we've used in
most of the tutorials before this now
I'm going to break that down a little
bit and explain it to you and we're
going to take a look at some other
events that we can use now let's go
ahead and create a new project we will
select windows forms application and we
will set the name to events and just go
ahead and click OK now we'll wait for
that to load okay so now we're going to
go ahead and head over to our tool box
and we will select a button and place it
on our form now we'll go ahead and
resize the form some here and we'll make
the button a little bit bigger so we'll
just go ahead and leave the text value
the same because that's going to be
changing pretty soon and we'll change
the name to button events now if you go
ahead and double click button 1 you can
see here that it creates this sub and
it's called button events underscore
click and you can see it takes two
arguments we've got five Alcindor as
system not object and the sender is our
button the button is an object and II it
says by Val II as system event ours e is
the event args that is being sent so if
we go ahead and come over to our
solution explorer you can see a button
right here called show all files now if
we go ahead and click that you can see
that a lot more files show up under our
events solution so we can go ahead and
click this arrow under form one VB you
can see here that we have this one file
called form one designer dot DB now this
is where Visual Basic generates all your
code that creates your form
this right here so when you drag and
drop drop items onto your form
it creates them in this designer file
now you can see here that here is our
button and what this basically does is
it sets the location it sets the name of
it the size and everything that it needs
to know to add the button in the right
place and change and have the text value
and all that other stuff now if we keep
scrolling down you can see that here is
our event it's called friend with events
button events as system dot window soft
forms dot button so this is where the
event is and it's coming from button
events now whenever you add an event
it's going to go ahead and generate it
in this file so if we come over here to
the design we can go ahead and take a
look at our properties right here and if
we click the like click the lightning
bolt you can see that it opens up all
these events that we can use now let's
go ahead and look at mouse hover so
we'll go ahead and double-click Mouse
hover and you can see it creates another
sub for us inform 1vb now you can see
that the mouse hover has two arguments
right here which is the sender and it's
going to be the same as the button
events clicked because it's the same
button but our system event Rx is going
to be different so we can go ahead and
just take a look at what this will do so
if they mouse hover then we're going to
go ahead and type button events dot text
equals text changed so whenever they
hover the mouse over there is going to
say text changed now let's come up here
and we'll add something under button
events click well type message box dot
show sender dot to string and we'll type
message box show e dot to string
so whenever we click on this is going to
show us what cinder is and what E is
so let's go ahead and run this program
and take a look at what happens so you
can see we have button 1 and you can see
if I hover the mouse over it says text
changed and it won't change back because
we would have to create another event
for the mouse leaving this button now if
we go ahead and click on text change you
can see we get the message box for the
sender and our sender is system dot
window stop form stop button which is
the button is a button object and the
text of it is text change we'll just go
ahead and click OK and you can see that
E our event args is system dot windows
forms dot mouse event args so now what
we can do is show you the e for Mouse
hover so we'll type message box I show e
dot to string so let's go ahead and run
this and you can see when we hover the
mouse over it shows us system dot event
args so go ahead and add some objects to
your form in the designer and go ahead
and click the lightning bolt and take a
look at some of the events that you can
make play around with those and once you
get familiar with some of the most
common events then go ahead and move on
to the next tutorial and you can see
we've got the form 1 designer here I
would suggest that you don't modify this
because it could screw up your program
sorry about that I got interrupted there
so on what I was saying is don't modify
this form one designer dB you can look
at it to kind of see how the program
works and learn from it but don't modify
it if you don't know what you're doing
so thanks for watching guys and stay
tuned for the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
