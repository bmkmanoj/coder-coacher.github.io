video what I want to do is I want to
show you guys how to properly use
multiple child elements so right now up
to this point we've been developing this
program where we can kind of edit
comments and we're going to be able to
remove comments and we can kind of keep
going with a you know techniques that
we've been using but I'm going to tell
you guys right now in a few tutorials
we're gonna run into a problem and
that's this what happens whenever we
want to do stuff like rearrange these
notes put them in a different order what
happens when we want to just have more
control over them well this is the thing
right now we have a bunch of independent
comments this is a comment this is a
comment and this is comment now even
though we can set properties and states
on them we learned all about that they
still are independent in other words
they don't know about each other so this
comment hi my name is Bucky it doesn't
even know that this comment exists
there's no way that they're connected so
whenever we try to do stuff like
rearrange these since they don't have an
idea of each other's existence it's
going to be really difficult for them to
change order they only exist in their
own universe so in order to have more
control over them as a whole instead of
just individual comments we need to
pretty much surround it in a parent
container or just think of it like a
manager where you can kind of manage all
the pieces so what I'm going to do is
I'm actually going to set up a board
component and you can think of the board
component as this blue surrounding
container right here now this board
component is going to be made up of all
of these comments and since we set it up
that way it's going to be aware of every
single one and they can move them around
change your order delete them remove
them and it's a much better system than
just having a bunch of standalone
objects so let's go ahead and do that in
order to make another component let me
just minimize that so it's a little bit
easier to see so here's my comments
right here you can make as many comments
as you want and I'm only going to make
one called board so I'm going to have
one board and we can
like you know a dozen comments in there
three however many we want so in order
to make a new board just call rec great
class stick this is object now this is
another thing that I'm going to do I'm
actually going to have an array in here
and this array is essentially going to
be equal to each comment so again in
this board we're pretty much going to be
able to reference each individual
comment and manage them all in that kind
of way so let me just write get initial
state make sure I write that correctly
and this is going to be a function and
again all this is going to do is it's
going to return an array of comments so
again you can have as many states as you
want but I'm only going to be you know
making a really simple example so there
I go and let me just add three different
comments so I'll say I like bacon um
want to want to get ice cream why do I
always think about food think
something's wrong with me and I'll say
up okay
you have enough comments now all right
so our initial state is essentially just
an array with three strings of text so
remember whenever we actually make a
comment component all we do is we just
use comment and then we put a string of
text right here so it's going to be
really easy so now let's go ahead and
actually make those now whenever we make
it remember we have to use the render
function so the render function and
again if you have multiple functions you
need to separate them with the comma
this is going to be responsible for
returning whatever HTML that we want to
draw so the first thing I'm going to do
is since this is on multiple lines
surrounded with parentheses is I'm going
to make a div that's going to represent
this entire board and actually what I
can do is actually just take this and
copy it right here so this is the HTML
that it's going to
turn and now whenever I render I just
have to write board like that and it
returns this so the class name is board
and instead of just having these
comments I actually want to make
comments based on this array so I pretty
much have to take this array loop
through it and for each item in it I
want to stick it inside a comment right
like here so I'll delete this I'll do
the long way art so what I'm going to do
is in order to do that in JavaScript if
you aren't familiar with mapping we
first need a reference to this comments
right now remember it's a state it's not
a property and the reason it's a state
is because it's going to change so this
state and then you write the name of it
which is comments and then what we can
do with JavaScript is we can actually
call a function called a map now
whenever you use map what you can do is
you can throw in a function in here and
it will call it for each element in the
array so whatever function we write
right here um it's going to call it on
this one and then this one and then this
one now the arguments for this function
or parameters are item I so again like I
said this map function is going to take
this array and it's going to loop
through it and for each item it's going
to treat the text as item and actually I
can actually change that to text that
might be a little bit easier and for the
counter it's going to be equal to I so 0
then 1 then 2 then 3 then 4 tomato
tomato
so for each of these iterations what I
want to do is just create a new comment
so I just want to return and remember
forgot that capitalized comments comment
now whenever we make a comment all we do
is we add the text in between and now
we're good to go so this is going to
work just fine however here is the one
two that we have right now we're just
creating a bunch of comments but we
still don't have any really unique way
to identify each one the reason that we
set up this new kind of architecture is
because we wanted this board to kind of
be a manager for all of the comments so
in order to have control over these
comments we need to give them a unique
identifier now the main way that you
kind of do this is you actually use a
key so in a react a key is a way that
you can uniquely identify each child and
you can actually give it an ID or ID
number or whatever you want but this is
kind of the standard way and we'll take
a look at a couple tricky things later
but for right now there you go so again
we made a board and all this board did
it is it took an array and for each item
in the array it generated a comment so
now this board it actually owns all of
these comments pretty cool huh so now if
i refresh this we can see i like biking
want to get ice cream okay we have
comments now I like bacon wanna get ice
cream okay we have comments now so
essentially it's the exact same result
as before but now even though the user
doesn't really realize it we now have a
lot more control over the items or
comments in our program</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
