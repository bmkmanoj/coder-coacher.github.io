slash on live gamer for the new Boston
and in this tutorial we're gonna be
working more on our enemies library so a
couple of things I need to change before
we continue working is that this needs
to be a public sub so that we can access
it outside of the class
and we need to make attacks of type
string even though it will automatically
detect that I just want to put that in
there just so you know what it is and
what it'll hold so we may be adding to
this enemy class later on but for now
with let's just leave it the same way it
is so we'll come over here to enemy's
library and let's go ahead and add a
class well string this down a little bit
and you can see here that I have a
dragon a villain and a zombie so let's
go ahead and for class 1vb and if you
didn't see that I'm sorry I just did I
click show desktop and it may have taken
away the video but I've got three
pictures a zombie a villain and a dragon
so let's make a zombie class go ahead
and click Add and we will zoom in okay
so we want zombie to inherit from enemy
okay so it's going to get the health the
attacks the default attack and the
health property and it's going to get
the constructor so we'll come back over
here to zombie and let's go ahead and
add zombie attacks so we'll make an
array of this so private zombie attacks
as string what's that an equal to eat
brains
what else let's sing something left for
dead we could do claw
I guess if zombies have claws um what
else does think of one more thing
we'll just to throw up like a Boomer so
our zombies can eat brains claw and
throw up so let's go ahead and let's
just do zombies attack so public sub and
we have default attack we'll do
zombie attack and then we want to buy
wrath user health as integer so whenever
the zombie attacks let's go ahead and
generate a random number so we can come
back in here and let's just go ahead and
copy these even though copying and
pasting is not a good idea in coding so
so we'll copy this and then paste it
right here so let's go ahead and do it
between from index 0 - let's say index -
so it's going to be 0 1 or 2 so now I'll
do a select case so select case attack
num do case 0
let's do user health - equals let's do
15 so if they get their brains eaten
they're going to lose 15% of their
health case one user health minus equals
let's do five
and then in case to user health
- equals let's just do two for that okay
so now that we have the zombie attacks
let's go ahead and you can see that we
created these arrays of attacks now we
haven't used them so far we've just used
the indexes of them well later on we're
gonna send me we're gonna be sending
these attacks back to the caller so they
can add them to the program to the game
program and they can tell you what just
happened how you were attacked and stuff
like that so we created zombie attack so
now let's go ahead and create another
class so we will add a class let's make
a villain so go ahead and click add and
we want to we wanted to inherits enemy
and we'll just zoom in here so just like
you're not a zombie attacks let's go
ahead and create villain attacks so
private villain attacks as string let's
go ahead and think of something a
villain could do let's say shoot let's
see what else okay so our villain can
shoot stab or let's just use explode for
throwing a grenade so we'll just type
that instead so throw grenade okay so
now what we want to do is create a
villain attack function or a sub just go
ahead make it public sub villain attack
and we want to reference the user health
again so user health as integer and I'm
gonna go through this pretty quick
because we've already done this several
times so we'll create our our random
generator and our attack number so then
we'll just do a select case so select
case attack num case 0 so if index is 0
or if attack num is equal to 0 which
would be shoot we'll do user health
minus equals let's say I think it's shot
well do 10 case one user health minus
equals 8 case - user health
- equals 12 so whenever they're attacked
they are going to lose some health so
let's go ahead and get that out of the
way now I'll just go ahead and create
one more class here I'll just go through
it really fast because you guys already
know what to do
so we'll make it a dragon
we'll have it inherits enemy I'm going
to go ahead and pause right here and
come back once I'm done writing this
class okay so I made this dragon class
we've got the dragon attacks array blow
fire claw and tail smash and then we
reference the user health and then
create a random number and it will take
away their health based on what the
random number is now I just need to end
sub okay so look at this code go ahead
and put it in if you have it and we're
gonna move on to the next tutorial where
we'll be where we will be using our
class library in a program</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
