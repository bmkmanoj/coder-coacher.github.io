tutorial for the new Boston what we're
going to do in this tutorials basically
create that simple stopwatch application
now that's telling you guys about now
the first thing we need to do in order
to get the stopwatch application work is
we need to find some way to reference
the time and how we're going to do that
is we're going to get the time the
current time from the system which is
the Android so that's basically the core
concept of this lesson and what we need
to do is we need to set up a textview
above our on create method called
show results and we also need to create
two buttons called start and stop all
right no no no we need to call create
two Long's
which is start and stop so we can work
with you know a tenth of a second
milliseconds milliseconds yeah that's
what I was looking for not a millisecond
sorry even a tenth of a second but
that's what we're working with is
milliseconds so start stop and now we
just need to kind of set up again a
reference for show results which was our
text view of our first tab so we're
going to say show results equals
textview fine view by d r dot ID dot TV
show results or whatever you guys label
that as and now we also since we set up
our buttons in the last tutorial we need
to set up our own click listeners for
those buttons so we're just gonna say
button start dot set onclicklistener
to this and button stop dot set on click
listener
to this nothing new there as well so all
right now we're going to go down to our
switching case where we where the magic
happens so the first thing that we're
going to do is we're going to set up our
starting variable right when we hit our
start button we're going to get the
current time from the system so again we
created a long to handle that and we
call it start so we're going to say
start is equal to and then we're going
to say system 4 into the system class
and when we hit dot we can get current
time in milliseconds right here and so
that's what we're going to that's what
we're going to use pretty simple I mean
this right here is the core concept of
this lesson just get you know whether
you're working with velocities on touch
events you can you know start the time
right when they touch the screen and
release the time right when they release
the screen or get another time they
release other touch event and then you
can calculate some kind of velocity or
something like that if you want but
you're always going to have to refer to
some method of time and we're going to
do that by system current time and then
we're also going to do that within the
stop event so we're going to say our
stop variable is equal to again system
dot current time and there we go I mean
we have a starting time and ending time
all we have to do is change that
textview so we're going to say was our
text you called show result well
actually we're going to say because if
it's all about problem solving sorry I'm
kind of talking all over the place here
but let's say if they hit the stop
button and they never hit the start
button then we're going to get some kind
of error if we try to you know set the
text because we don't have a start
reference so it's going to give us a
problem so one way we can handle that
again is just a simple if else or if
statement so we're going to say if start
is not equal zero I don't know and then
we're going to print our textview so
what we're going to do is basically
within here we're going to get our
starting time
- our stop time so we're going to say
set up a new type of variable along
result and this is going to be equal to
our stop time - our starting time so
basically it's going to be how long it
took the person to go from start to stop
and then we're going to say our text
view which we call show result and we're
going to say dot we're show results was
it dot set text and now we just have to
convert this long into a string so we
just refer to the long class capital l
ong dot and then we say to string and
that's going to convert a long variable
into a string so our variable we want to
convert convert is result and basically
let's check it out make sure it works
and we're done I mean basically all we
did is we got the current time at the
starting of current time at the stop and
then we found the result if the starting
time was not equal to zero
oh so kind of forgot the key step here
with this is we need to set our starting
equal to zero to begin with so we're
just going to say start equals zero
within our on create method so that way
it will kind of problem-solve for us
and then let's run the application make
sure it works so again this is a
millisecond so when we hit let's say
stop right now
our starting variable still at zero so
it's not going to explain anything but
we have if we start wait a little bit
hit stop is two hundred forty seven one
milliseconds which is about two seconds
two point four seconds in the next
tutorial I'm going to teach you guys how
to format I mean it's kind of a general
Java type type tutorial for the next one
so if you guys want to skip that that's
fine but I'm just going to teach you how
to format this result and we still get a
problem because the last time we hit or
start it's still running so it's still
going to calculate every time we hit
this stop button from that initial start
so I mean we aren't going to worry about
that I don't wanna get too much into a
stopwatch application but as you can see
right now we could use a stopwatch for
like laps like oh that's lap one fifty
one seconds
that's lap two fifty four seconds
whatever I need to either go to bed or
create that job at tutorial see you guys
then have a good one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
