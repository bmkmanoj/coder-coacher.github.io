eighth Android tutorial for the new boss
in what we're gonna get into if you
can't see my test package here is OpenGL
and basically OpenGL is gonna allow us
to program 3d 3d objects within a view
you see any like 3d games that's what
they're probably using is OpenGL and as
well as like it's beneficial for just
processing information and pretty much
any kind of game development so it's
pretty useful what we're gonna do is
just basically develop a 3d square and
have it rotate nothing too awesome but
at least you guys will get the basic
concepts and what we're gonna do is
we're gonna set up three classes so just
get those set up first class we're going
to call GL Capital G capital L example
and that's going to be our main activity
class and then we're also gonna create a
new class called GL render or renderer
he X for example and also what kind of
object that we want to create so we're
gonna create another class called GL so
they're all kind of close together when
you guys are looking at these GL cube
maybe since we're gonna create a 3d cube
and just hit finish and there we go and
let's get our first or example class all
set up again this is just going to say
extends activity and we got to add our
imports right click add a again a on
create method so nothing new there and
basically we're working with G open GL
yes for mobile development you want to
use like a surface if you guys remember
back when we were doing a little bit
graphics earlier we use a surface view
and it's kind of the same concept except
we're going to use a GL surface view so
we're just gonna create a GL Capital G
capital L surface view
and we're gonna call this our surface
and there we go at our imports and as
you guys will notice pretty much all the
OpenGL objects start with this capital G
capital L so when you guys see that most
likely you're working with a OpenGL
object just to keep that in mind and
what we're gonna do is we're also going
to add to and I should have done this
when we added our oncreate method but
we're also going to add a resume method
and a pause method
so I'll just again go to source override
implement methods and onpause
and also a on resume so there we go
we're gonna add those two methods and
basically we work with opengl we're
gonna create a surface view of some sort
that's gonna be a GL surface view and
we're gonna basically set that to be a
we're gonna set a renderer to that
surface for YouTube render the way that
we wanted to set up the camera set up
all the stuff that we would like and
then we're just basically going to pause
that surface view and we're also going
to you know resume it as well so just to
get that set up we have our our surface
instance and we're just gonna call this
and we're going to set this equal just
to a new GL surface view so pretty
pretty default there and that's supposed
to be equals and that's supposed to be
capital L as well so and we have to pass
in a context so we're just gonna relate
to the context of this class and there
we go we have our surface view setup and
now what we're gonna do is basically
we're gonna have one more line of code
but we'll get into that in the next
tutorial well then we're just going to
set our content view to our GL surface
view so it was called our surface within
the on create method and then all we're
gonna do is pause the surface and
restart it within our pause and resume
method because again we don't want to
use more you know we don't want to use
up memory that we
don't even need so we're just gonna say
surface view our surface dot on pause
I'm not just gonna pause their surface
for you pretty simple and we're also
just gonna say our surface dot on resume
so basically that's just going to pause
their surface and resume it pretty
pretty standard so that's the basic
setup of this activity again we're gonna
add a renderer to our surface view to
handle some methods for us but that's
gonna go there but besides that we're
pretty much done with this activity
again you guys can keep this something
for the future tutorials when we add
that renderer in and these are the three
classes that we're going to work with so
I'll catch you guys in the next tutorial
hope you have a good one and see you
later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
