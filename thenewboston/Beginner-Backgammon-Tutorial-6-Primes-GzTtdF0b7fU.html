about primes now the definition of a
prime is only two or more points next to
each other for example this would be a
prime right here and what I did is I set
up this is called a perfect prime when
you own a prime on six consecutive
points now as you can see this gives
your opponent lots of trouble when
trying to escape because there's nothing
your opponent can roll to get these
chips out of here one two three four
five six you have it all blocked off so
this is a situation that you typically
want to put your opponent in and it's
good when you first start out making a
lot of points in your home board it gets
harder and harder for your opponent to
escape so if you can ever set up this
position this would be ideal now check
this out
why is this so useful first of all these
checkers are locked into place until you
remove one of these points so what you
can essentially do is keep rolling and
moving your checkers around the board
around the board and eventually you're
probably going to have to remove one of
these points which will probably be your
seven point right here and even when you
remove this and move them up it's still
going to be difficult for your opponents
less to checkers the lamina of the seven
because unless they roll double sixes
and can move them both out at once even
if they roll one six and get it out they
still leave a blah open to be hit so
that's why it's so dangerous for your
opponent and so awesome for you to set
up these perfect Prime's especially if
during their home board so that is the
basics of prime and why it's so useful
another thing you want to look out for
in Prime's whenever you see your
opponent is building a perfect prime on
their homework remember if one of your
checkers gets hit then this is where
they're going to have to come out at so
typically what you want to do when you
see your opponent setting that up is you
want to try to own one of their points
in their home board that way when you
got a checker that's hit it gives you a
chance to come out in this case on five
again if you have a checker that was hit
and they own a perfect prime just like
that there's no way that you could come
out
check that out one through six is all
blog so that's why owning the point in
your opponent's home board is such a
useful technique for blocking off
against their perfect crimes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
