second video and in this video no fur
how to create the account section now
remember whenever I design these little
sections I made basically a template for
you where you guys can either have one
column layout as you guys can see just
the one column right here two columns or
a three column layout one two three now
let's go ahead and start with the most
simple a one column layout so of course
the first thing we need to do is we need
to create the button and of course every
button is a list item so whenever we
create a list item this is going to
create the button now right now we have
a button but we don't have any text on
the button so let's go ahead and create
that now in order to add text on button
what we need to do is we actually need
actually I can steal this to add a link
in between the list item now whenever we
add text in that link for example
account the text is gonna appear on the
button so you see that word account
right there that is how you create this
and actually whenever you click the word
account it can take you to another page
on my website I just have a link to
account PHP because that's like your
main control panel but I'll just go
ahead and put a hashtag there and you
guys obviously on your website if you
don't have a user account change that to
whatever like about you know frequently
asked questions whatever anyways that's
how you create a basic button so now
what we need to do is we need to create
the functionality that when you hover
over it this pretty much one column
layout pops up the drop up menu so how
do we do that
well remember that I said that each
column every time you make a column it
needs to go inside a layout so you make
your layouts first and actually let me
give me a little more space to work with
alright so in between your list item
outside your link your a tag I don't
even know what a stands for it to be
honest a hyperlink a link I don't know
maker I think that's an anchor just came
to me by anyways what you need to do is
you need to build your layout first now
your layout comes in the form of a div
so div actually we want to end this and
annoys me if I don't end them right away
class equals all right now we have three
layouts to choose from a one column
layout a two or three column layout this
one is only gonna hold one column and
then it's basically asking in your
layout how wide do you want to drop up
to be well we only want this to fit a
one column layout so now what we're
gonna have if we just ran it right now
is pretty much a layout with no text in
it whatsoever that's pretty much this
wide right here
it fits one column so in since we have a
layout that fits one column let's go
ahead and stick one column in it so div
and this is gonna be the column itself
so class equals column one so we pretty
much made a layout that was big enough
to hold one column and now we're
sticking one column in it simple enough
that's all you do so from here the only
thing we need to do is we need to add
all of this text stream messages
pictures so on and so forth I'm actually
gonna add two sections stream and
messages and then you guys you know you
don't have to see me type pictures
informations friends because it's all
the same you guys can figure it out now
whenever you just want to add a
stand-alone link like stream you see
stream does it have any sub menu items
it's just alone it's just like a header
so this is how you do that a and of
course I got it
now the class for this equals header
links now the text of course is just
stream so that's it that's all you need
to do now the next thing we need to
create is messages and the cool thing
about this is you don't need to add a
break or a margin bottom or a margin top
we already set this up so you can just
go ahead and copy this and paste it and
put messages and whenever you run this
in your browser you are automatically
going to have space between this section
and this section pretty freakin cool so
that's how we set it up pretty much
perfectly so now what I want to do is I
want to start adding these links so what
links are their inbox sent trash and
compose now obviously if you guys you
know can't see these links are styled a
little bit differently than these main
header links and a actually what I want
to do just copy this now the class of
these is actually list links so the
first one is inbox and we'll just
pretend that you have like five new
messages but of course usually what
you'd want to do is you would want to
determine or count the number of
messages using PHP you link it to your
database but for now we'll just pretend
you know that we have five new messages
so inbox sent trash compose sent
trash compose Wow take a spelling class
Bucky all right so if we ran this now
then all of the links would basically
look like this gray plain white when you
hover over them but if you notice let me
scroll down a little bit if you notice
this inbox link is bold and it it pretty
much stands out its bold and it's white
so how do we make this bold and white
well the only thing that we need to do
is we need to go to the inbox and
whenever you have a new notification
just add this and you want to add it
programmatically in PHP but I'm going to
show you guys the code anyways just
change the style of this equal to
font-weight:bold and also I don't know
if you guys can see this color white so
that's what you need to do so basically
throw in a little bit of PHP code that
checks if you have any new messages and
if it does throw in this bit of code
right here style equals font-weight:bold
and the color equals white and that's
going to turn your notification link on
pretty much make it stand out in box 7
requested 13 so on and so forth so
that's all we have to do for the account
section so now this is 100% complete so
now that you know how to add a 1 column
layout and stick one column in it and
then just add your information the next
thing we know how to have to learn how
to do is do it with a three column
layout now this is actually a lot
different because it's set up quite
differently and we're also going to be
working with pictures and this is
actually one column you know well I
guess this is actually a pretty cool
example because there are a couple
different things you can have within the
three column layout either three
individual columns one column wide
paired with two columns for a total of
three and this right here even though
you guys can't see it because there's
not enough text this actually spans all
three columns it's three columns wide so
in the next video I'm going to show you
guys
to do that so thanks for watching and
I'll see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
