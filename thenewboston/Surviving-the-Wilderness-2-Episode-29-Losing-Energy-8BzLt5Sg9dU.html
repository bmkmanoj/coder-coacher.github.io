the only thing that was following my
hook and the Frog guts were little
minnows and they're obviously way too
small to bite onto my big wooden poke so
now I'm just going to cook up those frog
legs make a little stick that I can put
them on
instead of cooking the whole frog I'm
only gonna cook the legs this time the
rest of the frog is basically useless
there's no meat on it it's just all guts
it'll be a lot easier to cook this way
definitely got lucky with this one upper
right in front of me it's good time to
because I am frickin starving
see how those ones are
smell good
so good
not just for out here these are freaking
delicious
someone is like 10 times better than the
one I had yesterday it's even better
known that these frogs are the only
thing keeping me alive too
so good
this one actually has a lot of meat on
it it's almost as much meat is that big
one yesterday I make sure to get it off
I needed that I really needed that I got
to boil some water alright guys it's the
end of day 8 I don't know if you guys
can tell or hear but it's raining right
now and that's what I'm doing
I have to gather wood again because all
the wood that I gathered is now wet and
I have to start a fire again using
anything that I could find even today
which was would I consider a good day I
ate I drank even a good day out here is
a terrible day just awful experience
altogether when I first started doing
this I honestly thought that the longest
it would take was 3 or 4 days and it
would be fun it would be like camping or
hiking but the bugs are crazy and every
day I have less and less energy I'm
dehydrated I have no idea where I am and
I know that the worst part is it is that
I have to keep moving because that are
on that Park is 6.1 million acres and
even if people were to come to look for
me there's no way that they would ever
have a chance of finding me so even if I
found a spot that I wanted to stay I
can't I'm beginning to think right now
that for the first time that there's a
chance that I don't even know if I'm
gonna be able to make it out of here
like I said this is probably gonna be
the last video of the night it's getting
dark and in the woods it gets dark a lot
faster than when you're out in the open
so that's probably yeah I want it I
don't like filming at night anyways
because I'm afraid I'm gonna lose
something and the bugs are getting crazy
and I don't want to get my camera girl
wet but I'll give you guys an update
tomorrow morning and let you know what's
going on</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
