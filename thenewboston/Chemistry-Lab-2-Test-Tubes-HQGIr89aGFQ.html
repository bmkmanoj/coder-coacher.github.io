welcome to your second chemistry lab
tutorial now in this video I want to
talk to you guys about test tubes now
test tubes can actually be used for many
different purposes now some of the most
common ways that people use test tubes
are first to mix solutions they add
their solution right in the test tube
and swirl it around getting it nice and
mixed together another thing is that
people often heat samples right in your
test tube go ahead and put it right over
a flame heat it up and it speeds up the
chemical reaction and another thing is
if you just have a regular old chemical
reaction with no flame or anything you
can observe the chemical reaction right
in your test tube now if you know that
you're going to be storing samples in
the test tube what I recommend doing is
getting a rubber stopper for your test
tubes because this is basically like a
cork just a solid piece of rubber but
it's made specifically for test tubes
and whenever you store samples in here
it just keeps them nice and you know
keeps them from falling out and another
thing that I would recommend getting is
a stopper let me see if I can get a
camera angle a rubber stopper with a
hole in it and actually you want to grab
a couple of these and the reason that
you would do this is because not for
store examples but sometimes we're going
to be heating up chemicals and we're
going to want to capture the gases or
the fumes from the chemical reaction so
you actually use your rubber stopper
with a hole and put a piece of glass or
plastic tubing in there and that is how
you capture the gases from a chemical
reaction so again remember that whenever
you buy test tubes make sure to get
solid rubber stoppers or corks and also
rubber stoppers with a hole in them for
whenever we want to catch our fumes now
it's best to have a wide variety of test
tubes and different sizes and you also
want to have a mixture of plastic and
glass test tubes if you can only choose
one I would probably recommend glass now
some of the more common size test tubes
this one right here these are my
favorite these are actually 16 by 150
millimeter and what this means it's
pretty much the width of the test tube
and also the height so those are the
ones that I use most often the standard
size if you probably were to buy only
one size and set
you probably want to stick with 18 by
150 because like I said that's the most
standard size test-tube I just like 16
by 150 that's my favorite and another
thing that you definitely want to do is
you want to get some kind of test tube
rack this is probably my favorite one
this is an old wood one that I got from
actually someone that used to be my
science teacher and this is another act
but you want a rack because it's a lot
easier to store your test tubes and also
whenever you're just observing some core
reactions you can line them up nice and
neat and it's a lot easier to observe if
you have a rack like this so again a
bunch of different sizes a mixture of
glass and plastic but if you can only
get one size stick with 16 by 150 or 18
by 150</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
