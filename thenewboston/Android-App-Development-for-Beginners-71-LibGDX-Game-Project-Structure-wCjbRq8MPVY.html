any code what I want to do is I kind of
want to take a step back and explain
exactly how this game project is set up
because it's going to save you guys a
lot of confusion and a lot of headaches
in the future so first of all remember
one of the cool things about this
framework is you can develop games for
other platforms in other words we can
write code one time and we can
eventually deploy it on other platforms
like iOS on the web Android of course
now that's why you see this Android
directory in a chord rectory now
remember whenever we are setting up our
project I unchecked iOS and desktop or
web or whatever all those other ones
were because I'm just focused on making
an android games for this tutorial
series however if I left those checked
then you would see other directories
under Android Android iOS desktop a
bunch of other ones so what's the deal
with this do we have to you know tweak a
bunch of code and all of those well no
the code that we're actually going to be
writing is in this core so for the first
couple of examples if we hop over to my
GD X game and open this as you can see
this is the code that ran that little
demo this you know this is like a real
quick explanation but this created the
arm that little image and right here
you're setting the background red so
this is where we're going to be writing
all of our code so now you're saying all
right well why would they even put this
Android folder in here though what do we
do that whenever you write a game that's
going to run on multiple platforms
there's going to be some code that you
write that is specific to Android or may
be specific to iOS any code that is
specific to that platform you're going
to write in that platforms directory
however we aren't going to really be
worrying about that since we're going to
keep things really simple so again 99%
of the time not only in this tutorial
but even if you decide to develop for
other platforms you're going to work in
the core directory so that is you know a
quick little explanation so now
what I want to do is actually explain
what's in this file so in this file
again we have a bunch of crap that's
created by default the image and the
background and stuff however to make
things really simple and just for this
first demo here's what I want to do I'll
go ahead and delete all of these
variables all those objects and also
delete everything inside your methods so
right now what you're looking at is a
blank project this is a lot easier to
explain right if I'm just you know
starting out teaching this stuff so the
first thing of course we have a bunch of
imports all right well we're going to be
learning about all those later whenever
we start typing any code now the class
there's the name extends application
adapter so right off the bat we're
seeing that we inherit from this class
called application adapter probably
should know a little bit about that well
what this class is is it includes a bump
a bunch of methods that get called
automatically at different points in
your game
so we already can see that we have this
method called create and render and
there are some other ones too but I'll
talk to you guys about the other methods
when we need them let's go ahead and
figure out what these methods do right
now well this is a method that gets
automatically called whenever our app is
first created so the user just opens
your app it runs this class creates it
so any code you put in here um is going
to be called so this is really good for
just initializing you know your variable
setting up all your resources we're
pretty much going to be setting
everything up in create alright that was
easy enough to understand what about
this render render is going to be
continuously called whenever our game is
running so you can think that is the
main game loop this method is going to
be called depending on your device some
are like 30 to 80 times every single
second so again this is a method that
gets called repeatedly so any
functionality to kind of render objects
on the screen or drum or anything
like that we're going to stick in here
so again set everything up run the game
and again we don't need to actually go
in another file and call these because
they get called out automatically cool
thing about this framework so let's go
ahead and just figure out how to print
some really simple text on the screen
right now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
