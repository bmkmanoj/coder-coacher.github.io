Blackford here with another Photoshop
cs6 tutorial and today we're gonna learn
how to apply your adjustment and layers
to to only part of an image so sometimes
you don't want your adjustment layer to
affect everything in the image say maybe
I don't want the the sky to be adjusted
with the brightness adjustment layer or
anything like that so I'm gonna show you
one way that we can pretty much opt out
the sky by painting it out in its a mask
so what you need to do first is just
bring up an image and then add some
adjustment in the layers and then adjust
them so you can see some kind of change
so what I did is I have a brightness and
contrast layer on right now and I just
upped the contrast up to 52 so you can
do that if you want or you don't have to
so go ahead and go into your layers
panel over here and select the mask part
and the mask part of the the layers
panel is this white box right here and
this is actually a mask and what you
want to do next is make sure you have
this properties panel open so if you
don't have it open just go to windows
and then click on properties you want to
make sure that your density is at a
hundred percent and your feather is at
zero percent now feel free to adjust
those if you really need to but for this
tutorial this is how we're gonna keep
these so we can get a nice crisp line so
go ahead and select a regular paintbrush
and then go ahead and pick one of your
regular brush tips there and you want to
have it on normal you want to have the
opacity at 100%
if you have the opacity down it's not
going to have the full effect on there
so make sure you have your layer
selected here and I want to show you
real quick what it looks like with the
adjustment layer
and with the adjustment layer off so
this is on right now and if I click on
the eye to hide it this is off you can
see it's a lot brighter now let's go
ahead and start painting this sky as you
can see now it is painting out these of
the sky and one thing I forgot to
mention real quick is that you want to
make sure that your for your paintbrush
the foreground color is black and
anything that's black in your mask that
gets painted it's going to be taken out
of the adjustment layer so let's go
ahead and paint and and you get the idea
I'm not going to go super in-depth with
this but if you wanted to you could
basically get a zoom in and get your
brush into all these little crevices and
everything like that so that's how you
paint that stuff out no say you messed
up and oh crap I just accidentally went
way down there into this guy's hat just
switch up make your foreground color
white now and then you can paint there
right back in so if you happen to know
what an alpha mask is this is kind of
like that in that black is going to take
away the adjustment layer it's going to
take away the property that you put on
it and wait anything that's white in the
mask is going to bring it back in so if
I start painting this back on with the
white the adjustment layer is going to
be filled back in there so let me change
this back and I'll just change back to
black and just paint this out real quick
and I just wanted to show you that in
the layers panel if we come over here
you can see now that part of the
thumbnail image here is black and you
can also see on the layer mask here so
that really helps you out now the the
intensity of the black or the intensity
of the white is also going to have an
effect so let's go ahead and switch this
to 50% gray or somewhere around there so
I have switched that to that
if I go ahead and paint it's only gonna
apply the adjustment layer at 50% now if
you change the gray til something like a
35% here so if I come up here and go a
35% gray something like that it's going
to change as well so more when it's a
lighter gray it's going to show more of
the adjustment and layers property if
it's a darker gray it's gonna show less
of the adjustment in layers property so
as you can see there now hopefully you
guys can all see the change on the
screen of the different color of the sky
is that painting it over now that's all
you need to really know about being able
to paint in your masks and everything
now if you look on your mask always
check that out to see as you can see
here on the mask if you look close in
there there is a black dot and I would
want to get that out by painting it over
and now you can see that the black dot
has is gone now so just keep an eye on
your things when you're painting and
just be mindful of what you do and
obviously so that's it for the tutorial
and we're gonna I'm going to show you
another way to do this in another
tutorial that you might find easier
depending on the type of image that
you're working on so I look forward to
seeing guys in that one have a good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
