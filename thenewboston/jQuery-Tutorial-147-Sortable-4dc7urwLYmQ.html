with a video tutorial for the new boston
in this tutorial we're going to be
looking at the sortable interaction in
jQuery so we're going to be creating a
list much like we did when we looked at
the droppable tutorial or the droppable
interaction in jQuery and we're going to
allow this list to be sorted so we've
included the jQuery UI a UI library as
well as the original jQuery library and
they also have a stylesheet here because
I'm going to be styling my list that I'm
going to be creating in just a moment
now inside you ijs is where our jQuery
code is going to go to actually make
this particular list suitable so the
first thing we want to do is create an
unordered list so I'm going to create
some ul tags and inside here give this a
few options so we're going to have for
example three elements of this here and
I'm just going to type in a few names
okay so now I need to give this UL a
particular ID and this is going to be
names now the reason I'm giving this a
particular ID such as this and not list
because we're going to be creating
another list in a moment and allowing
each list to interact with each other so
being able to drag items from one list
into another list so let's go ahead and
preview this in our browser you can see
whether we've got some indentation here
with the bullet points I'm actually
going to remove these so I'm going to go
over to style dot CSS and I'm just going
to style ul I'm going to set the padding
to zero pixels I'm going to set the list
style to none and I'm also going to go
ahead and set the width of this just up
here to 200 pixels because currently a
list takes up the whole document so now
it looks a bit like this and we want to
go ahead and make it draggable straight
away so I'll sort of all rather so each
element will become draggable and the
list will automatically be sortable so
fundamentally we would go into our
external javascript file which is you
ijs and we need to use a selector to
select this list which i've called names
we then want to do a dot as we usually
would and we need to make this sortable
now this alone will make this list
suitable however we're going to specify
some options in a moment which allow us
to create some better interaction and
also connect it with our other list and
we're also going to be looking at one
event as well there are quite a few
events for sortable but we're going to
take a look at the update event a bit
later so now we have the list it looks
as normal however we can actually now
sort the elements inside the list so
just by appending on this sortable
interaction we're now able to actually
sort the list so let's go ahead and
create some curly brackets and start to
look at some of the options available in
the source will interact interaction now
containment is probably one of the most
important
if for example you had one list and you
wanted the containment to be just within
that particular list at the moment you
can see I can drag elements across the
rest of the page and we have no
containment in place or the default
containment in place so this is not
really a problem but you often don't
want elements to be dragged away from
this list we want them to be just be
dragged up and down so I'm going to go
ahead and specify the containment option
and I'm going to make this equal to
parent and what this will do is it will
only allow items to be sorted within
this parent which is ul so let's go
ahead and test this you can see that I
can't actually drag them away and they
are all a lot they're all aligned along
the y axis so now that they're sorted
you can see that we've got this problem
here of when I pull this up it overlaps
this and doesn't automatically sort the
Billy Billy name below Ashley it can be
a bit funny and you know not work very
well in this case so we have another
option which makes selection or sort
ability a lot more natural and this is
the tolerance so we specify the option
tolerance and the most natural is
pointer and what this will do is it will
sort as soon as the pointer reaches the
other element so now you can see that as
soon as this just about overlaps here so
as soon as my pointer reaches the other
element it will automatically go ahead
and sort it so it feels a lot more
natural and if you try if you're trying
this out for yourself you'll probably
agree okay so let's go ahead and look at
some other options some more aesthetic
options the first one being cursor and
this is just the cursor that's displayed
when we're actually dragging a
particular element now at the moment is
just set to the default selection icon
or cursor I'm going to go ahead and set
this to pointer there are obviously a
few other options but I prefer pointer
because it gives us gives us this nice
hand icon which sort of simulates
actually moving something around
so now that we've created it up to make
it a look a bit better and we've added
this pointer in we may want the list
elements to revert once we've actually
dropped them you can see at the moment
if I don't quite drop this it snaps back
to its original position if we were to
change at the revert option to true this
will actually allow it to sort of slide
back to its original position you can
see there now this works as well if you
were to have the containment set to say
document and if we were allowed to move
these elements across the page for
example over here you'll see it will
revert back to its position so it won't
revert back to its original position but
it will revert back to the position
associated with the drag and the the
sort so for example if I move Billy over
here and then pulled it down slightly
you can see that there's a gap there and
that would fit nicely in the gap and
revert back to that position so revert
works in that way in the sense that will
revert it back to either its original
position if it hasn't been moved or the
position that's been moved to if it's
not within that particular element or
within the particular container okay so
now we want to go ahead and look at the
opacity option let me just pull these
down so we can view them a bit better
okay so the opacity option just
specifies an opacity if you've seen the
tutorial on dragging you'll know that we
can also specify an opacity with
dragging and I'm going to set this to
naught point six zero and that's at
sixty percent opacity so when I move it
you can see it's changed now to a sixty
percent opacity</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
