something anyways what's up guys is
Bucky and uh welcome to just a random
update video it's not even really a
update video it's just a random video I
know I haven't made a video and put on
my channel in a while so I was like well
I'm not doing anything tonight might as
well make a video so I want to tell you
guys about a couple random things not a
lot to do in my channel just you know I
figure I might as well wasting time and
make a video so the first thing I want
to tell you is that I made a new forum
it doesn't have anything to do with my
old forum doesn't have anything to do
with computers or computer programming
or anything like that um a lot of you
guys know that I'm a huge UFC and MMA
fan so I thought it would be cool to
make a UFC forum so the name is UFC
forum online and pretty much if any guys
are in the UFC or MMA like that like I
am go check it out it's a cool place you
know to talk about UFC get all the
latest news and rumors and stuff like
that and in addition to that if you guys
want to stay updated when women like the
UFC pay-per-views or Strikeforce paint
events are going on I'm gonna be
covering all of those live I got some
cool software on my forum so if you like
can't afford the fight or you're in a
location where you can't get it and you
don't want to go out to a bar or
anything like that then go ahead and
whenever there's a pay-per-view or
Strikeforce event or any MMA event they
have to pay for it and you don't want to
pay for it
just go ahead in my forum and I'm I'll
give you guys minute to minute details
I'll sit at my TV blogging on my little
laptop so anyways that's gonna be cool
so don't forget that what that's what I
want to talk about I got a little cheat
sheet of stuff I want to talk about
that's he talked about that
check oh this other stupid thing I want
to tell you guys about like for Less
week I've been getting involved in like
stock trading and just you know
something to waste my time so anyways I
signed up for this website is called
investopedia.com not my website and they
let you have these games where you start
off with like a hundred thousand dollars
and it's pretty much
pretend stock trading but you use the
real stock market and it pretty much
gives you fake money and it's like a
stock market simulator so anyways I made
a game called Bucky's game so if you
sign up for investopedia.com
and whenever you're searching in game
type in Bucky's game without any
apostrophes or anything like that then
I'm already signed up for it so you can
play against me and every anyone else
who signs up for it in it like I said
you're gonna start off with a hundred
thousand dollars and pretty much trade
stocks and see how much money you can
make so if you ever wanted to you know
get into stock trading but you don't
have any money go ahead and join my game
and maybe I'll give out like prizes or
something at the end whoever wins the
most money in the stock market but uh
I'll think of something stupid to give
out to like two top five winners or
something but anyways sign up and play
against me it's going to be fun not
really a whole much more to say about
that and what else was I going to talk
about oh yeah I was making a couple PHP
tutorials in like the last few months
and I was gonna make one tonight in I
was gonna talk about inheritance but I
couldn't figure out if I covered it
inheritance before or not so instead of
looking through my videos to see if I
covered it or not because that would
definitely take like four seconds and I
do not have that time I'm a busy man I
got things to do let me know if I
covered inheritance it or not and if not
I'll make a tutorial about it if I did
that I'm gonna move on to the next
subject and the last thing I want to
talk to you guys about is my computer
you know a bunch of crazy stuff the last
thing I want to talk to you guys about
is a video series that I'm thinking of
making in the next couple months well
I'm thinking about doing is for those of
you who have watched the surviving the
wilderness series I'm thinking about
doing it myself in either the add erotic
Mountains or Great Smoky Mountain
National Park so if you would like to
see me in a surviving the wilderness
series and for those of you don't know
it's pretty much you go out with I think
it's a knife a flint and a machete and
see how long you can last in the
woods no cell phone no GPS no I don't
know no food no tent nothing like that
it's pretty much you have a knife and
you see how long he lasts and I'll be
filming the entire thing so anyways I
want you guys feedback before I make
this video if you think it'll be a good
idea then let me know if you think it'll
be stupid and you don't want to see me
in the woods for however many days then
on just tell me it's gonna be stupid and
don't do it just keep making tutorials
so anyways um like I said that's all I
have for you guys nothing important
nothing really new and exciting to talk
about but anyways if you're interested
in signing up for my UFC forum or you
want to get like all or you want to not
get but you want to follow along with
all the paper views or paid events
definitely check out my forum if you
want to play against me and the stock
trading game definitely do that and let
me know if I covered inheritance or not
and I'll be making some PHP tutorials in
probably the next few days and lastly
tell me if you think surviving the water
and this is a good idea or a bad idea
mmm that's pretty cool on camera
actually
mmm-hmm anyways that's all I have for
you guys so I think guys for watching
this useless video and uh I'll see you
later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
