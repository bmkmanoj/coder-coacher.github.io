slash on live gamer for the new Boston
and in this tutorial we're going to be
taking a look at quitting your do loops
early now this will work for do-while
loops or do one two loops now if you
remember back we learned how to quit for
loops early now the same concept can be
applied to do until and do-while loops
let's go ahead and get started and make
a little demo application so go ahead
and select console application and we'll
type this quitting do loops go ahead and
click okay so let's zoom in some here
and let's go ahead and add console dot
read line okay so now let's create our
do until loop so let's do until num1
equals 10 then go ahead and loop now
let's come up here and create num 1 so
we'll declare num1 as integer and we
will set it equal to zero so now it's
equal to zero we're going to do until
num1 equals 10 and we will console dot
write line num1 so now what we're going
to do is we are going to increment num1
so if you run this it's going to give us
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 now let's add a
simple if statement so
if num1 equals 5 then exit do so what
this is going to do is whenever it comes
down after they are due until statement
each time it loops it's going to hit
this if statement right here and then if
number one is equal to five then exit
the do loop
so since num1 starts at zero it's going
to run through this it's going to be
fine and it's going to equal to one and
then it's going to go down and then once
it equals five it's going to exit the do
so our program is going to print out 0 1
2 3 4 because it's going to exit once to
equals 5 let's go ahead and run this and
you can see here that we have 0 1 2 3 4
now we can also do this with a do-while
loop so do while num 1 is less than or
equal to 10 so if num 1 is equal to 5
then exit the new loop let's go ahead
and change this a little bit here will
do if num 1 is equal to 7 so you can see
here that we get 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 and then
it exits now what we can also do is
let's say our do-while loop is not
incrementing by 1 so what if it skips
the number 5 well what we can do instead
of if num 1 equals 5 we can do if num 1
is greater than 5 so let's just
increment this by 2 and you can see here
that we're going to get 0 to 4 and now
you can see that it stops before it got
to 5 because num 1 was greater than 5
now if we do it like this then it's
going to print out all the way and this
if statement is never going to run so go
ahead and make a couple do until loops
that exit based on certain conditions
you can do it differently than I did it
I encourage you to do that
so you can learn more
about the programming and then once you
got that down go ahead and move on to
the next tutorial and thanks for
