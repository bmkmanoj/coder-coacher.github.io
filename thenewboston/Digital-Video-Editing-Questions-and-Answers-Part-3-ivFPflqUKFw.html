in summary there's a lot more to it but
it's pretty much looking at the overall
picture of your frame instead of just
each pixel individually the next thing
they came up with was something called
temporal compression and what this
pretty much does is look at each frame
and it says all right we don't really
need to make a bunch of key frames for
the frames that further pixels that
aren't changing so we're just going to
make new key frames for the pixels that
are changing for example if this video
you're watching right now had temporal
temporal compression on it and my arm
was moving like this it would only make
a new keyframe for the pixels that my
arm is and all of this background and
wouldn't change things so there would be
only one keyframe for its background but
it will make new keyframes for that and
as you can see this was a way to make
the file size a lot smaller by only
changing the parts of the video that
moved so on most of the time you don't
really have to pick spatial compression
or temporal temporal compression
whenever you are editing video your
video program automatically applies a
preset according to whatever your
project settings are and it
automatically usually gives you a codec
and what the codec is I know you guys
probably heard this a lot codec stands
for compression and decompression and
it's a way of automatically compressing
your video and your camcorder before
loves the video on your computer like DV
camcorders they automatically compress
your video at a rate of twenty percent I
think so whatever the uncompressed video
is on your camcorder by the time against
your computer it's already twenty
percent of the file size which is very
good actually and on besides your
camcorder automatically compressing
video you can actually compress video
whenever you're exporting your video
onto the web or DVD so those are pretty
much the basics of compression there's a
lot of different program
you can use the compressor video but i
just wanted to cover what spatial
compression in temporal compression was
just an answer your guys question so uh
thank you for watching I hope you
learned something I know what's kind of
confusing but uh try to figure it out
anyways and you can learn more by
researching on the internet it's tough
but anyways it's all time I have for now
so thanks for watching I'll see you next
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
