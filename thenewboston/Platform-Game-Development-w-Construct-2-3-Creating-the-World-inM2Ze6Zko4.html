tutorial in construct 2 and in this
video I want to talk to you guys a
little bit about animation and how it
works is differently with the different
items in the game so what we just did is
we imported a tile set or a spreadsheet
now typically a spreadsheet is going to
be something like this it's going to be
a bunch of images that you're going to
play one after another so this is our
dude we're going to use later and as you
can see it starts off with them standing
and slowly transforms to him running and
once we play these images right after
each other it's going to look like he's
moving into a run but if you're thinking
about it we don't want this to happen
with the world we don't want the grant
the ground like changing images and
moving around or doing anything stupid
like that
so what we need to do is we need to help
construct to to treat the world a little
bit differently than you would treat
like a moving character or an enemy now
we're basically going to say don't
animate this at all so how do we say
that well with all of this loaded up in
this window right here to the right
called animations select default
animation now this is basically the
settings of how do you want these tiles
to be animated well of course they're
not going to be movement so we don't
want them to be animated at all so for
this animation speed in your default
properties and again make sure that you
have this default selected change it
from 5 to 0
basically saying whenever we have like a
piece of the ground or a platform that
the dudes going to hop on don't change
it to another frame or another image
just keep it the same
so default speed 0 we're good to go now
anytime we use these images they're not
going to be moving around or changing so
now we can actually close this out and
as you can see the first image appears
on the screen so again these are the
pieces that we're going to be able to
snap together and make the world for the
dude so let's go ahead and do that right
now now this image right here actually
isn't the one I wanted to use I want
to use a different frame in that title
set so in order to change it if I select
it what I'm going to do is put initial
frame to one and hit enter
and as you can see I don't know if you
guys could just tell but it changed
slightly here let me show you guys again
you're a zero keep your eye on that tile
and there is one so this is the one I'm
going to use for that first piece of the
platform and actually if you want to
make more pieces of this then what you
can do is once a selected hold down ctrl
and click and drag this and just go
ahead and do it again and all right so
this is looking kind of like a ground
but obviously these pieces are all the
left edges so what we actually need is a
center piece and a right piece so go
ahead and click the center one and the
frame for this we can actually change
this to ten and hit enter and obviously
with your sheet you're going to have to
look what image goes where but for now I
actually just remembered them so the
middle one is 10 and the right one is 13
so hit enter and look at that and also
another shortcut that you can use is if
you don't remember all what number
corresponds to what image like you
probably don't what you can do is you
can actually just take any of these and
double click it and then you can see all
of them real quick so you can either
just select it or you know just a
reference of okay what one was the
middle one oh yeah it was 10 right here
so you know so basically now that we
have all these tiles imported the next
thing I want to do is move them all
together so we don't have this weird gap
in between so let's just say we're gonna
we're going to put this here to start
and I'm just going to take this in let
me try to get it perfectly alright I
don't I don't know if they're really
aligned up you see I'm getting that
little gap in between so what you can do
to make this like a thousand times
easier is this now on the top bar in
maybe I should just wait to the next
time actually yeah this video is getting
kind of long so in the next tutorial
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
show you guys well I don't know if I
just have time I'll just show you guys
real quick under the View tab hit snap
to grid and what this is going to allow
you to do is snap around in a perfectly
coordinated system so if you select this
first one and let's say you want to move
it right there and select this second
one it's going to it's pretty much going
to turn your game into an invisible grid
and allow you to move these tiles only
within that grid so now you can see you
can easily snap that baby perfectly
where you wanted it so now that we got
these snap perfectly where we wanted it
you might as well leave this on right
now because it's not really hurting
anything right now and also if your
tiles are a different size then you're
going to want to change that right here
but I know mine or each 32 by 32 so uh
or um what's it called when a number
goes these numbers are divisible by 32
like a 64 16 so um that's why I chose
that but anyways this tutorial is
getting long in my mouth is getting dry
actually so I'm going to go choke some
water you guys practice snapping your
world together and in the next video you
know we're going to be doing adding that
player it's going to be awesome so I'll
see you guys then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
