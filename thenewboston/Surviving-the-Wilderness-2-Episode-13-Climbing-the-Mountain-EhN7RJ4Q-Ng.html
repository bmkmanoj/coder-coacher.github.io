lot easier said than done
it's a lot steeper than I thought and I
have to take a break like every 200 feet
so I'm freaking dehydrated oh my god my
legs are killing me and I gotta figure
out how to climb these huge rocks it's
gonna warm her out and the bugs are
coming out now whoever does this for fun
he's an idiot so after about over three
hours of climbing the worst condition
part of a mountain ever I wasted so much
energy climbing it I finally got to the
point where I said I was going to get to
I wanted to get to it or at least I
thought I wanted to get to it turns out
that this was a huge mistake
and let me show you guys what I found so
that's where I came from down there this
is pretty much what I had to climb the
entire time steep rocks and nothing to
hold on to and that's the pond that I
was filming from when I said that I
wanted to come up here so now I'm up
here and I got a better view of
everything but it looks like a better
view of nothing because that's what I
found as far is the I can see for miles
and miles and miles nothing but
wilderness
nothing but mountains no radio towers no
telephone poles no villages no roads no
anything so that's where I am right now
I really don't know what I'm supposed to
do hurry now so I can see about 60%
around me I don't know if I should stay
here or go back or try to get to the
other side bot I'm guessing it's just
more of this that's probably one of the
worst decisions that I had yet wasted so
much energy I already have zero energy
it feels like I'm dehydrated I don't
know what to do</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
