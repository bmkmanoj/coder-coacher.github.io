tutorial and in this tutorial I want to
talk to you guys about the derived class
constructors and deconstructors
basically I want to figure out this
riddle whenever you have a constructor
in addy constructor in the mother class
does the daughter class also inherit
that constructor well it inherits
everything else so is that constructor
and Deconstructor included well your
short answer is no it does not inherit
the constructor and D constructor from
the mother class or does it I guess
you're going to have to watch and find
out
so let's go ahead and first make a
constructor and D constructor in the
mother class so let's go ahead and
remember in order to do that just create
a function with the same name mother and
tilde mother for the D constructor
now let's go ahead and set this up and I
guess we'll build the constructor first
mother mother and all we're going to
have this constructor do is like C out I
am the mother constructor explanation
point emphasis on that crap and now
let's go ahead and do the same thing
let's copy this because I'm lazy and
remember dadier tilde so that's the D
constructor and just write mother let's
get rid of the IMD it's tacky she's a
mom mother D constructor so now we have
a mother class that has a successful
constructor and D constructor so now
whenever we create a mother object like
mother MA it should build the object so
and I messed up something right here
some mother mother let's see what I
messed up
oh here it is right here and L you need
that because end is not keyword so let's
go ahead and run the skin and now
whenever I create a mother object you
can see that the object gets created I
am the mother constructor and whenever
the program comes to an end the object
gets destroyed mother Deconstructor so
our mother object works as expected I
guess you could say whenever the object
gets created this runs and whenever it
gets destroyed this runs we already know
what a constructor and B constructor
does so now let's go ahead and build a
daughter object now remember at the
beginning of this tutorial I promised
you guys that the mother constructor and
the constructor even though the daughter
is inheriting all the stuff from the
mother I promised you guys that it is
not inheriting the constructor and D
constructor so let's go ahead and build
the daughter object if I can type
daughter and we'll just name this like
Deena because that's a nice name so
let's go ahead and build and run this
and see what we get whoa whoa whoa Bucky
Bucky I think you lied to me it said I'm
the mother constructor I am the mother
constructor Bucky you mofo you son of B
you told me that the daughter is not
inheriting the constructor from the
mother class so why on earth would it
run this constructor twice well let's go
ahead and actually build a daughter
constructor and we'll see exactly what's
going on we'll see if I actually did lie
or if I didn't so in order to build
daughter constructor let's go ahead and
build daughter parentheses and also
tilde daughter for the whoa what the
heck is that escape
the heck is ahead I do not know how that
got there
anyways let's go ahead and do that and
actually instead of having to copy this
I'm just going to you guys should not do
this by the way
just close your eyes for this part and
just going to change this to daughter
and copy this always bad programming
practice because you always usually mess
up something but hopefully that should
run just like that and now the mother
class has its own unique constructor and
D constructor and the daughter class has
its own constrictor and D constructor so
now whenever I run this you're saying
alright so you lied me obviously the
daughter did in fact inherit the moms
constructor so now that it has its own
construction and Deconstructor I should
see just two constructors and 2d
constructors run from the mom one from
the kid so let's go ahead and build this
in what the heck is this crap six things
popping up all right Bucky you need to
take a timeout and explain to me what's
going on well in order to do that I'll
make it real simple for you guys just
comment this out right here and run this
program again and now we see once we
just built this one daughter object
actually let me go ahead and take this
out completely and now XS out and build
it and run it again now we see that even
we built even though we built one
daughter object it's still running that
mother constructor and the daughter
constructor so what the heck is going on
Bucky alright now let me take a timeout
take a deep breath because I got some
explaining to do
when I told you at the beginning of this
story that the daughter does not inherit
the mother constructor I wasn't lying I
was telling the truth even though the
daughter is not inheriting the mother
constructor the mother constructor still
runs so basically here is how your
program works whenever you start this
program it says alright
I have one daughter object that I need
to make so the very first thing I'm
going to do before I do any of my own
crap in the starter class the very first
thing this program is going to do is
it's going to invoke the base classes
constructor so it says alright daughter
you have one base class called mother so
let's go up to mother and we're going to
end and we're going to invoke the mother
constructor before we even do anything
with the daughter so that's why the very
first thing we did was invoke the
mother's constructor and then after that
we were able to invoke the daughters
constructor so basically whenever you
use a class it sets up all its base
classes before it does anything on its
own class so that's why whenever running
the starter object it sets everything up
on top of it before it you know did the
daughter stuff and another thing I want
to point out say you weren't only
inheriting from a mother but say there
was a grandmother and a
great-grandmother and there was a huge
hierarchy well it's still the same thing
if that was the case then the
great-grandmother would get done first
and then the grandmother and then the
mother and then the daughter basically
the very top class is going to get done
um the constructor is going to get
finished executing first on the top most
class and this is because like I said
whenever you have a class that inherits
from another class it needs to set up
the class above it in order to make sure
everything is going to work inside it so
the daughter is going to say RA I need
the mother in order to work and the
mother is going to say alright I need
the grandma in order to work and the
grandmas going to say RA need the
great-grandma in order to work and
that's the very top so that's why the
great-grandmother it would be set up
first but in this case we only have a
mother and a daughter a very simple
explanation so that's why the mother
gets set up first because in order for
this daughter class to work the mother
class needs to be working first so that
is why the mother constructor gets
called first like I said the daughter
class isn't inheriting it's just setting
it up so that's why this mother
constructor gets ran simple enough so
that's why the mother constructor gets
ran and then the daughter constructor
gets ran but then the daughter D
constructor gets called first and then
the mother D constructor that's kind of
weird you're saying alright if we're
going to set this class up first then
you might as well destroy it first right
but that's not the way it works it goes
mother daughter daughter mother it's
kind of gets sandwiched in there so
here's what's happening with the rest of
the program
whenever an object gets destroyed and
remember we only had one daughter object
in this program then here's what happens
whenever an object gets destroyed its
Deconstructor gets called so Deena's
Deconstructor got called first and
whenever your program saw that this D
constructor get called it sets off a
chain of deconstructors the kid called
after it so if there's were you know a
huge family the daughter would get the
daughter would die first and then the
mother and then the grandma would die
and then the great-grandmother so it
gets kind of built in a reverse order
then dies but that's how it works so
basically one last time
whenever you're first say you had an
object like the daughter all of these
spaced classes the topmost base class
gets instantiated first it takes care of
the uppermost class first because it
needs every class needs class on top of
it to work in order for that object work
so that's why mother got called even
though we weren't inheriting it we
needed to set it up before a daughter
could get set up now whenever this
program ends the first thing to die is
this daughter object and once this
daughter dies is going to set off a
chain of death throughout the family the
mother is going to die then the gram is
going to die
then greg grandma's going to die then
Osama bin Laden's going to die because
that's what happened yesterday and
that's what day it is in case you guys
are watching this like three years in
feature that's what date is today uh May
third Osama bin Laden was declared dead
yesterday or two days ago whenever they
announced that so anyways I think I'll
just in on that note because I'm getting
way off topic now and I probably confuse
the guys enough so I thank you guys for
watching don't forget subscribe and
