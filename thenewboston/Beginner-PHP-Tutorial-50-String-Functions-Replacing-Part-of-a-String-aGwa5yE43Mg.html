and in this video creative for the New
Boston I'm going to be talking to you
about substring replace now substring
replace looks like this this is how we
call the function in PHP now substring
replace takes up to four arguments the
first argument that we take is the
string that we want to look at the
second argument is the string that we
want to replace the third argument is
where we want to start and the fourth
argument is where we want to end how
many characters or how many I guess
length if you like the length of the
replacement now let's have a look at
what this white basically does first
substring replace like I said is a
combination of substring and STR replace
so we have substring and PHP which will
return a specific part of a string so we
could specify in a string let's say if
we had a string Alex if I wanted to
start at zero one and go to characters
we were we would return e x so that's
substring STR replace will find a string
within a string and it will replace it
with a specified string so substring
replace is really a combination of these
two functions so why would we need this
we need this because we're searching for
something but what we're then doing is
we're we're replacing we're replacing
the string with a specified amount of
data so for example if you wanted to cut
a string in half this would be a
function to use if you wanted to say in
fact no sorry if you wanted to cut a
string in half you could use substring
but with substring replace
it will search for a string but only
within a specified portion of a string
so let's create a string now that we can
work with to show this example off I'm
going to choose this part don't search
let's just put a slash there this part
search now what's the idea of this
example I'm going to not include this
part of the string I don't want this
part of the string to be searched in
however I want this part of the string
to be searched in and what I want to do
is I want to replace part with another
word so let's create a new variable
called string underscore new and this is
going to be equal to calling substring
replace now we can start putting the
arguments in it to start putting this
into practice so the first argument is
easy we just need to supply the string
that we want to look in the second is
and we need to put in the string that we
want to replace so I want to replace
part this word here with something else
so let's just say part No we'll just say
yeah mmm Alex I can't think of any
better examples so the next argument we
need to give is where to start looking
so or where we start want to replace so
if we count up the characters we're
going to say 1 2 and B 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
9 10 11 12
I'm not sure if that's counted 13 14 15
16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28
29 so this will either be 29 or 30 I
think and then how many characters or
will the length of where we want to
search that's 4 because we've got 4
characters in part so let's have a look
now at string new and see what's
happened it's quite hard to come up with
an example with something for this but
when you do need it you'll say oh that
would be useful so yeah okay so this is
worked I counted correctly so now we're
saying this part don't search this Alex
search so we haven't actually searched
but we've rather specified where we want
to replace within the string now why
would this be useful and where would
this be use for in a real-life example
let's say we had a forum where a user
could like in a word processing like on
a word processor you can search and
replace we've already covered searching
within a string so if we were to search
within this string and look for part we
could then find out that part is located
at point 29 at location 29 we could then
say well we've searched for part the
word part is four characters long so
then you can take in user input
and specify what you'd like to replace
so in this particular tutorial I won't
be demonstrating that however there is
another tutorial where we create the
exact program that I've just talked
about all the scripts that I've just
talked about so these are the
fundamentals of STL substring replace
but in the other tutorial we're going to
look at how we can put this into
practice and how it might be useful</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
