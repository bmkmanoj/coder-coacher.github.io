variable name so let's go back to age
XJS now you do this inside square curly
brackets and the each value you send to
this file is comma-separated so the
first one we're going to well the only
variable we're going to send is the
string so I'm going to call the variable
input and I'm going to make this equal
to string now this might look a bit odd
essentially this input here is what we
would use in PHP to grab this so input
is the name of the variable that we've
sent and string is obviously the
variable we created earlier with the
string data from this text field so now
that we've done that we would you well I
mean if we needed to supply additional
parameters we could say input - string -
something like that so there you'll come
and separate every single value that you
include the third parameter is a
callback function which in this case is
extremely important now after we have
sent the data to this file this PHP
forward slash reverse dot PHP file we
want to be able to return the data that
sent back from reverse PHP and in this
case we're reversing the string using
the STR Rev function in PHP so we need
to create a callback function and again
we create a block here which we can pull
just down and in here it will make it
easier to write the code but we need to
give this function a parameter and
that's going to equal the value that's
returned by reverse dot PHP so in this
case I'm going to write data now data
will contain everything that is sent
from reverse dot PHP so the the output
contents of reverse dot PHP will then be
stored inside data so inside of our
callback function here what we can
actually do is go ahead and put this
data here into a div
underneath here so let's go and create a
div I'm going to call this feedback I'm
going to end the div there I'm obviously
not going to write anything in there
because we're going to have jQuery
handle that for us so in Ajax j/s what i
want to do is i want to use a selector
and i'm selecting the feedback div and
then I'm going to say dot text and then
in brackets I'm going to write data so
let's just go ahead and explain again
what we're doing we're sending data to
this file here we're sending a variable
called input with the value string which
we've retrieved up here we're then using
a callback function and we're grabbing
data here that's sent back from this
reverse dot PHP file we're then putting
this data inside the feedback div that
we created on our index page so
hopefully that makes sense so far now
what we're going to do is test out our
our HTTP requests now at the moment
nothing really here is is useful because
we haven't created any code inside
reverse dot PHP however what I'm going
to do is I'm just going to simply come
in create some PHP tags and echo out
test' now what's going to happen is
despite the fact that we've sent this
variable here data will now contain the
value test because we've echoed this out
into the page the page contents will now
become available in this data variable
so our feedback div will contain the
value test let's go over to our page and
test this out so despite why I type in
here now nothing's really going to you
know work because we haven't created
anything interesting we've just echoed
out tests from our PHP file however when
I click go you can see that the value
test has been returned and placed inside
that div so now that we know that the
HTTP request has worked we need to work
on the PHP file
in order to manipulate this input and
then return the reverse string so the
first thing we want to do is check if
the variable is set so we're going to
say if is set dollar underscore get and
in here we need to supply the variable
name and that is input so input so if
that is set we can go ahead and create a
new variable and that's going to be
that's going to just grab this value
here which we obviously have in get
input so this is going to be string is
equal to dollar underscore get input so
now string is equal to the posted
variable here which comes originally
from the text box so now what we can do
is echo STR Rev which is a simple
function that reverses a string and we
supply that with one parameter which is
the original string so now what's going
to happen is when we refresh our page
and type something else in I'm going to
type my name and click go you can see
that PHP has returned the reversed
version of what we originally typed in
the text input field so we now
successfully performed a get HTTP
request using jQuery now like I've said
in another part of this age at these
Ajax jQuery tutorials is that if we were
to do this with Ajax on its own pure
Ajax we would be writing a lot more
lines than we are now so although some
of this looks complicated some of the
syntax that's complicated especially
with these brackets and this callback
function here hopefully the concept is
understandable to you and you can now go
ahead and start to test with this in the
next video we're going to look at the
post HTTP requests as well and a bit
about why we might use that instead of
get but for now we have created a short
piece of code which sends data to the
reverse dot PHP file
and returns a reversed version of the
string</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
