tutorial and instead of just telling you
guys um all of the different tests I'm
going to just show them run through them
real quick and then I'm going to post
them on my website the New Boston comm
so you guys can just copy them because
if I show you guys each individual tests
like I've been doing it's going to take
like eight years
so we've already tested to see if the
username contains the letters and
numbers and if it did I mean if it
passed that test then it went on and
check for duplicate names so I'm going
to run through the rest of these real
quick
the next thing after it checks for the
name wasn't used it's the same thing you
have to do the same exact thing to check
if the email wasn't you select look at
your database to run through and
whatever email they posted right here
right here make sure that it isn't
already in the database again if num
equals two I mean if num equals zero
that means there's zero in the database
so you can move on the next step the
next step after that is um if post pass
equals past two and post email equals
post email two now what this test does
is make sure that pass and confirmation
pass and email and confirmation email
add up and remember post pass right here
this variable is whatever we typed in to
here whatever we typed in here is going
to be stored in that variable and again
this is confirmation passed this is
email and this is confirmation email so
if it passed all these tests to check
for duplicate names and duplicate emails
and stuff like that the next thing we're
going to want to do is generate a random
confirmation code that's going to be
using their email and the code for this
is md5 unique random and what this is
going to do is generate a unique
confirmation code that's stored in the
variable confirmation code right here
and once we generate a confirmation code
we're going to want to send a bunch
variables to them but before we do we
want to strip all of the tags that a
hacker might use so for example if they
used instead of entering their email
address is whatever at a low com a
hacker might try to use something like
um script uh bad things and they might
try to enter that they might try to
enter this so they can kind of like
change our site using javascript or
anything like that what this does right
here strip tags is it removes all the
HTML tags so if someone's being an idiot
and trying to put JavaScript or HTML
tags into our database then they can't
do that it's just a way of securing our
website a little more and after they do
that we want to insert the data into the
database temporary now we want to insert
all the data in the temporary database
because if we um because if we just
enter it into the permanent database
without checking make sure they have a
confirmation email then it's another
security risk so what we're going to do
is insert all their data into a
temporary database send them a
confirmation email right here and if
they click it then we want to put it
into the permanent database then so what
this means insert into a temporary
database send them a confirmation email
and this is pretty much just send them
all the confirmation email right there
now in that confirmation email we're
going to send them is going to have code
to insert that information into a
permanent database so this whole page
right here is just pretty much to test
all of your information making sure
you're not trying to hack your site
making sure your aren't spam and if you
pass all these tests we want to insert
your information into a temporary
database and send you in
email confirmation and I'm not going to
go over all this like I said but I am
actually I already did post it on my
website on the New Boston comm as you
can see um if you go down is look at PHP
source code from PHP tutorial 30 and one
it's all right here so you can just go
ahead and copy all this and put it right
in your website and you can see what it
means by then and if you have any
questions at all on any of this all you
have to do is sign up for my site arm
register it's going to be up here I'm
already signed in and ask me my
questions on the New Boston comm again
I'm not going to answer any of your
questions on YouTube if you post
questions on there since I never check
those messages so again
study this copy my source code and I
comment it for you so you can see
exactly what it means exactly what it's
doing and in the next tutorial I'm going
to be showing you guys what to do with
that confirmation link once you send it
to them in the email so this is actually
the most confusing part and I'm sorry to
throw this at you guys real quick but I
made it real easy for you guys copy once
you get past all of this it's going to
be a piece of cake I'm going to walk
three guys step by step showing you guys
how to build one of the coolest games
you ever built for PHP so again thanks
for watching please subscribe my youtube
channel and again visit my site at the
new boston comm if you need any help and
thank you and I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
