computer networking tutorial and in this
video I want to go over the different
parts of a network so let me go ahead
and build a very standard or typical
computer network right now so obviously
of course can't have a computer network
at least not in this example without a
couple pcs and these pcs would just be
you know your desktop at home or maybe a
laptop if you have one it may be um I
don't know at school maybe you have a
server and if you guys don't know
exactly what a server is then I'm going
to be talking about it either in the
next video or the later part of this
video but networks usually have servers
in them and let's see what else would
you have it I don't know school printer
that all the computers would be
connected to so here's your printer
here's a little piece of paper I don't
know why I put you know writing on that
paper when it hasn't even been printed
yet anyways you typically have a printer
and then you have your let's say network
hardware and this is the stuff that
people typically think of whenever they
think of computer networking like
routers and your modems and you know
switches if you know what those are so
these are all you know the kind of
networking you know I don't want to say
these all have to do with networking but
this is typically what people think of
these pieces right here now all of these
devices from you know the laptops the
desktops modems printers no matter what
it is every part of network is called a
node all of these devices are nodes so
this PC this server this router is
pretty much any like device I want to
say and I say that because I'm going to
be talking to you guys about something
else that that's another part of a
network that isn't the node so of course
we have all these devices but what are
we missing in our computer network well
kind of you know what makes a computer
network a computer network a way to
connect these devices so of course we
connect them in different ways maybe a
copper or wire so you have some copper
wires you know connected to your servers
and maybe I don't know you have some
let's say radio waves Wi-Fi connected to
your printer or maybe you know you have
a wireless router so there's Wi-Fi
coming off here so basically any way to
connect nodes whether it's copper wire
or fiber optics or just Wi-Fi all of
these things right here these are called
communications media communications
media while you probably can't even read
that because of my handwriting so bad
but that's basically what a very basic
computer network is made up of at the
heart of it is just two parts notes
which are pretty much your devices and
communications media which is whatever
means connects those devices whether
it's you know waves in the air or copper
wire fiber optics so on and so forth so
remember all computer networks are made
up of two parts communications media and
they provide ways to transfer data
between the nodes simple enough</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
