Photoshop cs6 tutorial and in this
tutorial we're going to start using some
tools that kind of go with the last
couple filters that I went over and the
tools are the sharpen blur and smudge
tools and these tools are pretty neat
they can help you out when you need to
sharpen or blur only just like a portion
of your image and you want to do it with
like paint strokes and stuff like that
so let's get started now the blur
sharpen and smudge tools are over here
in on the tools panel and they'll be
either a teardrop shape a triangle shape
or this finger shape and that's where
you can find it if you click and hold
down you can see all the different tools
so the blur tool here softens hard edges
or reduces detail the sharpen tool
increases contrast and the smudge tool
pretty much pushes the colors around to
create like a smudging like look so like
smear stuff I guess so let's go and
duplicate our background layer so we
don't mess it up and we'll just work on
this background copy so make you make
sure you have it selected now let's go
ahead let's just start with the blur
tool and go up to the top here and
select your brush tip so select anything
you want and then increase the size or
whatever to whatever you want I'm going
to just increase it so we can see what's
going on a little bit better so I got
mine here at 61% okay and let's just
start like blurring something so we'll
just blur the face on this and the way
you want to do this is you can either do
short clicks or you can click and drag
and just hold down and keep on going
over the same area over and over and you
can see how this is blurring out the
face now you can see this is taking a
really long time and it's a pretty
subtle effect
so there's different
that you can change that I'm gonna go
back into my history here and I'm gonna
go to the top where I'm done below been
done blurring there we go so right now
nothing has happened because I went that
back that far in my history now up here
at the top there's a couple different
things we've got the hardness of our
brush if we put that up it's going to be
harder more concentrated blur as you can
see that was a lot quicker and faster
than with a soft brush so I just hit
control Z to go back now we've got our
strength here which will also increase
the amount of our blur so if you put the
hardness up and the strength up let's
make sure the hardness is still up yep
it is it's gonna do a faster and harder
blur as you can see there now if I have
sample all layers checked here it's
going to blur everything in the whole
document so just realize that when you
have this sample all the layers we've
got a mode here where we can do a darken
a lot in a hue or saturation or
luminosity where you can basically blur
based on of these different modes here
so go ahead and experiment so I'll go
with darken right here and you can see
how this is different than just the
normal so experiment with those on how
you like to on on which one you would
like to use the best and whatever one
you like to use the most I'm gonna
switch over to the sharpen tool so I can
show you some more stuff so we've got
the sharpen tool here and a new option
comes up that's called protect detail
and this basically just minimizes
pixelation while maintaining details so
I'm gonna go ahead and use this and I'm
gonna use my right bracket on my
keyboard to increase my brush size
I'm gonna go along like these glasses
we're gonna sharpen these up so I'm just
gonna zoom in so we can see a little
better and I can bring this down so
let's let's start trying to sharpen up
this image here you can see what's going
on here it's increasing the contrast
they're getting way darker and then like
the brights are way brighter and the
darker is are way darker and not his
sunglasses are like way different
colored as you can see there so that's
what the sharpen does now obviously I
applied that way too hard so I thought
maybe just wanted to go across at once
and then you can see the difference that
way so use it sparingly you don't want
to go too overboard with it let's go to
the smudge tool and yet another new
option comes up called finger painting
and it uses the background color as the
smudge so if you have it deselected if
you don't have this selected it's just
gonna use whatever is underneath your
pointer or whatever is underneath your
brush just smudge so let's go ahead and
smudge the lips as you can see what's
going on here kind of looks funny and
that's what the smudge does it basically
just smears everything now let's go
ahead and use the since these images are
the same if I apply the finger painting
method to it it's gonna be season like
the it's a little different than what I
expected inspect it to go white not too
sure why I did that but
maybe it's part of the transparency
background layer or whatever I expected
it pretty much to do nothing but there
we go there's a we'll turn him into the
Joker there we go nice well that's how
you use your smudge tool your blur tool
and your sharpen tool so use the blur
tool to soften hard edges or reduce some
detail you can use the sharpen tool to
increase contrast along the edges and
that in turn increases the sharpness
obviously and you can use this smudge
tool to create like a kind of like a wet
paint effect I guess painting or
smearing effect so that's how you use
these different tools and hopefully you
can use them in your next project</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
