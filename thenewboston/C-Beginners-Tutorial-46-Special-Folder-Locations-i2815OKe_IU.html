tutorial that I'm making for the new
Boston and in this tutorial I'm going to
show you how to use the convert class so
all you're going to need for this
tutorial is a button and a text box and
once you have those on your form just
double click on the button so in
previous tutorials we looked at the bit
converter class and the bit converter
class um mainly handles fights and we're
on we're going to want to be looking at
other variable types so we're going to
use the convert class so in order to
access the methods inside of the convert
class we just don't want to type convert
and then use the dot operator and since
all the methods inside of this class are
static we don't need to create air we
can even create an instance of this
class so first like I said we're going
to be looking at converting a string
into an integer so we're just going to
use the two and 32 method and then as
you can see it falls for where all this
method is heavily overloaded meaning
that you can pretty much type any
variable type inside of here and we'll
convert it into an integer or it will be
try to so we're just like I said going
to be converting a string into an in 32
so we're just going to type text box 1
dot X because it represents a string and
basically what this will do is it will
convert whatever is in textbox 1 dot
text into ending 32 and if it cannot do
it if there's like letters in there or
something it will throw an error so
first was going to create in to say
equal du and then we're just going to
display that integer in the message box
we're gonna have to do dot choose
all right so basically what it does here
is it takes whatever's in text box one
box and it converts it into an integer
and then it sets whatever it converts it
into equal to this integer right here
and then it displays this integer in the
message box so now I'm going to be bug
here we just type any number in here and
we'll display in a message box type in a
four we hope we get four type in 10 and
we get time well if we try to type in
like letters or something like a those
it's going to get an error yep input
strings not in correct format just we
can't convert letters into an and then
32 so we can also do many things with
this like we can treat it just as if it
was like a number or something like we
use a pad like an ad to do it or
something if you don't have to just be a
bit like that can we can treat it as if
it was just a number or a variable so we
can just add 2 to it
type in like 10 we should get 12 yup so
yeah all right so there are many
different methods inside of this mover
class like I said you can convert pretty
much anything into anything if you were
to character like if we wanted to do
whatever character is in text box one
text now we just want on a display is
character an amount box we can do that
like in like app right here yep
try to type in like a string or probably
going in there yep string must be
exactly one character long and it wasn't
like five or six um
there's other methods as well there's
two boolean where you're going to
convert it into a boolean and some of
these you may say you're probably never
going to use them like this to boolean
but you'd be surprised I thought I would
never use this to boolean but I ended up
using it like a few weeks back so
anyways just convert
Xbox men's text and Julian sigh equal to
that display the message box so we type
in true here we shouldn't get an error
type and false you shouldn't get an
error no but if we try to type in like
anything besides true or false we're
going to get an error we just type in
that yes string was not recognized as a
valid boolean so it's not a bad idea to
put a try and catch statement around
when you're converting things because
sometimes it won't work out or like if
you're pretty shape if only some of the
time it's going to convert I would
recommend bring a try and catch
statement around it so your application
doesn't crash and then you can always
just put a box here saying like the
version failed and then you just know
that there's a problem with your
conversion and then you can just keep on
converting or have your application keep
on going so we wanted to do like - we're
fine but if we try to type in like
anything else now we'll just get the
conversion files instead of our
application crashing which is always
good
so that's pretty much it for this
tutorial on the convert class but I
didn't go over every single method
inside of it because it's pretty
self-explanatory like you used to
convert dot and then whatever you want
to convert it to like you want to
convert it to an 64 then you just set
equal to a long or something like that
so yeah that's pretty much it for this
tutorial so see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
