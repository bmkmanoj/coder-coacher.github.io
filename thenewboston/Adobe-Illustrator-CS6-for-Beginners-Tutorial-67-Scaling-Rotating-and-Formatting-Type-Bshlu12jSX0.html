illustration cs6 tutorial and in this
tutorial we're gonna keep on learning
about using the character panel and
we're gonna show I'm going to show you
about the extra options that are on the
panel but first I wanted to bring you
this important message this is on the
back of a gas station and it says
education is important but cold beer is
important ER and I thought that was a
good PSA I'm gonna get rid of that get
out of here okay there we go and I'm
gonna use my area type tool again and
I'm just gonna go back to type here
window type character and we've got it
already open know if you don't have
these extra options on here you just
need to go to the options and then go to
it'll say show options and now you got
it and everything in here is pretty easy
and you'll find some of it you you'll
kind of recognize how it's what's going
on and everything here so the first one
we've got is scaling the type we've got
vertical scale here on the left and
horizontal scale on the right no it's
gonna either make the type wider or
narrower for you and the other one's
gonna make it taller or shorter so
vertical scary goes taller or shorter
and horizontal goes wider or narrower
and that's not easy to say like ten
times in a row alright so let's go let's
start increasing the scale here so I'm
gonna start with the vertical go to 550
and you can see what that does just as
predicted if I go to 75 it's gonna be
smaller than it used to be so I'll put
it back at 100 and then let's check out
the horizontal scale 175 way too much
let's try there's 125 you can see it's
just like spreading it out and if I go
to like 50 it's a way closer and it's
moving around because of the shape of
the air
type tool the area type is a star so
it's moving around to try to get into
it's always trying to get up here into
the top now let's see the next thing
we've got here this is the baseline
shift and this goes all along with
leading and you can set where the
baseline is I'm not going to worry too
much about that in this tutorial but I
want to show you about rotation here
character rotation and you can pretty
much to rotate the object here and are
not the object the characters so let's
go to 30 and now you can see that
they're rotating on their own each
character it's not like rotating as a
big whole thing as one is rotating by
character put this back at zero and now
we've got a couple more things down here
that deal with formatting your type and
we've got all caps and then the next one
here is small caps and then we've got a
couple superscripts and subscripts so
these just if there was a part here like
I selected a certain part of a good and
this will make it up higher kind of like
this the numbers I can't even think what
it is what they're called but hopefully
you guys understand and then we got
underlined and then we've got a
strikethrough and if you have just
somewhere it's selected then it's only
going to apply it to those words that
you have selected but if you have the
whole thing selected like when you
select it with the selection tool it's
going to go across the whole entire set
of text that you have
then we've got our couple styles here
sharp crisp strong and these are called
anti-aliasing and what these do is they
pretty much affect the sharpness of your
type here so I have on none right now
and if you if you look at it you can see
especially in this a and then that's why
you can see that it's really jagged II
let me apply sharp to it and you can see
that the J have gone out and then you
experiment with the different texts to
see which one that you like better that
works well with that so that's the
anti-aliasing method and then we've got
our language you can change it to
whatever language you want
I'm stick with the USA so I don't get
lost and that's pretty much it so yeah
that's all I've got to talk to you about
using this character panel here
I think in the next tutorial will go
over paragraphs and all this stuff here
with the paragraphs and yep we're good
to go have a good one everybody thanks
