showed you guys how to store numbers in
variables but did y'all know that you
can also store different types of data
in variables I'm talking not only
numbers but you can also store text
words dates logic and we'll talk about
logic later on but it's pretty much like
true and false and we'll see why that
comes and comes in handy later on but
all this different crap we can store
inside variables now whenever we do that
sometimes our needs to figure out
exactly what type of data you're storing
so let's go ahead and do something cool
right now so say that inside the
variable a we want to store the number
32 and inside the variable B we want to
store the word Bucky so what we can do
is we can actually use a function in our
to figure out what type of data is
stored inside a variable and to do that
use the function called okay hit caps
lock their class now the piece of
information that you need to give this
function is the name of the variable so
what this is going to do is it's going
to tell you what type of data is stored
inside a and let's go ahead and do the
same thing for B
be so let's go ahead and run this and it
says r8 we're setting our variables
right here a which is 32 is in the Marik
and B which is Bucky is character or
text basically that's what character
means so this is helpful let's say um
let's say you're making a program that
the person needs to enter their age so
they enter a number you want to make
sure that it is in the Marik if they
enter something like Bucky for the age
by K that's character ain't numeric try
again Hoss so actually let me guys let
me show you something else
helpful for that there's also another
function that we could use called is
numeric and it can tell you if the
variable is numeric or not so sometimes
you just want to test if the variable is
one specific type of data so let's go
ahead and set a equal to we'll use
different kinds of numbers here actually
I can type it out now and you copy am
not that lazy alright so a is equal to 4
23 B is equal to negative 8 C will set
equal to 32 in some random decimal
places and we'll set the variable D
equal to the word whoo yes it's immature
but hey so am i all right
so in order to test if a variable is
numeric what we can do is we can use is
dot numeric and then inside that type
the variable name so let's do it for a b
c and d b c and d so let's go ahead and
run all of this and i'll explain to you
guys what happens so right now we're
just setting all the variables a for 23
is in the Merak
so it says yes it is in america true
negative 8 is in the marek as well
thirty two point five three four five is
also America a decimal place stone
America poop however poop is not a
number so that would be false so maybe
this would come in handy if you're
making a I don't know a program for like
bank accounts or something where people
can have all of these in their bank
account maybe this guy went into some
debt maybe this guy I know maybe it's a
Bitcoin account or something however if
they you know try to send like poop
amount of dollars you can't do that Hoss
that would be false that's where you can
use the is numeric function so anyways
that is different types or a few
different types of data that you can
store in variables um we'll cover dates
and also logic later on when the time is
right but for now I just wanted to show
you guys that there are indeed different
types of that that you can store and
there are also some cool functions that
you can use depending on which type of
data you use</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
