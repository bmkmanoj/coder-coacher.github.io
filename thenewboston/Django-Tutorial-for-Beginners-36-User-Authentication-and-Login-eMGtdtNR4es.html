authenticate and log in the user so let
me just say your threes credentials are
correct all right so what we're going to
do is we're going to make a new variable
called user interaction you want to call
authenticate so this is going to take
two pieces of information keyword
arguments and we're going to pass in
their user name and for the password
we'll just pass in this password
variable so essentially what this
function does is it takes a username and
password and it checks in the database
to see if they are an actual user to see
if they exist so what we can do now is
we can check to make sure that we
actually got a user back you can say
user is not none then this is what we're
going to do so again whenever you run
this function if it's authenticated then
it's going to take that user in return
it as the user variable right here so
now this should be equal to Bucky or
admin or whoever so we need to check one
more thing and this is kind of weird but
basically what Django lets you do is
they let you have users in here that you
can either like ban or make inactive
maybe someone just acting up and you
didn't want to delete their entire
account so you just disable their
account so you need to check for that as
well before they log in so if user is
active then this means that re their
account doesn't get banned and of course
they logged in proper password the user
exists so how do you actually log them
in and attach a session well it's really
easy you just pass in a request in user
that's it that is all you need to do
they are now logged in to your website
so you can actually now refer to them is
request dot user and again don't write
this actually boat later on whenever you
want to print out their username or
something then you just write request
that user that username request that
user dot profile photo
whatever information you have about them
and check this out so they're now logged
in and you can now refer them that way
but after they log in I'm actually going
to want to redirect them to the home
page because if they just log in and hit
submit and then it just shows them a
blank form then they're probably going
to make I am I logged in or did I press
the right thing or what so in order to
that you just right return redirect and
the URL which is music index boom
roasted so if this is true and they
submitted the form properly then
hopefully they log in and get redirected
right there but if they didn't then what
I'm going to do is this I'm just going
to say okay try again so alright so I'm
just going to return render request self
template form form make sure this is in
the property or thing alright so again
if they didn't log in or if their
account is ban or whatever then we're
just going to say alright you know what
here's a blank form for you so now the
last two things we need to do is we
actually need to give this URL and I'm
just going to have it where if they go
to register um then this is going to pop
up you can name it like create an
account or whatever you want but let me
just copy this alright so my rate
expression is me register and use your
form view and get rid of this and I'll
just name it register
all right looking good and we also need
to create this registration form HTML
template real quick and I'm probably
just going to steal one from somewhere
else so right click a new HTML file
registration form let's steal the from
album form so copy that paste there
right in there and let me just change
the title so get rid of this and set the
add a new one just say register and for
the heading out to say create new
account
now capitalize new what else all right
so now if we go to register then we're
getting an error because I messed up my
regular expression all right so all
right the carrot goes at the beginning
Bucky you fool and okay hopefully boom
roast there you go
all right so create a new account and
let me pop open this admin section 2 so
admin users we don't have any other
users so check it out so this right here
the reason that this is pre-populated is
this is actually just Google Chrome so
it has nothing to do with Django this is
just Chrome's default because I said
safe password like a fool so the
username can be um bacon buddy now let's
just say bacon 2 2 at gmail.com password
pass 1 2 3 4 so now whenever I submit
check it out it logs me in and it
redirects me to the home page now this
is probably going to log me out right
here alright so the reason that whenever
you go to the admin your logged out is
because you are actually now logged in
as bacon buddy so if I just log back in
as admin let me close out here log back
in is admin look at my users I see that
I now have a new user called bacon buddy
and here's all of their information so
there you go so that is after a quite a
long tutorial how you create new users
how you let them register and also login
to your Jango website so I'm going to go
ahead and take a break I'm going to
watch a hockey game the Pittsburgh
Penguins they better win and yeah thanks
for watching
I will see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
