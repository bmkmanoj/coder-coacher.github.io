is done and also our PHP file is
complete let's go ahead and create the
last file that we need the heart of Ajax
the JavaScript file so go ahead file new
and we'll just go ahead and save this as
I'll save it is food store food stores
that Jas and go ahead and save it and
make sure that you save it is whatever
you link to right here in your HTML file
so hold on got a itch in my ear oh all
right so now what we need to do the
first thing that I recommend always
doing is storing your object and easy to
use variable because this object is kind
of it kind of has a long name so I'm
just going to go ahead and store an XML
on H TT p and go ahead and set this
equal to create XML HTTP crust object
now this is actually a function name and
we're going to be building this function
right now now first of all why do we
need this variable to hold this object
well the xml httprequest object which
we're going to be getting in the
function that we're going to be building
this is the awesome object that allows
you to communicate with the server
without having to refresh your page so
this is basically the most important
object in Ajax so that's what we're
going to be doing right now so let's go
ahead and create a function and this was
the function right here this function
right here and it's not going to take
any parameters so basically the job of
this function is to pretty much get this
object and store in this variable right
here so the first thing we need to do is
we need to say what variable we're
working with copy
and then you know later on we can set
this equal to something but for right
now the first thing we wanted to do is I
want to explain this first of all
Internet Explorer is gay where I
shouldn't say that it's politically
incorrect Internet Explorer is retarded
so they do things differently in not in
a good way they always do things
differently in a bad way so the very
first thing we need to do in order to
use Ajax for all the people the idiots
using Internet Explorer we need to make
sure that Ajax works for them so this is
how you set your XML HTTP variable equal
to the object that Internet Explorer
uses so the very first thing you want to
test is if window dot active X object
now this is only going to be true if
they're running Internet Explorer so
basically if this is true then it means
the user is running Internet Explorer so
what do we want to do now well what we
want to do is try to set this variable
I'm just go ahead and copy this set this
variable equal to new active X object
and is a parameter you go ahead and put
this in double quotation marks
Microsoft dot XML HTTP so basically this
is how you set this variable equal to an
object if the user has Internet Explorer
and if not then you can just go ahead
and catch all your errors and just go
ahead and set it equal to false and we
want to set equal to something just so
it returned something so to set this
equal to false so this of course if
they're running Internet Explorer and
they can't even set the variable equal
to something then they should probably
just go out and buy a new computer so
basically remember that I said that this
if block right here is testing or pretty
much setting this variable equal to the
object and this is the object that is
behind the heart of Ajax if they have
Internet Explorer else
and we need to else block because
hopefully this is the bit of code that
runs because hopefully they're on a
other browser hopefully Google Chrome so
let's just go ahead and copy this try
because I'm lazy so this is what happens
if they're on you know Firefox or Google
Chrome obviously we don't keep this
right here because this is only for
Internet Explorer what we want to do is
set this equal to a new XML HTTP request
and this is actually a built-in function
so we don't need to code this ourselves
this is how you should properly set this
variable but basically if they have
Internet Explorer this is how you set
the variable equal to the object if not
then this object is the one we want to
use and remember like I said this is
going to be set equal to the variable in
this line right here and this is the
object that's responsible for
communicating with PHP or communicating
with XML behind the scenes that the user
doesn't see so now go ahead out of your
if-else statement and what we want to
test is basically if if that will set
the false so how can we do that well we
can go ahead and say if not XML so
basically whenever you set variable
equal to this object it's going to
return true if it did it successfully if
not it's going to return false or if you
had one of these errors it's going to
return false so basically if you
couldn't set the object then we just go
ahead and get a an alert just to let the
user know that hey something's wrong and
we'll just say you know can't create a
that object Hoff's so hopefully they
never see that and else if you could do
it successfully then we just run a
return XML HTTP and why do we want to
return it because remember in this very
first line before we start coding that
function we set the variable equal to
this
object or excuse me this function right
here so of course this function needs a
return statement or else this variable
wouldn't be equal to anything so
basically that's the very first function
and you're going to have this function
in all of your Ajax programs so make
sure that you pretty much only have to
code this one time and I'm going to be
only coding this one time but for the
rest of these tutorials all of the Ajax
functions or excuse me all of the Ajax
programs are going to use this function
right here so congratulations
you probably did the most important
thing in Ajax now we can go ahead and
get to the good stuff which is you know
making everything work in the background
and communicating with a server so
thanks for watching don't forget
subscribe in in the next tutorial we're
going to be coding some more awesome
functions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
