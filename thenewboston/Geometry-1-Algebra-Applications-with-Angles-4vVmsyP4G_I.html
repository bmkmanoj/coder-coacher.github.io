geometry is going to deal with algebra
applications with angles so basically
today we're going to take your knowledge
of geometry and your knowledge of some
basic algebra skills we're going to put
them together so that we can
algebraically solve problems that deal
with geometry principles I know it
sounds like a lot but it's really not
that much so let's start off with some
examples so for example 1 we know that
this angle equals 2x and this angle
equals 80 degrees so the first thing we
have to notice about these two angles is
that their vertical angles and if you
remember vertical angles are congruent
so this is congruent so this angle is
congruent with this angle so if two
angles are congruent that means that
their measures are equal so to show that
their measures are equal we're going to
take 2x and set it equal to 80 now we
can use some basic algebra skills to
solve for X so if you divide both sides
by 2 you get X is equal to 40 degrees
now for Y or you can set up two kinds of
equations since we know that these two
angles together make up this line that
means that these two angles are
supplementary so these two angles sum
equals 180 so in order to show that
we're going to take 2x plus the measure
of Y and set it equal to 180 or you
could notice that these two angles are
supplementary and say y plus 80 equals
180 for this one it's going to take you
a little less time you can just subtract
80 over and get y equals 100 for this
one
you'd have to substitute our value of x
in
so 2 times 40 plus y equals 180
80 plus y equals 180 so y equals a
hundred degrees so now we're going to do
another one and we know that the measure
of angle B ad is 90 degrees so that
means that there's the sum of these two
angles because they're separated by this
Ray AC is going to be 90 degrees so to
show that we're going to take 4x plus x
equals 90 degrees now we can do that
because of the addition property of
angles in geometry we always have to
have a reason for why we're allowed to
do something so our reason for this
would be addition property of angles and
we won't always have to write out that
reason that's just good to know so that
when you look back over this you know
what we did so 4x plus X gives me 5x
equals 90 divide both sides by 5 and you
get X is equal to 18 degrees now I'm not
done quite yet because I found the value
of x and the value of this angle which
is 18 degrees but now I need to find the
value of this angle so I need to take 4x
and plug in 18 for X so 4 times 18 is
equal 72 if you want to check your
answer you can take 72 plus 18 and set
it equal to 90 degrees and if you add
these together you'll get 90
and since ninety does in fact equal
ninety these two answers are right so we
have a couple more examples we're going
to do so we have this these two angles
right here they both form a line so that
means that these two angles are
supplementary which means that their sum
is equal to 180 degrees so 4x minus 20
plus X is equal to 180 degrees 4x plus X
is 5x minus 20 is equal to 180 degrees
if you add 20 to both sides you get 5x
is equal to 200 degrees we're going to
divide both sides by 5 we get X is equal
to 40 degrees now I have to go back in
and plug this in to this equation
so 4 times 40 minus 24 times 40 is 160
minus 20 gives me a hundred and 40 and
if you want to go back and check 140
plus 40 and set it equal to 180 and 180
does in fact equal 180 so that's how we
know those answers are right so we have
one more problem we're going to do today
so we're told that angle LMK is a right
angle so this big angle right here is a
right angle since a right angle has a
measure of 90 degrees we know that this
big angle has to equal 90 degrees so
that means the sum of each one of these
little angles has to equal 90 degrees so
2x plus 20 we're going to add these two
equations together and set it equal to
90 degrees
2 X + 4 X is 6x 20 minus 2 is 18 equals
90 degrees if we subtract 18 over we get
6x is equal to so 6x is equal to 72
divided by 6 we get X is equal to 12 now
we can go back and we have to plug in
this to these two equations because
right now we only know what x equals we
want to know what each of them angles
equal so 4x minus 12 excuse me - 2 we're
going to plug our X in so 4 times 12
minus 2 4 times 12 is 48 minus 2 is 46
so the measure of this angle is 46
degrees 46 degrees now this angle we can
solve it one of two ways we can do the
same thing we did here and plug in X so
we get 2 times 12 plus 22 times 12 is 24
plus 20 gives me 44 or I could have
plugged it into this equation i plug in
46 for 4x minus 2 equals 90 and then 2 X
plus 20 plus 46 equals 90 I'd get 2 X 20
plus 46 gives me 66 equals 90 if I
subtract 66 over I'll again 2 X is equal
to 24 so X is equal to 12 so that's
another reason does another way to check
that my X is correct and I can plot or I
could have done the
and I could have taken 2x plus 66 or not
66 2x plus 20 plus 46 is equal to 90
minus the 46 over and I would have got
2x plus 20 is equal to 44 so you don't
always have to check your answers that
many times but it's good to practice
when when you start it out so that was
our first lesson in geometry not too bad
but make sure you come back and watch
our next lesson where we're going to
talk about symmetry of shapes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
