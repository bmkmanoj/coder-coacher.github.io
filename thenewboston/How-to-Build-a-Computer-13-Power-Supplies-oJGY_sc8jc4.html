your how to go to computer tutorial and
today we're going to be looking at our
power supply our last component for our
computer
you can't build computer without power
supply so that's where we're going to be
going over today now what the power
supply is is whenever you plug your
computer into the wall it plugs directly
into your power supply and this in turn
is gonna go through your motherboard and
also connect to all your components and
give you power
now the power supply is more commonly
referred to as the PSU and this stands
for a power supply unit that's just you
don't really need to know that but
that's just some fun information for you
the major thing that you want to look
for when buying a power supply is the
maximum amount of energy it gives off
and this is measured in watts anything
lower than 300 watts you really don't
want to be putting into your desktop
because it's embarrassing and it's going
to just fry everything and it's just
going to shut down and just don't do it
all right now anything over 500 for just
a basic use that's top and I'm gaming or
anything this is gonna be more than
enough to power all of your components
so anything from like three actually go
like that 400 to 500 you should be good
I'm gonna have 400 watts today so
another thing you want to look for when
choosing your power supply is the brand
name this is actually pretty important
because there are some cheapo power
supplies that as soon as you plug in
they're not reliable they're just going
to shut down and they're just gonna fry
and you really don't want to buy a
cheapo so make sure you're getting a
good brand name
it's a trusted tested reliable so the
last thing you want to look for when
choosing your power supply is the type
of power supply there are two major
types of power supplies out right now
you got your ATX and your atx12v the ATX
power supplies are the all power
supplies the power
the older motherboards the newer power
supplies is the atx12v so when choosing
your computer and choosing your
motherboard and power supply make sure
it has a 12v hookup and the difference
between ATX and ATX 12v is this your
power supply is going to be plugging
right in here to your main motherboard
connector the ATX power supply used to
have 20 pins on these connection
connector but the atx12v power spike it
has four extra pins for a total of 24
pins and these extra four pins are going
to be used to power your PCI Express
adapters and those are going to be
hooking up right here so make sure when
choosing the power supply just to be
safe always go with the atx12v and there
are some other differences between the
ATX and ATX 12v but this is the biggest
one now for our built today we went with
the silverstone which is the brand name
it's a really good brand name women that
atx12v which means we have those four
extra pins to power our PCI Express
cards and we also chose a 400 watt power
supply and this is going to be more than
suitable enough to power our computer
and if we ever decide to expand it's
gonna be just fine to do that too so now
that we got all our components ready we
are ready
finally to start building this computer
so make sure you're watching these
tutorials in hi-def and check out my
next tutorial and we can start building
this baby see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
