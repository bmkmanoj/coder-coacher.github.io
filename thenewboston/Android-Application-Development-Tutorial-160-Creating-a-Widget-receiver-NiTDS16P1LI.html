Android tutorial for the new Boston what
we're gonna do in this tutorial we're
basically gonna create a widget as you
see here you can move the switch it
around on your home page and you can
delete it and what's gonna happen is
when we I'll just delete this real quick
we're going to use a method when deletes
displays a toast for the most part of
this widget is pointless but you can
just add a widget by holding down on
your main screen and it pulls this up
here and we can pick like pointless
widget which is the one I created just
to get reference and then it creates
right when we create a widget opens an
activity that is basically gonna be your
configuration so we can type something
and hit OK sends that results in this
text this first textview is going to be
whatever that result is and then our
button is going to be disappeared or
buttons gonna you know open up activity
or some sort may be open up you know the
new boss in splash screen get our
activity going that way and also this
last textview it's going to just display
a random number every like half an hour
or however often our our widget updates
so as for now we just created it it's
not displaying a number and we might
actually disable this button and wait
for half an hour as well something like
that but that's pretty much what we're
gonna create just the pointless widget
for the most part so let's just get into
it the first thing that we're gonna do
we're gonna do is just set up our
classes so you guys can keep them open
for the next few tutorials if you choose
so what we're gonna do is we're going to
set up two classes one to basically be
our widget and handle of the widget
activities and methods and all that
stuff and then we're gonna create a new
class that's gonna be popped up when we
first create our widget on you know the
person's device so we can do some sort
of configuration the first class we're
gonna call it pointless widget because
it's pretty much pointless thoughts you
know whatever so we have that class
created we also need to create one new
class to be our configuration so we're
gonna say
widget config something like that and
those are going to be our two classes
that we're going to work with now we
have to define these classes in the
manifest and it's gonna be a little bit
different than what we have done
previously not much different but a
little bit so within our manifest here
within the application brackets we need
to set up both those classes one is
gonna be a receiver which is our widget
because basically it's a broadcast
receiver that's gonna receive updates
you know whenever we tell it to update
and all that good stuff so basically our
widget class is gonna be that receiver
and our other class is actually going to
be an activity but we need to configure
it so right when our you know
application starts it's going to open up
that activity so again the first one we
need to create is a receiver which is
different because before we worked with
activities and again we just need to
call the name so we're gonna say Android
name is equal to and then dot pointless
class or pointless widget and we also if
you choose to give it a label we're just
gonna copy the label from all of our
other classes and paste it and there we
go we're gonna open up some space for
this receiver and we're gonna add an
intent filter and basically we're just
going to give that some space as well
and what we're gonna do within this
intent filter is set up an action name
there's a few different names that we
can or there's a few different action
names that we can refer to when making a
widget but this one's gonna be our
update it's basically going to want to
be called when it when our widget
updates so we're just going to say
Android dot a p-- widget dot action dot
an all uppercase app widget underscore
update
and then we're just gonna close off our
action name and so now this class is
gonna be called every time our widget
updates and we're gonna set that update
probably in the next tutorial but once
again we just need to refer to this
action name we're also going to add some
metadata so we're just gonna say under
our we're intent filter closes off we're
gonna say metadata oops
and we're going to give this a name
Android name is equal to android dot up
wit again dot provider and we're also
going to relate some information about
the resource which we'll get into later
I just want to make sure we have
everything defined before we get into it
and we can kind of review this later
so our resource is going to be equal to
again whatever we set up the resource as
but we're gonna say at XML forward slash
widget stuff or whatever you guys want
to call that those other things had to
be you know spelled verbatim but this
one is a class or this is gonna be XML
file that we're gonna create called
widget stuff so we got remember to do
that and then just forward slash closed
off for metadata</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
