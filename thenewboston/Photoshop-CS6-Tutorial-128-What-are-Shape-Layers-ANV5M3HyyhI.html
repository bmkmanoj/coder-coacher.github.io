welcome to another Photoshop cs6
tutorial today we're going to be working
with shape layers and you can get those
from using the pen tool or you can use
the shape tool so go ahead and just open
up a new document doesn't it can be
anything and make sure it's like a blank
document so you can if you want to go
along and pick any of the one of these
tools rectangle tool is what i'm going
to use and then the next thing we're
going to do is change this to a
shapewear now the difference between a
shape layer and one and like if we use
like pixels or something like that is
that the shape layer when you make it it
goes on to its own layer and you have
the ability to add a fill you can add a
stroke and then you can add other things
like dallaire options like you can add a
drop shadow you can colorize it you can
bevel and a bunch of other things so
let's get on with this and show you what
you can do so let's start with this phil
here now this is going to fill the
inside of the circle where all this
white is so if i select a color it's
like blue maybe it's going to insert the
phil there now the stroke here is what
is around the outside and right now it's
red i could change that to a different
color i could change it to black and
what's going to determine the size of
the stroke is this right here and right
now it's at three point i can move it to
last to give it like a small stroke as
you can see there or i can make it
bigger that's way too big and get more
thick stroke so then we've got our type
of stroke here these are our stroke
options it could be a dotted line and
this looks better when it's smaller so i
can make these something like this like
if you want to make a coupon then you
can use this
then we've got smaller dots and then
we've got these corners here you can
round it off the corners or you can have
end caps on these you can see that made
them around this one will make a kid
them square and then this one will not
sure what the difference between that
one and this one is oh this one is it
goes out past so this one goes right to
the edge of a square and this one goes
past now we've got our a line here where
we can align it to the center of the of
the fill we can align it to the inside
or on the last one it can align outside
like this so let's go to more options
here and then we've got more advanced
options you can pick from these presets
and then you could actually make your
own and then save it so that's how you
make your own fails we've got our
dimensions here and this is for the size
of the object that you're making the
next thing we have up here are the
options is the options here for dealing
with multiple shapes so the first one we
can click on here is called path
operations if you ever forget what these
are you can just hold on the oh hold
your mouse button on and this will pop
up so we got path alignment and path
arrangement so we've got when you make
when you create a new a new shape right
now and set to new layer so if I created
a new shape make it red it's going to
create a new layer well oh yeah it goes
by this Phil right here so it goes by a
new layer now if i go to combine shapes
let's change the color here let's do it
too that's good none
let's create a new shape now it has
combined the shape Syria as you can see
and the phil goes around both of the
shapes now there's other options here we
could subtract from a shape make a hole
in one of the shapes if we wanted to and
then there's other that you can go over
and check out on your own so just go
ahead and mess with those they're pretty
easy to figure out then we've got here
we've got a line to the canvas or we've
got a line to selection now most of
these are most of these are grayed out
and up over these in the next tutorial
we talked about arranging she players
now if you want to you can go ahead and
select the pet selection tool and if you
have two shapes on your it on one layer
you can click one and you're able to
drag it out and you can drag these
around to interact and they can interact
with each other now I've got this one
that was cut in the knees so these
shapes can interact with each other if
you move them around and the fill and
strokes move around accordingly the next
one we've got here is the if you select
one of the shapes with the selection
tool you can bring that shape to the
front send it backwards it depend one
shape is overlapping another you can
bring it forward using these or send it
backwards so it's behind another shape
using that so if I select this shape
let's make it it's going to make them
both that so I actually have to end up
showing you that in the next tutorial as
well because these ones aren't set up
for it that way but um so then what
we've got next I wanted to show you the
fill options so if you click on Phil
excuse me if you click on Phil you have
the option to have no Phil you have the
option to use a solid color
we can use gradients and we can also use
patterns so you can keep that in mind
when you're making your shapes we've got
our options to add unload patterns and
gradients and all that other stuff as
well just like with anything else same
thing with the stroke here you can add
gradients and things like that to your
stroke or turn it off if you would like
by clicking on this with a line through
it that turns off the stroke and that's
all I wanted to go over with about the
shape layers for now for this tutorial
and then in the next tutorial we can
work on arranging the shape layers and
messing on them a bit more into a more
advanced ways so thanks a lot for
watching this one and be sure to watch
the next tutorial about arranging the
layers so you can get more of an
understanding have a good one everyone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
