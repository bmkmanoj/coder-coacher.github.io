60th objective-c tutorial and in this
story we're gonna be starting to work
with files now in the last 59 soils all
we did is pretty much build programs or
right from here random and they output
it stuff maybe they calculated some
things on the screen but we never really
actually created a new file or did
anything really interesting to alter our
computer system so that's where we're
going to be doing in this tutorial and
this is very crucial to all your
programming from now on and the thing is
that it can get really confusing because
there are a lot of very small subtleties
that you need to watch out for and also
there is a lot of information that we
need to cover just create one basic file
so uh you know if you have to pay
attention to any tutorial make sure it's
this one so the first thing that we want
to do is create a basic text file and we
want to do this manually so we have a
file it over work with later on that way
I wanted to copy around change the name
of it maybe so here's what we want to do
in your xcode toolbars excuse me the top
of the screen go ahead and click file
new file and what we want to do to
create a basic text file is go ahead and
click other on the left hand side and
click empty file right here now empty
file we can create a text file from go
ahead and click next and just name your
new empty file anything you want test
your file name is something that is
pretty obvious it's tester file now
check this out when we're working with a
file path and the file path is pretty
much the location right here we want to
put this new text file in the same
folder or directory that our program
runs in server saying alright this is
what we run in our program and this is
where we're creating everything not so
fast
Xcode set up your program kind of weird
that it put where the program runs in a
different folder so this is one thing
you have to watch out for go ahead and
click Choose and then in your build and
in your debug this is where your actual
program runs from you can see Buckey
tests right there so go ahead and click
Choose and now your tester file is in
that build debug it's in the same
directory where your program is running
from and that's what we wanted universe
saying all right
why do we need it in the same directory
well technically you don't need it in
the same directory but it's really
useful when you're trying to give your
computer program I mean you need to tell
it where the file is located so instead
of having to type out a whole long path
you can just type the file name and it
would just look in that directory first
so check this out they should be all in
the same directory maybe your tester
file may be up here but anyways now that
we have a tester file type in some book
my name is Bucky and I like kam now go
ahead and a file save this at the top
and now that we have a shape text file
with anything in it I mean it really
doesn't matter what contents are in this
as long there's something in it we can
go back to our Bucky main program
actually just click on source and now we
can go ahead and learn what we want to
learn and but before I even do that
check this out in our finder make sure
you go to your username mine's white
blue 1942 and your documents documents
bucky test build debug check this out we
have the tester file right here now go
ahead and just move this to the side of
the screen don't close it because
whenever we create files we can see them
popping up right in here and it's pretty
cool so anyways with all of that we can
finally begin typing some code in our
dumb program so the first thing we want
to do is we want to tell our computer
program where that file is so make a
string object NS string and just name
your object test or file I mean you can
name your object anything you want but
if you name your object the same thing
is your file name which was tester file
then it's really obvious like when
you're working with your files of the C
well object references what file so now
that we have pretty much the path of the
file and again here's what I was talking
about we usually would have to give us a
huge path like you
user user white balloon 1942 and then
you know that that that but since it's
in the same directory we can just
reference it from the same file name so
that's why I wanted to do that it makes
it a lot easier so after we're done
building the path which is pretty much
assuring object what we want to do is we
need to build something called a file
manager and this is from the class NS
file manager and you can name your thing
your file manager anything you want I'm
going to name my manager so it's really
easy to see what it is I like to name
everything really obvious so I don't get
confused what a file manager does is it
allows you to use the built in methods
that are made for working with files I
mean just like any other object pretty
simple so in order to actually create
your manager go ahead and put manager or
wherever you name your object and set it
equal to again not those these there we
go that's a little bit better an NS file
manager and you want to call a method
called default manager and what this
method is going to do is it's going to
make a manager for you a file manager
and it's going to store it in the object
manager so anyways what we have now is
pretty much this manager object and with
this manager object we can work with
files create files copy files rename
files if we want so with that being said
all I'm going to do in this tutorial is
check this path right here and make sure
that this file exists so go ahead and do
this make it if statement if and what
I'm going to do is call a method called
file exists at path using manager object
and remember since we have access to the
NS file manager class there's a method
in here called file exists at path and
all this does is it returns yes if it
does exist and no if the file does not
exist so the path we want to use is
actually this string right here so
go ahead and put tester file and what
it's going to do is this object is equal
to the path so when it asks for a path
we can just give the tester file and bam
check this out pretty simple so go ahead
and go ahead and set this equal to no so
if the file doesn't exist that means we
have an error in our program so what do
we want to do it the file doesn't exist
NS just log our message on your screen
anything you want but file does not
exist explanation please and return one
we're going to be making a bunch of
error messages and each error message is
going to have a different return value
so then if it returns like four we know
it's that error so go ahead and just
name this return one and build and run
this and see if we got anything
interesting perfect
it says program exited with status value
zero that's good that is exactly what we
want now check this out if you had a
thing called tesslar file you know 30
for this obviously is a file that
doesn't exist the only file that exists
is tester file right there so let's go
ahead and run this save and see what
would happen
file does not exist so that's what we
wanted our error message is working fine
so let's go ahead change this back run
it again make sure we get exited with
status value zero and we are good to go
for a next tutorial so this is how you
can build a basic file manager whatever
path you're working live pretty much
means whatever file you want to check
for and check if that file exists so
pretty simple stuff if just make sure
you follow all those little things I
told you those little tips and tricks
and in the next order we're going to be
doing actually some cool things that
files besides just testing if it exists
so thank you guys for watching I'm gonna
copy all this source code
put it in the forum links below so thank
you for watching don't forget subscribe
and I'll see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
