with a video tutorial for the new Boston
in this video we are looking at creating
something like the following in which a
user can be typing a comment for example
and add some text or or some kind of
element to this or element of text to
this text box while they're typing now
I've chosen to use emoticons or
emoticons depending how you pronounce it
but essentially what I've done is I've
created three emoticons which could be
images in this case I haven't used any
other images I've just used buttons but
you can go ahead and use images for that
and I'll explain a bit about that later
but essentially what we're doing is
we're allowing the user to type a
comment for example great staff and then
that we're allowing them to add an
emoticon and then begin typing again so
I really enjoyed it
so essentially what it is it's it's a
way for a user to quickly you know load
an emotion con into us into a text area
and this is found on things like forums
you know and any other sort of
commenting system where emoticons are
available now we're not going to be
looking at displaying them as images
inside the text area because obviously
we can't do that it is possible but
we're focusing on the main functionality
behind it inserting so in order to so
increase our skill in this area now it
looks quite simple but there's a few
things that I have included to make this
absolutely flawless in the sense that
first of all we focus back to the text
area as we type so if a user was to type
something here and then click this
emotion con they're focused back and
they're correct is just back here
otherwise if we didn't include this
functionality they'd have to click back
into the text area to start typing the
other thing that you notice is as I've
typed you can see a space appear here
and also a space appear here for the
user to continue typing something
afterwards however when we have nothing
in our text area and we click a smiley
you see that the spaces aren't a
to the front and or the prepended to the
front and appended to the to the end of
this so as long as we have some text in
the text area so something we don't need
to include a space after this last G but
when we click on a smile it
automatically creates a space for us as
long as we've typed something so we can
go ahead and start writing out the code
for this now as I said it's extremely
it's extremely basic with regards to the
overall concept but it can be applied to
a number of different areas and also
this functionality such as not adding
spaces is also gues quite useful and
we're going to be looking at one of the
jQuery utilities which is the trim which
trims whitespace from either side so
we'll take a look at this the in in our
text editor and we'll start to write out
the code okay so back over to our text
editor we're going to start to write out
the text the input field itself and then
also create each element of the emotion
buttons and it's important to note that
the way we're doing this it makes it
easy to add additional emoticons to
allow the user or whoever's modifying
the script or anything like that to just
add more content that will be placed
inside and we'll look at a demo at doing
that at the end of the tutorial when
we've completed it so the first thing we
want to do is go ahead and say something
like type a comment we'll wrap this
inside paragraph tags and what after
this we will break down and we'll use an
input no we're not going to do an input
type we're gonna use a text area text
area here okay so I'm going to give this
an ID and this is just going to be
comment so now on our page we just have
a text area now we need to go ahead and
style this so it's a bit larger so I'm
gonna go ahead and open style dot CSS
which is included on my page and I'm
just gonna reference that comment the
text area that we've just created and we
can go and give this a height and we'll
say the height 90 pixels and we'll give
this a width and we'll give it something
like three
the pixels so that's just enlarge the
text area just so we can type enough
content in there and it looks nicer
we'll then go ahead and close this
because we're not going to need style
dot CSS anymore okay so now let's go
ahead and create a another paragraph
down here with the emoticons so let's
say choose in Moe and we'll go or add
emoticons probably sounds better and
we'll go ahead and just bring this down
so it's a bit easier for us to deal with
and a bit easier for us to see okay so
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
create three buttons with three
different emoticons in them and they're
all going to be assigned at the same
class and for that reason it makes it a
lot easier to then go ahead and add more
buttons but give it the same class and
we're going to use jQuery to pick up the
value of the the tear the buttons so for
example what's displayed on the button
is exactly what's going to be placed
inside of the text area so I'm going to
go ahead and create three buttons or we
can create one duplicated down but it
doesn't really matter so I'm going to
create a button here and give it a value
of just a smiley face textual
representation of a smiley face and I'm
gonna assign a class to this and this
class is going to be emotion con in to
Konya okay so I said at the start of the
tutorial that you can use images as well
with this which would probably be better
in the case of emoticons now in this
case what you would go ahead and do is
you would just let's just do it above
here as you would create an image as you
usually would with a particular source
so it might be emot-- four slash smile
dot PNG but what you do is you'd go
ahead and you'd site assign an ID sorry
a class to this as well so you can
assign the class emotion calm because
that's what we are keeping us the global
class for this but you know also then
have to go and give this a value so we
can give it a value as well so jQuery is
going to pick up the value inside of
here based on this value attribute so
that's what you would do if you were to
go ahead and use
images but for now we're just using
these buttons</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
