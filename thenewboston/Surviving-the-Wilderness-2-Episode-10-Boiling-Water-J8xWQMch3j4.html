little more magnesium on it this time
and also I put the leave on bottom and
got more so whenever this one ignites
I'm just going to put the other ones on
top slowly
to the car
why are you not alright so now it's my
third time I put a crapload of magnesium
in here and this leaf is a lot drier
than the other one
this doesn't work I'm flipping out
freakin thirsty
can't get at the hit can't really aim
those things too well
come on there we go Gary
Gallery kidding me
right there
right there right there keep it going
this thing goes out
I want to smother
mom
anymore Stig's
all right
humor sticks
I don't get the leaves under there
well there's my first pot of water not
sure how long water takes to boil
whether it is the only thing I kind of
messed up on well first of all I grab
the water firm down in the rapids right
there because I think it's a little bit
fresher
if the water is moving because I know
pawns they sit still for too long
see this water isn't really moving I
think it kind of murky and stagnant so
that's why I grabbed it down there some
nice clean pretty much Aquafina Dasani
water and I filled it all the way to the
top because I figured I was going to
spill a little bit but uh whenever I was
putting it on the fire since it was so
the pot was so filled up with water I
accidentally spilled a little bit and it
put out part of my fire but it's going
good now and I don't know how to uh keep
it so like the ashes and crap don't blow
in it but I'll figure that out in due
time so now I just I just have to wait
for it to boil and then enjoy I hear
some boiling
pop up the hole</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
