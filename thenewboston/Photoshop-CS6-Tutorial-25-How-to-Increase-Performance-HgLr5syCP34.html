Photoshop cs6 tutorial on how to improve
the performance of Photoshop on your
computer
I'm your host buddy Blackford and let's
get started
so we're going to come up here into the
Preferences so let's go to edit and then
preferences and then we'll come down to
performance and this is where we can
start assigning different like
performance tasks so the first thing I
want to go over with you is this scratch
disks down here
now when Photoshop is working on
something with a lot of stuff it needs
to process it will use your RAM first
but after the RAM runs out then it'll
use these scratch disks to use the
distribute the workload and perform an
operation so it'll use a free space on
your on any available drive so any of
the available drives you have are called
scratch disks that that they will use so
it's best to divide the workload so I'm
going to go ahead and check my external
hard drive here and use that as a
scratch disk by assigning multiple
scratch disk drives you increase
photoshop's overall performance the next
section I want to go over is this memory
usage section here and the more RAM you
allocate the Photoshop the more
efficiently it's going to run and for a
basic guideline Photoshop is going to
require about five or six times the
working size of five or six times the
amount of RAM of the working size of
your document
and working sizes of a document is when
you have all the layers in there and you
keep on adding more layers once you add
another layer it's going to increase the
size of your document
that's the working size so it's good to
have as much RAM as you can allocate and
but make sure you leave a little bit for
other programs if you're using like two
programs at once like if you're going to
use like After Effects and Photoshop at
the same time then you may want to lower
the allocation of lower the available
RAM for Photoshop and up grew up the
available RAM for After Effects depends
on how you're using it so if you're
using Photoshop alone leave at least two
gigs of RAM for the like outside
programs so I'm going to up this here to
almost 12 gigs because I have 14 point 6
mega fourteen point six gigabytes
available so I'm going to go to 82% here
and that's going to be good for me on
the memory usage here now we've got our
history and cache here there are presets
here for documents that are certain
sizes so like a tone thin document and
like something that's tall like really
tall and not very wide and you get like
default and then you got something
that's big and flat which is like I
don't know like if you're working on
like a billboard or something like that
so that's what that is
your history states are the amount of on
dues you can have you can have up to a
thousand done dues but I mean no one
would ever really need that so you don't
have to worry about going to a thousand
I would hope but when you increase the
number of history states or undos it
increases the amount of RAM Photoshop
uses to manage your history so if you
lower that the amount of history states
then it will increase their performance
you have but you have to sacrifice the
amount of undos you can make so that's a
it's like a I can't remember the term
but it's like a
either like a win-lose kind of thing I
guess so
you got to manage that the way that you
work on your own if you make a lot of
mistakes you might want to increase the
history States so that's up to you so
the cash levels here are screen or
redraws and if you hover over top of
like the cash levels here down at the
bottom of the Preferences there's a
description and I'll read it to you real
quick number of cash levels of image
data used to improve screen redraw and
histogram speed choose more cache level
for bigger documents with few layers
choose fewer cached levels for smaller
documents with many layers changes will
take effect the next time you start
Photoshop so when you're working on
large documents more cache levels help
you speed up the function and make image
manipulation proceed faster but they are
in they work within your RAM so the more
cache levels you choose the less RAM
that you'll have available for other
photoshop functions so pretty much use
that kind of like it's kind of like the
trade off with the history states so
depends on what you're working on you
can change that for each like project
that you're working on now we've got the
cache tile size and that's the amount of
data Photoshop stores or processes at
once so use a large tile size for large
documents to speed up processing if
you're not sure what to use just use one
of these buttons up here so default is
good and then you've got up to 1028 K so
that's what I use just to
it says set cache levels to two or
higher for optimum GPU performance it'll
it'll give you a little information bar
there for you based upon your graphics
card and stuff like that
we've got our graphics processors
settings here it'll tell you what
graphics card you have here and then you
can use the graphics processor here for
helping like speed things up which is
pretty nice and if we go into the
Advanced Settings we've got our drawing
mode here we can check to use the
graphics processor to us accelerate
computation so if you have a good
graphics card it can help out a lot even
even like not even a good graphics card
can help out to open CL and into a lace
you want to have those checked to get
the most out of like your graphics card
and when you have this on advanced it
uses your graphics card to the fullest
extent it can normal is like in the
middle and basic is like the least
amount so it says if this mode seems to
perform less smoothly try switching to
normal or basic mode so if you're
getting like your Photoshop is like
freezing up or anything like that
lower lower this down to a different to
look normal
so that's a for increasing your
performance in Photoshop I hope you guys
learned how to use this correctly and
start like making some really cool stuff
in Photoshop really quickly now so I'll
see you guys later
in the next tutorial thumbs up if you
