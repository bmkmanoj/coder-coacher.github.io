Android tutorial for the new Boston what
we're gonna do in this tutorials we're
gonna use a seek bar to control the
volume right now it's not program so you
can still hear the volume but it's going
to be two tutorials and then we're gonna
basically wrap up our application add
some ads put it on the market place all
that good stuff so we're gonna kind of
go quickly but not too quickly all we're
gonna do is we're gonna create an XML
layout that has a seat bar and that's
under the form widgets and it's right
here seekbar throw that in and you know
add a ID to it I called it seat bar
volume and then we're gonna go create a
class called seekbar volume extends
activity we're gonna set up a seek bar
instance and a media player instance
nothing too new here well guess the seek
bar is but we just have to add a
reference to the XML for a seat bar we
have to set our content view to that XML
layout and within the oncreate method
that's where we're gonna start our Media
Player again I just referred to that
background music rar folder that are are
you know sound that we included in our
project and I started it I also added an
on pause method that releases the sound
so nothing nothing too new there I hope
you guys can set that up and how we're
gonna handle our volume is through
something called an audio manager so
we're gonna set that up above our class
I'm just gonna say Audio Manager a am
something like that and what we're gonna
do is in after we add our imports we're
going to set up our audio manager we're
gonna set this equal to
Audio Manager just the basic setup and
again we're gonna say get system contact
our system service and we're gonna refer
to context dot audio service so now we
can you know mess around with the audio
of our application and our activity and
all that good stuff so what we're going
to do now is we're going to set up
basically the current volume that the
person has on their device and also the
maximum volume so we're gonna say
these are gonna be int values so we're
gonna say int max V and we're gonna set
this equal to our audio manager dot get
stream max volume and we're just gonna
refer to the audio manager class we're
gonna say dot we're just gonna say
stream music so all that's doing is
creating an int value for basically the
maximum volume that you know the phone
can project so that's all that's doing
it looks a little bit complicated but
it's really not too bad so then we're
gonna set up the current volume sir just
and say current V and we're going to set
this equal to again our audio manager
dot get system volume or stream volume
instead of max volume and we're gonna
Seguin set this up to our audio manager
class dot
stream music as well and that's gonna
get the current volume and pass it in as
an int and also in this tutorial we're
gonna set up basically you know our
listener for seekbar so we're gonna say
seekbar which is the variable name that
we created and say dot set on seek bar
changed listener or change listener and
we're gonna say this and then we're
gonna allow our class to implement the
on seek bar change listener so there we
go and then we just have to add our own
implemented method and as you can see we
have three of them a progress change to
progress start track tracking touch and
a stop tracking touch which we'll get
into in the next tutorial again I just
want to make sure everything's set up
and I'll show you guys how we can use
our seat bar to handle basically our
volume so I'll catch you guys in the
next tutorial hope you have a good one
and see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
