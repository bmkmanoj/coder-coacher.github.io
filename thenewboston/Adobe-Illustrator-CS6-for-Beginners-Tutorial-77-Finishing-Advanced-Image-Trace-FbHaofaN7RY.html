illustration a six tutorial and we're
going on part three of the image trace
advanced options so last we left off on
corners where I showed you how much
corners how the corners slider affected
what was going on so the next thing I
want to show you is a noise slider and
what the noise slider does is a pretty
much reduces the noise the higher you
have it so the higher up the less noise
so if I wanted to bring this up to
something actually we'll leave it where
it is and I'll stop it real quick and
we'll just kind of take a look at the
image I'll zoom in a little bit on a
section and when you look in here you
can see things that are kind of I have a
bunch of dots around and they're highly
pixelated and noisy and that's what
noise is so to reduce that and get a
kind of more of a smooth look you would
increase the noise so I'm going to do
that and I'm going to increase it 7 to
85 ish percent I'm gonna let it do its
thing and I'm gonna pause this until
it's done and then show you what's going
on afterwards and try to show you the
difference so see you in a second and
I'm back now and I have the noise ply
and you can see that when you adjust the
noise you're going to get different
patterns within the object here because
it's been more blurred and the noise is
a little bit more less noticeable so
you're gonna get different patterns here
so that's what the noise does the next
thing we've got here is method and
there's two different methods here one
is called a budding or one is
overlapping and that's basically telling
you how the past connect and as you can
see on here on the little info pop-up
the abutting it creates cut out paths
and then overlapping stacks them on top
of each other so for example for maybe
this wing here the first color if we
headed on overlapping would be this the
darkest color and then they put another
layer of the light color on top of it
and then a lighter and so on until
they're overlapping it kind of looks it
would look like how it is now
so let's go ahead and take a look at
these right now take a good look at them
because this is the up budding section
and not really the outlines so that's
what it looks like and I do outlines
with the path there so you can see it
and then if I want to go to overlapping
let's try that and then that way oh it
is on overlapping so now I want to go to
a budding that's why so that was on
overlapping already now it's gonna go to
the abutting with the cut out paths and
we'll see what that looks like and now
once again I'm gonna end up pausing it
so you guys don't have to sit here in
silence watching this because I can't
think of enough stuff to say during
these things so I'm gonna pause it and
see you guys in a second see you later
hey everybody I am back and now our
method has been changed we changed it
from overlapping to a budding and let's
see how it looks let's go to tracing
result without lines and as you can see
there are a lot less outline or a lot
less outlines on here a lot less paths
that you have to deal with when you use
India Buttle and you can see that it's a
lot more crisp and clean it all depends
on what you like and what you like to
deal with and how you think it handles
the different colors so keep that in
mind when you're using the methods here
and then down here we've got create and
we've got fills and strokes and what
what is asking you to create is the
colored regions in here do you want them
to be fills which are basically using
the paint bucket and put it in colors or
do you want to use strokes which is you
paths that have a stroked color on it to
create the colors and then if you have
strokes selected then the next thing
that'll pop up for you is the stroke
here and you're able to specify a
maximum width that you can have for the
stroke pixels so if you set the maximum
width of ten and I wanted to fill this
little section in that my mouse is on it
would have a bunch of lines going up and
through throughout this they it would
have a stroke connected to them and that
stroke would provide the color all right
we've got a couple more things down here
called
options we've got snap curves two lines
so if you've got a lightly curved the
line it's gonna make it a straight line
and then ignore white so if you have
something that's colored white and you
image trace it it's just going to set
the fill to none here's our information
bar down here basically it's telling us
what what we have when we're traced so
we've got a hundred and ninety three
colors two hundred and twenty eight
paths and five thousand three hundred
and eighty nine anchor points so that's
that and then here's a preview button
check it on check it off to preview what
your tracing if you don't if you uncheck
it and you start messing with some of
this stuff it's not going to
automatically preview what you want to
do so if you have preview on as you can
see the preview automatically starts
going off and you have the render again
so if you want to work quick if you need
to change a bunch of settings check off
the preview if you're trying to change
one setting to hone it in then you might
want to keep the preview on so that's it
for all the image stretcher options here
in our next tutorial we're gonna learn
how to do more things with tracing
graphics and it'll help you out and your
projects that you might be working on
where you use image trace obviously so
thanks a lot for watching this give it a
thumbs up if you liked it and be sure to

good day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
