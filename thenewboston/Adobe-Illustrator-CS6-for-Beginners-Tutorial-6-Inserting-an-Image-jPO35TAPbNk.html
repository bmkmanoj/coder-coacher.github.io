illustration cs6 tutorial my name is
buddy Blackford today we're going to
learn how to insert images into a
document so you can use illustrators
place command to insert artwork into a
document and it can be a document that's
just brand new or it can have already
have existing paths or images in there
so you can place different images other
than vectors inside this using this
command so you can insert things like
vectors like I said you can insert PDFs
PSD S which are photoshop files as well
as regular image formats like jpg PNG
tiff etc you can even insert document
files like Microsoft Word so that's
pretty cool so let's go ahead and start
and I'll go over some of the things that
I find so go to file and place and then
go ahead and select your image that you
want to use or your artwork and for here
I have in I'll move this so we can see a
little better adobe illustrator artwork
16-point oh and that's a vector file now
we've got some options here that you can
select
we've got link which usually is what you
want to have selected it places a screen
version of the image and links the
document to the image file so it's kind
of like just like a tempura in there and
it's already in it's linked to the file
so if you change that file it's going to
change on your on your illustrator page
template here places a dimmed version of
the image on the template layer so it
says it's a new layer that'll put it on
and replace will replace the current
image so if you have something selected
it's going to replace it if you select
replace so I'm going to hit place and
we're going to get this here we've got
cropped to media bleed trim crop art
bounding
now with these different um
items that we got here I'll go over
these at some point with you guys and
for right now we're just going to select
media and if you want to preview it you
can check the preview button here if
it's not on already so you can see what
it is going to do and you can see that
we've got a large area a large box here
around the other box because that's how
the original file is set up so if I hit
OK it's going to put this in the onto
our on top of all the other images and I
can click and drag and move it if I
would like and anytime I want to move it
I could just go back on top of this and
move it I click on another set of image
I can move that individually I click on
this one I can move it like this you can
see that there's a difference when I
click on something that's already in
here all the paths are being shown using
my selection tool all the paths are
already being shown but when I click on
this one not really able to edit the
paths just with or see the paths with my
selection tool so if I go to my direct
selection tool you can see that it's not
going to work either the edges and the
anchors they're all up here so this is
just the the image now I can scale this
image if I want to and it's going to be
able to scale up and down without losing
any quality because it is a vector and
that's one of the good things about
vectors here so that's pretty cool I
think so there's how you place an image
in place images into your document and
let's see what else we got to do so
let's go ahead and delete this out and
then what
try placing again and we can see what
some of the other options might do I'll
check template place media and now you
can see that it has been great out it's
behind the layer if I close that if I
hide this you can see now that's behind
the layer and it's also great out now
since this is a template we're not able
to edit it anymore
so that's what's going on here we've got
our template layer here it is actually
locked and now if I click the unlock
button now I can move it around again
see there's the lock button here like
that and you don't want to be using
template for a finished product you want
to use the actual regular one for the
finished product the have check template
unchecked because this isn't your true
colors that you want so that's all I'm
gonna show with inserting images into
the document and I thank you for
watching this tutorial so hopefully you
guys keep on watching and enjoy the
tutorials have a good one everyone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
