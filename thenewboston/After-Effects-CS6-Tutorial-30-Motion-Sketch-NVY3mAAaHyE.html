another After Effects cs6 tutorial my
name is buddy Blackford and we're going
to be going over motion sketching today
so my computer just crashed
actually my After Effects crashed for no
reason at all I did was move my mouse
around so I got to open up the project
again and to quickly get to a project
that you just had you can go to open
recent projects and this is the one that
I had lab last I mean that's why saving
is good I have that's why I have the
autosave on for every five minutes if
something random like that just happens
on some of these programs are to just
crash all the time for no good reason
so let's go over motion sketching now
and basically what a motion sketch is is
you take your mouse cursor and you can
draw a path and it will animate the
position keyframes for you so first we
got to go to window and open up the
motion sketch window and it shows up
down here and this is the these are the
default settings we'll keep that there
for now I'm going to go into position
I'm going to turn this audio off I'm
going to show that off later and we can
click on start capture just to show you
what it does so click and hold and drag
and it will animate keyframes according
to how fast and slow you move your
cursor around and as you can see it
creates a buttload of keyframes there
and it's really hard to edit so in a
different tutorial I'll show you how to
fix that so let's uh I'm going to hit
ctrl Z so I can undo that sketch
actually I'll do a ramp you preview and
see what it looks like oh man that's
terrible
I don't think any client would ever want
that ever so let's delete all those and
I'll show you another motion sketch
trick you can hit background here check
that and then when you start to capture
in your next motion path it's going to
show the background now your motion
sketch pretty much goes until your comp
is over you can set it here by dragging
the this workspace bar here so I can
drag this one to make a new starting
point or if I go to the end and drag
this end the end duration there is
different it ends it'll end earlier so
I'll keep the background down I feel
like it's better to keep the background
on unless you got a whole bunch of stuff
but I mean you really probably would
want references so delete that and then
you can change the speed at which it
captures so if you if you're like fast
with your mouse or have your cursor set
to really fast or something you can set
the capture speed up higher or lower to
adjust for how fast your mouse is some
people have a slow cursor that like goes
like this across the screen and that's a
mean trick we play on our friends
sometimes at the studios
it's really annoying when you can't
barely move it even moves slower than
that and then you have the option to
smooth out ahead of time the motion
capture so let's uh let's add some
smoothing into it and I'll turn on my
audio now when you start your capture
the audio will play along with it so you
can move to the music move to the music
anyways you can move to the music and
make like audio based motion paths so
I'm back now after my computer randomly
basically froze it didn't crash this
time it just froze so let's uh go ahead
with the capture with the audio so gonna
start capture hold down the button here
so there we got this moving to the music
there that I picked not even close to me
on time so I also have the smoothing on
so it's going to be a little different
you can see not as many keyframes and
since I have the smoothing on I couldn't
get exactly with the time I didn't have
good timing with the music delete those
and now there's a setting in your
preferences for motion paths that you'll
want to check I'm going to go to edit
preferences and then go to the display
section and motion path is here and
right now it's only going to display no
more than 15 seconds so if you have
something that's longer than that you're
going to want to switch to all keyframes
there and that will help you go past 15
seconds so I just have it I'll just put
it on there for now I don't really use
the motion sketch all that much because
I'm not like too great at it so I
usually do most things by hand also if
you're creating a motion sketch and you
don't want to go the whole duration you
can just let go of the mouse button and
it'll stop that's about it for motion
sketching there is a way to smooth it
out because I mean having all those
keyframes there is going to be a pain to
to edit and but you don't want to have a
zillion keyframes though the least
amount of keyframes you can have the
better because there's less room for
mistakes and less room for
any like possible glitches or anything
like that so we'll see you on the next
tutorial while we're going to figure out
how to smooth out the motion sketch a
little better than using the smoothing
down here see you there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
