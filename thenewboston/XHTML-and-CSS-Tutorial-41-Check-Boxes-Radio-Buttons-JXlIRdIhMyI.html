tutorial and in this tutorial I'm going
to be teaching you guys about some
different types of inputs because you
know sometimes you just want to user to
enter a unique piece of information like
their name or the address but other
times you're going to want to have the
user select from like a preset list like
when they say pick what sex you are you
want to give them the choice of male or
female you don't want to have them enter
something weird so you're just going to
give them set choices so there are times
for them the input text and times for
them to select from a list so I'm going
to show you guys how to do that right
now and you make a list in one of two
different types of ways actually one of
three but we're going to be talking
about two in this tutorial for example
let's go ahead and take that male and
female example I was just talking about
and male female and in the male what
we're going to do first is we want to
give them two choices either male or
female we don't want to allow them to
select male and female because you know
not too many people are male and female
a few but not too many so the first
thing we need to do is first of all
we're going to do a different type of
input other than text we need to add
something called a radio button a radio
button is pretty much a bunch of buttons
but you can only select one of the
buttons so let's go ahead and I'll show
you how to do that right now
input type instead of text put radio and
I think this term comes from the older
radios where you had to press buttons on
them instead of you know digitalized or
whatever it's called in anyways aside
from that type you also need a name in
the name of this is going to be sex or
something and you need a name because if
you have a bunch of different radio
buttons and you have you know maybe a
group of buns for what sex you are in a
group of buns for your favorite food and
a group of buttons for what pain you
like it knows how to group them together
so group all your buttons under the same
name and the last one is what value you
want to give it and most of these um
most of these attributes you don't
really understand until you start
understanding you know
something like JavaScript or PHP or how
to you know computer programming where
you have to take this information and do
something with it but anyways you need a
value because later on whenever you're
programming this data in putting it into
a database or something you need to know
what these things are so if there's ever
something that doesn't quite make sense
that's because you don't understand
JavaScript yet or maybe you do and you
know then it will make sense so anyways
this is one button but let's go ahead
and add another button right here just
go ahead and paste that and give it a
different value all your buttons need to
have different values even though they
have the same name remember that same
type same name different values that's
how they differentiate each other so
let's go ahead and save that and see
what we got we now have two radio
buttons one right here and one right
here with the same name and since they
are the same name our browser knows that
they're in the same group so to group
them together and you can only let the
user select one so when they select this
the other one comes unselected when they
select this the other one comes
unselected so same that's pretty cool
now I understand radio buttons but what
if their comes across a scenario where I
want to let the user select more than
one thing for example if you're making
like a website selling selling meats
online yes meat like bacon and stuff
well you're going to want to allow the
user to select more than one thing so
for example let's go ahead and add a new
line break and let's go ahead and add a
paragraph
and insert messed that up okay now let's
go ahead and ask them a question like
select the foods wow I can't type today
that okay take a break
deep breath learn to type select the
foods that you would like to order an
explanation point because we really want
to rub it in their eyes alright so now
we're going to give them a huge list of
foods but we don't want to allow them to
only select one because how are we ever
going to grow our business if we can
only sit and sell one food at a time we
want to give them a huge list and give
them the option of either selecting none
all of them or you know somewhere in
between so in order to do that we need a
different type of input and this is
called a check box a check box is pretty
much a lot like radio buttons but you
can check as many as you can either one
all of them two three four however many
so it doesn't unselect them
automatically like a radio button so
let's go ahead and first add some food
bacon ham tuna and soda pop even though
soda pop isn't really a food Hey
for this website I'm selling it who the
heck cares so let's go ahead and for the
input type it is get out of the way
cursor for the type it's check box and
this is going to give you a little box
that you can check mmm how neat is that
and for the name let's name all of these
food so anyways all of these types will
be named food so food food food food
just like before the names the same the
only difference is the value is
different so for example this one is
going to have the value of bacon and let
me go ahead and that before I forget and
let's just go ahead and copy this four
times because I'm Way too lazy to type
all this out so this one is going to be
the exact same except this one's going
to have the value of ham this one's
going to have the value of tuna and this
one's going to have the value of soda
and now let's go ahead and save it and
see what we get now it says select the
foods that you would like to order well
instead of just having a radio button
where they can only select
now they can select one two three or
four so how cool is that so now we have
the different types of Lists where you
can either give them one choice or you
can give them many choices and also we
have our old trusty reliable textbox so
anyways now we learn a little more about
forms and are ready to move on to the
next type of input and probably I'm
going to be teaching you a different in
the last type of list which is a
drop-down list but I don't know yet
hey what do I look like a fortune teller
so anyways thank you guys for watching
this tutorial and I guess I'll see you
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
