Ajax tutorial chatroom video series
whatever you want to call it actually I
have been gone for about two weeks
haven't been making a lot of videos and
that is because I've been working on the
brand new video series how to pick up
girls
in it has been crazy filming everything
and going to different colleges and
picking up girls so that's my next video
series I'm gonna come out with but
before I do that
and before I edit all everything I want
to finish this so still got whooping
cough um you know other than that let's
just go ahead and get started so in this
tutorial I said we're gonna style this
little part we already did all of this
now we just have to do the username the
pretty much this form down here so let's
go ahead and work on this username
section first so we're gonna stick
everything in a div so div you and did
this and we scroll down so you guys can
see a little bit better so first let's
go ahead and make this input for the
username itself so of course input and
I'll just in that right now so the type
equals text because we're typing text
into it now the ID of this I'm just
gonna go ahead and call it username
pretty creative naming conventions right
there now the max length I'm just gonna
set this equal to ten and also might as
well set the size equal to ten as well
seems you know like the reasonable thing
to do hmm excuse me chemical and now I
want to mention one thing I'm gonna add
this on blur now you guys may see the
thing on click a lot if you work with
JavaScript or if you just touched on it
for now on click is a JavaScript
attribute which basically means whenever
you click an element you call a
javascript function well on blur is a
little bit different well um blur means
whenever you lose focus then you're
going to call a javascript function and
we're gonna make a function called check
user name so that's where we're doing
onblur so let me go ahead and give you
guys an example of this if I called
myself Emily and you see how my cursor
is in there right now as soon as I click
anywhere else
that's when the onblur function gets
called so right now typing stuff boom
the aam blur function gets called right
there so that's what onblur is again
whenever the element loses focus
let me just rearrange some crap on my
window right here all right want to make
sure you guys can see what's going on
now the next part I'm gonna do is this
text area right here so we already did
the username simple enough so actually
if I just copy this it might be a little
bit easier and a little bit lazier for
me so of course it's text though now the
ID of this I'm gonna call message box
and now the max link for this I'm gonna
go ahead and put 2,000 now if you guys
don't know there's between max length
max length is how many characters you
can type in is in the size of it is
pretty much the visual size how big is
it on your computer screen so the size
is 50 now onblur we do not need that for
this instead we're going to use a
different attribute called on key down
now this is another attribute and what
this does is whenever the user presses a
key it's look did my voices crack I'm
like frickin 30 years old I'm not that
old I'm 26 and my voice still cracks
that's embarrassing as embarrassing crap
that's going on shouldn't even admit it
she just edited the freaking thing out
but no Here I am talking
anyways Anki down basically means
whenever the user presses down a key on
their keyboard
boom this is called so what we're gonna
call is we're gonna build handle key and
the parameter we pass it in is of course
the event which is basically the event
itself alright so that looks pretty good
now we only have to do two more things
so we got this taken care of we have
this taken care of now we need the send
button in the delete all button and
these are incredibly simple therefore
this little thing is popping up on my
computer screen right now so restart in
four hours and or actually postpone that
crap I'll make sure I don't actually
delete my store oh alright so anyways
windows thank you for interrupting me so
the input for the let's go ahead and
make the send button first is type
equals button and value equals send and
this is of course the button that's
going to send your message so we're
gonna give it an onclick attribute so
basically whenever you click this button
it's going to call a JavaScript function
send massage there we go now if we just
copy this I think you guys can see
what's going on from here this is button
still and the text on the button is just
going to be delete all in what this is
going to do is basically delete anything
that you have in your text area pretty
simple so on click what we're gonna want
to do is just call delete all messages
great like that and actually what it's
going to do as well it's not only well I
don't know we can make it to clear this
as well but it's going to clear all of
these messages so whenever I showed you
guys the little functions in PHP to
delete all the messages from the table
that's what this is going to do and
maybe like I said will throw some
functionality to clear this message as
well we can even add another separate
button but for now just remember that
it's going to clear basically all the
messages in the chatroom so now look at
this boom save this file because boom
roasted we are done with it incur
gratulations we have one more file to go
so that's the good news the bad news is
it's a very long and
not confusing file because I'm gonna
break it up to break things down real
simple for you guys but it's gonna take
a few tutorials but once you understand
it then you guys have now understood how
to build an awesome freaking Ajax
chatroom so thank you guys for watching
