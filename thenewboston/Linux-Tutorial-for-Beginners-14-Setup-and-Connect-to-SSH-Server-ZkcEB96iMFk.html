this video I am going to show you how to
set up and connect to a server somewhere
else in the world so if you ever want to
host the website and you want to buy a
server online and connect with then you
need to follow along because this is how
you do it and I'm going to show you guys
a technique called SSH and how to set up
SSH keys and these are a lot better and
a lot safer than using just a regular
plaintext password because passwords if
you use that to log into your server
they can be cracked
I mean someone can guess them and hack
into your server well with SSH and I'll
show you guys exactly how to set it up
it's pretty much impossible to crack so
a nice safe connection first thing we
need however is a computer somewhere
else in the world now there are a bunch
of different websites
my favorite is digitalocean they're
super cheap and I hate sounding like I'm
a Salesman or something but I posted an
affiliate link below and I never post
affiliate links because I just think
they're like kind of cheesy I never
posted one before but um I noticed that
with digitalocean whenever you post it
then you guys if you decide to sign up
you get 10 bucks off so if you want
click on the link below this video and
you get 10 bucks off if you want to play
around if you know of another cheaper
site then leave the comments below -
boom roasted but sign up for this and
once you create your account you're
going to be logged in to this page so
this is like your main account page I
already have a server set up in
digitalocean
they just call their servers droplets so
what we're going to do is we're going to
create a droplet right now and this
means just create a server so they're
going to create a server and we need to
give a couple settings the first one is
what do you want it to be named now this
isn't the name of your website so for
example if I was setting this up to host
my website the new Boston com I don't
need to type the new Boston Common here
I can type whatever I want just so you
can identify it if you have multiple
droplets or server setup so I'm just
going to name it like a
the milk road because why not I think it
sounds pretty cool and now you can
select your size a bit I'm just going to
set up a cheapo five-dollar one right
now if you're actually hosting a website
then you would probably want to go with
either 20 or 40 because on an actual
server you're going to be running 64-bit
processes and they take up a little bit
more memory so for this example you know
I don't want to splooge so I'm just
going to test it out and now it's saying
where do you want us to set up your
server so they have a bunch of different
locations all around the world I am just
going to use New York because I live in
New York and I'll give me the fastest
connection now since we can actually fly
over and start installing your own
software I mean that's kind of the point
whenever we scroll down here we're going
to see select image this just means what
software do you want us to install on
your server by default so a lot of time
when I do it manually I like to just
install plain old abouttwo with nothing
else and I installed Linux Apache MySQL
and PHP myself however like I said this
tutorial we're just learning the basics
so I'm going to click applications and
click lamp on 14.04
this means whenever they set up my
server it's already going to come with
Linux Apache MySQL PHP already installed
on ubuntu 14.04 and you know it's kind
of the lazy way doing it oh whatever
alright so scroll down here and since we
didn't even learn about SSH keys yet we
won't add any of those and hit create
droplet now the cool thing about this is
they usually only take like 60 seconds
to create so it's going to create my
entire web server install all that crap
on it in like a minute I don't know how
they do that actually but it's freaking
awesome alright so in about 60 seconds I
just got this email literally right now
zero minutes ago all right so this is
the default login credentials that I
need to connect to that server so this
is the IP address we only have one user
on it right now they set up route
default and this is their password and
of course whenever we login we probably
want to change that so go ahead and copy
this IP address first let's figure out
how to connect with so right now like I
said I'm just on my own computer send at
home just had a bowl of ice cream and my
servers over in New York City or you
know wherever they're set up in New York
so I'm going to write SSH and after this
you type the name or the username you
want to connect to so I want to log in
as root it's the only user we have right
now and then write an @ sign so then if
you hold down shift and paste you can
paste in your IP address that have one
in it they copy the whole thing yep that
is it all right so I want to connect to
this computer as the user root now I'm
going to hit enter and the very first
time we connect is going to say um you
never connected this computer before do
you trust it yes I trust that it's
authentic and of course it's going to
ask you for roots password to make sure
that you are authorized to log in so
copy that paste it using shift insert
and hit enter so it's going to log in
now the way that digitalocean and most
companies set it up is whenever you log
in to root for the very first time they
make you change your password and that's
just so if anyone ever hacks into your
email they can't see the default
password in plain text then you have a
new one security feature so it first
asks for the current password so paste
the current password in again that they
gave you and then we can choose our new
password so it's write whatever you want
write it twice and boom you're good to
go so now we are connected and check
this out so if I just write like um LS
or write PWD um you know let me see the
LS look at this so all of these files
they're not on my own computer this is
actually the server in New York City
that we're connected to and if we ever
close out and log back in again then we
can log in using
our new password pretty sweet so that's
the basics of how to set up a server and
connect to it somewhere else in the
world and in the next video since I'm
getting kind of long on time I'll show
you guys how to set up SSH and teach you
guys everything you need to know about
it it's going to be sweet see you guys
