show you the lesson text to write really
intuitive nesting rules so say that for
example I wanted to make a left
navigation menu on my website now inside
this menu I was gonna have a bunch of
links and I wanted to style those links
differently than the rest of the main
content so I know you guys are thinking
alright couldn't I have to like write a
bunch of classes or maybe I'll just like
make a bunch of child elements inside
the nav and I'm probably gonna have to
add a huge long comment for the
designers by K these links are different
than regular links can be kind of a pain
in the butt right well with less syntax
it makes it incredibly easy so say that
the main area on the left hand side
we're gonna give it an ID of like side
nav now inside here directly inside what
you can do is you can actually embed
other properties so for the main site
navigation the main area will just give
the entire thing a background of like
333 which is like kind of dark grey it's
actually kind of this color right here
this main area now inside here we can
actually stick a property like our link
styling now what we're saying is we're
gonna style these links will only apply
the style to the links inside the site
navigation so it's pretty much exactly
like your brain thinks of it and not
some you know weird generic CSS syntax
that's hard to understand so since this
is a dark area on the left hand side
we'll just give it like a color of white
and let me just add some other things so
since they are not links that you want
to put in line stack on top of each
other we're gonna display those as
blocks and also add a padding so they
don't just look like a list and actual
you know navigation menu items so put a
padding of like 8 pixels now you can
actually have more than
here so say for example I wanted this to
change whenever the user hover hovered
over these links I want to change the
background to like some lighter gray
color how much easier is this to
understand than this right here like
okay hopefully that doesn't get jumbled
up with anything else gonna have to add
a bunch of comments so you know the
developers don't do anything weird to it
look how easy that is the understand all
nice and organized for you now let me
just show you guys that this actually
works so for the div remember we gave
this the ID of sine F and now let me
just put a bunch of links in here so
link make sure it's a dead link and I'll
just put like a home what pages would be
on my website home about and bacon best
website ever now actually want to
include one other thing down here just
so I can stick a look at it and show you
that they do get different styling so
wow I love wow I love the new Boston it
makes me feel complete alright so check
this out
boom and this is because I apparently
want to be better should be alright so
check it out so we're saying only style
the links inside this side nav which is
you know it's not on the side I don't
really feel like actually floating it to
the left and making a nice layout but
check it out these links right here use
the same basic generic styling and we
can really intuitively see that whenever
we stick anything inside this side nav
that this is how it's going to be styled
but only apply the styling
two elements inside this side
NAB div right here so pretty cool takes
care of all of it behind the scenes for
you really intuitive really awesome
ladies and gentlemen that is nested
rules in less</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
