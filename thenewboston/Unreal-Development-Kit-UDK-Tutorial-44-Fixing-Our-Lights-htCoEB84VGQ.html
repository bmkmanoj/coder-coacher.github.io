44th udk tutorial and in this story one
can be doing is I'm going to be covering
one of the things that I didn't have
time to cover in the last oriole and
that's this so let me go ahead and hit
play from here and I'll show you guys
what I'm talking about but before I do
if you guys notice that you can now hear
my computer sound check it out hear me
shooting around and also my footsteps
it's because I got a new screen
recording program and that's because in
these upcoming tutorials I'm going to be
working with sound so I needed my other
screen recording program wouldn't record
my computer sound so if this video looks
a little different that's why so you
guys can hopefully hear my sound even
though it's incredibly loud I should
probably fix that turn it down a bit but
hey i'm too lazy to do that so check it
out in the last tutorial I taught you
guys how to use a light switch aka a
trigger and whenever you touch it it
turns the light on but now check it out
whenever we back away from it the light
stays on hmm that's no good let's try
bumping into it again mmm no that's not
working okay so we definitely need to
fix that so that's what I'm going to be
teaching guys to do in this tutorial so
go ahead and oh I think I got kennel
cough go ahead and X out of that an open
unreal kismet by of course hitting this
little k with the arrow and move this
over till it's entered and we actually
need to change a couple properties in
kismet the very first property is we
need to change one of the properties on
this touch event so go ahead and select
your touch event and whenever you do
this properties panel is going to pop
open in the bottom left and by the way
if you're not seeing the properties you
want to see you right here it's because
you don't have the right thing selected
this window right here changes based on
what you have selected so if you have
this event selected the properties for
this event is going to pop if you have
an action selected then you see the
properties for the action if you have a
variable selected then so on and so
forth but anyways we want to change your
property of this event so go ahead and
select the event and actually the
property move on change is in this
sequence event
now what we're looking for is this right
here max trigger count now I know I call
that thing a light switch a lot but it's
actually called a trigger and one of the
properties it has is how many times can
you use it now by default this is pretty
dumb but by default it's set at one
right in it right here and you see if
you hover over it a little box pops up
that says oh it went away how many times
can this event be activated 0 for
infinite so by default we can only use
it one time basically whenever we hit
our trigger one time the light switch is
on and then that trigger breaks we can't
use it ever again so we have no way of
turning those lights on or off ever
again so for infinite it said hit zero
so now that we hit zero we can now turn
on an infinite number of times you can
turn on off on off on off until our
fingers bleed so go ahead and change max
trigger count 20 and now that trigger
can be used an unlimited number of times
but let's go ahead and examine this a
little bit closer so if we've read our
program it says alright whenever we
touch our trigger which basically means
whenever we bump into our trigger the
lights are going to turn on but what is
telling our lights that whenever we walk
away we want them to turn off well
here's the thing that says turn off and
nothing's happening so basically our own
our lights which basically only works
one way it only turns our lights on so
in order for our lights to turn off we
need to say all right whenever you
untouch that trigger turn your lights
off and i know this language is a little
bit weird because in real life you never
tell anyone to untouch something you're
either like all right turn my lights on
or off you're never like hey Tony
untouch my face you know you don't say
that you said get your hands off my face
by anyways in the UDK they use this
language touched in untouched and it
pretty much means are you touching the
trigger or are you not touching the
trigger so that may help help clear
things up a little bit so it is in this
is hora what we did is we change that
max trigger count 20 this means our
lights which were work
until the end of time we can turn on and
off a million times if we want to when
we also told our udk or kismet or
whatever whenever we aren't touching
that light switch to turn the lights off
so now when every bump into the trigger
is going to turn on whenever we'll be
back away it's going to turn off oh you
don't believe me do you well let me just
go ahead and play from here now freak
with you guys so go ahead and touch this
light switch and keep your eye on that
stack mesh right there our lights pop on
now back up they turn off do it again on
off on and off run it through on off on
off I can do this all day guys you think
I want i'm gonna i'm about to record a
three-hour video of me doing this now
i'm just kidding so anyways i just want
to tell you guys that we now can use our
trigger an unlimited number of times and
also unlike before when we could only
turn our lights on we can now turn them
off by untouched the trigger so for now
that's all you guys get in the next
tutorial what i'm going to be teaching
you guys how to do is use the sound in
conjunction with kismet and it's
probably the coolest tutorial yet
because we are finally incorporating
sound into kismet it's awesome so
anyways thank you guys for watching
don't forget subscribe and I guess I'll
see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
