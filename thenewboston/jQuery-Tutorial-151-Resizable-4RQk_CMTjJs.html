it will snap to each grid part so it's
it looks it's snapping almost let's just
go ahead and turn these two off and
let's just increase these size to 50 by
50 okay so you can see that the element
is now snapping to this grid it's 50 by
50 grid that it's snapping too so it
just it will just snap in the X and Y
axis now we do have a problem here that
we have this absolutely tiny now and you
can go ahead and fix that with the
minimum width and the minimum height
option which we're gonna be taking a
look at a bit later now let's just say
you had this object and you wanted to
only allow resizing with on a particular
angle of this so you wanted this to be a
handle here and this to be a handle but
you didn't want these two here to be
handles which at the moment can't
because they are at the end of the
document so let's just say I only wanted
this right hand side to be draggable and
I didn't want it to be able to resize
downwards we're gonna go ahead and look
at the handle option now so let's go so
it's the handles option and in here you
can specify a comma-separated list of
values all being their direction so for
example you could have n for north he
for east
s for south and w for west and you can
specify these comma-separated so you can
choose where you want it to be draggable
from so for example if i was just to say
east that would be the very right hand
side here you'll also notice that the
small resizing triangle has gone as well
that's because we've now specified the
handles that this can be resized from
and can no longer be resized from here
so for example if I was to hover over
this bottom one you can see that I can
no longer resize this here or at the
corner as well however I can go
and resize from the east now if I wanted
for example it to be resizable from the
east and the southeast which will be
this corner here I can go ahead and come
a separate se now this will allow me to
separate from the East and the and the
south east as well here so you can see
that the little triangle is back because
we can now resize from the corner we can
resize downwards like this however
obviously we can't grab it by this edge
so this is a comma-separated list of
values the values that are available to
use are obviously north east south and
west you can have north east south sorry
south east south west blah blah blah and
so on so you can you can define you know
the options that you choose now you can
also just go ahead and specify it all
here and we'll all will do is it will
allow it to be dragged from all angles
again now you'll notice that this time
instead of not if we didn't include this
option for example let's just try that
you can see that I can't actually drag
it from this corner so you can see that
I can't actually drag from the West or
the north here so to handle this I guess
if you'll excuse the pun you can set all
here so when we refresh we can actually
resize in words like this and we can
resize it anywhere on the page that we
like because we've specified all handles
available so we can do it from all
corners and all edges of this div so
that's the handles which is an extremely
powerful functionality tall or option
when it comes to this now let's finally
take a look at the max options so the
options that we actually have our max
height which we can set a max height so
for example at the moment we are at a
hundred pixels by default so that's a
max 200 sorry not px and we'll comma
separate and say mac or min height as
well so the
mmm hi I want it to be as 100 and let's
go ahead and specify a max width and
we'll set this to 200 and also a minimum
width as well set this to 100 so
essentially what we're doing is we're
setting the minimum height and the
minimum width to their original values
100 obviously these can be any value you
want to set them and the maximum height
will be 200 so let's go ahead and
refresh you can see that when I drag
inwards it doesn't work the minimum
width and the minimum height are now 100
so this won't work dragging it in when I
drag it out you can see it will it ends
at the 200px margin so now that I've
specified a minimum width and a minimum
height it's constrained to these
particular this particular region so
we've taken a look now all the options
that I felt were useful to practical
applications there are a variety of
other options which you can go and take
a look at in the jQuery documentation
there are also events associated with
this so for example whilst I'm resizing
an event could take place so we could
for example as the box is being resized
or as the element is being resized I
could go ahead and feed back inside of
here or under here the actual size of
the box says that there's a variety of
things you can do with this however
these are the practical applications of
the practical options that you can use
within this interaction in jQuery UI so
my recommendation would be to go ahead
and play around with things such as as
you're resizing maybe going and putting
the coordinates or the size of the box
inside of this div while you're resizing
it so yep that's all the options that I
felt necessary like I said go and take a
look at the events and play around with
this it's an extremely powerful and
option filled interaction</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
