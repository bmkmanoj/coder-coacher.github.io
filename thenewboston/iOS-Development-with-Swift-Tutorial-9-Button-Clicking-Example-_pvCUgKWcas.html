we need to add a label right above these
buttons so I'm going to type in label
over here because I'm too lazy to search
for it and drag it anywhere up here and
you can leave the text label by default
but I'm just going to double click it
and hit like defaults text now again
what's going to happen is whenever we
click one of these buttons we are going
to through the code change the text on
this but the first time it pops up we'll
just have the default text so it will
display that just so the user knows
where it is and now what we need to do
is we need to form a connection between
this text and this file right here
because remember in this method we're
going to say okay change the text of
this item so unless we can reference it
somehow um you know this is kind of
going to be lost because right now they
are kind of disconnected because even
though that these are hooked up through
actions it can't reference it anyway
right now so I know what you're thinking
okay let me click this hold down control
drag in a release and I'll just choose
action because you know a connection is
connection all right well huh action
isn't right there and the reason for
that is because remember I said that the
action resembles pretty much just think
of it like this in action that the user
can do something that the user can do to
your screen however this is just a
static text label it wasn't meant for
tapping or swiping or anything like that
it's just an item that appears on your
squit on your screen so the type of
connection that we need is an outlet now
outlet is pretty much just a reference
to this item and once we have a
reference to it inside our code we can
do things like change the text but again
an outlet is just a reference to an item
an action is some method that the user
calls whenever they interact with
something interactive like a button and
if you guys kind of get confused by now
don't worry in like
or else it would just be like second
nature so now what is the object name or
the variable name that you want to refer
to this and I'll just say like a Bucky's
label and of course everything else is
good hit connect and it makes that
object right like that now just real
quick let me explain what all these
stupid key words mean because a lot of
these are specific to Swift again
anytime you'll have an outlet or just a
static reference to some item you use
iboutlet that means interface builder
outlet week says that again what I'm
going to do and what I set it to do a
couple tutorials ago is instead of
teaching guys the entire Swift language
and then going on in the same tutorial
series and showing you guys i OS
development I'm going to teach Swift in
an entirely new tutorial series because
it's probably going to take like 50
videos to like get really good at it but
for right now if you're familiar with
any other programming language or if
you're coming from objective-c I'll talk
to you guys through the weird things
again I'm assuming that you guys already
like Noah classes and what an import
statement does but just the little
nuances of Swift I'll talk you guys
through so week again this is like the
two second tutorial it pretty much says
that we can break this connection to the
button whenever we don't need it anymore
so you know that's that in this
exclamation mark at the end you guys
probably noticed that all right that's
kind of weird I didn't see that in any
other programming language that just
says that this object it has some value
so it's not know so whenever we run this
code and build it later on we're saying
hey compiler you don't have to check if
this is empty or it's um you know nil or
anything because it just saves you a
little bit of time so I know they're
kind of weird syntax but you know that's
that now another thing I want to point
out if you're new to Swift is whenever
you're writing Swift
you don't need semicolons at the end
statements so it's kind of like Python
if you're familiar with that so if you
see me leaving out semicolons um I'm
doing it on purpose you don't need them
in their recommended to not have however
this is kind of the weird thing you can
have them if you want so it's a optional
but um in the just so I can keep up with
standard programming practice I'm not
going to include them alright so now
that I got all that taken care of this
of course is the entire class that
controls that this is a reference to
this text element to this label and this
is the method that gets called whenever
we click one of these buttons so what
I'm actually going to do is this we see
that we have this parameter pass then on
this method called sender now this is
pretty much passing in a button that
called the action so the sender is the
object that called or kicked off this
method so whenever we click bacon the
center is going to be bacon and whenever
we click tuna the center is going to be
tuna now just to make this tutorial
pretty cool what I'm going to do is I'm
going to get the text either bacon or
tuna and I'll change the text to
dependent on what button we click so
that'll be a little bit more interesting
so let me just add a comment so you guys
don't forget I'll say the sender is the
object that called this method which
will be a button so what I'm going to do
is I first need to store that text which
will be the title either bacon or tuna
in a variable so I'm going to hit let
title and I'll talk you guys through the
Swift syntax in just a second sender
which will be that button title for
state just going to hit tab title for
state and in here I'm going to write dot
normal
all right so first of all let me mention
this whenever you make variables in
Swift what you do is you use the keyword
var to declare it and then you can write
something like a Bucky equals 22
and later on if you ever want to change
it you can set Bucky equal to something
like 2 whatever
that's variables for oh we already know
that now why did I use let right here
what let means is it's a constant so in
Swift use var for variables or in other
words values that you can change and let
means a constant so if you ever try to
do something like this
let Bucky equal 22 and then you change
it later on is saying uh-uh you told me
this value was constant meaning you're
not going to change it so why did I use
let right here well this title we're not
going to change the text on this so it's
better to use a constant for that all
right pretty cool so now they own the
other thing that we have to do Oh
probably should mention this title for
state normal believe it or not there are
different titles that you can have on
different states so the states of your
button include like regular which is
normal which it is right now you can
also have whenever the buttons like held
down that's a different state so I know
it's kind of confusing that there you
can have like different titles on the
same button but that's what that is just
pretty much mean when the buttons normal
which is always going to be in this
example just get the title of it and
then store that title which is a string
in the constant title alright so that's
a lot of explaining for you know a
couple lines of code but now you guys
understand so now what I want to do is
just one more line of code to change the
text on this label so the first thing we
have to do is reference it buckey's
label and the property is text simple
enough so now I'm just going to write
something like
you click the title button now what
we're doing right here is we're just
interpolating title sticking it in right
there so it says eventually if we click
bacon it's going to say you clicked the
bacon button and if we click tuna it's
going to say you clicked the tuna button
pretty sweet looks like everything
should work good right now so let me go
ahead and change this to iPhone 5 and
run this bad boy all right open up your
stimulator and
I'm going to cook bacon you click and
the reason that it's doing this is
because I need to resize this so we have
enough room let me make sure that we
definitely have enough room all right so
that looks good and another thing that I
want to mention is this whenever you
just want to stop this it kind of
resembles just stopping this app you can
click this stop on and it just stops it
in other words exits out of it or if you
want to get rid of it you can just close
I owe a simulator quasi OS simulator
kind of a cheese achieves the same thing
so now let me run this again hopefully
you'll have enough room all right so I'm
going to click bacon you click the bacon
button tuna you click the tuna button
bacon tuna tuna bacon bacon tuna tuna
bacon bacon bacon a day doing this a
hundred times
love my bacon to a nap alright so that
is the basics of interacting with the
user again there's a lot more to cover
but that was probably to be honest the
hardest tutorial is just getting in
getting our feet wet and another thing I
want to mention is this if you guys want
any of the source code not only from
this tutorial but what I'm going to do
is I'm going to take the source code
from all of my tutorials and I'm going
to be putting it on my for
so some people just like to sit back and
watch your videos and then just go get
the source code some people like to type
and follow along either way it's all
going to be there for you for free so
yeah thank you guys for watching don't
forget to subscribe and I'll see you
guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
