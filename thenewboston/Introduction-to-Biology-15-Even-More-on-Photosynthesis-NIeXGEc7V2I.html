this video i am going to be covering the
Calvin cycle it's the carbon fixation
step of photosynthesis in the calvin
cycle ATP and nadph from the
light-dependent phase are used to make
carbohydrates and they uses carbon
dioxide as the carbon source so carbon
dioxide incorporation requires a massive
amount of energy like a freakin boatload
of energy more like a freakin fairy load
of energy so for every six carbon
dioxide that is incorporated 18 ATP and
12 NADPH molecules are used so like I
said it's a crap ton of energy but
anyways carbon dioxide incorporation is
going to produce
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate which is a
three carbon molecule there are three
phases in the calvin cycle you first got
your carbon fixation where carbon
dioxide is incorporated in to ribulose
bisphosphate using the enzyme rubisco
and then the six carbon intermediate is
going to split into three
phosphoglycerate two molecules of
3-phosphoglycerate the second step is
the reduction and carbohydrate
production where ATP is used to convert
3-phosphoglycerate into 13 bisphosphate
go straight NADPH reduces it to
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and the net
reaction is six carbon dioxide's are
going to form 12
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate the last step
is the regeneration of ribulose
bisphosphate you got 10 molecules of
glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate combining
with six molecules of ATP to produce six
molecules of arrival OHS bisphosphate
alright so here's how the cycle works
you've got your 6 carbon dioxide which
is a one-color carbon molecule and
you've got your 6 ribulose bisphosphate
or rubp molecules which are 5 carbon
molecule
rubisco is going to combine these two to
make 12 3-phosphoglycerate you can see
here the structure is just a three
carbon molecule with a phosphate on the
third carbon after this 12 ATP's are
going to be hydrolyzed forming 12 adps
the form 12 13 bisphosphate glyceride
molecules also a three carbon molecule
this is the structure of 13 BPG right
over here you can see it just has an
extra phosphate groups stuck onto the
first carbon right there after this is
going to go through some more stuff and
12 NADPH azhar going to be reduced to 12
nadp+ a--'s and 12 inorganic phosphate
groups are going to be kicked off so
form 12 glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate
molecules also a three carbon molecule
here you can see that carboxylic acid up
there has been reduced to an aldehyde
but you still got your phosphate group
on the third carbon right here so two of
these glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate are
going to be used to reduce a glucose and
other sugars the other ten are going to
be used to produce ribulose bisphosphate
to continue the cycle again but so 10 of
these are going to go and 680 PS are
going to be hydrolyzed to form to reform
the six of ribulose bisphosphate so you
need then the cycle starts all over
again you can see the structure of
Regulus bisphosphate right here if you
want but that's all i have for carbon
cycle the calvin cycle rather but in the
next video i'm going to go over some
alternative pathways that plants use
such as photorespiration and the
incorporation of four carbon
constituents and set five carbon the
constituents own and cam plants</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
