jQuery introductory tutorial I decided
to do a tutorials a tutorial series on
jQuery because it is a very popular in
lightweight cross browser compatible
javascript library that is very useful
whenever you're trying to inspect
document object model elements and
manipulate CSS and create effects and
use Ajax this this javascript library is
I think out of I think I read over out
of the most popular websites of the
10,000 most popular websites I think a
third of them are using jQuery so I
figured it would be a good a good set of
tutorials to sort of enter trucks use
and reduce you to how powerful jQuery
really is so let's get started and the
first thing we're gonna do is go to
jQuery calm and on their home page they
have a link a download link and we are
going to download the production the
minified small version of jQuery so I'm
gonna go ahead and click on download and
you see it takes us right to a
javascript file and I'm gonna say select
all and copy and inside of my local host
I have created a JavaScript folder and
inside that folder I have also created a
jQuery file so I'm open that up inside
Dreamweaver then you see we have a blank
javascript file here so I'm gonna go
ahead and paste everything that I just
copied in to this javascript file and
I'm gonna save it
I have also created an index dot PHP
file and this is going to be the page
that we are going to be working with in
the following tutorials where we edit
and write some new JavaScript code using
the jquery javascript library so the
first thing we're gonna do is import our
jquery javascript into our index dot PHP
so since we put it in the jas folder and
call it a jquery jeaious we're going to
do it just like that I'm going to save
that and I'm gonna copy this right here
and paste it underneath I'm gonna take
out this source because in a second we
are gonna write some code inside of this
script block so one of the things that
is used very commonly even before jquery
was around was javascript developers
would use the window dot onload to throw
in some elements into the document
object model whenever the page was
loaded but there's a problem with that
because for instance say if you had a
lot of large images or some banners or a
lot of things that take time to load
then it could be sort of annoying to
wait for all that stuff to load before
you could start to put more pieces using
javascript into your web page so what
Jake what the guys from jQuery did was
they created a a ready event so it
basically figures out when the page is
ready to be manipulated and it allows
you to add some code and to add some
pieces to your web page using JavaScript
so right now we're going to
I'm gonna type that in and I'm gonna
show you what that looks like so I'm
going to say when the document is ready
then we're going to call function and
type some code in so I'm the why does
that it's really weird
okay so in here we're gonna put some
code so what this is saying is whenever
your documents ready start at types and
code and start to load some stuff so
since you see we have a link right here
we have an anchor element we're going to
we're gonna add some code that says
whenever this is clicked we want to
create a pop-up so we're gonna say
a dot click function event
and we're going to want to say alert
thanks for visiting
forgot my quotation there okay so what
this is saying is whenever we click on
this anchor element it's gonna give us a
pop up before we can leave the page and
once we say okay it's gonna take us away
from the page so I'm gonna save this and
I'm going to reload the page okay so we
have this this link that we expect to
see right here we're gonna click on that
and it gives us a pop up and say okay
and it takes us to the jQuery home page
so that is one way that we can
manipulate some document object pieces
and there's another thing that we can
type we can prevent the default behavior
by typing event dot prevent default and
what that's saying is it's going to
prevent this from actually it's gonna
prevent the pop-up from happening so I'm
gonna reload this whoops forgot Save
there we go it's gonna exit it's gonna
prevent the the default behavior of an
anchor element is to take you away from
the page it's gonna prevent the default
behavior of that anchor element so it's
not gonna allow the anchor element to
take you away from the page so that is a
brief introductory to jQuery in the next
tutorial I'm going to show you how to
add and remove CSS Styles I had to
remove CSS classes and I'm also going to
show you some special effects and go
over some different functions some
different callbacks and functions and
and then we'll continue to dive deeper
into jQuery and I know this this
tutorial might seem a little boring but
I'm just sort of into introducing you to
the the way of writing jQuery JavaScript
it's it's really a whole new way of
thinking about JavaScript it makes
writing somewhat complex code much more
easier to understand and easier to write
so thanks for watching and hopefully you
guys are interested in jQuery and you're
excited about the next tutorial and I
will see you in the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
