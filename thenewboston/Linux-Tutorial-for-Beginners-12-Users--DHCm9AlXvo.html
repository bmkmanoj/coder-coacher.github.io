this video we're going to learn about
users so users are actually really
simple so just like Windows or Mac your
computer can have different users now a
user of course is just anyone who uses
the computer so if I was setting up this
computer for my family I might have a
user account for me maybe one for my
brother maybe one for my mom my sister
whatever so basically anyone that uses
the computer is a user simple enough now
the reason that we want to create
different accounts is because these
users usually have restrictions on which
files they can access so if I had a
company I could have a group of users
that were like my front-end guys so they
could only access the HTML files the web
design and for my back-end guys those
users can access you know the PHP files
the database so it's a nice way to you
know restrict access for each group of
people now whenever you use the Linux
there's a couple things you need to
understand first is that there is always
a super user who is named root now the
super user can do anything so whenever
you like if you're the owner of the
entire server you always have root or
super user access now you may be
thinking ah right so I just bought my
own server I'm the only one on I'm
setting up my own site I'm just going to
use root this main account all the time
and that way I'll be able to do anything
sounds great right but even if you want
full control over your server and you're
the only one accessing it you usually
don't want to log in as root and that's
because even though they can do anything
that's not usually a good thing because
there are a lot of system files that you
don't want to accidentally delete or
accidentally edit so like I said even if
you're the core single system
administrator on a server you usually
create another account that um you know
can't accidentally mess up any system
files and then if you ever want to you
know actually run a system command with
full super
our privileges then you just use pseudo
or sudou like we saw in the last video
and you can do that so that's what
people usually do so let me show you the
basics of how to add a new user how to
manage the groups and whatnot so right
now let me just make sure I'm in my home
directory and I'm just uh I don't know
navigate to the desktop I'll show you
guys a few things
so let me visually do this so you guys
can see what's going on so let's make a
new document and I'll just name this
like a corn and I'll just write I am
corn whatever just something stupid in
there all right so we got one file just
for demonstrating and if I ever do this
LS - LA and look at that file check it
out we already know what a lot of stuff
is the date it's created on the name of
it whatever and then we see these two
things Bucky Bucky hmm all right well we
know I'm logged in as Bucky but why
would it say it twice well whenever
you're looking at a file like this again
this first thing are the permissions
already learned about those this name in
this name stands for the owner and the
group they belong to so of course I am
Bucky so I own this file Orcs is this
one right here and also I belong to the
group Bucky so you can have different
groups and I'm going to show you guys
how to do that in a second but remember
this whenever you create a new user for
the first time it also automatically
creates a group for them with the same
name so if I want to make a group called
boys and you know put me and my brother
in that and a group called girls and put
my sister on my mom in there I could do
that but anyways just remember because a
lot of people don't understand why they
see the name twice that's what's going
on the owner or the individual user and
then the group so let me clear out of
this and let's just go ahead and add a
new user so I'm going to add my mom is a
user on this computer and in order to
add a new user you need root or
superuser privileges
so since I'm logged in this Bucky I need
to call pseudo so Super User do this and
the command for just adding a new user
is user ad and then their username and
her username can just be mom so now I
have to say okay make sure that you have
the right privileges so I'm just going
to type the password and this is just
the main password to use the login and
we now edit mom mom is a user so what I
want to do for mom right now is I want
to make sure she has a right password so
sudo pas SWT mom so I'm going to edit
the password for mom and I'll just right
give her a password and then when she
comes home from work I can say hey mom I
made an account this is your password
boom you're good to go
she's going to go what the heck are you
talking about have no idea what Linux is
come eat your dinner but whatever that's
my story
all right so that's the basics of how
users work and actually wait to the next
tutorial to show you guys about groups
because there's a couple things I want
to talk about so there you go see you
guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
