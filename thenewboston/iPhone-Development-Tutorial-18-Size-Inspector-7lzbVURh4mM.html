development tutorial and in the last
tutorial what we did is we finally got
our iphone to rotate and the screen to
change appropriately when it did but
check this out we got some technical
issues you see one two three four that's
good but buttons number five and six are
totally off the screen so you're saying
all right this is a problem how do we
fix it well you are in luck my friend
because that's exactly we're going to be
going over in this story how convenient
so go ahead iPhone simulator quit iPhone
simulator and hop right back in the
interface builder and in order to
respond to how the objects act when you
rotate your iPhone or iPod here's what
you need to go go ahead and select any
of these objects and in your attributes
panel see this ruler right here go ahead
and click that and these are your size
attributes so the even though it says
your size attributes you can go ahead
and mess with how your objects are going
to get resized when your phone is
rotated so it's pretty much not only
size attributes but also rotation
attributes as well so what we are
concerned with is not size of position
not alignment not placement we're only
going to be looking at auto sizing right
here and as you see by default it's this
little box right here and this a little
this is pretty much a preview of how you
want your object to act whenever you
rotate it so let's go ahead and
understand what all this crap means
right here well this inside square you
see this any object that you selected go
ahead and select number button button
number one this inside square represents
whatever object you selected so see
where my cursor is this inside square
now represents my button sort of saying
all right then what the heck does this
mean and uh yeah well this white space
around your object represents the
distance from the object to the edge of
the screen so you're saying all right
this represents your object
all this stuff represents the space from
your object to the edge of the screen
and now you're saying all right then
what the H do these arrows and little i
shaped crap main right there well first
of all the arrows represent the change
of the size of your object so check this
out here's a little preview right here
here's what happens when you turn your
iPhone as you can see this box stays in
the same place in a relation to the top
and the left to the screen and your
button doesn't change in size at all so
now let's go ahead and click this arrow
up and down and now you can see this
since this object you click the up and
down you now enable resizing of the
button up and down so now if we were to
rotate this the button would grow up and
down and that's not exactly what we want
so now head go ahead and click this for
fun I'm left and right and now you can
see if we were to rotate it the button
what automatically grow in size left to
right so I mean we don't want any of the
buttons to grow so we don't want any of
those arrows selected never saying all
right I know what these arrows do these
represent the buttons and this
represents the ability to change in size
but what the heck i simple as me the I
symbols mean the distance from that side
of the screen to the object if you want
it locked so go ahead and deselect them
all and check it out instead of locking
that button where it is and now gets
rotated and pretty much is pretty much
moving all over the screen so if you
only want to lock it to the top of the
screen go ahead and click this top one
and now you can see the distance from
the top of the screen to the top of the
object doesn't move so if you only want
to lock it to the left hand side go
ahead and click the left and I see the
distance from the left of the button to
the left of the screen doesn't move so
this is the very first button it belongs
in the top left corner that's where we
wanted so now what we need to do is
basically go through and adjust where we
won a lot
each button and by the way here's a
helpful hint I now selected to by the
way the size of your object is not going
to change so we only have to change
these little I parameters we do not have
to change these the size at all so you
see one this is what we want we want it
to lock to the top left of the screen
for two we want it to lock to the top
right of the screen pretty cool huh now
go ahead and select button number three
and we want this to lock to the left
hand side of the screen alright so go
ahead and select number four and we want
this lock to the right hand side of the
screen pretty cool I got it so five this
button appears at the bottom left so go
ahead and select the bottom left
blocking attributes and now last 16 you
guys can guess these select these both
and select bottom and right I mean did I
say that before anyways you'll figure it
out and now this button number six stays
in the bottom right no matter how you
resize it or rotate it so now that we
got all of our auto sizing attribute set
go ahead and an interface builder select
file and save and that'll save those
attributes now in Xcode build and run
this you say all right one two three
four five six all right we're good so
far now hardware rotate left and o.m.g
are you freaking kidding me that is
awesome exactly how we want to act so
now you see among others to stays in the
top right five stays in the bottom left
six days in the bottom right and all the
rest of the buttons appear where we told
them to appear so again anytime you want
to mess with those those are in your
size attributes which also is pretty
much is like your reputation attributes
by default so that is how we do that and
fix that error but you know there's
still a couple more things that we need
to cover concerning rotation and we're
going to be covering that stuff in the
next tutorial so thank you guys for
watching don't forget subscribe and I
have some extra time check out my form
it's pretty cool ask me question or
something so yeah thanks for watching
and I'll see you
next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
