objective-c tutorial and in this is
Torah we're gonna be expanding the
rectangle class we built in well the
last couple tutorials so basically what
we did is we built a class or a program
for rectangles and squares but say we
weren't just building a random program
we're actually building an application
to draw rectangles and squares on the
screen so what we have so far in by the
way I deleted everything out of my old
tutorial you know give me a clear blank
slate on my main method Elise but
anyways what we did is we gave our
rectangles and squares pretty much a
width and a height and we also
calculated the area and perimeter if we
need to know that for you know fill
color or anything like that but aside
from just giving that a width and height
when you're building an application like
this you also want to tell the computer
program where on the screen do you want
the rectangle do you want it to appear
up here or do you want it to appear down
here maybe up here so the most common
way to do this is to develop a
coordinate system and if you remember
from math class the x-axis goes left and
right horizontally and the Y goes up and
down so let's go ahead and do that right
now
and we'll put this point down here zero
zero so um what do pixels so let's go
ahead and put it would be like 1 2 3
over 3 1 2 3 so 3 over and 3 up would be
the origin 3 3 if you don't know how
coordinates work just think of playing
battleship and that's pretty much where
we're gonna be building here so let's go
ahead and build a new class for your
origins I mean if you want in your
rectangle to have origins you could go
ahead and extend your class the origin
properties X origin Y origin but we're
gonna be working with it a lot and not
only in our rectangle class so let's go
ahead and in our project let's go ahead
and add new file all the defaults look
good just go ahead and press in next
right here
and for your new class just go ahead and
name it
um XY point I mean you don't have to
name the same thing as I do but it's
nice to follow along so finish that and
now we have two new files XY points so
let's go ahead and click on the source
and now we can see everything and there
we go so let's go ahead and delete this
and where's my other one dot M delete
the comments I always delete the
comments because I hate them
and so for your let's see your interface
file for the XY point the first thing we
wanted to change is cocoa to foundation
and foundation just like that I hate how
those dot H's appear so let's see it's
going to be interface XY point and we're
gonna have it inherit from nsobject and
what properties do we want to give it
well we want to give it an x-value and
y-value so in X and this is going to be
the distance it is from the left-hand
side so if it was so if X had value of
100 it'll be a hundred pixels away from
the left and obviously int y and this is
going to be the distances away from the
bottom so if it's a hundred 200 it's a
hundred over one 200 up so it would
appear right here guesstimating you know
like I measure imperfect hundreds of
pixels when I'm moving my mouse I don't
really but anyways what we want to do
after that is define our properties
using that property and spell it right
that's two bit better and just go ahead
and put an x and y and this tells
Objective C what our properties are so
now the only thing we're really going to
do is we're gonna build a method to set
x and y so of course you need the header
it's not going to return anything void I
hate how that stuff pops up I wonder why
I cannot get rid of that but anyways set
X Y and you're gonna pass it two values
of course but you can guess and
and we'll just call this one x value and
you're gonna pass it another int and
this will just name a y value like that
so let me make sure I got everything
here we got XY properties and we got a
method right here so now we can move on
to the implementation file and show
everything how to work so we want to
import X a so let me tighten this up a
bit that's what she said
and of course we want to implement XY
point and the next thing we wanted to do
is at synthesize x and y and this is
automatically gonna build setters and
getters methods for us if you forgot
what synthesized those now we got to
make sure we add a body to this method
that we said we're going to build and
again what all this method is going to
do is you're going to see in the second
is this going to allow you to set the
coordinates for x and y so let's just
remember we're going to pass a value and
x value and a Y value and we already
have these variables x and y so this is
the easiest thing you'll ever see x is
equal to x value that we pass in and Y
is equal to Y value that we pass in
pretty cool huh and see that looks good
right there but I am debating whether to
keep going on you know what in the next
class or me excuse me
in the next tutorial I'm gonna be
showing you how to change everything in
your rectangle eyes and teaching you a
whole bunch of stuff but for now I mean
we got this class built so you know
that's better than I expected to do for
this tutorial but I'm running out of
time but uh thank you guys for watching
I'm out of time in the next tutorial
I'll show you well what to do next so
thank you for watching if you want the
source code click the link below and you
can go get it at my forum for free so
thanks for watching the freaks don't
forget to subscribe and I'll see you
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
