tutorials on the different color modes
now we're going to start getting into
understanding the CMYK color mode by the
way this is buddy Blackford and if
you've been watching the other tutorials
I guess you would already know that but
let's go on
so the CMYK color mode is a color mode
of papers and printing presses so
printing presses converting images
colors into percentages of CMYK and CMYK
stands for cyan magenta yellow and black
and if we look at the image here we see
cyan over here on the Left magenta
yellow and right in the middle is black
and they all combine to create black so
what happens is a printing press
converts the amount of colors into
percent percentages like I just said and
those eventually become the color plates
on the printing press and one at a time
the plates apply color to a sheet of
paper and when all four colors have been
applied the paper contains an image that
is similar to the image you created in
Photoshop so that's really cool that's
what Photoshop is all about and stuff
like that creating some being able to
create images that you can use as in
print as well so that's one of the good
things about Photoshop now if you want
to check and see if your images in CMYK
what you need to do is check either in
your channels or up in your image so if
we go to channels right now and look we
can see that we're still in RGB color
space and this is what people mostly get
when they import an image is most of the
time it comes in in it to RGB if we come
up to image and we go to adjust our and
we go to mode we can change that to CMYK
now before we do this real quick you
need to understand that you will lose
some of the color saturation
during the conversion
and these colors the saturations of them
won't be able to always be printed when
you are like if you're expecting all
these colors to pre-printed exactly like
they were it's not really going to
happen and you can tell which ones
aren't going to work out by coming up
here go to the View menu and then we're
going to come here to gamut warning and
now you can see things that where the
warnings are so all these colors right
here are out of the printing press
spectrum right now so what's good out of
here and click off the gamut warning and
we already know what's going on and
what's going to happen let's go back and
adjust the mode now so that we're in
CMYK so it says you're about to convert
to CMYK using the profile and I'll go
over profiles at another time they're
kind of confusing but there's a whole
ton of them but this is fine for now
just hit OK so as you can see now they
have been the colors over here in the
channels have been changed up so let's
look at the color change of it
individually really quick so here's if
we just turn some of these off here we
have black and you can see the different
shades of black that are on here let's
go to yellow so we just want yellow you
can see that there's definitely in
yellow and then the different shades of
yellow that are created we go to magenta
obviously the same thing and then cyan
same things there so then we start
adding to them together and we get our
CMYK colors now let's compare these up
here and let's go to our history and we
can see that CMYK color was something
that we did it was an action that we did
that we can just go back and you can see
the difference in saturation and
remember the gamut warnings they were
mostly over here on these blues and
greens and stuff like that check them
out when I switch back to CMYK
you can see they got D saturated pretty
much all the colors got D saturated now
if we go let's check out the warning
again and you can see I turned it on as
you can see by the check mark there just
click on it there's nothing that's in
the warning area so this pretty much
when you have it change to CMYK
nothing's gonna show up because you're
in the correct color space so I'll turn
that off because I don't need it on so
if you're wondering what a gamma is it's
a it refers to the range of colors that
a specific device is capable of
producing so there's a bunch of colors
that our eyes can pick up but certain
electronic devices and printing presses
they're not able to reproduce all those
colors yet we don't have the technology
I guess in the certain color spaces so
weird we have to use the gamuts that
they're talking about to define our
spaces that are going to show up on the
different monitors and everything like
that hopefully that made sense so
hopefully you guys get the gist of the
CMYK they are called
subtractive colors because when you add
them all together they produce black now
if you take out all the yellow all these
cyan and all the pink you're going to
get white pure white in your image so
keep those in mind that's why it says
subtractive up there at the top and I
don't think there's anything else I need
to go over right now for the CMYK just
remember that it's for paper and for
printing press and to change your colors
and I recommend doing it doing this at
the very end when you're about to like
save in your final and it's like your
final version of your Photoshop document
then to change to CMYK colors so that
way everything does it at once and
you're not messing around with a whole
bunch of different colors and doing it
all the time so that's my little advice
I guess and
again you guys can I guess that's the I
would forget how to end these things but
anyways that's it for the tutorial
thanks for watching guys and putting up
with my terrible endings I have a good
one everybody</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
