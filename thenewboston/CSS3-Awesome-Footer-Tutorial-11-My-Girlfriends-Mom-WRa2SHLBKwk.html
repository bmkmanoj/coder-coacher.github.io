video and in this video we're gonna be
working on some more styling but before
we get to that I have another
predicament that I'm in I know I already
asked you guys some advice about my
sister and I got kind of mixed reviews
but now I have a bigger problem and
that's this I have to get my
girlfriend's mother a birthday present
because she got me a birthday present
now I feel obligated I have to get her
one and the only thing I know that she
wants is a Google hoodie because I was
wearing my Google hoodie at her house a
couple days ago and then she was like oh
I like one of those so you know what
else am I gonna get her and here's the
situation I don't know what size she is
but I'm 90% sure that she would take a
medium however if I buy her a medium and
it turns out that she wears a small then
I'm gonna be really kind of embarrassed
because it would imply that you know I
thought she was larger than she is so
should I just go with my gut and get her
a medium or should I play it safe and as
a compliment
get her a small even though then it
would be kind of a pain to return it
because you got to get my online so let
me know you know I'm torn apart so with
that being said let's go ahead and get
to styling the footer so the first thing
I want to do is what we're going to be
doing actually is we're gonna be putting
the footer menu inside the footer tag so
pretty much the entire thing the entire
toolbar right here is going to be a
footer menu in each of these buttons
account profile to comms programs is an
item in that menu so it'll make sense in
a second footer menu just think of this
as the entire toolbar margin of course I
always do that merging margin zero
pixels padding zero pixels now as you
can see with individual buttons the text
isn't butted up against the side in what
we're going to do is we just want to set
the overall style for the footer and
then we can style the buttons how we
want you know put the text exactly where
we want it
and width:auto so pretty much this is
you know just to reset everything the
footer has no padding or margin and the
spans across the entire bottom of the
screen now like I said this footer is
basically a list in these buttons are
list items so let's go ahead and style
those right now
so footer menu just gonna copy this
footer menu now when you have a list
item which is essentially the button so
the first thing we want to do is set
list style Wow
I'm losing my mind here list style equal
to none because typically whenever you
make a unordered list they have those
little bullets or you know hyphens or
whatever well these are the buttons so
list style equals none now the next
thing we want to do is we want to float
these to the left so whenever you add a
button it's gonna float to the left
add another one it floats to the left so
whenever you're writing this in your
HTML file make sure you add them in the
proper order so accounts gonna go to the
very left then butting up against that
is your next one and you'll see later on
so float to the left and let me give me
some more room to work with float to the
left now for the font size 12 pixels and
if you are you know just one it is the
same as your typical website then you
don't need to override it but for anyone
developing this footer it's 12 pixels
now the padding and this basically is
the padding of the text if you didn't
have anything the text would be in the
top left corner of the button and you
see how the text is kind of floating in
the middle of the button how do we do
that
what we need to give it 12 pixels 14
pixels 14 pixels 14 pixels now what this
means is 12 pixels for the top and the
right bottom and left hand side is 14
pixels so this actually depends on the
height of your footer but for mine this
looks pretty cool now if you guys
noticed the buttons kind of stand out
okay who sucks the me right now
okay that's nice the buttons kind of
stand out from the regular footer so
this where my mouse is right here is the
footer a buttonless footer and I don't
know if you guys can tell the difference
on YouTube but the buttons are slightly
darker and they also have a right-hand
border which is a little thin black line
pretty much that separates each button
so how do we achieve this effect and
guys you definitely want to do this or
else it's gonna look that you'd like you
just have text on a bottom you know
toolbar we actually want buttons so how
do we style these to have a cool glass
looking effect well the first thing we
need to do is set the border right and
this just makes that one pixel solid
rgba 0 0 0 which is black lines on flame
0.4 now I want to repeat this one more
time Wow 1 peso
well actually I'm gonna type the next
thing then do this alright so the border
right is just a thin pretty much a black
border that is on the right hand side of
every button and as you can see on this
programs 1 that's what separates this
programs button how you know when this
stops and the rest of the footer begins
now for the background what you want to
do is you want to set this at RGB a
black which is zero zero zero zero point
one now remember whenever you have
something with a semi transparent
background and you lay it on top of
something that's already so much grants
parent they don't cancel each other out
they actually stack on each other so if
this background was 40% and then you
laid a button that had 10% opacity on it
it wouldn't be 10% opacity showing
through here it would be 10% think of
like transparency if you guys know what
they're think about a piece of paper
laying on top of another piece of paper
there you go boom roasted or wax paper
or something like that so the background
of this button isn't
10% it's 10% opacity in addition to
whatever was behind it so that is how
you get buttons that are slightly darker
because it's like a transparent piece of
paper laying on top of another
transparent and then of course all of
this is pretty much just you know basic
housekeeping styling so in the next
tutorial what I want to show you guys
how to do is check this out you see how
the buttons are already slightly darker
than the background well I want them to
get even darker when you hover over them
so look at the button quit looking at
that pop-up menu you looked at the
pop-up menu do don't look at the pop-up
menu look at the button only you see how
the buttons getting darker
whenever you hover over it well I'm
gonna be showing you guys how to do that
as well as some other sweet effects in
the next video so don't forget to tell
me what I should do about my
girlfriend's mom thank you guys for
watching and I'll see you guys in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
