exciting Illustrator cs6 tutorial and in
this tutorial we're going to learn how
to duplicate objects because there's a
few different methods that we can use
and knowing all the methods is awesome
so what a duplication is is it takes
your exact object that you have selected
and it's going to make an exact copy
everything that has to do with the
object is going to be copied or
duplicated so even though the stroke is
a fill the size everything alright so
the first thing you need to do is have
your selection tool selected and I'm
just going to go ahead and select an
object the first way and the easiest way
is to hold down the Alt key or it's the
option key on a Mac and you're going to
just drag hold on all you can see that
the the icon or the cursor turns into
like a double arrow just click and drag
and set it down and that's how to
duplicate quickly and easily now another
method is the copying and pasting method
so if we go up to our edit menu we can
go to copy which is ctrl C and then we
can go up here again and we can go to
paste and it's just going to paste this
object in the middle right as a
duplicate since I already have this
copied we can try to up these other ones
paste in front is going to paste that in
in the same place but in front of the
object you just had actually let me redo
that real quick and then I'll drag it
off to see so you can see that there is
a duplicate okay and then we have paste
and back which is going to paste it
behind paste in place just paste it in
the same exact place that the other one
was in and paste in all artboards just
pastes it on every single up word that
you have so those that's the copy and
pasting method and all the hotkeys are
the same as they would be for copy and
paste so ctrl-c ctrl-v if you want to do
it real quick
like that saves time and then the last
one that I can show you on the single
artboard is using your keyboard so if
you hold down alt and press your key to
our press one of your arrow keys you can
see that it moved a little and now if
you look I have two separate stars and
they're the exact same now if you press
hold down all and you press your key a
few times you get this shadowy looking
effect but all it is is just a whole
bunch of duplicated stars so that's not
what you really want you can see how
many times have duplicated it so if you
think you're trying to create a shadow
effect by doing it that way it doesn't
work it just creates a whole bunch of
stuff and there's better ways that you
can do that now if you are working in a
different document or in two separate
documents and you want to duplicate an
object from one document to the other so
I want to bring this this polygon over
to the other document just set up your
document so that they're side-by-side
click on your object bring it over and
just drag it over and it'll duplicate it
I'm just going to get out of here so
those are your methods that you can use
for duplicating and they're all really
easy but you need to know them and I'm
going to show you a more advanced to
duplication and this is called
duplicating using an offset so go ahead
and make sure you have the selection
tool selected again select your object
you're going to go to the object menu
and you're going to go to path object
and then we're going to go to path and
the next thing we're going to go to is
offset path now we've got a set of
options that we can mess with you can
enter the distance that you want it to
be offset and let's do 30 here so we can
see it a little better
and the next thing is called joints and
we've got a couple options
we got mitre and this is basically just
the bend the style so we've got pointed
we've got round or got bevel mitre is
pointed round is circular and bevel is
square cornered so we're gonna go with
mitre because this is a star and we want
to point it
we've got miter limit and you can set
this from 1 to 16,000 I think and it
determines when a mitered corner changes
into a beveled corner and when you have
a low number in there it creates a more
beveled corner and when you have a high
number in there it creates a sharper
corner I'm just going to do something
like 100 and I can hit preview and you
can see what it does now now if I
uncheck preview it goes away but this is
what it's doing if I do an offset of
zero it's gonna create this as an exact
duplicate but I can create it as
something like 10 and this is how you
create things easily within another
object as well so I can try something
maybe negative 10 to create another star
within this star and then I'll show you
the different joints here we've got
round and you can see that it made the
star a little bit more rounded and now
we've got bevel and it made it have a
couple extra points in here to make it a
little different let's go to miter and
then I'll I'll basically mess with this
miter limit for you real quick if I put
it to zero you can see that it changed
it basically to a bevel and I put it to
a 50 looks pretty good on 50 would it
normally be a hundred there's 100 and if
I put it to 16,000 you can see that a
headed in a couple extra points that
were not needed really and just use your
own discretion when you're using your
miter limits and that's pretty much it
you learned how to duplicate an object
and you use how to duplicate or you
learned how to duplicate an object with
the offset button so hopefully those are
awesome for you guys and you'll learn
something if you did go ahead and give
me a like button I'd click the like
button down in there at the bottom
that's really helpful when you guys do
that and thanks a lot for watching the
video and stay tuned for more so have a
good day everybody</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
