over right here so anything in this
section on the right hand side is gonna
be centered and it's gonna have all this
padding and also the black border right
here on the left hand side which is
actually it appears as a vertical line
so color picker and whoa what the heck
did I just do all right
V align equals top now this is gonna do
is by default whenever you have
something inside a table data like this
its centered vertically so for example
look at my cursor right now if I had an
image in there it would appear right
here what it up here at the top it would
appear right here so if you want to have
more control over your images which I do
in the case of this pallet what I like
to do is I like a v-line top and then I
just add a padding top and then I have
control of how far it is from top order
many ways that's why I did that and now
we can go ahead and the first thing we
need to do is actually add this image
now I'm gonna go ahead and post the
image on my forum so if you guys don't
have it you can actually input any image
there it doesn't even have to be a color
pallet but if you guys want this one
then go to my forum Bucky's room comm
slash forum and you could download this
exact one so in order to insert the
image just write image the source equals
I named it pallet ping and actually I
don't even want to give it a border do I
need to all right might as well and you
know F it but anyways I'll just stick
with the core basics for this tutorial
and then if you want to style it on your
own web pages and you can get fancy but
what we do need to do is we need to add
on click equals
get color event and you're like whoa
whoa whoa slow down Bessie wTF is this
well on-click is basically a JavaScript
function that says no I don't want to
say JavaScript function because what it
does is it's an attribute in HTML and
whenever you click your mouse it calls
the function that what is ever in the
value so for this value we wrote get
color and we passed it in events now
later on what this javascript function
is going to do is it's basically going
to retrieve the color so to make it
really simple in everyday terms whenever
I click this part of the palette it's
going to return red whenever I click you
know this part of the palette is going
to return blue so that's what this
onclick does as soon as I click it gets
the color and again it's a little bit
more detailed than that but you'll see
in JavaScript I just give you guys a
real you know basic introduction next I
just want to insert one more tag BR for
Bucky's room everyone should join and
after this let me just go ahead and add
an input now this input right here is
going to be a default form value so go
ahead and code this and then I'll talk
ID equals color type equals hidden
read-only equals true and I'll talk
about what all this means in a second
and value equals zero zero zero zero
zero zero doom roasted alright so you
guys are saying what the heck is this
I'm looking at the section in there is
no input box why do you have that well
the reason I have this is because we
need to have a hidden value that doesn't
display it's basically a default value
and that's what this read-only means
read only true and if you guys have
never seen this attribute in HTML 4
before it means that it cannot be
modified you can only read it you can't
edit it at all so that's why it's hidden
because we don't want the user
to interact with this element at all
it's just you know something that we're
gonna be working with in JavaScript
later on so that's why I want it
basically before the user picks the
color you know we have to give them a
default color Oh have a little hiccup
stuff like that but anyways the last
thing I want to do is I want to add this
little thing text will look like this
and this is just a simple little prompt
to let the user know hey this isn't just
you know a random image on the
right-hand side of your screen you have
to actually click on one of these in
your text is gonna look like that so
always nice to let the user know what
the eff is going on so span and I want
to give this the ID of actually I don't
even think I did it actually yeah we
don't even need that I styled it in my
other example but for right now all we
need to do is go ahead and write it so
text will look like this so now whenever
we run this program we're gonna get this
little prompt on the screen and like I
said now the user knows what the f is
going on so that is all we need to do to
style the chatroom itself so now we
styled pretty much this entire table
everything that's highlighted in blue so
the only other thing that we have to do
is actually we just have to style the
little form under it real quick this
little div area that says guest the part
where you type your message the send the
leap on and it takes about two seconds
so I'm gonna be saving that for the next
tutorial because there are a couple
things that I want to talk about how
this you know intertwines with your
javascript file later on so I'm gonna go
get like some freaking cough drops or
something and probably some McDonald's
because I'm a little tubby and well
thing guests watching and well I'll see
you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
