welcome to your eighth Premiere Pro
tutorial and in this tutorial I'm going
to show you guys how to work with
keyframes a huge part of Premiere Pro
and especially working with effects so I
know I showed you guys how to apply
effects to a video or a picture or a
title in the last tutorial but in this
tutorial I'm going to show you guys how
to make your effects change over time so
you're saying all right why in the world
would I want an effect change over time
well let's go ahead and select this clip
so we get all the effects that pop up in
the effects controls for example if we
go ahead and expand opacity we know that
100 means full video and zero means
totally black because it's totally
see-through but if we go ahead and
change this over time we could go ahead
and give it the appearance of it fading
in or fading out so that's why we want
to be able to work with keyframes
because we're basically saying alright
we want this effect or a certain effect
to change over time so let's go ahead
and the very first thing I want to do is
add a title at the beginning of my movie
so I'm going to go ahead and select this
kit clip drag it out and for the title
I'm just going to use this picture so go
ahead take this picture drag it onto our
timeline and now I'm just going to go
ahead and zoom in and take this video
clip and put it right up against just
like that now I'm actually going to zoom
in a little bit further and let's go
ahead and play our movie and see what we
got
so for five seconds we got this title
this pretty much is the image is
standing there and then pop it goes and
starts playing our video but wouldn't it
be awesome if at the beginning of our
video instead of just starting out just
like that it faded in and then maybe
before it got to the main video right
here it faded out that would make it
look a whole lot more professional so
let's go ahead and learn how to do that
so go ahead and select the title you
just added in guys just go ahead and
grab some picture off of Google or
something if you don't have a title like
this and I'm going to show you guys how
to work with keyframes specifically the
opacity
because that's the most obvious so go
ahead and select your title and then the
effects controls appear at the top and
go ahead and expand opacity and then
expand it again and now you see this
little bar right here so this timeline
is not the timeline for your entire
movie this is just the timeline for the
duration of the title so zero zero
starts at the beginning right here and
all the way at the end is five seconds
so again it's not your entire movie is
just how long that title appears on the
screen so what we need to do is say our
a we're going to make points in time
that at that point in time we want to
tell you where you need to be opacity
wise so since we want to fade it in
here's what we need to do go ahead and
start at zero zero pretty much the very
beginning we're saying all right at zero
zero we want you to be zero opacity
totally black just like that and now if
you can see a little diamond appears
right here so we want to have it fade in
at one second or you know sometime
around one second so move your current
time indicator to one second you can
even move this one it really doesn't
matter and now we're going to tell it
all right now what we want you to do is
at one second we want you to be totally
opaque or not see-through at all so now
as you can see we told it at zero zero
to start out totally black and at one
second be totally opaque so in between
then it's going to transition just like
that and as you can see whenever you
make a keyframe is pretty much a point
in time you're telling it to do a
certain thing and that's when a diamond
appears so we're saying all right that's
pretty cool now if you play this video
look in the top right when I'm going to
hit space it now fades in and let me go
ahead and tell you this in order to move
your keyframes you can just go ahead and
take this and slide it to the right or
left so if I want to make this fade a
little longer instead of one second I
can go ahead and slide it over into two
seconds now instead of my fade taking
one second long if
go ahead and hit play it takes two
seconds long just like that so now we
say all right that's pretty cool but how
do we fade out the video well what we
need to do is say all right let's think
about this for a second if going from
zero to 100% fades it in going from 100%
to zero would fade it out so go ahead
and start around three and a half
seconds or something and go ahead and
move your time slider just like this
where you add a keyframe so whenever you
move your slider right here it
automatically adds a keyframe basically
because you're changing something
another way to add a keyframe is just go
ahead and hit this little diamond button
and it goes ahead and adds a keyframe if
there's not one there already or if
you're on one already it takes it away
so we can go ahead and do it either two
of those ways so now we got zero 100%
100% and if we go all the way to the end
and slide it to zero then it's going to
fade out so if we just go ahead and
scroll with our time slider we can see
that we're fading in and then it stays
it a hundred percent for about a second
and a half and then it starts to fade
out so that's a much more professional
way of working then you know just
cutting from seeing the scene so let me
go ahead and play the movie as a whole
fades in stays fades out and again if we
want to say all right the fade in was a
little too long I'm going to go ahead
and shorten that and the fade out wasn't
long enough so let me go ahead and
lengthen that we can do it just like
that now I want to show you guys how to
navigate keyframes whenever you're
working with keyframes this is a problem
that a lot of people have we're saying
all right I think I'm over the keyframe
now so I'm going to go ahead and hit
this and remove it oh crap I
accidentally added another one so let me
go ahead and do this and maybe this oh
crap I added another one what you need
to do whenever you have keyframes
already on there you can navigate them
to the previous and next keyframe so if
you want to automatically pop it to this
keyframe just go
and hit this and it pops you on that
keyframe so now you can go ahead and
remove it or if you want to work with
this one just go ahead and hit this
right arrow and it will pop you to that
one remove it remove remove so that's
how you can add subtract keyframes or
move left and right so basically the
only other things we have to worry about
is this velocity which pretty much don't
worry about this in the blend mode down
here it pretty much says all right if
you have something underneath it how it
blends with it but basically don't even
worry about those I never use them and
unless you are making a really weird
movie then you don't need to worry about
them at all so before I let you go now
that I have some extra time I want to
show you what I do for my podcast and
this is a really cool trick that you
guys can use as well so I go ahead and I
start with a video clip on track number
one and now I pull my title on track
number two so what I want to do is I
want this title to start out just like
this and then I want it to fade in to my
video so let's say I wanted to start
fading out at 3 seconds and from 3
seconds into the end I want this title
to fade out in my video to appear so my
video is underneath my title so we're
good to go already so go ahead and
select your title and expand the opacity
property for it and make sure you're
about three seconds into the title right
now now what I'm going to do is I'm
going to set this to 100% by adding a
keyframe now it's stuck at a hundred
percent until we change it now at five
seconds or the end of the title I'm
going to go ahead and change this to
zero so now between three seconds and
five seconds it gradually fades into my
video pretty cool huh
and at the end of my podcast I do the
exact opposite I fade the title back in
so it's kind of like oh the new boss
didn't check us out my live show or
whatever so now if we go ahead and play
this check it out it plays and around
three seconds
it fades in to my video smooth awesome
transition so again the only thing you
need to remember is these things called
keyframes what they are are basically
points in time and they're points in
time where you tell Premiere Pro all
right at this point in time this is what
I want the effect to be and it's going
to stay that way until you make a new
keyframe and tell it something different
so if we want this to fade up we just go
ahead and apply a new keyframe and at
the beginning apply just like that so
now it will fade in stay and fade out so
there you go hopefully you got a better
idea of what a keyframe is and how to
work with it and again if you just
totally want to reset everything just go
ahead and hit this and it's going to
clear all of your keyframes or you can
go ahead I'm excuse me it's going to
clear the last thing or you can go ahead
and just jump the keyframe delete it
jump the keyframe delete it and delete
all your keyframes until you are totally
cleared out so that's all I have for you
for this tutorial thank you guys for
watching hopefully you got a better
understanding of what keyframes do again
not only opacity but you can do this
whenever you're fading in volume if you
you know you want to bring in a song and
you want to start out quiet and get
louder and louder
whenever you're bringing in a different
effect other than opacity again they all
are the exact same so thank you for
watching don't forget to subscribe and
I'll see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
