and this is a video tutorial for the new
Boston in this video we're going to look
at an ajax request in jquery that lets
you simply load another page into your
current page and what we're going to be
doing is we're going to be creating an
external file which we're then going to
load into a div on our page so the first
thing i'm gonna do is go ahead and
create a button that's going to sort of
initiate this loading so let's go ahead
and create an input button and i'm gonna
give that a value of load now we need to
go over to another page in our text
editor so i'll create a new file in our
text editor and i'm going to actually
create some content i want it to be
displayed from this page so i'm going to
create some strong tags here this has
been loaded in to another page okay so
let's go ahead and in the root directory
let's save this out as let's just call
it page to HTML okay so now that we've
saved page to HTML inside index dot PHP
we need to decide where we want to put
it when we press this button so i'm
gonna create a div underneath here and
i'm gonna give that an ID of content the
button i'm also gonna give an ID and i'm
just gonna call that button so
essentially what we're going to do is
press this button and we're gonna have
this page dot HTML loaded into this div
area here so it's an extremely useful
and simple technique in jquery that
allows you to perform what would usually
take you probably about 15 lines to
write in ajax it alone so let's go ahead
and create an external javascript file
that's going to handle the clicking of
the button and then the loading of the
content into this div so i'm going to
create a new file and
save this inside my Jas directory and
I'm gonna save this as Ajax Jas okay so
now that I've done that I need to
include Ajax Jas on my index.php page so
I'm gonna recreate another script tag
that's going to handle the include of
this file so we've got type is text
forward slash JavaScript and the file we
need to include is J s /a Jax j s
so now Ajax dot J s has been included
into our page successfully we can create
an event handler for this button now the
event handler will then place the page
to HTML inside this div so let's go
ahead and create the event handler we
need to use a selector and we are using
this selector on this ID of button so we
use a hash and then button and we say
dot click so when the button is clicked
we want to go ahead and carry out this
operation to put this page inside the
div so we need to create a function
within this and a block as well using
curly braces now I'm going to pull this
down a couple of lines and inside here
will be the one line of code which will
include this page dot HTML inside this
div so it's extremely extremely simple
to do so the first thing we need to do
is find out where we want to put this
page now that's in this div which i've
called content so we can again use the
selector hash content and now we need to
use the load function so dot load now
inside of load we're gonna take one
parameter or we're going to supply this
with one parameter and that's going to
be the name of the file you want to
include so in this case it's page dot
HTML ok so now that we've done that we
can go ahead to our browser and test
this I'm gonna refresh the page and we
have our load button like we created
earlier
now the div is just underneath here and
hopefully when we press this button
we'll have paged HTML included inside
our content
so we've loaded this page inside of our
content if so let's go ahead and press
load you can see that the text that we
created earlier inside of the HTML file
with the strong tags because you can see
it's been shown in bold has been loaded
into this div area now we've included an
HTML file but this doesn't actually have
to just be an HTML extension let's go
ahead and create a new file and we're
going to call this let's go back to the
root directory I'm gonna call this page
dot PHP okay so I'm going to close page
to HTML now we want to load the contents
of page PHP inside of this div so you
may be wondering can we use PHP code
inside of this in order to load it into
our div well yes of course you can let's
go ahead and just create a simple loop
that's just gonna count from a number
upwards so we'll say count from 1 to 10
so we echo out X so we've created a
simple loop that's going to echo out
numbers from 1 to 10 and then we are
going to display this inside of our
content div so we're using H we're using
PHP code inside of this page dot PHP and
loading that into content so let's go
ahead and click load ok let me just go
back and check if there's anything wrong
okay I think over here yeah we'll use
this here okay so so just a bit of the
logic behind this because I did make a
mistake X is starting at 1 the condition
is then the X while X is less than or
equal to 10 we increment X so the page
did successfully load but the content
didn't show because I had the logic
mixed up let's go ahead and press load
and you can see that we've now loaded
numbers 1 to 10 so we've now
successfully included a PHP file inside
of
our inside of our content div now you
may be thinking can I go ahead and
include image files inside of my content
div for example if I just open up my
directory that I have here and let's
look all the files I've got an image
called tartan jpg so what I'm gonna do
is I'm gonna try and attempt to load
this into my div directly so we load
tartan jpg into our content area now
this would be extremely useful if you
wanted to load a file into a Content
area however the problem with this is is
going to load the file contents as
opposed to interpret it as an image what
we would need to actually do is change
the headers on the document for this
image to be displayed correctly let's go
ahead and see what happens now you'll
see that a load of rubbish will
eventually pop up this is just obviously
the file contents for the image as
opposed to the image directly so using
this load method we can't directly load
an image in however if you were to
include an image on an HTML page you
could then load that in so we've looked
at including a basic HTML file and then
a PHP file with some PHP code in it
obviously you can use other file
extensions as long as the page can be
interpreted by your your server you can
actually load any page in you like with
whatever web development language you
choose to write in so that's essentially
the load function which takes advantage
of Ajax calls that would usually just
include a page inside and like I said
before we've used three lines here with
with Ajax we would probably use about 15
to 20 lines</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
