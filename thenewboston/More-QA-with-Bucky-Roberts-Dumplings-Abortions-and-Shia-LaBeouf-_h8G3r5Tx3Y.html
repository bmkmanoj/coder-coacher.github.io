another video a question and answer
video I got all your guys's questions
just got them in for the last video and
I'm gonna try to answer some for you
so let's see what we got start out or an
X hey Bucky I don't want to ask you
anything just saying hi that's kind of
nice way to get things started so or
next hi to you as well alright what do
we got next banana you Nana neat little
name is it just me or he kind of looks
like Shia LaBeouf that's like the 800
time someone said that people I do not
look like Shia LaBeouf okay
I'm not him come on come on guys all
right
fueled seven what is the best
programming language to start with now
this is highly debatable and I'm going
to get a ton of backlash from this and
people are going to say start with
something simple and build your way up
but I'm going to say start with
something kind of in-depth like Java or
C++ because once you learn a language
like this and know all about objects and
other stuff anything you learn from
there on now it's going to be more
understandable um since if you learn
something like Python or something
simple and then you went to like
objective-c you're going to get what the
heck are objects and what is this and
this if you start with something kind of
like Java or Objective C or C++ and
everything else is going to be a lot
more simple to you and easier to grasp
plus Java is not that hard to learn that
brings me to my next question XOR gate
zero one one zero what is your favorite
programming language and why what's my
favorite probably Java just because not
only it's one of the fastest growing
languages it's so dynamic you can pretty
much do anything you want with it from
3d video game into apps to a you know
put it on any computer you want any even
operating system so uh yeah definitely
Java for much more reasons or a lot more
reasons than I can explain
alright algún Xena algae Xena
do you like Kiwi now I don't know why
you asked
question but I love Kiwi so that was
really weird that you asked that um
whenever I go to the store I don't even
rinse the pesticides off him or anything
because I like the way they taste
I sleeve the stickers in the hair and
everything on it and I just oh so
delicious
I don't know what they do to them but uh
it's good now sneeze brace asked what's
your favorite food um I would have to
say probably either
Beefaroni or pasta Roni or macaroni or
maybe dumplings I pretty much like any
food that ends in Roni or umph wings so
uh I don't really have one just any of
those alright akima hekima maybe I
probably posted this before but you want
Facebook guys I am NOT on Facebook I'm
sorry to tell you and I'll tell you why
if I did have a Facebook then all my
girlfriend's would probably find out
about one another and it would not be
good so you know that's why debit 256 do
you plan to get married or have kids um
no and no but actually a couple years
ago one of these things accidentally did
happen but I had to save up money and
pay for an abortion so uh it was a shame
she was only 19 years old so I didn't
like to watch her go but you know and if
I ever got someone pregnant I would have
no idea what I would do so but anyways
uh let's see
techno junkie can you make more c++
videos PS I did your mom alright uh well
that was uncalled for and unnecessary
unless that's my dad
so which in that case that would also be
uncalled for an unnecessary sale either
way next question
all right some dragon Alex B my question
what would be your dream job my dream
job would definitely be to produce or
direct or anything with digital video I
love it I love putting all the pieces
together editing changing the color
working the sound I love everything
about it so definitely not programming
it is a I mean I wouldn't mind doing
that neither but probably something with
digital video or something along those
lines it would just be fun in something
new every day and let's see the last one
Matt 556 oh three seven the CUA Shia
LaBeouf
all right guys
you know I'm getting kind of tired of
this you know here's what I'm gonna do
I'm gonna set up a poll on my blog
whether it's gonna ask do I look like
Shia LaBeouf or not because at least a
thousand people told me I do and I just
want to tell you guys that I'm not him
if this is what you're searching for I'm
sorry you found me instead so go to my
blog and vote whether I do or do not
look like Shia LaBeouf and all settle
settle this once and for all
so thank you to all the people who asked
regular real questions and if you have
any more questions just leave them um
just leave them on this video so thank
you guys for watching don't forget

blog</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
