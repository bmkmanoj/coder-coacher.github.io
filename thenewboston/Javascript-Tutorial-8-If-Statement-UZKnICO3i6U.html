tutorial and in this tutorial we're
gonna be actually getting into the fun
stuff of JavaScript we're gonna be using
javascript to make a decision for us a
very basic decision but a decision
nonetheless so the first thing we need
before I even start is a couple of these
over variables so you can make yours
anything you want if you want to follow
along with me and copy me I'm gonna set
my number 1 equal to 20 and number 2
equal to 30 now
the first type of decision we can have a
JavaScript make is something called the
if statement and this tells JavaScript
that we only want it to execute a block
of code if one of our conditions is true
if it isn't true then don't even do the
code at all so the syntax for if is you
guess that if now after that you have
parameters and make sure you don't put a
semicolon at the end because it's I know
it's different than everything you
learned before but it's good practice
and in your parameters test whatever
condition that you want to test and
remember if this condition is true then
it's going to execute the code we type
after it so I'm going to say if num1
which is 20 is less than num2 which is
30 then in right here
use your curly braces now whatever we
type in our curly braces is going to be
the code that we execute if it's true so
we say if the number 1 which is 20 is
less than the number 2 which is 30 then
we want you to output on the screen um
we'll just have an output good job Haase
so now here's what's going on we have
two variables right here we have our
condition and this says if this
condition is true then we want yet to go
ahead and do this if it's false then
don't do anything so let's save this and
take a look at what it looks like as you
can see it said good job Hoss and why is
this because the number 120 is less than
the number 230 well that's what if we
had that switch around and what if we
had if number 2 is less than the number
1 if 30 is less than 20 then what do you
think it's going to do
well I can't do this because this only
happens if it's true so let's save it
and take a look at what it looks like as
you can see I keep refreshing this page
and nothing happens so this is a way
where you can only execute a block of
code if a certain condition is right for
instance you could have someone type in
the name like you can have a prompt
command and all have equal to Bobby and
then you can have if prompt equals Bobby
then alert hi Bobby
and if not then just move on to the rest
of screen
so this is a very basic way of how we
can use JavaScript to make a very basic
decision and in the next tutorial I'm
going to be talking even more about it
but it doesn't get really that hard it
just gets easier and easier we have and
we can make it make more than one
decision right now we're just making one
in the next tutorial we're gonna give it
more choices but that's for another time
so keep on watching and keep on or write
in my videos thanks bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
