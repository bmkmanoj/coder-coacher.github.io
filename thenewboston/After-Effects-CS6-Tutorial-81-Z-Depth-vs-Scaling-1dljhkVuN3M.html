After Effects cs6 tutorial my name is
buddy Blackford and today we're going to
be going over the comparison between Z
depth and scale and I pretty much like
to compare this in the real world to a
billboard and pretty much when you're in
the real world and you're dropping past
in a car and you see a billboard you
look at it and it looks fine it looks
like it's crisp and you can read
everything fine but if you ever have
walked up close to a billboard you can
see that it's been blown out and it's
killed up really huge it's just a
picture that's been scaled massively so
when you come up to it it's like looking
at it like this if i zoom in on my eye
five g's if i zoom in on my background
here you'll see that it's all pixelated
and everything I'm at 400% and sometimes
that's pretty much what a billboard
might be zoomed in as and it'll look all
like pixelated and stuff like this now I
added this moon into here and we're at a
hundred percent now and I color
corrected it a little bit so it looked
like it was something that was supposed
to be in this scene now if you pretty
much you can't tell but I have scaled
this moon up a hundred and fifty percent
now if I try to scale that up 150
percent in 2d mode it would look all
blurry and crappy and everything so let
me take off this 2d right our 3d mode
right here and I'm gonna have to pull
this over so we can see it this is how
much I scaled it
and it's you can see it's I'm at a
hundred percent right now it's blurry in
the middle you can't really tell all the
different things and it's the edges are
all blurry too so I'm gonna put it back
where it was and then put it back into
the 3d mode so it's back where it was
and now you can't tell the reason that
you can't tell is because I took the
moon and I moved it back in z space
pretty far so let me pull up the
position and I moved it back 3348
no three thirty three thousand four
hundred and eighty two I wanted this to
be really far back because if I ever
move the camera and I don't want it to
move I don't want it to look like the
moon is actually moving when I move the
camera in because that's not how it
would work in the real world and since
it's so far back I'm able to scale it up
I could probably even skilled up even
more if I wanted to like probably a lot
cuz I have it back there pretty far and
it's you can't tell that it's being
scaled or if it's blurry on the edges so
that's a that's how I'm trying to
explain this Z depth versus versus scale
if you push something back in Z depth
and then scale it up that's still okay
if you have it close to the camera and
you try to scale it up and it's closer
to you in Z depth that's not okay it's
going to make it pixelated and blurry so
if you're trying to make something
bigger but in a Z in a 3d scene just
you're gonna have to either start with a
large picture or you're gonna have to
adjust its position in the Z depth and
then scale it so that's pretty that's
just a quick tip for you I just wanted
to go over it hopefully that made sense
and just think of like the billboard
analogy where if something is far away
it can be scaled up and still
fine that's all I got for you in this
quick tip but sometimes people don't
realize this and can't figure out why
their image is looking all crappy and
everything so I'm going to just end the
tutorial here and let you guys try that
kind of stuff in your scene on your own
so have a good one guys keep on using
After Effects to make awesome stuff and
I'll see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
