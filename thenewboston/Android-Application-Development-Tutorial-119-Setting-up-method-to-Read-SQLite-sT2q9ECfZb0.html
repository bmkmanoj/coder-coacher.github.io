and 19th Android tutorial for the new
boss in and just briefly before we get
started I just want to show you guys if
you guys we're having some troubles also
what we can do with this catch exception
because right now it's not really doing
anything besides setting it to false we
can also set up a dialog where we're
gonna refer to the exception itself
which is called E and we're just gonna
say dot will set up a string and we'll
call this err we're gonna set this equal
to e dot to string and then we can just
basically instead of this text here we
can set it equal to our error string so
we can get a little bit more information
if if we are having a problem so we
might change this that to dang it
and we just finish off that statement
and what we're gonna do in this
tutorials we're actually gonna get our
data from our database so we're actually
going to work with SQL view and again if
you open up here we have this text view
which we referred to as text view SQL
information so what we want to do is we
want to set up our text view the
reference here quickly so we're just
gonna get that set up
so I clipped the video got a phone call
so I'd pick that up but there we go we
set up a reference and now we have this
text view that's related to that text
view and all we're gonna do is basically
let's let's set up our method for the
most part and then we'll define it so we
have a text view and then we're gonna
create our hot-or-not class and we're
gonna call this our table or actually
info we'll call it info and we're just
gonna say new hot or not and again pass
in the context of this class and now
what we want to do is we actually want
to again just refer to our info just say
dot open then what we want to do is we
want to create a string so we're gonna
call this string info our string
data and we're gonna just basically say
our info dot get data so obviously we
don't have that get data class but
that's we're gonna set up here again
just to get kind of familiar with how we
can you know just create methods for the
most part and use them so basically what
we want is we want to return some kind
of a string from this get data method
and then what we're gonna do is we're
gonna set our textview set text to
basically our string that we got the
data from if that makes any sense
so again we just opened up our
hot-or-not class got the string from
this method that we haven't created yet
and we close it and then we just set our
content view to that to the information
that we got so let's just hover over
here and we're gonna say create method
get data and type hot-or-not and as you
can see right here it sets it up for us
for the most part it sets it up for us
and now what we want to do is we
basically want to create a string array
we're gonna call this columns and we're
gonna say new string array and within
here we're gonna say key row ID comma
key name ID or key name and key hotness
so those are again our three columns
that we have within our database alright
I clipped the video because it was
taking too long to finish this specific
tutorial so I'll probably just leave it
off at this point and I'll catch you
guys in the next tutorial have a good
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
