21st physics lesson and in this lesson I
want to show you guys an example of a
gun and a bullet because I think that
this is a much more simple explanation
of the conservation of momentum so
hopefully I can draw a gun let's see how
well I can drive so here's my gun and
here's the barrel and we'll draw the
little trigger right here alright so you
know I think I'm going to add a handle
because this is a pretty good-looking
gun might as well keep it going so there
is your gun right here and inside the
gun you have a bullet now well bullet
usually looks something like that and my
Balilla my bullet looks a little bit
like something else but anyways this is
a gun and that is a bullet let me go
ahead and label this you probably can't
even see that bullet and gun for some
reason I really like labeling things and
gun so let me go ahead and the only
other thing I want to do is write the
formula for momentum which is momentum
there we go that's how you spell it
mass times velocity now I want to write
this down because it's pretty important
and I'm going to keep referring to it in
my example so right now like I said
let's go ahead and figure out the total
momentum of the system well you guys are
probably saying wait a minute okay
what's the mass of the bullet what's the
mass of the gun you know what it doesn't
matter because the velocity of this
entire system is zero because obviously
it's not moving you're not you know
doing a drive-by or anything so since
the velocity is zero no matter what the
mass is the momentum has to be zero too
so just remember that the total momentum
of the system is zero before the event
now the events of course is the firing
of the gun now whenever the gun gets
fired this bullet goes zooming out here
at an
extremely high velocity and I'll
symbolize that by writing up arrow
velocity or V now in addition to the
high velocity in comparison to the gun
itself this bullet is just a little
piece of metal so therefore it has a
very low mass and I'll symbolize that by
writing down arrow mass now whenever you
fire a bullet it's not like the bullet
only moves and that's it
there is a little bit of kickback in the
gun now whenever there is a kickback in
the gun a couple things are happening
that we need to take note of first of
all it kicks back it kicks back in an
opposite direction and in comparison to
the bullet itself the gun is this big
chunk of metal so it has a very high
mass and in comparison to the speed or
velocity of the bullet it has a very low
velocity of course the kickback itself
isn't as fast as the bullet flying
through the air so let's go ahead and
look at this again two things are
causing momentum first of all the bullet
which has a high velocity in the low
mass and second the gun which is kicking
back in an opposite direction and this
has a high mass but a low velocity so
pretty much the opposite of the bullet
so in this case scenario in in every
case scenario whenever you fire a gun
momentum is conserved therefore the
total momentum of the system is zero
after why is this the case well even
though we don't know the exact mass of
the bullet or the gun we know that the
bullet and the gun both have momentum
but their momentum is pretty much moving
in opposite direction so they cancel
each other out why do they cancel each
other out well like I said because
they're moving in opposite directions
and the momentum of both the bullet and
the gun is always going to add up to
zero so there is probably a more simple
explanation using a gun in a bullet
because you know you probably are going
to fire a gun more often then you're
going to tie two cards together with a
spring and a rope and cut them
so hopefully guys understand about the
conservation of momentum now and yeah
that's all I got to say about that so
think guys for watching and I'll see you
guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
