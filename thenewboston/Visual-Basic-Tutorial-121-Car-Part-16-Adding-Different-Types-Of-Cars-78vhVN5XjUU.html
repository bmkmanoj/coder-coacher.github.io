slash on live gamer for the new Boston
and this tutorial we're gonna be working
more on the car program now I've got a
lot lined up for this tutorial and it
will probably end up be being split into
more than one part for this one tutorial
so I might switch back and forth between
different points that I want to talk
about so if you remember the only type
of car we have been working with is the
car we have now been using sports cars
or trucks with new car or the name of
the color of the doors etc so what we
want to do is be able to add trucks and
sports cars to our to our list right
here and access the attributes of them
so let's go over here to form one and
now I showed you a way of using selected
car to get these selected car that's of
the index
well now what we can do is instead of
having that being limited to only being
a car we can come down here to button
set name and we can get the item at the
index of the cars array list so we'll
just type cars and then we'll do list
cars dot selected index so what this is
going to do is it's going to get the car
name of the car at the selected index of
where they selected it so this can be a
sports car or a truck or just a normal
car and it will get the car name value
of that so let's just go ahead and
change some of these values so we'll
type cars and then that index of list
cars dot selected index now we could go
through and manually change each one of
these but there's an easier way to do
this we can just go ahead and press ctrl
F and it will bring up the Find and
Replace menu so what do we want to find
we want to find Scylla
did car so you can see that it went
ahead and found that the next one for us
we can go ahead and replace this with
cars at index of list cars dot selected
lengths are not length or wide I said
selected index so let's just go ahead
and get this out of here and we'll
replace all or what was go ahead and
replace this one right here yeah quit
dropping in there so we replace replace
and let's make this a little bit smaller
we'll just keep replacing until we get
back up to the first selected car which
is right there okay so now that we've
replaced all of these inside of our
button event handlers let's go ahead and
test it out and see if it works
so we'll minimize these just to organize
the code a little better and we'll run
this so we'll select Mustang GT we'll
set the name of it and you can see we
get old named Mustang GT we can just
name it the on live gamer of GT click OK
and it's going to update it for us so
that way we can use objects to type
other than a selected cars so now what
we can do is we can allow the user to
build a different kind of car in their
new car form right here so we can have
them make a truck or a car or a sports
car so to do this let's go ahead and
come over to form 1 DB and we're going
to add a combo box right here now this
isn't the best-looking program but you
guys can change it around to whatever
you want to make it look a little bit
better so here's our combo box and we
want to go ahead and go to the
collections in the property
or the items so we'll add car truck and
sports car and so now if we click OK the
user has the option to choose either a
car truck or sports car when they create
a new car so just like that now let's go
ahead and come over here to our new car
BB and what we're gonna do is we are
going to create a public variable called
vehicle type as let's say string so
whenever the user selects something from
the combo box and clicks new car we're
gonna get what they selected and use it
in our new car form so instead of saying
name of car it might say name of truck
or name of sports car so we'll come back
over here to for Mondavi beam and
whenever they click button create car
it's gonna call the create car method
that we have so we need to do is we need
to come down here we have our add new
car form it's a new car form and we show
the dialog so now all we need to do is
use an if statement so if and we need to
come back in here and rename our combo
box to something that is easy to
remember so I'll do combo card types go
back to the code so if combo card types
dot selected index is equal to let's say
zero which is car at least I think it is
you know we got card truck in the sports
car so if the index is zero then what do
we want to do we want to run everything
that is in here so we'll just come down
here and then type and if once again so
if the selected index is equal to zero
we want to have it show the new car form
and it's going to create a new car
object but we want to go ahead and set
the the string from new car that is our
vehicle type so we want to set add new
car we want to set the vehicle type to
the type that they are selected so we're
gonna go ahead and copy this so if it's
equal to zero then we want to go ahead
and set the appropriate values so add
new car vehicle type equals combo car
types
dot selected and let's see is it item
oh yeah let's do selected item that
should give us
sorry about that alarm but that should
give us the text that is inside of the
combo box
so whatever the vehicle type is it's
going to send that back to our new car
object that we've created</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
