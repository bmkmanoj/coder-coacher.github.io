can run and jump and he also has a nice
little world that he can you know play
in but the thing is there's really
nothing interesting for him to do he's
just you know just having a good time
all the time running around pretty
freakin boring so let's go ahead and add
an enemy so he'll actually have
something to kill and something can also
injure him and kill him as well so in
order to add an enemy of course we need
to add another spray object so double
click anywhere in your game
select sprite and insert this and just
go ahead and click anywhere right here
for now now the first thing we want to
do is actually import the sprite strip
of the enemy now mine is right here and
of course it's a just a snail that curls
around so select the strip itself and
hit open and that's proper and of course
just like before we're gonna delete the
first one hold shift crop all of them
and also on the origin actually have a
origin tool selected already hit - so
remember you always want to at the
bottom metal for platformer games
enemies in your main player and apply
this origin the entire animation so now
once we verify that all right good to go
however there's a couple things that you
guys might want to tweak for me I'm
gonna go ahead and select this animation
first of all I'm gonna speed them up a
little bit to 15 because a 5 is just
like really slow and another thing that
I want to do is I'm gonna set this
looping to yes so basically this is just
um an animation of a snail crawling and
of course once he gets done with like
one thruster or whatever you call it um
I just want him to keep doing it over
and over again until either we kill him
or he kills us so close out of that and
it's gonna place him on your screen and
I'm going to rename him snail enemy so
now we have this now that's uh well
pretty much behaving just like we wanted
to animating properly and now
go ahead and add some intelligence so
basically just like any other platformer
game the goal of our player is to kill
this now and if you ever played Super
Mario or Sonic the Hedgehog which I'm
sure you guys have you can kill enemies
by jumping on top of them however if you
just run into them from the side or they
run into you then they hurt you so
that's how it can hurt you and that's
how you kill them so now let's add this
intelligence to our game so the first
thing that I like to do is actually add
another behavior to this player so click
on the player and then click behaviors
and I'm gonna add this flash behavior
right here and what this does is
whenever it's activated it makes your
player temporary temporarily blink now I
don't even know if you guys know this
but pretty much in every platformer game
you ever played whenever you user got
hurt he blinked like on and off and that
just resembles that's just feedback to
the user playing your game that all
right that's not good I probably
shouldn't run into the snow from the
side and then you can like deduct a
health or kill your players take a life
whatever but whenever he blinks it means
this dude's getting hurt so now I want
to test for a couple things I first want
to test when this player collides with
this now whenever they collide it can
mean to one of two things if he was
jumping on top of them when he collided
then that means the snail gets killed if
he collides with them from the side that
means the dude gets killed so let's go
ahead in our event sheet and add that
functionality right now so the first
thing we need is to check is the player
colliding with us now so player box and
there's actually under collision is on
collision with another object so we want
to say when this player is colliding
with this snail hit done and then say
what do we want to test
well we actually need to test two things
but first let's test if he is falling in
other words did he jump on the snail so
whenever your events
fit hit s and that's gonna add a sub
event and of course we need the test is
this player box falling and there's
actually really cool right here on her
platform is falling so of course if the
player box was falling that must have
meant he was jumping in other words
jumped on the snail so the action I
guess I had the action right now the
action for this whenever he jumps on the
snail we just wanted to kill this now in
other words it's now enemy destroy so
did the player collide with the snail if
so was he falling if he was falling or
jumping on this now
killed us now now I also want to add one
other thing and if you right-click this
right here you can press add another
condition now well let me go ahead and
type it and then you guys are going to
understand what I mean the player box
which is the player itself I'm going to
test the Y position compare Y right here
and I want to test F less - just now
enemy Y and this is pretty much saying
the wise snail position and I'm gonna
click done and then I'm instead of uh
talking guys through so I'm gonna just
code it all and then um say guys what it
means in a second set that form vector
if I can set back to Y
Victor why 700 looks good alright so
this is basically saying well give you
guys like the how to what your game is
gonna look at it and pretty much ask did
the player collide with the snail if he
did make sure that your player was
falling and also make sure the players
position is above the snail and the
reason I added this other thing right
here is because you don't want to have
this case where they like jump on the
snail and they're falling but they but
though a player is like right here where
their position is below the snail but um
they're still falling in this case you
want the player today so basically what
we're checking is are they jumping on
top of them properly where they need to
be so if so destroy the snail of course
that's the purpose and also what this
does is it sets the vector Y of a player
to - 700 now what that does is it
basically makes his position shoe up a
little bit because negative in the Y
position is up so you basically hop on
the snail and if you kill it then it's
just gonna make you bounce a little bit
so instead of just doing that I'll show
you guys so jump and you see how there's
that little bounce right at the end I
think that gives it a really cool effect
so again if you don't if you just jump
in like that you just land on the ground
and sticks though well once you land on
the snail you give it a little bounce
and it just lets your player react and I
know it's just better feedback like you
actually did something so that's better
than jumping right through the snow and
just landing on the ground so now that
we know how to kill the snail what we
need to do now is actually have that
snow move around left to right and well
do a couple other things as well before
this game is actually complete so for
now thank you guys for watching and well
I'll see you next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
