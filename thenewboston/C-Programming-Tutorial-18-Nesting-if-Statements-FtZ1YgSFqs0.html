we did is we made a very simple program
to test the users age we'll add them to
input some number which was their age
and if it was 18 or greater we just said
you may enter the website if not then we
said nothing to see here
simple stuff but now what I want to do
is I want to say this if they were
allowed to enter the website then let's
just go ahead and give them a custom
welcome message based on their gender so
of course we need a variable for gender
name a gender and we also need a place
for them to input it so we'll just copy
this and we'll put something like what
is your gender and make sure to give
them options we'll say m / f because let
me go ahead and tuck this so I don't
forget gender percent C now the reason
that you only always want to give them
options is because if you just ask the
question then some users might type in
male some users might type in dude some
users might just press f you want to
give them one option only on how they're
supposed to format their answers and
also another thing I want to point out
and you guys should probably do this all
the time is sometimes whenever you put
this percent D for scanf but it right up
against the quotation mark it sometimes
can confuse your computer not a lot
whenever the users inputting numbers but
especially with characters and like
words and stuff like that so it's common
practice and I'll do it from now on to
add a space between the quotation mark
and the percentage sign again it depends
on your compiler and all that stuff but
this is kind of behind the scenes stuff
it's always good programming practice to
leave that space again your program
might work with it without a boat let's
have it anyways so what we're going to
do is let's go ahead and put our code
right in here so basically we're going
to be putting an if statement inside
another if statement so basically we're
telling our computer to test this thing
first and if it's true test something
else and of course we want to test their
gender
so if gender is equals equals two
because we want to make sure it's
exactly equal to and we'll just do a
we'll say if they entered em first for
male so single quotes em so right now it
says you may enter this website with a
space after it and so let's just go
ahead and print out on what would you
print out for a guy something like dude
so well let me go ahead and finish this
code and then it'll be easy to see
what's going on now if their gender
equals F they must be a girl so what do
we say to them milady
so basically I'll run this program right
now show you guys a quick example how
old are you I am 27 what is your gender
I am a male hit enter and it says you
may enter this website dude
pretty cool now let's go ahead and run
that again and we'll say okay but what
if I don't know it's my sister how what
are you 15 hit enter what is your gender
she is a female and hit enter one more
time it says nothing to see here and
that other decision never gets made
because basically what's going to happen
is it's going to say okay you're not
above 18 so I'm going to hop right down
here I'm going to actually skip all over
all of this crap right here and I don't
even use that gender variable ever again
now actually show you guys what I'm
talking about right now say that uh we
actually didn't use that space and I
know it works on or it doesn't work on
this compiler and we try to run this
program how order you okay looking good
27 hit enter Oh what the heck it then
even it just ran right past that scanf
right here and it didn't even give me
another option so this gender variable
never even gets filled it pretty much is
a bug and it skips over the program so
if you ever you know one
program with a bug then that's how you
do that why would you want to do that
you would never want to do this so just
don't do that I'm just showing you guys
um make sure you have your spaces in
there from now on and that's what we're
going to be doing so anyways thank you
guys for watching don't forget subscribe
and I'll see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
