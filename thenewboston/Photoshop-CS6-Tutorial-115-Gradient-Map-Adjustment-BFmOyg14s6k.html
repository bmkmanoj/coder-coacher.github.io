Photoshop cs6 tutorial in this tutorial
were going to go over the gradient map
adjustment and what the gradient map
adjustment it does is it replaces the
tonal values of the image with color
supplied by a gradient that you choose
so it's a good tool for creating special
color effects or inverting the gray
scales of your colors or um there's some
other things that it's also good for so
let's go ahead and go ahead and open up
the image that you want to use then go
to image go to adjustments and then
we'll go to gradient map the first thing
it does is it brings up a gradient map
that's already chosen so let's go ahead
and click on this arrow here so we can
click get the gradient picker now here's
a couple of gradients that Photoshop has
chosen for us and you can choose black
and white now the gradient goes from the
left to the right the left is going to
be the shadows the middle here is going
to be the mid-tones and the right is
going to be the highlights now we can
reverse this to invert the image and we
get a crazy cat or we can click on
dither here and what the dealer does it
is it adds random noise to smooth out
the gradient and reduces banding so
let's just so you'd know what that means
so you can it's up to you if you want to
use deter or not sometimes you can see
see how nice it looks and sometimes you
can so let's go ahead and I wanted to
show you something else once we click on
this and we go to our options here right
here which is this little gear we can
load presets and say presets and all
that stuff and then we've got some
presets here that are pretty nice
especially this one called photographic
toning let's click on that and we'll hit
OK and save changes ok we'll hit yes
that's fine no actually we're not so now
we've got these better looking toning
methods here if I click on one
we get these different tones here we go
it looks pretty nice we get some
different looking effects going on here
that we can use as like a color cast
almost with our images some of them work
well in certain images and some of them
don't now if I hit cancel here and go
over to our gradient map over here which
is the picture of the gradient I can
also wear that here it is
do the same thing photographic toning
okay and then we've got our toning ones
here so you can do it from the
adjustment layer so same thing so you've
also got other ones here like the
special effects you know okay and we've
got a couple special effects here ooh
psychedelic hope you guys aren't
watching this on mushrooms because you
may be freaking out right about now so
we've got some cool ones this one's
pretty crazy well that's about it for
the gradient map and you've got the same
same things going on here we've got our
dither we've got our reverse here and
the reverse is gonna be the same because
it's the same thing going on throughout
here it's like a reversible so that's it
for the gradient map and hopefully guys
can use some of these special effects to
make your image look pretty cool and
that's it so thanks for watching
everybody have a good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
