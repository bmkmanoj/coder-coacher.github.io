this is a second video for the new
Boston on timestamps now when we want to
display a date we can display the
current date we've already established
how to do that now what if I wanted to
display a date that was say a couple of
days ago or a week ahead or in fact I
wanted to read in a particular date and
store it as a timestamp now when you're
storing data for example dates in
databases it's always recommended you
store as a timestamp therefore making it
available to process that day and in
many different ways possible so at the
moment you can see we've got the time
we've grabbed from a timestamp we've got
the actual time which has been formatted
however what if I want to just up here
let's just remove this as well otherwise
it won't make sense
what happens if just up here I want to
change the date I want to change the
date to say a week ago okay so today
today is April the 1st and 2011 so what
I want to do is I want to change the
time and I want to say the time is equal
to in fact what we'll do is we won't do
that here we'll establish the time stamp
here and then here what we'll do is
we'll say we can either say plus or
minus a certain a certain amount of
seconds so what we can do is we can say
minus 20 so time minus 20 that's 20
seconds before what we're looking at so
let's refresh this now at the moment
this shows an hour that's probably a bad
idea we'll say minus 60 for a minute so
let's refresh
so this says it reads 824 and 50 seconds
now looking at my clock on my computer
it's actually 825 so now it's 826 on my
computer
so we've gone back an hour so now what
we could probably do is say time now
equals or copy and paste that over to
here get rid of that and append a break
on to that in fact no we won't wheel
time modified so I'm just setting on my
variables so they look a bit nicer so
now what we can do is echo a sentence
here so the time now is time now a break
on to there and say the time modified is
and space and time modified so let's
refresh this page and see what we get so
the time now is Friday April 2011 and
you can see this 26:55 however this
one's 25 55 because remember we - 60
seconds however there's a really useful
function in PHP and that is called an
STR - time and what this allows you to
do is take a string data for time so we
could say plus one week and that would
return a timestamp with a week's worth
of seconds added on to it so we can test
this in here we could say plus and then
we could say STR - time
remember this is string data with
converting a string to a timestamp we
can create say plus one week now if we
refresh this the time now will the time
now will show a or we're looking at the
date in this case Friday and April we've
added a week on so we are looking at
only Thursday 1916 and plus
Oh L don't know one week there we go so
refresh right this might just be my okay
there class one week and what that
should do is know in actual fact looking
at this logically okay right right okay
so what I've done is I'm returning the
timestamp and adding on something we
don't need to so if I was to say st at a
time this is already including the
timestamp and then we're adding a week
on so let's just try this again and
refresh okay so now you can see that
it's gone from Friday to Friday however
if we were to say - one week this is
probably a better example because now
we're going to go back into March we've
changed this now to March so let's just
put this as D and refresh so first of
April and let's put this as a D small
small D lowercase D and it's refresh
okay perfect so now we've got a textual
represent an americorps representation
of the day so first of April 2011 we've
gone back a week which is the 25th of
March so now what what happens if we say
+1 year obviously going to take
ourselves into 2012
so we've got 1st of April 2011 plus and
then the modified is 1st of April 2012
but what we can also do is we can do
things like combinations so what we can
do is we can say plus 1 week 2 hours 30
seconds okay so what we're now doing is
we're adding a week 2 hours and 30
seconds so let's just refresh we'll
check the first let's first of April and
it's 20 31 so we're now ended up with
the 8th of April which is a week later
with 22 and you can see that we've done
2 hours and the 30 seconds is been added
on
so we've got 35 here and we've got 5
here so we're going into the next minute
so this is a really great way to modify
your times depending on your needs
obviously these functions can be used
alone you can use them to feed in a time
stamp so we could say time - and we
could say 30 seconds so let's refresh
we've gone back to this again so I think
it appears that we know yeah we're not
going to use this because because of the
nature of how the function works however
we can obviously use this alone we can
use the STR time and then say a week
however if we wanted to go back let's
say let's say for example 30 seconds 30
minutes let's just say well we'll
enclose this in brackets first and then
we can say two hours or a and we'll just
say like seven days for example so seven
days two hours 30 seconds and 30 minutes
so what we're doing is we're multiplying
everything together to create the
seconds now let's refresh the page and
we can see that what we're doing is
we're taking this back seven days so
we've got first of April mmm let's just
try changing this to 24 hours - what
result we come up with let's refresh
okay so um it's taken us back 24 hours
24 hours let's just double-check that 24
hours then another two hours and that's
back to the 31st of March so yeah 24
hours we've been taken back not sure why
this 7 days isn't working
but anyway it's just something to
research and have a look at it's very
hard to explain every single point of
timestamps because there's so many
functions within PHP that deal with the
time so be sure to have a little
research
around have a look around and the
php.net manual is full of information
about this and you can view live
examples but this is generally how we
would use time stamps and how useful
they can actually be</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
