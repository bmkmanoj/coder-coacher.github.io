Photoshop cs6 tutorial
I'm your host buddy Blackford and today
I'm going to go over the minimum
requirements for your computer to be
able to run Photoshop cs6 I'm going to
add in my input what I think you should
really have to run cs6 so see since cs6
can be ran on Windows and Mac systems
I'm going to post up both of them so you
know what to have or what you need to
upgrade on your computers so I use a PC
and I'm going to be more knowledgeable
about using the Windows platform than I
am the Mac but I do know I have used
Mac's before several times just never
actually like have been able to like
build a Mac since I usually just buy
them from the store and they're already
built I guess I like to build my own
computers and window or pcs so I've got
a little bit of an advantage when I'm
talking about Windows over Mac anyways
I'm not going to get into like Windows
versus Mac debates but we'll leave that
for you guys to decide in the forum's
so for Windows we're going to need we're
going to have a couple processors that
are our minimum requirements here and
you're going to need a Intel Xeon
Centrino or Pentium 4 and these are the
minimum requirements
anything that's I've been created later
than these you can also use and it's
recommended to any of these will be fine
to run Photoshop cs6 for the Mac it's
the Intel based Mac processors for your
operating system the lowest for Windows
is Vista and I would recommend getting
something like either Windows 7 or
Windows 8 which can handle
more memory for being able to use the
Photoshop cs6 64-bit which I'll talk
about next in the next tutorial for the
Mac you need the OS X 10.6 point 6 for
both systems you're going to need one
gigabyte available on your hard drive of
course you're going to want to have way
more than that available because your
pictures and then your Photoshop files
and everything like that but this is
what you need to be able to install it
on your system my recommendation is to
get another hard drive either an
external hard drive or another hard
drive internal hard drive that you use
just the store stuff on as a backup in
case some of your files get corrupted or
your hard drive gets corrupted somehow
you'll have a backup it the worst thing
is to have worked on a bunch of programs
made a bunch of cool stuff and your hard
drive fails and then you lose everything
now you have nothing to put show on your
demo reels or show in your portfolio or
anything like that to other people that
might want to hire you who are you or
use you as a Photoshop expert for RAM
which is memory you're going to need for
both one gigabyte of ram minimum now two
gigabytes is recommended by Adobe for
using Photoshop I would recommend having
at least 4 to 8 gigabytes of RAM because
when you start using Photoshop if you if
you can use Photoshop cs6 64-bit though
Ram will hire Ram will give you a better
performance now for video card you can
have both of these 16 bit 256 megabytes
video cards I would recommend having
a at least a 1 gigabyte video card to
256 is probably going to be a little
slow so get a 1 gigabyte video card
anything that's been made in the past
like 2 years will probably be good for
your monitor same thing for both 102 4
by 768 is the resolution that you're
going to want now in my opinion it's if
you're going to be using Photoshop a lot
and you plan on making a living out of
it I would get the best monitor that you
could afford it should be an HD monitor
with like a 1080p resolution at least
and it should be able to handle lots of
colors so an LED monitor would be nice
but get the best one that you can
because the whole thing about Photoshop
is um working with a lot of colors to
make sure that what you're working on
looks good on not just your monitor but
like everywhere else so if your colors
are all effed up on your monitor then
they're going to be effed up everywhere
else and you're going to be like crap I
didn't didn't realize that it looks so
crappy so make sure you that you get a
pretty good monitor the best that you
can afford so those are just a
requirements that you need the minimum
requirements and then I give you my my
recommendations myself so yeah that's I
guess that's it
I always have a hard time ending all
these tutorial videos not really sure
how to end them in like a way that
sounds cool but I'm just like - thank
you guys for watching and subscribe to
keep updated on all the Photoshop
tutorials that are going to be coming
out soon so I'm going to be making a
bunch of them and I'd like to thank you
guys for watching them so see you guys
later
have a good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
