with a video tutorial for the new Boston
in this tutorial we're going to look at
implementing jQuery into a page and just
testing if it actually works or not so
one of the things that we need to do
first of all is go over to the jQuery
comm home page and you'll see here that
we can actually download jQuery now
there's a production and a development
version and you're going to need to
choose the production version the
development version you'll notice is
slightly larger it's two to nine KB and
this is uncompressed code now the reason
for this development version is if you
are developing plugins and need access
to the uncompressed code for jQuery
however the production version is only
31 kilobytes and is minified and gzipped
now let's take a look at the difference
between them quickly you'll see that the
uncompressed code just looks like normal
javascript a large large file as as you
would expect from a 2 to 9 KB file let's
go and look at the production version
you can see that it's still long but it
has been compressed to create a shorter
file size so once you have the
production version selected go ahead and
download you jQuery it should open up in
your browser as code what you're going
to want to do is select the entire page
and copy it to your clipboard copy now
we want to come over to your text editor
and before we paste it into a file we'll
just have a look at our directory
structure before we continue now when I
write any JavaScript code I keep it in a
file called Jas index dot PHP is the
file that we've got currently open here
and Jas is where I would keep all of my
JavaScript and files so let's just look
in JavaScript you can see that I've
created a file called jQuery Jas I've
given it a Jas extension and that's the
file we've also got open in our text
editor so essentially what I'm going to
do is I'm going
to copy and paste the code from jQuery
I'm going to paste it into this jQuery
j/s file let's go back again now inside
index dot PHP and I'm going to include
this jQuery file that is found in the
J's folder so that's essentially the
directory structure we're going to be
keeping and where we place jQuery in
order to include it into our page so
like I said I've got this jQuery J's
file open in the J's folder and I'm just
going to paste the code that I retrieved
from the jQuery comm website now I'm
going while I've saved out and I need to
come over to index dot PHP in order to
include it into my page so how do we
include it well usually when you're
writing code JavaScript code you would
start in your head and you would do
something like script type is equal to
text forward slash JavaScript so we've
got the type attribute in the script tag
and then we would come down and we would
end our script and we would write our
JavaScript code in here now because
jQuery is a 31 KB file and we need the
body of the document to load before we
actually use things like event event
handling you'll notice in the last
example I showed you with the hide and
show button we actually need to allow
every element in our page to be able to
load before we actually start to check
for elements so we're not going to be
writing any code or including any files
in the head part of our document we're
going to be doing it at the very end of
our body so let's go ahead and type
script type equals text forward slash
JavaScript and let's go ahead and end
that script there now usually you would
write your code in here however what
we're doing is we're including this just
because we don't want to paste our code
into our document so it would work if
you were to paste the jQuery
file into this document let's just wait
for that to load
okay so I've just managed to get rid of
that because the file size of that
crashed my browser so the example didn't
really work however my point is that we
could write our JavaScript code inside
of here however what we're doing is
we're just simply starting this script
tag and ending it but we're supplying
the source attribute so we can say J s
/j query J s now because we've pasted
our jQuery code in here this is now
available to use in this document we can
write all of our code up here and we'll
still have use of the jQuery library so
now what we want to do now that we've
included jQuery entire page is actually
testing whether it works so in the next
video we're going to be short creating
some short inline jQuery which is highly
discouraged just so we can test the
functionality of jQuery and see if it's
worked by including it by this method
you'll often find that if you were to
include jQuery and you did it you didn't
do it properly you'll have no control or
use of jQuery at all so extremely it's
extremely important if we just create a
simple inline test just to see if it's
worked now if you're not sure of the
difference or the similarities or you
know the rights or wrongs of inline or
external JavaScript then this will be
explained in another video and we you'll
be able to understand why it's not so
good to use inline JavaScript or jQuery
now if you remember the example we
looked at a couple of videos back you'll
notice that I was using external
javascript and there was no actual
JavaScript present within my button or
the paragraph that I you that I was
actually hiding and showing so we'll
look at that in another video however in
the next video we'll look at a quick
example to see if jQuery is working on
