want to add some text fields and that's
because I don't even know if I said this
but I want this um demo to resemble a
login screen so we'll say that the user
has to enter their email and their
password and then they click a button to
login so a really simple login screen so
we're going to add two text fields let's
type text field what I want to do with
this first one is I just want to take it
and I want to align it actually right
above the middle but I want to align it
somewhere on the right-hand side looks
good all right good enough and now I
want to add a label and this label is
going to align to the left side and make
sure that it lines up with the middle of
that text field so all right we'll
change out colors and everything in just
a second but now this will let me change
the text on this so this will be for the
email type email and hit enter now I
would deselect that text field and I
don't want to position it right in the
center so all right that'll be good
enough and one more label that'll say
email
or I mean password alright so those look
pretty good let's just change the first
of all the font color to white so if you
go to your attributes again with this
item selected you can click color and
there are a bunch of different ways that
you can select the colors what I can do
is well I might as well just go to this
select white clothes feel like a little
kid selecting from the Korean section
this isn't professional all all right
so whatever art so now that we got that
taken care of what I'm going to do now
is I'm going to grab this bottom
password input I'm going to start
dragging it across just so where am I
going to put it so somewhere right there
and I know you guys can't see the little
blue line but you're going to be able to
feel a little snap and what that snap
does is it says okay this is position as
far is left is I want you to because
obviously there are some guidelines that
we shouldn't position different elements
on a certain width for one another so
whenever you have a snap it actually
means something so you should probably
think about stopping there
whenever you're positioning things
around so that looks pretty good and
another thing I want to do is this you
see how the word password is a little
longer than the word email well since
they're both kind of in the same spot
what I'd like to do is I like to have
them the same width so I'm just going to
drag this so it's the same width as
password and later on if we decide to
you know like align both of these to the
right then they're going to appear
exactly like we want them so that's a
nice you know another tip now that we
have a decent looking interface this is
a pretty cool login screen we can now
hop into me teaching you what I want to
teach you guys in the first place and
that is about the first responder now
the first responder is I'm going to show
you guys how we can use it to fix an
issue in that issue is whenever we type
something into one of these
puts and then that software keyboard is
going to pop up like whenever you text
someone well if we ever try to get rid
of it right now it's not going to let us
get rid of it because we have some
logical issues so I'm going to show you
guys a couple different ways that you
can hide that keyboard so the first
thing that I want to allow is just the
user tapping the background so we really
don't have to change anything for that
now another way I'm going to show you
guys the hyda is if you have a button
and we'll say that it's a login button
and I'm going to put it at the top
because if I put it at the bottom then
whenever that keyboard pops up we aren't
going to be able to click this pun so
you would never do this in real life but
just for demonstrating that's why I'm
putting it on at the top and you can
also type like a login and let me change
a color of this too so select that text
color can be tangerine alright looks
good and so again right now I'm just
designing the interface so let me go
ahead and run it make sure everything
looks good and all right looking pretty
sweet so in the next tutorial if you
guys are like what the heck were you
talking about with a keyboard that
doesn't make sense at all I'll show you
guys what happens whenever we type text
in here the problems that occur and how
we can use first responders to fix them
so thank guys for watching and I'll see
you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
