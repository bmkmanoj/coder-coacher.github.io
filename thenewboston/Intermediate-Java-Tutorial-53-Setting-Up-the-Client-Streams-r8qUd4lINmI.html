is we need to code the methods set up
streams and basically just like the
server application I'm not going to be
teaching guys anything new what this
does is I don't know I'll just pull it
set up streams to sin and see if
messages so I'll just name this private
void I'll give you guys the outline
version set up streams and this throws
ioexception all right looks pretty good
so of course the output stream is we
already made that now we have to make it
already made it now we got to make it is
new object output stream and this is the
name of your socket plus get output
stream just like that which is basically
whenever you're running this on the
client side the stream that flows from
the client to the server so now just
like the server you actually have to
flush all the leftover bits or all the
leftover crap down the pipeline to just
good housekeeping flush and let me see
if I can I'll give you guys a good ok
says flush is the stream this will write
any buffered output bytes and flush
through the underlying stream pretty
much like I said I think my sample was a
little bit better flush all the crap
through the pipes so now do the same
thing for the input so we can actually
receive messages new object input stream
and this one takes a connection get
input string awesome so the last thing I
want to do is I just want to show a
message that lets these are no you know
what streams are now set up you are now
connected and put this on new lines
it says dude your
streams are now good to go explanation
poi and I wonder if I typed it like
something like this dude your streams
are now good to go how many people would
be mad at me and be like oh my god I'm a
grammar nazi you can't do that so you
know I should have done that just to
tick you guys off but already probably
dude your streams are now good to go so
code your method exactly like mine and
if get guys one more time if you don't
know what I'm doing right here go ahead
and watch my server tutorials and I
explain everything but now I just wanted
to do you know get it out of the way do
a real quick tutorial on how to set up
your streams from the client-side and in
the next tutorial let me see we're going
to be doing oh yeah coding this while
chatting method and this one is actually
a little bit different from the server
side and I'll explain that when we're
there but anyways I'll see you next time
thing guys for watching and well follow
me on Twitter you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
