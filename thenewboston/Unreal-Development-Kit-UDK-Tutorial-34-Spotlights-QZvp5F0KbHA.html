thirty fourth tutorial and in this
tutorial I'm gonna be talking to you
guys about spotlights some of my
favorite types of lights in the UDK so
in order to add spotlights to the screen
we can go ahead and add them but let's
spice things up a little bit by adding
some static meshes so go ahead and open
up your content browser and make sure
you have static meshes selected and go
ahead and select lights again you don't
have to do this but I just want to add a
little flavor this one looks pretty cool
but I want something a little bit
different one of these either won't eeny
Meeny money mom okay this one go ahead
and drag one of these lights out on the
screen first of all I can tell this
thing is massive so I'm gonna go ahead
and shrink this bit probably in your
side view is gonna be your best bet and
go ahead and slide that down and I'll
just slide it up I want to make sure
that it's kind of in front of my
whatever this thing is called a totem
pole a pillar because I wanted to cast a
pretty cool shadow so I'm gonna go ahead
and add one right there and then I'm
gonna go ahead and alt drag and add
another one kind of close but kind of
far away these kind of look like people
with like their hands hanging down and
their legs like kind of hanging kind of
like tiny little glowing robots and
nailed to the wall
that's what I think of when I see these
is that wrong should I see the
psychiatrist probably but anyways now
that we got our level set up time to
start adding some lights so the first
thing we want to do is figure out how to
add these spotlights and that's the easy
part
in order to add spotlights go up here to
view browser windows and what we're
gonna want to select is actor classes
now we go ahead and click this and we
can already see I have everything
because I was messing around with it
before this if you expand lights these
are all the different types of lights so
you guys are saying all right spotlights
and point lights those are two kinds of
lights that's it well look how many
different types of lights that we have
to learn
pretty cool huh so in this tutorial I'm
gonna be working with spotlights so go
ahead and select the regular spotlight
not spotlight movable toggle just go
ahead and select a red
spotlight and don't double-click it or
try to drag it or anything just go ahead
and select it in X out of your screen
now in your perspective you go ahead and
right-click and right and you'll have an
option that says add spotlight here so
go ahead and click that and now
everything goes dark because it added
the spotlight but it's not shining on
anything yet so go ahead and make sure
you have your move tool and drag that up
and as you can see a spot like is
basically well how I don't know it's a
spotlight I don't know how to describe
it better than that you actually know to
spotlight is it's basically if you like
have a spotlight in your hand and you
look at what's in your hand
that's a spotlight I mean for real I
can't explain it better than just
looking at it you can see what it does
it's different than like a light bulb
where it kind of goes in every direction
it kind of shines on a certain point so
yeah that's kind of a better explanation
so with that being said I want to go
over one thing there are a couple
properties that we have to watch out for
or a couple of common properties when
dealing with spotlights so go ahead and
with your spotlight selected hit f4 and
this is going to bring up your
properties window but check it out if
you go ahead and expand light and expand
light component you're gonna have a
special section for spotlight component
now you're going to have two main
properties that you need to watch out
for the first one is inner cone angle
and the second one is outer cone angle
now right now you can see that it's kind
of you know just one cone out on the
screen so you might be kind of confused
as what the difference between these two
are and a lot of beginners are so I'm
gonna explain to you inner cone angle is
let me make this inner cone and outer
cone different changes like twenty and
fifty so now whenever you look on your
screen you can see that you get two
distinctive cones you get your inner
cone which is right here and you get
your big outer cone that surrounds it
now it may be a little hard to tell
what's going on just by looking at this
but it's basically this whenever you're
setting up your light your inner cone is
like your hot spot that's the brightest
spot of your light now the outer cone is
kind of like the point where it starts
fading off so think of your light more
of like a gradient where the inner cone
is gonna be the deepest brightest color
in your outer cone is pretty much where
you want it to fade off and again how
the UDK works it isn't gonna exactly end
at this point because it calculates you
know light bouncing off of different
stuff but it's gonna give you a general
idea of how your lights gonna work so
again the inner cone just pretend let's
just call this the bright spot in the
outer cone we'll call this the fall-off
cone so go ahead and once you've got
that you know how to set up how you want
it I'm going to set mine in twenty-fifty
if you want to follow along just go
ahead and exit out of that and now what
we need to do is I want to set up this
spot light so it kind of sits right on
top of these little static meshes
because these are just static meshes or
3ds model with glowing material if we
were to play the game right now as you
can see it doesn't really give off any
real light at least not the effect that
I'm going for so I'm going to take this
spot light and position it right on top
of one of these so in order to do that
probably your front view is the best bet
go ahead and rotate this somewhere
around 90 degrees looks pretty close and
now what I want to do is in my top view
position this right about there and also
in my front view slide it down a bit it
might be even easier if I did that in my
side view but this is good for now and
another thing that you probably want to
watch out for is whenever you're
positioning these lights make sure that
you don't put them right inside your
static mesh because look what happens to
my light whenever I want to do that keep
an eye on my perspective view and I'm
gonna drag this into my static mesh
you're gonna say alright it'll probably
be good if I position it right inside
like right there well as soon as your
light gets behind your static mesh and
even if it's like half and half it's
going to shut off because the static
mesh is going to be blocking the light
source from entering your map so make
sure it doesn't sit exactly inside it
like you might think but push it out
away from it a little bit
again the player isn't going to notice a
difference and it's going to achieve the
effect you're going for so basically I
got my light shining exactly how I want
to if I were to play this game
it would look like the light is coming
from this point right here so now I'm
gonna change a couple more properties
actually one thing I want to notice is
this alright so I'm playing this game
and I noticed this the static mesh in
the material that's on here is kind of
like a dark blue material and this light
that's coming off its kind of like a
plain white light so I probably want to
change that to make sure this light
that's coming off is kind of blue so go
ahead select your like hit f4 to change
the light properties and we're done with
the spotlight component so we can go
ahead and minimize that and in your
point light component or excuse me your
light component I was still on my last
tutorial there go ahead and select the
light color now what we could do is we
could go ahead and scroll up here to
blue and try to get the exact blue that
we're looking for like that might be
pretty close right there or a better way
whenever you're working with lights and
static meshes it's probably best to do
this go ahead and select this eyedropper
and now you can hold this anywhere
around on your screen and check it out
if we hold it over this green right here
our lights going to turn green if we
hold it over this blue right here it's
gonna turn blue red right here red but
we want to select this blue right here
so go ahead and select somewhere in your
light right here and by the way look at
what's going on on my screen right now
the color is changing and that's because
usually we won't get this well that's
because if we go ahead and X out here
and took a look at my static mesh we
noticed that it's actually the material
is pulsating up and down the way they
have the material set up is that it
emits a different color and we're gonna
be learning how to do that in the
upcoming tutorials but usually your
lights aren't gonna pulsate you can just
go ahead and select your color so that's
why my light is changing but usually you
just hold the eyedropper over a piece of
your map and it's gonna be one color so
go ahead and hit f4 oh it already
opening it up for me and select the
light color select your eyedropper and
you hold it over whatever piece of your
map you want to achieve and say I want
to achieve this right here this cool
blue color I would hold over that but
since I'm coming from this layer I'm
just going to go
select that right there and it's gonna
give me a nice light blue the same exact
color is this light right here so now I
can go ahead and X out of that actually
what I need to do is press apply right
there hit okay and now I get my light
the same color as this light right here
so if we were to go ahead and play this
level the light that's coming out of the
spotlight would be the exact same color
as the static mesh and that's the exact
look that we're looking for so what we
want to do before we exit out of this
tutorial is this light is set up and all
we need to do is alt drag this over to
the other light and now both of our
lights are set up so we can go ahead and
build this level and I'm gonna go ahead
and play and show you guys a real quick
example of using spotlights in
combination with static meshes how they
look when your level is finally put
together so go ahead and close out of
this and I'm just gonna go ahead and hit
play from here and check it out it looks
like a light is coming right from that
and again if you wanted to make it more
you know customized a little more you
might want to change the settings on the
outer and inner cone to make the hotspot
actually I probably would want it more
how would I say this more focused
instead of more Y this is more like
point lightest right now but you can
mess around with it if you want I just
wanted to give you guys a real basic
rough draft of how to work with
spotlights so in the next couple
tutorials what I'm gonna be teaching you
guys is about all those different kind
of lights and all those different kinds
of light properties and how to achieve
some pretty sweet effects but for now as
always that's all you guys get so thank
you guys for watching I'm gonna be
shooting this light if you need me and
I'll see you guys in the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
