tutorial what I want to do is I want to
show you guys how to pass data through
routes and it's probably going to be
really quick I could have taught you
guys this in the last video but whatever
and this is pretty much the problem that
we have so we already learned that what
we can do whenever we want to work with
JSON data is we can take this file or a
reference to it and we can store it
inside a variable that we can use
anywhere in our program on any page that
we want simple enough but here is the
little issue and it's not really a
problem like in the sense we don't have
any errors but this is kind of the thing
that irks me a little bit see this fjs
file this is essentially the manager for
your entire application so what we're
doing right here is writing a piece of
code that is only specific to one single
page and we're sticking in the file that
it is supposed to be responsible for
managing your entire application well
that doesn't really make sense why
wouldn't you just stick this in index j
SS is pretty much the brains behind this
webpage would it be a little bit better
that way well yes it would so let's go
ahead and do that right now so we can
actually actually cut this part because
we need it and we can actually delete
all of that and that brings me to
another point anytime you have code that
is specific to a single web page then
you want to stick inside that route
anytime you have code that you can use
or reuse across multiple web pages or in
other words your entire application you
want to stick in app days or some other
kind of structure but that's pretty much
how your project is going to be set up
so anyways moving on in index J s let's
make a new variable and I'm just going
to name it like var VD I know that
usually stands for something else but
for right now it can stand for video
data
all right so we get a batter reference
and that's because our directory
structure is a little bit weird
actually need to have two dots right
there and whenever you have two dots it
means move up a directory so again we're
in views okay it's going to look in here
nope we actually have to move up and
then to confine our JSON file so again
what we can do since whenever we render
index we can throw in some additional
values to get passed through to the
template we can actually just do this VD
and actually let's do this video data
and we'll pass in VD that way we don't
have to rename anything just like that
so now we can use the variable video
data in our template and it's equal to
this JSON object so now let me run this
again refresh hopefully nothing changes
that means we don't have any errors and
beautiful project structure so again
what we did is instead of using code
that was only specific to one page and
including it on every single page we
just threw in the page that needed it
and we passed it through the route to
the template and it's a lot cleaner this
way so again like I said this is a
really short tutorial so what I'm going
to do it away some time is I'm going to
give you guys a challenge so what I want
you guys to do is this you see how we
pretty much loop through and print it
out every single playlist well I want
you guys to figure out how to take these
little chunks of text and actually make
them into a link to the correct playlist
and I'll give you guys a little hint so
each of these playlists that we
referenced whenever you click it the URL
is this space URL in the category which
is passed through in the JSON data for
example the first one is 294 and you can
see the category ID is 294 so on and so
forth
so your challenge if you can complete it
is to turn each one of these into a link
to the proper playlists and just onto
Emanuele II just don't you know type
each link out using you know a href do
it programmatically and once you guys
are complete then paste it right here
again if you're watching this on my
website then you can just say like the
title can be challenge number one for no
js' or whatever and you can paste your
code white right there and another thing
thank god i am explaining this right now
whenever you guys have questions about
node and you guys want to like paste
your source code you're like alright
this little chunk of code right here
isn't working I'm going to paste it in
the forum please use the code tags so
the code tags to get them is this little
symbol right here paste them in just
like that a lot of people they just
paste it plain text like this and then
it displays all funny like that so again
whenever you're posting code in the
forum please use the code tags and yeah
it'll save me a bunch of headaches
whenever I'm trying to figure out your
bugs for you so for now thank you guys
for watching as always I'll see you
later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
