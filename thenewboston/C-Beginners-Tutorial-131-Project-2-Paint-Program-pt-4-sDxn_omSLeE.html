thirty first sea shark tutorial that I'm
making or the new Boston and in this
tutorial we're going to continue working
on our paint application alright so in
this tutorial we're going to be drawing
shapes so for this tutorial you're going
to need to have a split button and on
our split button you'll have the option
of what shape you want to draw so the
text of our split or our split button
will just be draw
C and we're gonna make it so it displays
text and not the image and then under
draw a shape you'll be able to draw a
square a rectangle or a civil alright so
now when user clicks on a square we're
just going to have it set a fool to
truce then when we use it on it Mouse
down it will draw a square so we're just
going to create a boule ball draw and
square and set that equal to false but
then when the user selects square from
the split button right here
what's up stud equal the two sources and
then when the user puts their mouse down
we're going to say if draw a square and
we want it to draw a square so we're
gonna create a new solid rock solid rock
and then the color for our brush will be
the same color that the user is selected
for the pen color and that is tool strip
button one for color copy that from our
end blast down there cuz I'm lazy and
then now the way our brush all set up we
can just rectangle so we're just going
to say gee for our graphics Dilla
rectangle and the brush will be our
broccoli is created and then the
position that we wanted to draw will be
whatever position that the user has
their mouse asshole Y X and then not Y
and then for the size right now it's
going to have it at 50 later on I'll
show you how to customize that
all right so I'll actually we're also
going to set campaign balls and change
drops as well all right so basically
after the user clicks then they won't be
able to draw another square immediately
they'll have to go back to draw shape
and select on the shape so now I'll go
to draw a square and click somewhere on
our canvas that should draw a square yep
if we change the color to like green and
drew another square you have to screen
all right so now let's just draw another
color remember they're shaped like a
rectangle so we're going to do here is
just create another pool or a rectangle
draw rectangle and I'm gonna set that
equal to true when the user clicks on
that button then we're just gonna
basically rectangle is set equal to true
and then if it is we're just going to
draw another rectangle so we're just
gonna set these equal to 100 by 50 this
time though so it's an actual rectangle
and then we're just going to set these
to false as well
all right so now a migi bug select a
rectangle and click get a rectangle all
right so right now we can't really
select what size you want so what we're
gonna do is we're gonna add a text box
here so the user can select what size
they want so first which is that a label
for shape size and I'll just add a text
box or the actual size for you to be
able to input that unless you change the
size of this X Box like
forty so they don't have as much big all
right so now we're gonna do to the size
of this is we're going to say cool strip
one text box to actually text first I
want to convert this to on bird two and
thirty two and then our text box is X
and then we do the same thing for the
height but for the rectangle we have two
different sizes so what we're going to
do is we're going to just multiply it by
two and then this way it'll stay
proportional and the user will still be
able to select the size so now I need to
bug here type in a size so if we type in
like a hundred now the width of a
rectangle will be two hundred and itíll
be a hundred now we draw a rectangle
good if we draw a square good between
the sides to like pen just change the
color here red draw square yeah if we
get a smaller square and if we draw a
rectangle it should be small too yep
all right so I'm not going to code for
the circle cuz you guys know how to do
that but that's pretty much it for this
tutorial so see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
