with a video tutorial for the new Boston
in this tutorial we're going to be
looking at creating a dynamic almost
content loader with a fade effect so the
the end result looks somewhat like this
when we click on a particular link it
loads in an external page using the
jQuery load function and we can click
and actually choose different menu
options now this is only a quick demo it
obviously when I click each button the
same page keeps loading but that's
because I've deleted the files
associated with the tutorial but this is
a quick demo of how it would work so
when we click home we would have a home
page up here when we click portfolio we
would have the portfolio page that you
can see and the same with contact as
well so now these links are loaded in
with a href however instead of actually
going ahead and refreshing the page and
linking the user to another page it just
brings in this content here and we get
this nice fade effect with it as well
like a fade in effect so that's a quick
demo of how it works I'll go ahead and
refresh the played page and that now
that's blank and we can come over and
start writing the code out in index.php
now a few things to note we're going to
need to handle the clicks of the links
from an external file so we want to go
ahead and create an external javascript
file but just before we do that let's go
ahead and take a look at the structure
of our main page now I'm going to have
an area in my page that holds these
links so I'm gonna create a div just
here and I'm gonna call this let's just
say menu top and inside no in fact we
don't really need to give it a place
this in the David doesn't really matter
let's just go ahead and just start to
create some links obviously it would be
advisable to put it into a div if you
were doing this and let's just set up
our menu so I've got a home
and we've got portfolio and lastly we
have contact so we're using three pages
and we're going to be loading these in
dynamically as the user clicks on them
now all these links need to belong to
the same class so we can select it
appropriately in jQuery and that means
that because we're going to create a
overall global class for these links we
can go ahead and add more a bit later if
we need so it's as well as doing it like
this we're creating it in such a way
that more links can be easily added
later on to load more content and this
means that we don't have to create a lot
of code to actually get the result we
need so the H ref will sort out in just
a moment but for now we want to create
these to a particular class so I'm going
to call this menu underscore top so I'm
going to do that for all my links and
any other links that we're going to add
down here which obviously we won't be
doing for time purposes they're going to
belong to the same class as well so in
jQuery what we can now do is select any
class we want or sorry any menu item we
want using this particular class now the
link location is going to be a
particular page so this is going to be
in a pages folder and I'm going to name
them all appropriately so the first one
is going to be home dot PHP and then
we're gonna have portfolio dot PHP and
then we're gonna have contact or PHP now
I haven't actually created these files
yet but I'm going to go ahead and create
them in just a moment over in our
browser you can see that we've now got
our three links and they all link to
this pages folder and then the
appropriate name now what we don't want
to happen is this to relocate us to the
page itself but what we want is when we
click on it we want to take this page
here and apply it to the div that we're
going to just be creating in a moment
down here so let's go ahead and create
that div and this needs to have an ID
it doesn't actually need to be it can
all be on one line and I'm gonna call
this content
the content area so we're gonna place
each of these files in content area when
the link is clicked so we need to do a
few things in jQuery to allow this to
happen now before I do anything I'm
going to go ahead and create these pages
first so let's go ahead and open a new
page or a new file the first one is home
so I'm just gonna say this is the home
page and I'll save that out let's just
save that inside of here so I'm gonna
save that in a folder called pages and
this is home be HP so now we're creating
each page that we've linked to here and
we'll go ahead and take a look at this
in just a moment so let's go ahead and
create some header three tags this will
be portfolio and then the paragraph will
be this is my portfolio it will say that
as portfolio dot php' and the last page
is the contact page so we'll go ahead
and a header with contact and then these
are my contact details okay so let's
just save that last page out as contact
PHP now we have all the pages set in the
correct directory that refer or relate
to each of these links so now when we
click on them we have the pages open
like this
now what we want to do is as I said
earlier we want to load them into this
particular div that we've created here
so we want to load this href and this H
ref when it's clicked and this H
reference clicked into this content area
and what I mean is the contents of these
pages</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
