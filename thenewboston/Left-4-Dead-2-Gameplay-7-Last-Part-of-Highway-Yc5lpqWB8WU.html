welcome to the last part of the highway
mission and this is the part where you
go down the gully and you pretty much go
up to that what is it whispering oak so
let me go ahead and shoot this because
you know why wouldn't you and they're
usually stuff on this gully like not any
bullets but and by the way I'm going to
need some bullets real quick there's
usually adrenaline and pain pills so
stock up on that sometimes you're gonna
help pack so go ahead and follow along
this river and eventually when you get
to the end of it you're going to need to
go left up the hill look go ahead and
put these people first and there's a
charger right there but i'll let my
teammates take care of that well uh well
i clear a path along the way so go ahead
and just keep killing these people and
on their your medical charger I didn't
see him so go ahead and let's see who we
got to them them and there is usually um
ammo refills which I'm trying to find it
right now they're easy once a little
island to left and also if you go all
the way past where you're supposed to go
left there's often a mo refills there
but i'm not seeing in here right now so
now i have to whip out my piston will
start using that so it's the outhouse
for zombies case they need it so let me
look for that amal real quick because i
really don't feel like he's my pistol
for rest of time but i definitely will
if it comes to it we can get up here huh
nobody i'm not seeing it anywhere let's
see she this guy and yep that's boomer
he's mine yeah if i didn't see him it's
hard to watch nique around when you look
like that though so wait
come from seriously thought I just
killed all of them anyways kill him
again maybe I did kill him you know so
there's a pipe bomb over there let me
just kill these people take care of them
so go ahead and i already have boomer
bile so i might as well use this so I
can grab that pipe bomb so it's not
directing in when it may take time since
they're all coming from up the hill
proudly so yep now you see them coming
down for its boom about so go ahead and
fill these people that just came down in
once you killed all these people go
ahead and grab that pipe bomb because
you know I can't carry both on the ones
so just taking mouth and I really wish I
didn't have to use my pistol but you
know that's alright and go ahead and
grab that play bomb in you're definitely
going rather have a pipe bomb for this
next part of mission up the hill later
and that's because as soon as you get up
the hill there is going to be a ton of
zombies chilling there wait to get
exploded with this pipe bomb so let me
go ahead and wait up well let me use
this first always good to sit dirty
needles in your arm and now go ahead and
toss your pipe on them right there and
this is the last part of the mission you
need to pretty much go under that
whispering oak signs right there so
let's see this explosion and for some
reason these zombies were attracted to
it so I need to pick them up and make
sure not to shoot that car yeah that one
night a shot
these people now we're going to get one
last board before we can get in our safe
house why because I can shut that card
take care of this guy is bashing in the
head elbow and my neck you save you
every time all right so uh oh let's say
some of my teammates already decided to
go in the safe house thanks guys I'm not
getting attacked by zombies or anything
out here you just you just waiting in
there for me I'm doing fine so yeah it's
just me and Ellis out here and I guess
I'm gonna have to take care of the rest
of these by myself yep and uh oh alright
there we go oh now you guys decided to
come out and help us well little too
late now oh thanks for the pills yeah it
makes everything better now that I'm
done so that's that that's the last part
of mission and look with the most kills
as usual so thank you guys for watching
