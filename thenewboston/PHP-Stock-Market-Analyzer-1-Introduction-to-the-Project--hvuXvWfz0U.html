Robertson welcome to your very first
tutorial and how to build a PHP project
that analyzes stock data and therefore
predicts the future price of a stock now
how does this do this am I just going to
give you script and it's like BAM now
you know the future of the stock prices
no I'm not going to do that because if I
did then I would probably be the richest
person in the world what we're going to
be doing is we're going to be building a
program where we insert certain criteria
we're going to be giving it a company
name and we're going to be saying okay
this is when you would buy this stock
and this is when you would sell the
stock so we're pretty much going to give
a formula and it's going to test that
formula over the like the last five
years or something so if you say okay
well let me give you guys an example you
know how you have some friends it's like
yeah if you just buy a stock when it
goes down ten percent then the next day
it goes up twenty percent that's all you
got to do to become a million it but
you're like dude you work at McDonald's
probably taking advice from you isn't
the best idea
but also you don't know if that formula
actually works or not or if they're just
you know talking out their butt and you
know some people may be like yeah just
buy stocks on Monday and then sell them
on Wednesday because stocks always go up
the first part of the week people always
used to tell me stuff like that and I
always used to read these really weird
formulas and books but you never really
knew if they work or not
so what this program is going to do is
it's going to allow you to take that
formula and say okay I want to test this
from the last five years of data if you
used this formula on the last five years
of you know Netflix or something what I
have lost eight thousand dollars would I
have made twelve thousand dollars and
you can actually pick which formulas are
really accurate which ones aren't
accurate or accurate at all so what
formulas work the best for that company
or what formulas are just terrible and
would end up losing you a bunch of money
so again like I said I'm not going to be
giving you guys the formula of how to
predict stocks that's up to you but once
you learn how to input formulas in this
program then it's really easy to make
your own custom formula so I'm going to
be building a couple but really the
creative part is going to be up to you
guys I'm just going
show you guys how to put the program
together so the reason I'm making this
program is I actually coded this about
five years ago so it doesn't use
object-oriented programming and I'm also
going to be making a website that
displays the data in a really simple
table and it isn't really pretty or
anything but the program works really
awesome and aside from that you might be
thinking okay your tutorials are kind of
cool but I just don't care about the
stock market I have no money to invest
I hate finance so I think I'm going to
pass on this tutorial I mean I like PHP
but okay wait a second sir in this
tutorial I'm not just going to tell you
how to predict stock prices I'm going to
be teaching guys about web crawlers so
if you ever wanted to build a search
engine or web crawler for you know maybe
go out and get the cool news links for
the day or something it's an awesome way
to build a web crawler also going to be
showing guys how to work with files and
databases and showing you guys a few
awesome tricks that I learned over the
years and it's actually really cool
so like I said in order to build this
we're going to be working with PHP and
you're saying okay why are you looking
at Hostgator right now in my PHP
tutorials what I did is I showed you
guys how to install lamp or xampp or
some program that basically turned your
computer into a server and once we have
a server we can run PHP in MySQL and
everything like that but I have to admit
something to you guys I absolutely hate
servers and networking and everything
like that so the easiest thing that I
could do is I just bought a really cheap
server from Hostgator and no they didn't
pay me to you know advertise for more
though I wish they did if anyone's
watching from Hostgator you know just
send me some money
so anyways whenever you buy a server
from Hostgator it's already set up with
you know cPanel PHP MySQL it's ready to
go it takes about I don't know like two
and a half minutes maybe and then you
got a website ready for PHP so I bought
this website
Danyelle 1986 org and that's what I'm
going to be building it on but anyways
if you guys want to do this through
xampp or something then that's fine
so anyways
like I said now that I have cPanel I'm
just going to go ahead and create on my
databases and upload everything to my
website Danielle 1986 org and in the
next tutorial that's what we're going to
be doing we're going to be creating a
database creating a user as in adding
the user to database in getting this
thing rolling so for now I just want to
tell you guys what we're going to be
doing give you guys a nice little intro
so in the next story we can finally
start coding and working on this bad boy
so I am super excited for I hope you
guys are too and yeah I guess I'll see
you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
