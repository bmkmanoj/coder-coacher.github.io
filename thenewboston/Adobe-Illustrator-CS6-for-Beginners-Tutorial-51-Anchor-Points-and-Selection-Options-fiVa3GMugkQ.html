illustrator cs6 tutorial where I'm going
to go over some of the options with
dealing with pants and anchor points and
this could either help you guys out with
being able to see these differently or
working on how you select anchor points
and all that stuff and then you can mess
with these to tweak them to your liking
so illustrator has a selection and
Anchor Point display in the preferences
and it just a helps determine how you're
going to how these are going to appear
and everything like that so let's go to
edit and then we're going to go to
preferences and we're going to go to
selection and anchor display and we've
got a few things here we've got
tolerance and that's how close to the
actual anchor point that you need to be
to be able to click if you set the
tolerance to like 100 or something like
that you can like you can click over
here to the right of the actual point
and it'll still select the point the
lower you get the closer you have to be
to the point and the higher it is the
farther away you can be now the second
one here is object selection by path
only and that that means when you go to
select an object you have to select the
path snap the point if you change if you
turn that on you can snap to other
points in the object and it'll pretty
much come close come pretty close to the
actual point let's go down here into the
anchor point in handle display now these
are the different ways that you can show
the different anchor points on the left
you've got small boxes for everything
here for the anchors and these are for
the anchor points right here you've got
the way that they're displayed so you
can pick this middle one and if I hit OK
it's going to display a little bit more
differently
let me go back and I want to change the
path now I'm stuck on an anchor point I
don't want to be on that it's want to be
on path there we go I'm going to change
this one and turn the stroke off we can
just see the path let me see if I can
get my direct selection tool here
alright so here we've got our anchor
points we've got the one that's not
selected is a box that is empty and the
boxes filled in is the one that we have
selected let me go back to the
preferences and we can see how these are
going to get changed right now I have
the middle one selected if I have the
right one selected and then hit OK you
can watch how it's going to change and
it didn't really change all that much
these got a little bigger go back into
the options we can also display how the
handles are shown do you want to little
small dots as your handles do you want
to bigger filled in dots or do you want
two large circles that are filled up
here i'll click on it and hit ok you can
see how the handles are different now
it's all up to you how you like it i
actually like this setup the best and
i'll go back into the preferences one
more time so we can see when i had set
up and I picked these two on the right I
like them because the boxes are the
biggest and I can see it a little bit
better you got this highlight anchors on
mouseover that should be obvious when
you mouse over an anchor point it's
going to highlight it and this one is
show handles when multiple anchors are
selected and that's just going to show
these actual handles here and the only
one that hasn't once I have handles are
curved segments it's going to hit OK and
those
preferences there should get you through
most are get through most pen tool and
anchor point selection is pretty good so
that actually went a little bit longer
than I thought it was so that's how I'm
going to talk about in this tutorial so
we basically just went over the options
on how to make our paths look better to
us and you do whatever you need to to
make yours look better if these bigger
boxes get in the way which I don't think
that they should they're already small
as hell so this it's up to you basically
so thanks for watching this tutorial
give a thumbs up if you learn new stuff
about how to use your anchor points and
that's it see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
