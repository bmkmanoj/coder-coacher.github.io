tutorial that I'm making for the New
Boston and in this tutorial we're going
to begin our first project and in this
tutorial we're just going to be going
over creating the user interface for our
email sender in the next two to three
c-sharp tutorials we're going to
continue to work on this project so all
you're going to need for this tutorial
is all this stuff they're going to need
text box for the recipients for the
subject one for the body and you're also
going to need one for the email and
password that the user must supply
because in c-sharp in order to send an
email you must provide an email address
and a password from which you're going
to send the email alright so the first
thing that we're going to do is we're
going to groove on these four controls
and in order to do that we're going to
use a group box so we're just going to
basically on tell the user that they
need to provide these presidentials so
we're going to put them in here and
we're going to rename this group box to
credentials and we're just going to
resize this here and since we put it in
a group box we can now just move this
around and I'll take all the controls
beside it with it and they're just going
to size these things in here so that
they all fit all right so now as you can
see that just makes it look a little bit
nicer for the recipients text box we're
gonna have to provide a tooltip to tell
the users that when providing multiple
recipients they must separate each email
with a semicolon so we're just going to
go down to the tool box over here and
drag a tooltip over and we're just going
to select this text box right here
scroll down on the properties panel
until we see tooltip and we're going to
change the text of it to say when
providing multiple you know
at caress must separate semicolon so now
when your debug here and just hover over
this text box with some text in it
should see that we have a tooltip saying
yeah when providing multiple email
addresses you must separate each with a
semicolon
all right and also inside of this
password box we're going to make it so
that when typing in a password you don't
like actually see the text so we type in
like a password right here like I don't
know that then you can see it and so
like if someone was looking over your
shoulder or something they could see the
password so we're going to make it so
it'll be a star when you type in that in
order to do that we're going to go over
to the properties panel and change this
password password character to a star so
now when I type in this text box you'll
see only stars no matter what body type
and if you wanted to you could make it
be like one of those circles that you
have to see and like online password
providing things and you can just go in
the character map and select the circle
and just copy that you can use that as
well
I think that makes it look a lot nicer
but it's up to you if you can make that
character be anything so now we type in
here you see
yeah the password circle couple more
things we're going to do is make it so
the user cannot maximize or resize the
form so we're just going to go over here
and set maximize box to false so they
can't maximize it and make it so you
can't resize it either because we
allowed them to maximize and resize it
it's just going to look all stretched
out and all messed up so you don't want
that and we're going to make it so you
can't resize it so we're just going to
go to reform border style and change
that to fix the dialogue let's just
reposition everything right here so that
we can see it a little bit better
it makes it look a little bit nicer all
right yeah so and we're also going to
have an image on our sent email body so
in order to do that we're just going to
go to icon finder calm in order to get
an image I'm going to type in sin and we
should just get a few images here for
send so now resizes so we have a smaller
image for our button yes we need this
image so download it in PNG format
because that's what you're going to need
to have it on your button then go back
to C sharp have your button highlighted
or selected and then go over to the
properties panel and under image just
browse for the image you just downloaded
make sure you click a local resource and
then select import and then you can
browse for the image you just downloaded
select me send image that we just
downloaded and as you can see right now
it looks fine but it's behind it and so
in order to do that we're just going to
go over to image align and change that
to this make it be in front we're just
going to stretch it out a little bit and
you can also change it to like that or
at any side or position that you want
I'm going to make it be that side though
make this button a little bit bigger so
doesn't cut all there now we have a nice
little image for our send email button
so that's pretty much it for this
tutorial on setting up the user
interface for a project so see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
