and this is a PHP video tutorial for the
new Boston now in this tutorial we're
going to be looking at the SQL like
condition so we've already established a
connection to our database we can just
include this file in now what we're
going to do is we're going to create a
database with a few names in the in a
table so we're going to create a table
sorry we've already got our database
called a database now what we're going
to do is we're going to create a table
called names and this is going to have
two fields we're going to create a
standard ID field and as we've already
looked at so we're going to have an ID
field and we're going to have a name
field now the ID field is obviously
going to be of type int because it's a
it's going to be an auto increment
integer so we need to select auto
increment this just ensures that every
time we insert a value record this value
is incremented I'm going to create the
indexes primary because this is a unique
field so the name can be a virtual 40
depending on the name length this is
just for example purposes so I'd
probably recommend something smaller
however we'll just do this for this
tutorial let's go down and click Save
okay so our tables been created you can
see it here and you can see the
structure of our table here let's go
ahead and insert some name so I'm going
to insert Alex Garrett and down here I'm
going to uncheck ignore and I'm going to
type let's say Alex Malcom let's go down
and click go okay let's insert a couple
more records so let's say Dale Garrett
and we'll say Billy Garrett as well so
what we're doing really is we're
inserting a few bits of dummy data so we
can test this M sql-like condition now
let me just talk a bit about the like
condition the like condition can be used
on its own as like or it can be used not
to like so we can search either for
where something is like something or
where is something is not like something
and we can also use a wild-card so if
for example we were to search
in this table here that we've created
for Alex and we had a wild card on the
right hand side this would return all
values all values that started with or
had the beginning text of Alex so you'll
see you'll see how it works but later on
for example if we had Malcolm and the
wild card was on the left hand side
you'd see it would it would it would
bring back anything with text on one
side and Malcolm on this side so we can
use the wild card on either side as well
to return an exact value well no not an
exact value but for example if we were
to search for X space G and the wild
card was on either side we're searching
within our string as a whole so X and G
would return this result for example if
we were just searching for G it would
return this result this result in this
result because there's no G and Alex
Malcolm but there is a G existing in all
of this it's the most common one when
we're searching our fields would be to
use a wild card either side we can also
use an underscore to search for a
specific character so for example if we
were to say it's like Alex and then
underscore ARR ett it would search for
all the every record with a le x space
then any character than AR r ett but
I'll be demonstrating this within my xql
or PHP myadmin
sorry so let's go ahead and create an
SQL statement for this or query rather
so I'm going to say select and name from
names where and we need to pick a field
so this is going to be obviously name by
name like and then inside our single
quotation marks we can put our wildcard
in or out underscore whatever we wish to
do so for now I'm just going to say
wildcard
garrets for example okay so let's copy
and paste this so we can use it again
I'm going to click go and see what we
return so we've got every record where
the surname is essentially equals
Garrett because our wildcard was on the
left so any text here and the word
Garrett on the right hand side so let's
go back and let's change this around so
let's put the wild-card now on this side
now this isn't going to return any
values because Garrett is at the end of
every every field</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
