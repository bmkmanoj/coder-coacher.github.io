absolutely need is first of all a funnel
now remember if you saw on the fermentor
or carboy whatever you want to call it
it has a really thin or narrow neck so
whenever you're dumping it in from a
bucket or a kettle
you're gonna splash it all over if you
don't have a funnel it's going to get
all over a place so please get a funnel
and don't use the same one that you use
on your car another thing that you need
is a thermometer now I'm gonna be
talking guys about the right temperature
and when you use this but just remember
to have a thermometer and if you buy a
kit they always come with a thermometer
so there you go now the last thing that
you absolutely need is sanitizer now on
sanitized equipment is the number one
reason for contaminated beer remember
what we're going to be doing is we're
basically gonna be letting this beer sit
for two to four weeks on average now if
you let any other food or drink sit for
two to four weeks it's going to get
rotten and scored because of all the
bacteria in the atmosphere so we need to
keep all of our equipment clean and I
recommend this star stand sanitizer it
is the best no you know this is
hands-down you can't even argue this no
rinse sanitizer stars' and the best
sanitizer for home brewing
now another piece of equipment that is
actually kind of optional I highly
recommend is called a wort chiller
that's what this is right here now
whenever we boil the beer it needs to
cool down as fast as possible now people
have different ways that they do this
some people actually set it in the
snowbank if it's you know winter outside
some people put it in an ice bath and
their bathtub this is one of the best
ways it's called a wort chiller and I'm
going to show you guys exactly how it
works later on it basically acts like a
big radiator you put water in through
one end comes out the other end
stick it in your wort and it cools it
almost it cools it in minutes and if you
put it in the ice bath or something it's
gonna take almost over half an hour to
cool down so again this is called a wort
chiller and I highly recommend it so
that's all the basic equipment that you
need to start brewing your beer now of
course whenever you bottle your beer
you're gonna need a bunch of other
equipment for example bottles caps in
the little capper to you know put the
cap on the bottle well I'm gonna be
separating that in kind of a different
segment so I'm gonna be going over all
the bottling equipment when our beer is
done and we're ready to bottle it but if
you guys are like alright I have to go
out and find all that equipment right
there
well actually know whenever people get
started brewing beer the easiest way is
just to go online and buy a beer starter
kit it comes with all the equipment that
you need and even extra so that's what I
highly recommend is very easy you get
everything all in one package and it's
also cheaper than buying everything
individually so now that we went over
all the equipment let's go ahead and get
started brewing some beer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
