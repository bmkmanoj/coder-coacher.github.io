16th of physics tutorial and in this
lesson I want to talk to you guys about
circular motion and something called
centripetal force sounds pretty sweet
huh oh it is so I could just go ahead
and give you guys the definitions but
what fun would that be I want to draw
something so let me go ahead and draw
this dude right here I'm going to name
him Bucky because that's a really cool
name and what this dude is doing is he
is holding on to a string and he tied a
baseball on the end of the string why
did he do this I have no idea Bucky's a
little bit weird but not only did he tie
a baseball onto a string but he is
whipping this thing around in a circle
as fast as he can
why he's doing this like I said I don't
know he's a little bit weird but anyways
this example helps us to study circular
motion in something called centripetal
force
so this baseball we're going to just
call it the object because well they
call things objects in physics now
whenever you have an object and it's
moving in a circle the force between the
object which is the baseball in the
center of the circle which is where he's
holding onto the string the force
between these two points is called the
centripetal force so in this example the
string let me draw my arrow a little bit
better the string would represent the
centripetal force the force between the
object and the center of the circle so
just remember that because that's
probably going to be on your test or you
know I don't know why you guys are
studying physics but that's a term that
you need to know centripetal force so
another thing I want to tell you guys is
something that's probably going to blow
your mind this is one of those weird
physics facts that I'm about to tell you
and guys don't blame me because this is
kind of confusing blame Newton because
he's the one who thought up all this
crap it's this if Bucky is standing here
in the same location and he is whipping
this ball around at a constant speed
remember that I said that constant speed
Newton says that this ball is
accelerating okay let's take a break
here for a second you're telling me that
if this ball was
traveling around the circle at a
constant speed then it's still
accelerating what the heck is going on
that's like the opposite of acceleration
well let's go ahead and take a look at
the foreign left for acceleration
acceleration as we know is change in
velocity over change in time now up
until this point we studied things
moving pretty much dropping a ball from
a building or if you were in a car and
you went from zero to 60 then that car
would be accelerating so even though
this ball isn't changing speed why
didn't you and say that this fall was
accelerating well let's go ahead and
take a closer look at this formula for
acceleration it says change in velocity
over change in time now as we know
velocity is made up of two things speed
and direction I don't know if I'm going
to have enough space so I'll just write
dir so velocity is pretty much speed and
direction so before we were just
concentrating on speed and typically
whenever you think of acceleration you
think of things changing speed but the
truth is velocity can also deal with
direction so even though this ball right
here isn't changing speed it's changing
direction so that's a weird physics fact
that you guys have to remember objects
can and sup well excuse me I need to
take a deep breath because I guess my
brain is getting confused and it's
confusing my tongue as well but objects
can accelerate even when the speed is
constant because the formula for
acceleration which includes velocity
includes direction as well so even
though the speed is constant it is
indeed changing direction which
therefore changes the velocity which
causes this ball to accelerate at a
constant speed so go ahead and tell your
physics or science teacher that that
things are able to accelerate at a
constant speed and after their brain
blows up you can move on to the next
tutorial so thank you guys for watching
don't forget subscribe and I'll see you
guys in the next lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
