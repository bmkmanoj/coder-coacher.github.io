northern New York I'm 21 years old and I
just recently about a month ago lost my
job as a construction worker and me and
my friend Bucky here
we were watching Survivor shows like
last week and a very interesting shows
actually but I made a suggestion to him
that I think I could do something like
that pretty easily and he's I guess he
thinks that it's real hard but so he
offered me you tell him about it
Wow so we ended up making a little bet
which may be a big bet but basically I'm
going to pay Gerard here $100 a day for
each day that he can survive in the
wilderness and made a couple ground
rules so he can't cheat in the main one
is he's only allowed to bring these
supplies first one is a machete the
second is a Flint if you can figure out
how to use it figured he needed a fire
if you want to make it just a few days
and then I have just a regular knife
here and it's a couple things of rope
check and use to do whatever I please
so that's it pretty much these four
supplies no cell phone no contact with
anybody um he has to find his own food
his own water so uh that's that all
right and here is Gerard right here
ready to eat his very last meal before
he goes out on the great adventure as
I'm calling it what you got there Oh
health checks delicious oh just a single
classic meal small enjoy a big deal no
big deal
maybe less hamburger you every mm-hmm I
am predicting you last a day and a half
what about you well so probably the last
hamburger have in the next like month or
so I really hope you don't make it a
month or I'm gonna owe you a lot I'm
really counting on you lesson like two
days so but just we uh got we got like
30 days worth of tape
and we've probably got like a two months
worth of camera supply so I doubt you're
going to need all that but just in case
so enjoy so here we are on our way to
the Adam heterotic mountains we probably
got another half an hour to go it's just
still pretty populated area and I want
to make sure we drop them off in the
middle of nowhere
so I'll see you in half an hour so this
is a pretty secluded area looks like a
old hunting road or something
haven't seen a house in quite some time
so I don't think there's anyone around
here so we're probably dry for a little
bit more down this road and I'll drop
him off and he plans the walk out in the
woods probably going to walk out a
couple miles yeah at least a couple
miles out in the woods so yep
there is definitely nothing around here
anywhere we look so
have fun still feeling good about this
it's going to be a little bit too easy
actually
oh nice and look what we got here the
best trail ever leading into the middle
of nowhere probably not supposed to be
here but I'm not gonna be wrong yeah I
don't think we're supposed to be here
but um that's not important so this is
gonna be no new home for about next year
in half well hopefully that'll be like
80 grand
guys everything unique yep got our
camera gear
yeah and my supplies and Kimber your
supplies and your cell phone please
cellphone and I will be taking this and
you're all in two days and don't take my
money or text anybody so you can have
this alright and I got my pants on - oh
yeah
her shorts and I will see you I don't
know six weeks actually I've decided to
up my Annie take care of my car
all right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
