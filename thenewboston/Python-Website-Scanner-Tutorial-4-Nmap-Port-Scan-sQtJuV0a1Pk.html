address of a target of a server or
whatever what I wanted to do now is I
want to show you guys how to run an nmap
scan from Python now hopefully you guys
watch my nmap tutorials and if you did
then you already you're gonna know what
this is but if you didn't real quick
what this tool is is basically a tool
that allows you to scan a server and
find out what processes are running and
what ports are open so for example I'm
just gonna run a real fast scan of this
sir a nmap whatever options and this
just means run fast scan built scan all
the ports just scan the most common ones
and then you give the IP address so this
is my server of the New Boston comm I'm
gonna hit enter and on my server right
here we are running SSH and of course
we're hosting my website so we're
running HTTP and HTTPS now this can also
tell you if they're running FTP if
they're running MySQL so for example if
they have a database running on it and a
bunch of other good information but what
we want to do is we want to run this
from Python and also another thing I was
thinking is this so there are a bunch of
different options or ways that you can
use this tool and what one do I want to
build in toward Python scanner so do I
just want to build the regular one or do
I want to build this fast one which
gives you you know the real quick one or
do I want to build an aggressive one
which gives you a really you know
detailed view of it and I just wasn't
sure I didn't know how the end users are
going to use this tool so instead what
we're going to do is we're going to add
another parameter for the options so
this function is going to have take two
parameters the first one is any options
if they want to include any at all and
the second one is the target IP and from
there we can let them decide which kind
of scan they want to run so let me just
make a new file I'll just name it
nmap py
alright so import OS and just write get
an map and again this is going to take
two parameters the first one is options
and the second one is the IP address so
we're actually going to be passing in
this one for them since we already found
out how to get the IP address in the
last tutorial and remember the format of
this command is the word and map and
then your options and then the IP
address of your target server so the
command equals and map and then we'll
write not open options and then make
sure you add a space after this and then
the IP address of the target server now
take note of this what if that they
don't include any options at all what if
they just want to run a normal end map
where that's going to be fine because
even though that we have the extra space
let me clear this so you guys can see
even though that we have that extra
space it doesn't matter because you can
have as many spaces as you want in here
and as long as you write it in the
correct format and map whatever whatever
the new Boston calm and this is gonna
take a while because it's not a fast
scan but you guys are gonna see you get
the same result so it doesn't matter if
they leave out those options or not they
are optional unintended alright so the
next thing we wanted to do is of course
just run this process like before so
operating system pop in P open actually
that's what it's type in our commands so
run this and this is gonna actually
store the process now we need to convert
it to a string before so results equal
stringify whatever command we did
process thoughts read so again right
here we're building the process
opening up the terminal essentially and
now we just got all these results and we
converted it to a string and we store
that in the variable results and now all
we have to do is return those return
results and you can actually parse this
if you want but what I'm gonna do is I'm
just gonna return this whole thing I
don't know what information that they're
going for hold on I lost my gotta get
all this organized all right now just to
verify that this works what we can do is
we can print get n map and for this
first option I'm just going to run a
fast scan again and for the second one I
don't even know what is my IP address
this right here alright so hopefully if
we didn't mess anything up check it out
so it's gonna run a fast scan and boom
rose there you go so it runs the scan it
stratifies it and it returns the results
right here so later on we're gonna be
saving this to a text file but for now
ladies and gentlemen that is how you run
an nmap scan in python looking beautiful
I'll see you guys the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
