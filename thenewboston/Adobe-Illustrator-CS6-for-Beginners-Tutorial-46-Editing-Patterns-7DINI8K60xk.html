illustration to toriel
I'm your host buddy Blackford and today
in Illustrator cs6 we're gonna learn how
to edit the patterns that we've created
and if you don't know how to make a
pattern you might want to go over to the
previous tutorial where I taught you how
to make patterns using simple objects
and that one's a pretty good tutorial so
go ahead and add your pattern to an
object you know actually you don't even
have to do that you need to open up the
swatches panel and here you'll see the
patterns that you created we've got a
few in here and these are different
patterns that some of them were already
made and some of them I added so this
one is one I created last tutorial make
sure it's selected and then go to object
go to pattern and go to edit pattern now
it brings up the pattern options again
for you you can use your selection tool
to move things around and edit some of
these things and when you're ready just
click on save a copy and hit OK and this
is just letting you know that is went to
the swatches panel you can see it over
here and then if you want to save your
old pattern all you're gonna do is click
cancel if you want to overwrite the old
pattern you're just gonna hit done it's
gonna hit cancel and you can see I've
got my old pattern still and then I got
my new pattern that I created over here
here's one that I made before I'm just
gonna delete that out but I was testing
that out before I did the tutorial and
now I've got my new pattern added so I
can go ahead and select that with my bad
double click
that's another way that you can edit
your pattern you just double-click it in
the swatches menu so if I double click
this one it's gonna bring me my other
pattern and that way you can do it that
do something that way as well so I'm
gonna go ahead and create my object and
I want to make sure that I have my new
pattern on there we go and that's how
you make your new patterns now if your
patterns aren't lining up very well and
you can see that maybe I want this part
that I want this whole set of 4 squares
to be right in the middle I want to take
your selection tool and then hold down
the tilde key and go ahead and drag and
you're able to drag the pattern around
within the object without having to move
your object I mean you can also move the
object around and it will move that the
pattern around in that way but you're
actually moving the object around the
pattern and holding down the tilde key
and dragging moves the pattern around
the object so hopefully that made make
sense to you guys
and that's uh what else so I got to show
you about this the other thing I guess
that I want to show you guys is you can
add the pattern to either the stroke or
the fill so go ahead and select your
object I'm gonna make my stroke on this
a little bigger actually kind of a lot
bigger
oops I'll put it at like 20 so we that's
so we can see I'm gonna click make sure
it's selected then I'm gonna go over
here to my stroke and pull it down and
then I can add one of the patterns I've
created to it the and it'll make your
stroke a pattern as well so that way you
can use patterns as strokes or even as
fills and that's pretty handy to know
another way of doing this is to select
your colors and your stroke or your fill
from the tools panel so right now I have
the fill in the front so I know that the
fill is selected there
I'll click on it and then I can click on
one of my other patterns I'm going to
make sure my objects selected I can
change my patterns out that way using
the swatches panel same thing with the
fill if I click on the fill and bring
that forward now I'm able to change out
my stroke in the swatches panel as well
and that that's a sometimes it's faster
this way it depends on really what you
want to use but that's what you got
there now if you just want to delete a
swatch just click on one of them you can
come over here to this trashcan here and
click on delete swatch and that's gonna
get rid of the pattern that you had on
so that's all I wanted to show you about
editing patterns hopefully you guys
learned something new and you even like
a little thing where you hold the tilde
to move the patterns around that stuff
is pretty helpful and not a lot of
people actually know about doing that so
at least I know I haven't ran across a
bunch of people that know that so thanks
a lot for watching the tutorial if you
guys learn something if you liked it
give it a thumbs up and be sure to
subscribe for some new tutorials coming
up soon have a good one everyone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
