name is buddy Blackford and in this
tutorial we're going to be learning
about Auto Orient along a motion path
so pretty much Auto Orient when you turn
it on it will wrote have your object
here it'll rotate it to what it thinks
it should be to follow this motion path
correctly now I'll move this guy in the
middle well I just keep them in the
beginning actually and the way to turn
on auto Orient is a lair transform Auto
Orient you can hit ctrl alt and that's a
no right there and now you want to
change it to orient a long path this box
will always pop up and okay and you can
see now he is oriented differently
preview it real quick and then you can
see that's how Auto orient works now if
I preview it you can see that the
rotation values here aren't changing at
all that's because rotation and auto
Orient are separate and you can still
edit the rotation values while you're
having Auto orient on so if I just
change this maybe by 90 degrees now he's
facing that way a little bit more for
the whole time he will be going that way
so it looks like he's diving headfirst
into the ground it's okay though because
he's like a squishy guy now you can also
keep from the rotation and it'll work
the same so a keyframe here and I'll get
to the last key hit K to get to the next
keyframe so it's right on and let's
change him so he's
down like this it's good enough mmm to a
preview no you would have to go in and
tweak the animation because now it's a
little more it's pretty off so I'm just
gonna end up deleting this you can add
more rotation keyframes in to fix the
problem if your object is flipped and
you don't want it that way you can set
the rotation to 180 and it'll flip it
and sometimes there is a problem with
auto orient it will do some goofy stuff
at the end like twists or move around
and things like that the way to fix that
is to click on the point and now you can
see that there is a dot that appears
grab that and line it right up with your
motion path and that'll help fix that
there's another way to just click on
them again another way is to just get
rid of the handle by holding ctrl alt I
just clicked off again ctrl alt and
clicking on it it brings up the convert
vertex tool and sometimes you don't want
the auto Orient to be on the whole
entire time
for the layer so what you would do for
that is go to edit split layer and now
the auto Orient is only going to be on
this part of the layer and then on the
top and the second layer that we split
it off from the auto Orient is now off
no we can see it's doing the twisties
because I had that rotation keyframes
turn that off zero
you can't you can't keyframe Auto Orient
so this is the the best way to pretty
much get around that it's a workaround
yeah and that's pretty much it
there's not much else about the audio
orient just play with the the tool and
make sure to use your rotation keys
remember the auto aura is in lair
transform Auto Orient thanks for
watching this tutorial I hope you guys
learned something and are able to apply
it to your next project have a good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
