After Effects cs6 tutorial in this
tutorial we are going to be talking
about the timeline panel my name is
buddy Blackford and I'll be teaching you
this today and I'm just going to the
timeline panel is down here and I'm
going to teach you what each of these
buttons is real quick I'm not going to
go in full depth about everything but
I'll just give you a general overview of
the timeline panel so to start out we
will just start from the left up here
and you notice that there are different
tabs here these are for each of your
comps and you can X out of these if you
would like so we can bring up so it's
just maybe one and it's easier to I mean
it's easier not to have a million tabs
sometimes but sometimes it is easier to
have a bunch of tabs open so you can
quickly search through so if open this
it'll open up another tab down here and
we'll start here this is your time time
display and if you alt click on this
control ctrl click my bed you can
control click on that it'll alternate
between frames and like a time code it
says what your frames per second are
right here that's helpful this is the
quick search same is almost the same as
the quick search up by the project panel
the next is the composition mini flow
chart this is the Live Update button the
next one is the draft 3d this is the
hide shied layers button this is the
enable frame blending button this is the
enable motion blur button
this is the brainstorm button here is
the auto-keyframe properties button this
is the graph editor button and down here
we have them in this left corner expand
or collapse the layer switches pane so
there you go you can see what that does
just one down next to it is the expand
the transfer controls pane see how that
works
and then the expand then an out duration
panes right here you can see those you
have the toggle switches and modes
button which will change these right
here see that changes that this is to
zoom in and out your timeline down here
and obviously this is to scrub back and
forth when you're zoomed in and here's
your current time indicator here hold
click and hold to scrub through or you
can use the page up and page down button
to go frame-by-frame hold the shift
button and hit page down and it'll go up
10 frames or page up to go back 10
frames which is very handy and you
should always remember that because you
may need to go frame by frame sometimes
happens all the time
hmm we got the over here the bring comp
forward pan button so that clicks on
brings the comp up there forward and
this is the marker click and hold on it
and you can drag a marker over and if
you hold shift it'll snap to your
current time indicator here is the end
and beginning of your comp so if you
ever wanted to basically render to right
here and you have if you have like 10
seconds of black space at the end
you can bring this over to a certain
time area and it'll stop rendering there
you can also use it to cut off if you
hold shift it should snap it right to
where your current time indicator is
this button here also kind of functions
the same as down here this scrubber zoom
back count
that's a nice face go back to here I
like this shot cuz it's nice and bright
and then here's your the menu settings
that for that you have on basically all
your panels and so it's it's good to
know what what the buttons are named
that way if someone asks you to go to
the graph editor and fix something you
know that the graph editor buttons over
here if someone if someone asks you if
your client asks you while he's stand-in
there which sometimes happens because
sometimes I know the program well and it
might think they know everything but you
make make sure that you know what what
you're doing and you know to click on
the graph button editor if you say I
don't know what that is
sometimes you don't look as professional
well that's about all there is to
explain about the timeline panel without
going too much in depth there is one
more thing that I remember that I can
show you that you can click on these
buttons down here these are see how
they're enclosed you can click on them
and hold them and drag them to different
areas some people like bringing this
section over here because it's easier to
use this section a lot to hide layers
and now you can turn audio off and it's
keyframe assistant kind of thing you can
lock the layers it makes less move
and mouse movement because you do use
the section quite often but I like to
leave it over here some people it's it's
everybody's preference and yep that's
that's it this time not going to bring
any more surprises out there so thank
you for watching this tutorial hope to
see you in the next one
good bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
