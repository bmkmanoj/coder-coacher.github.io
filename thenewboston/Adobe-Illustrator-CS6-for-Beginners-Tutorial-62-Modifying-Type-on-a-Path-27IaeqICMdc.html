illustration toriel and today we're
gonna learn a little bit more about
typing on a path there's ways to modify
how you type on a path and a bunch of
other things so it'll probably take the
whole tutorial so let's go ahead and get
going and a beans here says that typing
on a path is great and beans here he's
from an anime and it's hunter x hunter
i'm not really sure if that's how you
say it but alright let's get started
let's go ahead and you can either use
your arc tool or spiral tool I'm gonna
go ahead and use the spiral tool this
time I'm gonna make a stroke and just go
ahead and draw my spiral that's good
this spiral is kind of big so I'm
probably gonna have to end up typing a
lot all right and I double clicked up
accident when I do that okay
so we've got our spiral here and let's
go ahead and grab our type on a path
tool and what you need to do is start on
like the edge of your path here and
click and now you've got your cursor
blinking and we can start typing things
oh I went the wrong way so I want to I
want to start here on this side of the
path all right what's going on here
alright so I guess the cursor wants me
to start up here but that's okay we can
always fix that kind of stuff okay now
we're getting all this stuff and I'm
just gonna start typing on some words
and let you know a little bit about the
tool as I'm doing that hopefully I can
do two things at once so when you use
the type tool you can add it you can add
along the inner or the outer edge of the
path and you can't put it on both
however so just know that and I can't
even do this
all this typing and talking at the same
time it's just too hard for me I don't
know why but let's go on and take some
observations
what's going on here so I click on here
and you see that there's points here for
the path so you're able to modify the
path still our path is following the
actual path here and when I clicked on
here it actually went up up to the top
I'm not too sure why that happened but
we can fix the positioning of what's
going on here
I can also make this smaller and as you
see when I make it smaller it makes the
actual text smaller so it's good to do
or it's good to set up the size first
and then start typing and also notice
that the the stroke is gone and this is
like the same as the area text tool so
if you want to have your stroke still be
there then you're gonna want to copy and
paste so I'll demonstrate that real
quick I just hit control Z a couple
times so I could get back to my object
so I've here's my path and it's got a
stroke on it for points so I'm going to
do is go to edit copy and then go to
edit paste in place and now I have two
of them so this time when I go to tack
type on the text let's just go like
right here alright it brought it way
over there yeah little odd but it must
be going in like reverse or something so
go ahead and I'm going to start typing
and you can see now that the actual
spiral still has the stroke because only
the path on top got converted into a
type object now when you're doing this
you don't want to press ENTER because
all it does it stops you from typing so
I just had enter you can see my cursor
is gone and I can't type anymore so
don't press ENTER until you're done
let's keep going and it actually also
created another set here when you press
ENTER it went to another line and you
can see the little plus box so don't be
don't push enter it doesn't work well
start typing again
all right so now we've got some paths
with some type on it and let's get to
more we want to talk about how to move
the type on a path so you're going to
want to pick up your selection tool and
then we're gonna go here and we're going
to want to drag on the bracket so here's
a bracket here where my mouse is and you
can see that the cursor changes over the
bracket don't grab the square grab the
bracket and using the bracket we can
move the type to anywhere we want
especially the center ones the easiest
if you go to the other side here like
this you can flip flip it onto this onto
a section that you want you can flip to
the other side and see if there's
anything else if you if you drank these
here on the opposite sides it'll just
move it along the actual path and pretty
soon you'll end up being able to catch
up to it and now you're only able to
type in between these two so if I move
this out farther and then I move this
out farther it's gonna go back to where
it was okay so there we go and as you
can see when I'm moving the the center
one here I can grab onto it
the other ones move as well well I can't
grab on to it right now I don't know why
but let's keep it going
to something more important we're gonna
learn how to modify the type on the path
so what we're gonna do make sure you
have your selection tool selected again
and click on the type so let's make sure
we have the type okay we've got it and
you know that you have the type selected
and not the other path selected because
you get the brackets and the squares
going on here go to the type menu and
then we're gonna go to type on a path
and we've got a couple different things
here that are effects so we got rainbow
skew 3d
stair-stepping gravity let's try
something
here's stair-step as you can see it's
going as like when it's going up and
down it's going into like a stepping
kind of motion and I mean here's 3d
ribbon so you wanna go ahead and on your
own time
check out these different effects and
see what they do so we want to click on
type on a path options next however and
you can also put your different effects
on right here so if you click on preview
we're gonna be able to check out the
effects a lot quicker and now you can
see what all the quick all the all the
options did really quick if you just
want a regular just keep it on rainbow
if you hit flip it's gonna flip it to
the other side but your cursor your
actual bracket here is going to go
somewhere else it depends on what your
shape is so basically it just flipped
the entire thing and then we've got our
different align to paths and you can
select the different alignments go ahead
and check out what you want so here's
the different things Center is right on
it
baseline is right on the lot on top of
the line and then a sender is going to
be like definitely below the line and D
Center is going to be definitely above
the line so here's our spacing go ahead
and change your spacing if you want to
Wow
didn't want to do that alright let's go
back to something a little bit more
normal
there we go there's 12 point spacing if
I go to 36 you can see it's a different
spacing if I go to negative 36
you can see it's open a little bit more
so that's how that works I'm just gonna
hit cancel and I've got my path here and
that's all I wanted to go over for the
paths remember that if you want to keep
your stroke or shape or whatever on the
path you're gonna have to copy and paste
it I'm what else do we go vert you don't
want to press Enter when you're typing
on a path
because it's just gonna create overflow
and it's not good and then remember to
click on these brackets and drag if you
want to move your text around and and
just remember that the type tool options
are up here when you have the with the
type selected and they're in the type
menu so if you ever want to check fix
anything or check out the different
types of fonts that you want without
having to click on each fund everything
remember that the fonts are also up here
and it's easy to do so that's it for
this tutorial
looks like I went pretty long on this
one but thanks a lot for watching
everybody
and it's been a great teaching everybody
so far it's awesome thanks a lot have a
good day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
