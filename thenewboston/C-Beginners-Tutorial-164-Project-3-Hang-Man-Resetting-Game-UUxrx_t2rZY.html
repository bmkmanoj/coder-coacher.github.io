tutorial that I'm making for the new
Boston and in this tutorial we're gonna
continue working on our hangman project
and in this tutorial we're basically
going to be handling when the user wins
and when they lose but before we move on
to that we're just going to want to
change this message box that shows when
you lose we're just going to want to
make that display the word as well so
we're just going to say the word was and
then just have the word after it so plus
work because remember we created this
word variable up here and it'll be set
equal to the random word that's
generated all right so now we're going
to want to check to see if user is one
and we're gonna want to do this every
time that the user guesses a new letter
and they actually get it right so we're
gonna want to loop through every single
label that we create and see if it's
text is equal to an underscore and if
it's text is equal to an underscore
we're just going to have a return so
that it will never reach the code that
will occur when you win so just going to
say for each label L in that labels list
that we created then we're just gonna
launch check to see if it's text with an
underscore so if L X equals an
underscore then we're just going to
return and then after this for each
statement we're gonna have it do the
code that will occur if you win and
since we have a return right here it'll
never reach the code that will occur if
you win if you haven't won notice namma
message box show saying you've won so
you won and then following that on the
message boxes title we're just gonna say
congrats alright and then we're going to
want to reset the game so that the user
can play again so we're just going to
want to create a new method that will
occur to reset the game and we're going
to want to create a method because we're
gonna want to have it reset the game
when you lose as well so I'm just going
to make the return type void right here
since there's no information that we
need to retrieve from this method and
I'm just going to call it reset okay
alright and the person that we're going
to want to do is clear this panel right
here because no matter how many body
parts are drawn we're just gonna want to
clear everything and then we can redraw
the hang post so that we'll start fresh
so we're going to go right here and
create some new graphics for that panel
so and along back create graphics and
then we're just going to want to use the
clear method to clear out that panel so
clear and we're gonna want to clear to
the background color of the panel so
panel one dot back color alright then
we're going to want to get a new random
words so it's going to say get random
word so though it's not using the same
word that we used previously then we're
going to want to draw the labels so make
labels and finally we're just going to
want to draw that hang post again so
draw oops
draw hang code and there are two more
minor things that we have to do here
we're just going to want to reset this
labels text so that all the letters that
you've missed won't still be there so
we're just going to say label twos text
equals missed and then we're just going
to want to clear this text boxes Tech so
text box ones tech tools an empty string
alright and then we're just going to
want to call this reset game method
after you win and when you lose so that
you can play again so reset game alright
so that's pretty much it for this
tutorial I'm sorry I'm not going to show
you this working in action because it's
gonna take me a while to show you both
me winning and losing so you're just
gonna have to take my word for it but
that's it for this tutorial so see you
guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
