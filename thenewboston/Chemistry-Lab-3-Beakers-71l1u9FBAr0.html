welcome to your third chemistry lab
tutorial in this video I want to talk to
you guys about beakers now beakers are
actually one of the most commonly used
pieces of equipment in your chemistry
lab you can actually use these things
for a wide variety of different uses now
some of the more common uses for a
beaker our first mixing material and the
reason that I prefer to mix my samples
in a beaker rather than test tubes is
because obviously as you guys can see a
beaker holds a lot more material than
the test tube so it's usually easier to
mix stuff in another reason that people
use beakers is for measuring so whenever
you buy your beakers make sure that it
has a volume indicator on the side
because if it's just plain glass and we
can't measure anything with it another
thing is boiling so if you have a sample
that you just need to heat up or
solution that you need to boil you can
go ahead and put it on a hot plate or
over a flame and that's why I recommend
getting a high quality glass because
we're going to be using beakers a lot to
heat up solutions so whenever we heat
them up if you have a low quality like
cheapo glass they usually crack or you
know high quality glass is awesome since
we're going to be heating it up that's
what I'm trying to say and another
reason that I really love beakers is
because they have a little spout and the
spout is really good whenever you want
to pour something it makes it a lot
easier so again mixing measuring boiling
heating up pouring beakers are pretty
much awesome for all-around uses now
another thing I want to recommend is buy
your beakers as a set because if you
were going to buy all of these beakers
individually then it's going to be
really expensive but if you would buy
all of these as a set for example I
bought these five right here the five in
front is a five piece set you can get
all of these for under $20 online so if
you want to save some money like I said
make sure you buy them as a set instead
of individual beakers now another thing
is if you have the money too then you
really should get two sets because it's
amazing how often you need two beakers
of the exact same size in our labs but
like I said if not you know it's not
100%
Cesario but it's gonna make things a lot
easier so buy them as a set if you can
buy two and if you're on a really tight
budget and you can only buy a few I
recommend getting 250 mililiters because
these are the beakers that we're going
to be using most frequently now another
thing I want to recommend is that if you
can buy a watch glass now a watch glass
is basically a big round piece of glass
kind of looks like a contact lens you
guys can see it and it's actually
another supply that we're going to be
talking about in another video basically
you use it to observe simple chemical
reactions but the reason that I'm
talking about it in this video is
because you can actually use them with
your beakers whenever you have a
solution or a chemical that you want to
store for a short period of time in a
beaker you can actually just cover it
with a watch glass and it's helpful for
a couple reasons first of all it slows
down evaporation so you don't lose your
solution so fast and another thing is
that it helps from contamination so you
know no dust or anything else from your
lab gets in it so basically get a watch
glass if you can if not you can just
cover it with something else but these
are really handy to have around
so think guys for watching and I'll see
you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
