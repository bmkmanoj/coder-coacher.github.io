anything new before you start typing any
more code let's go ahead and figure out
what all of this existing code is doing
so I already told you guys in the last
tutorial as soon as you run this project
right click and run what's going to
happen is it's first going to call your
startup script right here now all this
is doing is it's setting up your server
all the basic configuration settings for
your server it's telling it what port to
listen to in this case as you can see
3,000 so that's why we need to go to
this address for the home page and then
after that after WWJ s is done what it
does is it kicks off app j s so just
like before FJ s is the core foundation
of your nodejs project so essentially
whenever user comes to your website and
makes a request app J s is going to look
at that request and depending on the URL
figure out how to handle that responds
appropriately so right now whenever we
just set up this project we got two
simple web pages we got the home page
that's the one you're looking at right
now and I also showed you guys you got
this other page called users so let's
figure out exactly the workflow of what
happens whenever the user requests is
request is requests this users page so
what's going to happen is they say hey I
want to go to users so fjs says ok let
me figure out how to handle that so I'm
going to scroll and just like before
whenever we were learning about the
connect framework it's going to look at
app and this object is going to be
responsible for determining exactly how
to handle that request so we see that we
have two options right now forward slash
and forward slash users this means home
directory whenever they want to go to
the home directory call this object
routes whenever they want to go to the
users directory which we did in this
example is just going to call the object
users all right so what's users well if
we scroll up here users
and routes these are pretty much just
other files so users is going to require
this middleware right here and let's
look at what that is right here users
and if they go to the index it's going
to call this little script so in the
case of users what it did is it called
this file and all this file does as you
can see as a response it sends out
respond with a resource and that's why
we got that respond with a resource we
can actually put something like um I
love pizza in here and now when you run
this again the response would be I love
pizza so again what's happening and this
is pretty much how we're going to build
new pages in the future whenever we want
to make a new page we have to let app
this object know about it for example
will say like app use profile or
something whatever Pedro making and then
we have to make a new route which is the
brains behind it and our brains are
going to be a little bit more complex
than this but for right now the response
resists send them this response and also
typically what's going to happen instead
of just sending a response right here
and we can actually see this in index we
go back to index right here what the
brains or your routes are going to do is
it's pretty much going to render a view
now these views are like I said the HTML
pages so in this case it was rendering
index which is your index each a s file
so let me actually put this in left to
the right and you can see really clearly
what's going on so whenever the user
requested the homepage what it did is it
says RA where are the brains for my home
page in a router index what do you want
me to do here well I just want you to
render the home page so I'm going to
display this home page and obviously it
just says welcome to whatever the title
is welcome to Express and if we just
want to change this to Bucky is awesome
then whenever you run that that is why
the homepage would render Bucky is
awesome so that is pretty much the
workflow fjs handlers request the brains
and the views simple enough however in
the next tutorial we still got to cover
what all this other code means and it's
actually really easy so yeah thank eyes
for watching I'll see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
