this at each stage is probably a really
important step if you're just learning
because you can see the outcome of each
command that you're processing so in
fact let's get rid of this for now okay
so now what we've done is we've read in
the image we've all we haven't read in
the image itself but what we've done is
got the image size from the image a file
name that we've specified so we've got
the width and the height of this image
now what we need to do is we need to
specify a new size for the image because
obviously the point of this tutorial is
we're scaling this image down to
thumbnail size now we have a few issues
we can't scale it down by a percentage
because the file that we read in could
be say 2,000 by 2,000 pixels or it could
just on its own be let's say a hundred
by a hundred pixels or it could be 50 by
50 pixels etc so our file size that we
read in could be any size so what we
want to do is create the thumbnail to an
exacting size or a more or less exacting
size we don't want to scale it down a
percentage because if we were scaling
down a percentage of an image that was
500 by 500 and let's say by by a very
small percentage you'd end up with a
very small image however if you were
scaling down five a 2,000 by 2,000 by a
very small percentage you're going to
end up with a bigger image than the
first example I've already talked about
so hopefully this makes sense to you and
we need to understand this before we
start writing out our new size of our
image because we can't just say divide
it by a certain amount okay so we're
going to create a new variable called
new underscore size and what we're going
to do in here is a few calculations that
I've played around with myself to get
this working so because I'm not amazing
at math I can't explain to you why this
works or why it doesn't know what works
because it does what heck but you know
follow along with this try and
understand it for anyone that's more
logical minded than
means in terms of mathematics you'll
probably understand this a lot better so
we've got new size and I have chosen
whilst playing around with this for a
good hour I think
well half an hour so I'm basically going
to say image width and then I added this
to image height so let's just space this
out so you can see what we're doing so
we've added the image width which we've
got here to the image height then what
we've done is we've divided that all by
the image width multiplied by the image
height divided by 45 so let's create
some brackets so we're processing this
properly so I did image width and then I
multiplied it and then another bracket
in here so we're multiplying this by the
image height times @ ÿâ times by 45 so
we've got image width it add image
height divided by the image width times
the image height times 45 so this
operation will complete and then
multiply it by the image width and these
two operations in brackets will sub and
complete individually and then divide by
each other so just out of curiosity
let's go ahead and echo out this new
size ok so we've got the individual
values here now let's refresh that okay
so we've got a massively long decimal
number so there's a still a few things
we need to do to create the new height
of the image and the new width of the
image so let's go ahead and do that now
let's go over to context let's get rid
of that so that's just interesting to
see what that's produced but it does
work so now we've got new width and new
height I'm going to create two new
variables and I'm going to multiply the
current width by this new size so in
actual fact I was meant to put a divide
there so later on this is going to make
sense why
when we create our new width and our new
height so let's just echo this out to
see what we got okay so now we've got a
small value below zero so we've got no
point one seven one three blah blah blah
so this is a small value what we're
going to now do is we're going to
multiply the original image height by
and the height and the width by this new
size which will then create a small
integer value or Mike you know might not
but we're going to create a small value
at least to resize our image too so
let's create our two variables first we
want new width and we're going to do the
same with new height and this is
basically going to be the image width so
the original image width times by the
new image size and this is just in
general we don't have a width and a
height for the new size this is how we
maintain our aspect ratio we're creating
the width and the height with the
original height and the width so
original width and then the original
height times by this new size so what
we're not what we're doing is we're
using this variable here to just scale
down the width and the height but by so
what we're doing is with multiplying it
by M I mean a negative number
oh no sorry naught point one seven one I
think it was but therefore we're keeping
the aspect ratio of the width and the
height so hopefully that makes sense to
you that's just echo this out and echo
this out let's append a break just on
the end of here so you can see what's
going on and we'll come back in a
refresh so you can see now our image has
been scaled down so we're going to
forget about the decimal points here
these aren't important these will be
removed later on when the image is
created so we've now got an image one
two five by 70 so one two five by 70 is
obviously a maintain aspect ratio value
for the original width and the height so
our new image is going to be a hundred
twenty-five by 70 which sounds about
right for
thumbnail image so now what we can test
doing if you'd like is test well I'm not
going to do it in the tutorial but test
loading in up with this code a really
large image and see if you get around
the same size back because with this new
size variable here with the calculations
that happen here you will always end up
with more s the same size so let's get
rid of these echo here and let's get rid
of this break that's important we get
rid of that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
