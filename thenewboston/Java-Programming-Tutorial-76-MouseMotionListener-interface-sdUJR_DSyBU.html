your 76th Java tutorial and in this
story we're going to be finishing up
that program that lets us do Mouse
events and well that's pretty much it so
in case you can't tell right here we
implemented from two different
interfaces which are pretty much just a
class in essence the mouse listener and
we did the five methods necessary for
that but we implemented from this other
one to Mouse motion listener and these
are pretty much like you can see the
motions of the mouse so when you move
the mouse like this or click and hold
down and drag
that's what registers these events so
these are pretty useful for a good
drawing programs and stuff like that so
let's go ahead and implement the methods
right now so public I'm like a little
comment um these are mouse motion events
so not just the typical mouse arm or
they call a mouse listener or whatever
so the first method we need to make is
called mouse drag so public avoid Mouse
dragged I always heard it was drugged
like Dig Dug Drake dragged anyways just
talk to myself here so let's go ahead
and put mouse event events nothing new
here and for the body what do we want to
do when they drag the mouse well let's
go ahead and there's nothing really we
can do except change the status bar dot
set text and we'll set it equal to
something like put that back come on
Hoss you are dragging the mouse how
original is that I know it's most
creative thing I can't come up with but
hey I'm not that creative that's what my
therapist told me so I'm just going to
go with that so after that what we need
to do is have mouse move and what mouse
move does is called when you move the
mouse without clicking any buttons just
like I'm moving the
right here and I'm not click any buttons
so mouse drag is when you hold down the
button but public void amounts moved is
not holding down any buttons so let's go
ahead to Mouse event event and in our
body what do you want to put status bar
dot set text and go ahead and just put
something like you move the mouse so now
we got MOU SEO of course that's how you
spell Mouse so now we got all of our
methods that we needed to implement
since we implemented from Mouse listener
and Mouse motion listener so now we can
go ahead and run this program
and I've down Lee doesn't see one of
these things that's boater on Haan DL er
CLA SSH Andi oh there we go
make sure your capitalisation does
matter it's case sensitive in Java as
you just saw so now let's go ahead and
run this program right here and I'll
show you guys what happens if we don't
got any errors it'll pop up trust me so
here is our window by default it has the
title bar at the top and here's the
status bar down here and here's our
mouse panel and so the first thing we
see is well let me go through each of
these methods look at the status bar
down here I'm going to press down or
hold down the mouse button and says you
press down the mouse button now when I
release it it says I clicked at that
coordinate because when you press down
your release it real quick it's a click
server saying all right if I press down
and release it that's a click how do I
get this to the release method well if
you click it and drag it and let it go
that's the one that says you release the
button so if you click down and release
in the same spot it's a click if you
click down and drag it and release it it
says you release the button so now what
do we have we have mousepressed
mouseclicked mouse released we also have
mouse entered as you can see as I'm
entering it it's changing a red
is I'm exiting it the mouse has left the
window it's changing white and lastly I
have you move the mouse and if I hold
down my button look I'm clicking down
the button and dragging it says you are
dragging the mouse so now let me talk
through each of these methods you guys
should know what all this means how to
create the window by now if you've been
watching my tutorials and let me talk
through each one of these remember well
I might as well just run that again so I
can bring it up bring it right there
so remember when it said mouse clicked
it set the text equal to the two
coordinates % d % D which was event get
X and get Y and I know you guys can't
see get Y but trust me so look at this
click at 10/10 65 click that 30 46 so
that is pretty much what it means in for
your information the X is left to right
and the Y is top to bottom it starts 0-0
right here and it increases the most
right here it look 279 141 so that is
what click thus the mouse pressed is
pretty much taking it right here and
when you press it down that's why we
were able to get this text you press
down the mouse mouse released let me
make sure I can't move my mouse you
release the button so that's why we're
able when we let go of our mouse button
and of course when we enter the area it
not only says you enter the area for a
short bit of time but also changes the
color to red look at this non anandhan
oh I entered I'm not I didn't come in
yet oh I just entered again it's red so
now what else did we do exit is white
it's the same thing and the last one is
dragged which is holding your mouse
button down that way we were able to set
the status bar too you are dragging the
mouse and moving it without holding it
down you move the mouse look at that so
now what do we know how learn in Java in
this little program that took quite a
little ways to build we learn how to
respond to the users Mouse events so now
we know how to respond to your keyboard
events using scanner
and the other stuff we will enter a nice
tutorial and also their Mouse events
right now so we can pretty much start
building for some pretty cool programs
using you know graphics and stuff like
that but for the next tutorial I'm
probably going to be teaching you about
layouts how to make super cool windows
with buttons right where you want them
and you know more stuff like that but
for now thank you guys for watching my
mouse event handling tutorial I hope you
learned a little something of course not
too much because I mean come on why
would you want to learn a lot I mean
learning not that fun so again thank you
guys for watching don't forget subscribe
to my channel so glad your subscribers
so glad thank you for your views don't
forget subscribe again and I will see
you next door</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
