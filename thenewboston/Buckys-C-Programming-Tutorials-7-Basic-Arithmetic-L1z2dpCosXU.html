seventh C++ tutorial and in this
tutorial as promised I'm going to be
going over basic C++ arithmetic now I
don't know I think it was like tutorials
go I gave you guys a variable and I
showed you guys that instead of just
setting it equal to a plain old value
like this you can use basic arithmetic
like 4 plus 6 and then when you go ahead
and you print it out X or anything like
that it actually calculated the value
and printed out the answer so go ahead
and run this and you see that X now
equals 10 4 plus 6
so aside from addition I want to show
you guys all the arithmetic operators
that you can use and they're a little
bit different than you might expect so
let's start with the easy ones first
the first one is subtraction and of
course like 8 minus 4 this would be
valid if we go ahead and build this we
saw that the answer would be 4 so
addition subtraction easy enough but
also aside from addition subtraction you
can use multiplication but make sure not
to use X like that because that will
mess up in order to multiply in computer
programming use the asterisks and that's
the symbol above the eight on your
keyboard and what this is going to do is
multiply these two numbers eight times
four so now if you go ahead and run this
we should get 32 and check it out 32
just like that so the well let's go
ahead and before I go over this let's go
ahead and go over division in order to
use the vision in computer programming
let's go ahead and take 81 divided by 3
division the symbol for this is the
forward slash so let's go ahead and take
81 divided by 3 and we get 27 just like
that
simple enough but check this out what if
we have something like 81 divided by 2
well this I mean it should be 40 but it
has a remainder of 1
so let's go ahead and try to build and
run this and see what we get well it
just has 40 and that's not entirely
right because it should have a remainder
of 1 with it so we're saying all right
we're working with integers right here
and we
any other data types so how can we get
that remainder well whenever we want to
use the remainder we need to use
something called the modulus operator
and that is the percent sign like this
what this is going to do is it's going
to give you the remainder of the answer
it's not going to say 40 remainder one
it's just going to give you that one so
let's go ahead and build and run this
and you can see that whenever we do 81
modulus 2 it's going to give us the
remainder which is 1 so let me show you
guys a better example on maybe 24 modulo
7 well we know that 21 or excuse me 24/7
is 3 with a reminder where the remainder
of 3 so let's go ahead and build this in
again it doesn't say 3 remainder 3 it
just says the remainder which is 3
simple enough so now that we know all
the arithmetic operators I can begin
teaching guys about order of precedence
now aside from just you know one number
of rithmetic operator another number you
can have complex calculations like 6
times 4 plus 8 times 4 plus 9 divided by
20 and if we go ahead and build and run
this let's see what we get
56 birthday in our a so what order is
just doing this in is it doing 6 times 4
and then plus 8 or is it doing you know
4 plus 8 and then times that by 6
because depending on how you do it it's
going to come out with a different
result so the basics is this if you
remember way back in like seventh grade
math you know something called your
associative property and that's pretty
much this anything that's in parentheses
gets done first if you don't have any
parentheses it goes like this it does
all the multiplication in the vision
which would be this this and this it's
going to do that first and then it's
going to do you're dissin addition and
subtraction if you don't have if you
know if you just have like four plus
eight plus seven um you're saying all
right then is it going to do a plus
seven first or four plus eight first it
really doesn't matter it comes out the
same either way the only time you have
varying answers is when you have like
four plus three times seven for example
if you did four plus three it would be 7
times 7 would be 49 but whenever we run
this whoa easy box we get 25 why is that
because it uses the associative property
it actually multiplies first which is 7
times 3 and that's 21 plus 4 which is 25
so again if you want to explicitly say 4
plus 3 first you need to surround that
in parentheses so now whenever we build
and run this it's going to run your
parentheses first and say our a 4 plus 3
equals 7 times 7 equals 49 so remember
the rule is this parentheses first then
your multiplication in the vision and
then your addition and subtraction so
remember that and if you get confused
it's called the associative property you
should have learned it in like eighth
grade math or ninth grade math or maybe
7th grade I don't know I can't remember
it was a long time ago for now that's
all I want to talk to you guys about
basic arithmetic and how it works in C++
so for now that's all you guys get so
thank you guys for watching this
tutorial if you have any questions go to
my website the New Boston calm and click
on forum and you can ask me there so one
last time thank you guys for watching
don't forget subscribe and I'll see you
