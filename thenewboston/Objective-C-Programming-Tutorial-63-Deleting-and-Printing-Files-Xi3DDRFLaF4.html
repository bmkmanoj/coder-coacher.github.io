welcome to your 63rd objective-c
tutorial and in this story I'm pretty
much gonna be telling you how to do two
most common things with files you think
I'd be teaching you those first but I'm
actually teaching you the last
interesting huh so anyways let me go
ahead and close this delete the file I
already have and what we're going to be
doing is don't mind me mumbling back
then we're gonna be doing first is
creating a new file so file new file
just make sure it's an empty text file
from other and go ahead and click Next
and well we might as well name it baby
and choose where it's going is going and
build debug again as the rest of our
files so that looks good so now we have
a file named baby in our main directory
and we don't even have to you know
populate it with anything because I just
wanted to make a sample file to show you
guys that check this out
so I have something to delete pretty
much and by the way make sure that you
have no files in this directory except
of course your bucket test tests or file
and baby or you can just follow along
with soil it doesn't really matter in me
so the first thing I'm gonna be showing
you what to do is how to delete a file
so delete a file and make sure you spell
delete wrong in your comment and so in
order to I mean we could go ahead and
put this in if/else block to find some
error codes but you know we're not going
to be typing in error so manager and the
method for this is remove item at path
in the parameter is what path or what
file do you want to leave so app baby
and we type this in because the path is
pretty much the file name in the same
directory baby so this is the file that
we want to remove and there's actually
one more parameter you have to type in
for the air just go ahead and type in
this means if we get air don't do
anything weird just uh you know don't
even worry about it because I mean that
looks good we're not going to get air
hopefully so that's how you delete a
file but I mean I might as well just
finish out this tutorial and show you
guys how to print out a file so by the
end of this program we're still going to
have this tested file and the contents
are still going to be my name is Bucky I
like ham but how exactly do we print it
out right in our console right here well
in order to print a file
nice little comment what you need to do
is NS log of course that's how you print
everything and you need to print out an
object and put the semicolon at the end
and as that object what you want to do
is actually pass it a method now this
method to print out a file is an NS it's
a mile mile it's a method from the NS
string class and string with contents of
file so it pretty much takes the
contents of your file and turns it into
a string but is a parameter you say what
file path do you want to pass it so just
put in tester file because remember we
created a testifier test or file object
and there are two other parameters it
needs the first is en encoding now what
encoding means pretty much I mean it's a
little more in-depth of this but how do
you want to display and we want it to
display I mean trust me you don't have
to remember this at all because all ever
everyone ever does is just copy it but n
s UTF and check this out you get this
big NS utf-8 string coding anyways it
doesn't even matter what that really
means
it's just normally we just wanted to
display normally if you ever need that
again then just go ahead and copy it you
don't need to remember that
and err no so I mean these really aren't
things that you need to understand err
no they don't give us any airs encoding
print it out normally this just might
confuse you because it has a weird name
but anyways the main thing you want to
remember is storing the contents of file
that's the method name and as a
parameter what do you want to print out
so I mean make sure you have only your
tester file and baby
none of these new file new file twos and
now we can go ahead and run it so let's
see if baby deletes yep baby deleted we
created that new file too obviously and
check this out
what got printed out files thirty-one
bytes that's the file size my name is
Bucky and I like ham and again this was
from the last tutorial and this was from
the last tutorial too but again what we
did in this story is we deleted that
baby file from our program and we also
printed out my name is Bucky and I like
ham because that was the contents of
this test file right there so that is in
essence I'm get rid of this thing how
you delete a file using the remove item
at path in your manager object and how
to print out a file using this method
from the NS string class and this method
called string with contents file it
takes a file and converts it into a
string using this weird encoding that I
mean it's irrelevant but you need it
there or else you're good air and also
air null so I mean that's that for this
tutorial we are finally done with this
program I can go ahead and delete it all
but if you want to look at any of the
code maybe you're getting air go ahead
and click on the link below and then
I'll put it all in my website for you
guys go ahead and copy it for you guys
for free but anyways we are done with
this program finally what a relief so
thank you guys for watching and don't
forget subscribe and I'll see you next
