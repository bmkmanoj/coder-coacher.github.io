very last Oriole in this little series
of C beginner program it's Orioles
congratulations we only have one last
topic to go now this is actually a topic
that I wanted to make sure to cover
before I finish this tutorial and this
is actually something that confuses a
lot of people and I think it's just
because they don't really understand it
or it isn't taught to them in a very
good way so what I want to do is I want
to show you guys a really simple example
of the two different ways that you can
pass variables into functions
they're called passed by reference or
some people call it passed by address
and also pass by value in the difference
between the two so since you can pass
variables and functions two different
ways what I'm going to do is I'm going
to make two different functions to
demonstrate that that seems like a
logical thing to do so the first one I'm
just going to name pass by value and
actually what I'm going to do is I'm
just going to coat these because it's
going to be kind of confusing if I try
to talk you guys through before all you
actually see what the program does so
for right now just follow along so pass
by value we're going to throw a variable
in there called eye and we're just going
to set it equal to some number and this
is going to be like 20 originally we're
going to set it equal to 99 and then
just return so again all this does is it
changes I and that's pretty much it so
that's passed by value
now the other one is pass by address now
in here we're going to make another
integer but this is going to be a
pointer to I so this is going to do is
of course whenever we do that we need to
dereference it so that's pretty much
going to be the memory address of I and
we'll set this equal to I'll set it
equal to something random different than
this so you can see which one of these
functions that whoa and then just like
for return
so right now we passed in a variable and
then we passed in the memory address of
that variable essentially all right so
the first thing that we should probably
do is prototype these before we learn
about you know the differences between
them and all that good stuff all right
so we got the boring stuff out of the
way now let's get to the heart of this
tutorial and that's this so there are
basically two different ways to use your
variables and functions so the first
thing that actually want to do is make a
regular integer variable that we have to
use and of course we have to name it
tuna if not our computer is going to
crash and I'm just going to set this
equal to 20 so we're going to take this
tuna variable which is equal to 20 and
we're going to pass it through these two
functions and we're going to notice some
kind of weird differences between them
so the first one is passed by value so
pass by value and of course this just
takes out a regular integer which is
tuna and now let me print out the value
of it so printf so passing by value um
mr. solo tuna is now % thee and of
course that is equal to tuna so I just
run this real quick
just make sure no bucks so far all right
20 simple enough talk about that later
and probably don't want to copy that so
the next thing I'm going to do is pass
by address and of course if we look down
here what it does is it takes a pointer
which pretty much means it needs a
memory address because this points to a
memory address so we actually need to
toss in the memory dress of tuna
all right that's interesting and paste
that because I'm lazy and passing by
address tuna is now % D we're just going
to print out the value of tuna again so
pretty much
here we set tuna equal to 20 I mean we
did this since I like tutorial number 3
and then we use this function printed it
out and then use this function and
printed it out again so check this out
the first function it takes that I and
it's set to equal to 99 and the second
function it takes the memory address and
set C equal to 64 but if we look right
here the first function it looks like it
didn't even do anything I mean that was
20 to start with and then it's still 20
after we called this function the second
one was the only one that actually
changed a variable so why is that well
I'll explain it right now so like I said
we can use functions in one of two ways
the first thing we did right here is we
pretty much pass by value and that just
means don't actually pass this variable
itself just get the value that's equal
to which is 20 so essentially what it
did is this right here it passed the
value of 20 in so whenever we ran this
function anything that happened in here
it didn't ever affect the variable it
just affect the value of 20 so you said
I don't know I
some stupid variable equal to 99 again
this variable was left untouched and
this is called passing by value so if
you ever want to run some calculation
and this is actually what you're going
to do most of the time but you want to
leave the original arm variable as is
you can run a whole bunch of
calculations and never mess with this so
that is why even though we ran that
function when we printed it out it was
still equal to 20 now this next one
right here there are going to be certain
times where you actually do want to
change this variable so what we did
whenever we pass by address is we pass
the memory address in and that actually
takes this variable wherever it is in
memory and it passes it into here so now
whenever we change it to something else
it's actually going to change that
variable itself not just like a copy of
it
so what we did is we took that tuna
variable you pass it in here and we set
tuna equal to 64
that's essentially what we did so now
tuna equals 64 after this is said and
done so now whenever we printed out
again since we hard-coded that right
into the memory that's where it says by
whenever you pass something pass a
function it's address it actually
changes that variable so again the value
just passes a copy of it and whenever
you pass the address you pass in the
variable itself so you can tweak it so
hopefully guys understanding I know that
was a it's kind of a hard concept to
understand at first but um once you do
it a few times like anything else it
gets second nature and all these weird
symbols like ampersand memory address
pointers they're going to become really
easy but for now thank you guys for
watching that is it we finally made it
you are now on you know capable of
pretty much making any C program the
only thing between what we learned in
making a large piece of software is just
putting the pieces together so hopefully
you guys have the knowledge to figure
that out if you ever get stuck on
anything then go to my forum ask me I
actually like to figure that stuff out
and I like solving problems so again one
less time think as for watching don't
forget subscribe check out my other
videos I'm going to be filming Python
next my favorite programming language so
uh well hopefully I'll see you there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
