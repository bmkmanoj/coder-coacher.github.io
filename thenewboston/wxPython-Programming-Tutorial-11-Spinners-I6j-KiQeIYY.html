tutorial and in this tutorial I'm going
to show you guys how to make something
called a spinner now what a spinner is
is pretty much that thing that it looks
like a text box with a number in it then
you can click arrows up and down to
adjust the number of it so it's a lot
easier if I just build and show you so
I'm gonna build it and then show you so
the first thing you need to do is go
ahead and create a spinner object and
I'm gonna name mine spinner set it equal
to the W X and the word for this is spin
SPI n-c TRL say for spin control
I guess the parameter is kind of weird
in this one or at least one of them is
so pay attention the first thing you
need to put the parent and the ID we
knew that of course
now the third parameter it takes is an
empty string and this is pretty much
worthless because if you have an empty
string or regular string um
I don't really know why you need this
but you need it this is the value
parameter so just stick with me for now
an empty string is your third parameter
now the rest are your normal positioning
I'm gonna put mine in
let's see 40 40 make sure it's in the
middle it's screwing somewhere and of
course the size and just set it equal to
something like 90 negative one for a
default height so now we got a spinner
made but we usually want to do a couple
things to it such as set the range and
set the default value so to set the
range or the minimum you can go in
maximum numbers you can enter what you
need to do is put your spinner object
dot set range and you need to enter a
tuple put like one to a hundred that's
pretty much what most people use again
and this method is used to set the range
on your spinner another thing you want
to do is enter a default value or like
where it as soon as your program starts
what number is in there by default and
you do this by the set value method and
you can set the value to anything you
want I'm gonna set my ten to begin with
and let's go ahead and run this and I'll
show you guys how it works or actually
even what it is so this is remove that
thing out of the way this is a spinner
right here and as you can see our set
value is at ten you can also enter
numbers and numerically like that I'm
entering with my keyboard right now or
you can just go ahead and click this up
and down arrow to go up and down and
again you see one is the minimum we can
go and if we got a like 98 100 is the
maximum we can go when we do that with
set range right here now a cool little
tip if you wanna like whenever you get
to a hundred or one if you wanna instead
of going 99 100 then when you click up
it doesn't stop it wraps around to one
again or when you're going like from 3
to 1 and press down again and goes to
100 what you need to do is set a style
of SP underscore wrap and this will make
your value wrap around so pretty much
that's your basics of spinner again go
ahead and Chris spinner object set it
equal to WX spin control give the parent
negative on one empty string position
size you set the range like this and set
the value like this and that's your
basics on how to create a spinner so
thank you guys for watching don't forget
to subscribe to my channel and I will
see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
