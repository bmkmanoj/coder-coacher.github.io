tutorial then I'm making boards on new
Boston and in this tutorial I'm going to
be showing you how to use inheritance so
all you need for this tutorial is a
button and a class with a few members
inside of it now all the members inside
of this class are public we have a
string name which is equal to Bob we
have an integer a each which is equal to
10 and we have this void right here
where it will display a message box to
the user now say we wanted to create
another class that had that has all the
same members as this my class right here
well well we could just copy and paste
all this coder here and paste it into
this class but there's an easier way you
can use something called inheritance and
what inheritance we'll do is we'll take
all the non private members in this
class and allow you to use them inside
of this class so if we in order to
inherit you're just going to put a colon
after the plot after this class and then
type the name of the class you want to
inherit from we're going to inherit from
my class so now all the members inside
of this class that aren't private are
now in this class as well so if we were
to create a new instance of my second
class we wouldn't as you can see there
are now all the members that weren't
private inside of this class are now in
this class as well so we have this age
name and show message now you can also
add members to this class you don't have
to just stick with the members that were
already in this class for example if you
wanted to this let's say we want to
create another string right here let's
call it hair color but thankful to
around now all these will have all of
these members and this member inside of
his class
so um se we all have hair color and we
also have the original one via page name
and show message but we cannot inherit
members that are private for example who
were to make this string name private
then wouldn't be able to inherit it or
yet inherit from it so we wouldn't be
able to do my second class dot name
because it's private now inside of this
class we can use all of these public
members for example who wanted to do
will create a new method here which will
I guess just display another message box
message box special special message box
and what we can do here is we can now
access all the non private members of
this class so who wanted to have a
message system remove forms so if we
wanted to access this integer age right
here we could we could do base dot and
then age because the base keyword will
access the base class this is here this
right here is called the base class and
then the class that you that is
inheriting from a class is called the
derived class so this is this class is
derived from this base class or here so
we can use the keyword base to access
all the non private members inside of
its class so we could now have a message
box display the age inside of this
method inside this class right here so
if you make this public so you can now
use it outside no to MSC message box
special and we should get a message box
that says ten because we're using this
age right here and we're just playing it
in a message box
yep you can inherit you and you can do
base dot with any thing that's not
private like we could do instead of
doing this we could do base dot show
message we can use we can access methods
as well not only variables so we could
just display that base now dot age dot
to string and this will be the exact
same thing you know something else that
you can do is say you want to make it so
you can only access these members inside
of this derived class but you don't want
to make it so you can access these
members outside of the outside of this
class in this class what you can do is
you can use an access modifier called
protected so if we protected on both of
these we can still now access them from
this derived class right here by doing
based show message in base
but we cannot access them outside of
either one of these classes so if we
were to try to go out here and do MSC
dot and then our show message will get
in here so if I try to do show message
it will say that I can get this message
so it is inaccessible due to its
protection level so that just means that
since this is protected we can only
access this be this method and this
variable inside of the class it's
created in and inside of the class that
is derived from it and say you want to
like replace this method with something
that is very similar to it so say we
want to have this show message method
display a proper or a title to the
message box well all we could do is we
could do
and then type new Lloyd show message and
basically what this will do is it will
replace this void that is inherited so
if we were to make this public again
public all right if we were to make this
public again we would this right here
this method would overwrite this method
right here so we could have a message
box be displayed and here and we could
change it up and make it do something
different like we'll have it display a
title as well so it's called so now when
we do my second class it will go to this
method instead of this method because we
use the keyword new so it knows to go to
this method instead of this method so we
could do MSC dot show message and we
type in the message let's call it must
right there our message box should now
have a title because we replaced the
original method with a new one
yep and this is useful if you cannot
access this class for example this is
inside of like a dll or something
something else you can do is use the
override keyword um and in order to you
the override keyword this method must be
virtual so virtual and then we can do
something called override where we just
type keyword override right here and
that will do the same thing as doing the
new void or whatever we're going to do
this public as well so this should do
the exact same thing as before that's
just an alternate way of doing it Oh
all right so that's pretty much all
there is on inheritance so that's all
for this tutorial
so see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
