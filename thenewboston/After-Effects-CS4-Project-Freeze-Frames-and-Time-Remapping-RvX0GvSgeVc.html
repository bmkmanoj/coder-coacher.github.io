to another After Effects project in this
project I'm going to show you guys how
to do freeze frames and slow motion and
just working with time you know you can
make your scene go backwards if you want
and this is all about time remapping so
I already have this clip right here and
let me just drag it out to the timeline
panel and by the way if you notice my
composition is about 15 seconds long but
my clip is only 5 seconds long and
whenever you're working with time
remapping you always want your
composition larger than your clip
because then when you stretch the time
out and make it go slow-motion or
something it's gonna be like twice as
long if you don't know how to change the
time of your composition just go to
composition composition settings and
change the time right here this means 15
seconds this would be minutes and this
is hours so go ahead and click cancel or
okay depending on what you need and I'll
show you my clip right now there's me
coming in Oh drop the football oh boy oh
catch it nice action movie so let's
watch that one more time
I got whooping cough and by the way if
you want it to pre-render and you want
to hear the sound go ahead and press 0
on your number pad and this will pretty
render it for you with sound again you
can't hear my sound because I'm talking
in the microphone with a headset on but
let's go ahead and what I want to do is
instead of just having me yeah catch it
that's all exciting I want it to freeze
right let's see what the gaze frame is
right there yeah that was pretty gay
look at my mouth oh girls and I want it
to freeze right here and just pause a
moment in time so what I'm gonna do is
this go ahead and right-click anywhere
on your layer and go ahead and click a
time enable time remapping and what
enable time remapping does is pretty
much enable you to mess with the time of
your layer so now you can see it
automatically added two keyframes one at
the beginning and one at the end now if
we stretch these keyframes out the
and our entire clip would stretch out
making it slow motion so if you put a
five-second clip in ten seconds it's
gonna go twice as slow but we wanted to
do is just freeze this room right here
so go ahead and your time remap and
click this little keyframe adder right
here and we're gonna add a keyframe
right there now what we want to do is we
don't want to adjust this a little
cursor at all we only want to step
forward one frame and that'll be very
difficult with the cursor so go ahead
and on your keyboard press page down and
as you can see your layer moves one
frame forward by the way page up is one
frame back like you guys cared but
anyways once your one frame forward you
can go ahead and press that little add
keyframe again and now you got two
keyframes one frame apart one back and
one forward so now what you need to do
is you need to stretch out of the space
between this keyframe right here in that
keyframe so what you're gonna do is
deselect them all and in order to select
multiple keyframes select one then hold
down shift and select another one and
now when they're both selected drag them
let's say four seconds apart so now
there are four seconds between this
keyframe and this keyframe where time
isn't moving at all so if you're saying
all right check this out Michael it
plays just like this but then my clip
ends well all you need to do is when
your clip is edited go ahead and
highlight it and drag it out to the end
and by the way if you drag your clip
further than the time you're mapping
it'll just freeze automatically like
this see check it out but anyways as you
can see time go over is normal right
here and then between these two
keyframes now it pauses just like this
and then it goes back to being normal so
we don't need this extra stuff right
here and if you can't understand it yet
then check it out in the graph editor
right here in order to view a graphical
represent
of any of your animations go ahead and
select the animation and go ahead and
click graph editor now you can see this
graph represents the time of your clip
so for example my clip is 5 seconds long
that's why it's doing this so this is
normal speed right here and then you see
once we hit my first keyframe time
stands still Wow
it's magic and then after that it just
goes back to being normal
right like that now we're saying what if
time went down like this well if it went
down it would represent going backwards
in your clip which means doing
everything backwards so let me show you
well let me show you guys my final
product go beginning and hit zero on
your number pad and now look this oh oh
and there it is this would be a good
time for like Bucky the jock and then
your movie you know if you're making
like an opening clip for a movie that
would be good that would be good time so
let's watch that again here is Bucky
daunted um the jock
okay then time that in then it would go
back to playing you know it looked a lot
better in my head but anyways let's go
ahead and get rid of this graphical
representation and also let's get rid of
these keyframes and as you can see if we
got rid of these keyframes it would just
make it a appear in a little slower
motion since time is stretch it out but
what we want to do I guess I have time
to show you this is now that you know
how to do free streams in slow motion
let's go ahead and go backwards so for
example say I get to a point in my movie
like right here and then I'm like wait
and then I'm going to retrace all my
steps and I'm going to throw a twist
that yeah in a plot and so anyways what
we're going to do is it's going to add a
keyframe like that and then go to my
graph editor and instead of going
forward I'm gonna go back in time so
check this out
I come in
Oh everything's going normal but wait he
discovered something a dark deep secret
from his past go back go back go back go
back see you know again it sounded a lot
better in my head in a more natural way
to do this is to select your keyframe
and hit this easy ease button and that
gives it a nice curve so let's watch
this horrible movie real quick and oh
I'm coming in Oh drop the football but
wait would I leave outside
yeah actually did that noise with my
mouth pretty good huh
and again if I wanted to make it more
look more professional here's what I
would do layer excuse me effect make
sure my layer selected effect color
correction curves and now let me move
this just bring out the contrast that
said bit and yeah that's why we get a
sweet 300 factory hair so here is our
final movie whoa that was a super fast
oh here is Bucky the awesome football
player but he has a deep dark secret
from his past he has to go back in time
we get it yeah so you know that's your
movie essentials for you know time
remapping and how to work with it and
how to create freeze frames so thank you
guys for watching don't forget subscribe
and check out my blog too and I'll see
you next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
