so our first method of graphing is
plotting points so we have this equation
y equals 2x plus 1 we're gonna pick
these five points no particular reason I
just wanted you guys to get a good look
at what this graph looks like we're
going to plug each point in to find out
each ordered pair so if I plug negative
2 in I get 2 times negative 2 which is
negative 4 plus 1 is negative 3 I plug
negative 1 then I get 2 times negative 1
which gives you negative 2 plus 1 which
is negative 1 you plug 0 and you get 2
times 0 which is 0 plus 1 is 1 2 times 1
is 2 plus 1 is 3
and 2 times 2 is 4 plus 1 is 5 so now
what we're gonna do is graph each of
these points and then connect them
together to graph our line so negative 3
or negative 2 negative 3 1 2 1 2 3 this
is point 1 negative 1 negative 1 1 this
is point 2 0 1 0 1 1 3
three and two bye so this is our last
point so if we connect all these points
so if you connect this these points by
drawing in this line you'll get the line
and mine's a little bit off just because
I didn't use actual graph paper but when
you do these at home and you use graph
paper and your lines will be exact
method two is is how we're gonna graph
it using slope intercept form so this is
the more preferred way because it's its
moorings it's easier and it requires
less plugging in so since we know that
our slope is equal to two and we know
that our y-intercept is negative three
negative three is where our graph
touches the y axis and at any y
intercept the x coordinate is zero so
the that point is zero negative three so
if we draw in our y intercept and I'm
gonna name label it with a little Y and
starting at our y-intercept we're gonna
use the definition of slope to graph our
line so slope is just the ratio of rise
over run so if it has a slope of two
that means it's rises to and it's run is
1 so starting at zero
three we're gonna go up 2 to the right 1
up 2 to the right 1 up 2 to the right 1
and then starting at our Sam y-intercept
we're gonna go down 2 and left 1 and
that gives you the same kind of slope
because if you take negative right here
if you take negative 2 and put it over
negative 1 you still get 2 so that gives
us our points and then we can connect
them we're going to connect them and
we're gonna get the same line this is
the line we just got and this is the
line we got before and if you look at
them both they're the same one so that's
all we're gonna do with graphing but
make sure you come back and watch the
next video we're gonna where we're gonna
work on solving systems of equations</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
