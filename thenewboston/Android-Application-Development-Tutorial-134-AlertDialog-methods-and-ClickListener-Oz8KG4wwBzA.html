Android tutorial for the new Boston
we're gonna learn about alert dialogue a
little bit more in depth not much more
but a little bit and that's where we're
gonna we're gonna create a dialog that
pops up on the screen if again they hold
down their finger for longer than a
second and a half so what we're gonna do
is we're going to set up our alert
dialog within this within this bracket
here and also display it get everything
going there so first we need to set up
for alert dialog so we're gonna just say
alert dialog and we're gonna call this
we're going to call this alert something
like that
pretty pretty standard there and then
what we're gonna do is we're gonna say
new alert dialog and then we say dot
builder we give it a context we want
refer to our main class on dart touch me
class so we're gonna say main dot this
and then what we're gonna do is we're
going to say dot create and that's going
to create it right now it doesn't really
hold anything it's not really
well-defined but that's we're going to
get to here so now we're just gonna
refer to our alert and we're just gonna
say dot set the title and whatever our
title is like pick something pick an
option
and and then that's the title we also
want to add like a body or a message to
it so we're gonna say alert dot set
message we're gonna set this equal to I
told you pick an option man so something
like that I don't know no it's getting
too late for me guys I told you to pick
an option and there we go we have our
body and now what we want to do is we
have wanna have a few buttons so all
we're gonna do is we're gonna say alert
dot set button go figure right then we
have to set buttons text so we're gonna
say place a pinpoint and then we need to
create a listener but what we want to do
is refer to the dialogue interface for
this onclicklistener
so we're gonna say new dialog interface
and we're gonna say on click listener
and just hit enter and it sets it up for
you this is kind of I mean this is
pretty much a similar layout is when we
use our click listener before before we
use like the view instead of the
dialogue interface but since we're
working with alert dialogue we want the
dialogue interface that onclicklistener
and then here we go we have our on click
listener and what we're gonna do is
we're gonna basically set up our methods
for placing a pen point and and that's
for the first button but we want more
than one button so I'm just gonna copy
this whole chunk of code here for our
alert dot set button hit enter format it
for you guys and we're gonna change the
text of this one to get address
something like that and the only other
thing we need to do is it's trying to
set it to the same button that we set
here so we're gonna say set button 1 or
set button too and I'll set the second
button for us and then let's just paste
another one get you guys a little bit
familiar with the buttons here now
trying to just make a tutorial out of
this but I don't know and here we go so
we have three buttons now and we're just
gonna call this one option three for now
until I think of something to do for
this option and then all we're gonna do
is say alert dot show because we've
created it but we haven't shown it yet
so we're just gonna say dot show and you
know there we go there we go now our
lurtz gonna show up it's basically gonna
create itself and then show every time
we hold for longer than a second and now
what we're gonna do is within this if
statement if all this stuff happens
we're gonna return let me see return
true and that way I mean it's not super
important but that way we're gonna
return true if we go through this if
statement else we're gonna return false
so let's run our application make sure
it works
hopefully otherwise we have to redo a
few of these tutorials but I'm hoping
that it's gonna work here alright so we
have we have our map and then if we hold
and let go for more than three seconds
or I'm sorry a second half this dialog
comes up where it says pick an option I
told you to pick an option and then we
have three choices
all of them have unclick listeners
attached to them and as you can see this
get address in place pinpoint what did I
do here all right well the order of the
buttons is a little bit messed up but
we're just gonna we're just gonna roll
with it you know we're pretty chillax
like that and then we have all of our
click listeners but again I mean we're
just gonna roll with it because we don't
really care for the most part but like
if they're trying to pan around and you
know most likely they're holding for
longer than a second and a half so that
dialogue is gonna come up which might
cause a problem but you know our
application is gonna do it
it doesn't matter but if we just click
for under a second like this I'm just
kind of clicking injure I mean real
quickly our alert dialog doesn't come up
again it's only if it's for more than a
second and a half so hope you guys
enjoyed that tutorial hope you
understand a little bit more about this
alert dialog and also if you want to
change like the icon you can also use a
method like set icon and you can see
some of the other methods you can use
with this alert dialog but for this
example you know pretty much covered the
basics some buttons and all that stuff
so thanks again for watching guys and
I'll catch you in the next tutorial have
a good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
