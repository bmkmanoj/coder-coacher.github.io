to your 59th biology lesson and this is
rural I want to talk to you guys about a
dude named Gregor Mendel now Gregor
Mendel was actually one of the first
dudes to really understand inheritance
now he was actually born way back in the
1800s and back then people believed in
something called blending inheritance
now what blending inheritance basically
was is it was the idea that if you had
one of your mates say the dad was really
tall and he made it with the mom that
was really short or you know the
girlfriend whatever it is then the
offspring would be of medium height
because they would take a trait which
would be tall and short in these traits
was kind what kind of blend together so
the offspring would pretty much be the
average of the mates now obviously later
on we know today that this isn't exactly
the case but Mendel was actually the
first person you know he really didn't
buy the idea of blending inheritance
when everyone else was so what he did is
he began to study how organisms inherit
traits by breeding pea plants so pea
plant looks something like this and you
know it has a flower let me draw I don't
know maybe what color would be a nice
purple so pea plant has flowers on it
and of course it's a pea plant so it
also has peas and you guys already know
what peas are the kind you eat so what
he did like I said is he pretty much
started breeding these P plans so he
could study the traits of the offspring
so basically he looked at many of the
heritable traits in some of them were
flour color and lower some other ones
the color of the peas or a trait the
plant height and also plant shape and
pretty much any traits that he could
observe he took note of and this is how
he began to study inheritance in
genetics so after several experiments in
breeding different variations of these P
plans he began to notice some very
interesting patterns forming now it's
important to note that for the first few
of Mendel's experiments he
we use pure-breeding pea plants now what
is a pure breeding pea plant well these
are plans to always reproduce the same
traits in their offspring 100% of the
time so an example of this would be
maybe he was studying the tray of height
and pea plants have two different
heights that they can grow tall or short
well if a pea plant was bred pure bred
correctly this would mean that at all
pea plant it would always reproduce tall
offspring so that's basically what
happens in pure breeding their pea
plants that always reproduce the same
traits in their offspring
100% of the time now of course he pure
bred tall pea plants in the also pure
bred short pea plants which meant that
whenever you have a pure bred short pea
plant it always reproduced the form
short offspring so whenever I talk about
pure breeding that's what I mean pretty
much plants that always reproduce the
same traits in their offspring 100% of
the time now another thing that I'm
going to be talking about is different
types of generations have different
conventions of naming the original
parents whenever you breed something are
called the pea one generation now the
offspring that they breed immediately
kind of think of it like their children
is called the f1 generation so the p1
are the parents and the f1 are the
children now the next generation we'll
just call these I don't know the
grandchildren are f2 so on and so forth
so the original parents are the p1 their
children are the f1 and their
grandchildren or the next generation are
called the f2 generation so I just
wanted to mention that because whenever
I say whenever you know the p1
generation breeds the f1 offspring you
guys are gonna understand what I'm
talking about so in the next surah what
I want to do is I want to talk to you
guys about exactly what went on in these
experiments and why these findings were
so freakin interesting</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
