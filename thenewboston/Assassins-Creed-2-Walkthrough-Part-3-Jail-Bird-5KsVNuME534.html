welcome to the third a tutorial or
walkthrough or whatever you want to call
it for Assassin's Creed and this is
memory tenon this is called jarrett jail
bird well you can see from the title so
pretty much what you have to do is you
need to go talk to your dad who just got
put in jail so i'm going to show you
guys the easiest way to do this and I
mean there are a lot of different ways
that you can get into the tower to see
your dad but you mostly want to go in
from the north entrance since this is
going to give you the least confusion
and you usually want to avoid guards but
I really don't care if I run in the
guards you're nuts cuz I mean there are
some right there because i i'm just
going to fight them anyway so I'm really
just doing this quick and I'm probably
going to have a bunch of chasing me like
I do now but anyways you see this door
right here climb up right here and it's
a it's better if you don't get any
guards but I did so oh well and now i am
a notorious or whatever and now you see
the scaffolding scaffolding go up here
and now you get to the third level and
the third level is if you're getting
chase you pretty much want to do all
your fighting up here because then you
can throw your guards off and you can
kill them so i'm going to try it sorry
got kennel cough easily killed this guy
real quick crap two of them there we go
pinching the head
and I usually like to kill one at a time
so you know I kill one get them out of
the way then kill the other one but i
get rid of that guy publica up cup there
we go i'll go ahead and let's see i
might have to kill the other ones before
I see my dad but i'll see if i can do
this first you see in the bottom right
my minimap it is up if there's red or
yellow around it that means you're
notorious pretty much means are being
followed or chased and i don't know if i
can complete this let's see no I have to
become a non missed so that means i have
to kill all the guards that are
following me until my minimap becomes no
color so let me take care of these real
quick bam bam move so you can see see
the thrashing and what who did who Texas
part oh you I see how it is oh yeah
there you go up a cup mofo and there you
go once at the gut and one of the
slobber knocker all right I now finally
I man on Miss which means I'm hidden so
you know that was pretty discreet
assassinations right there and I don't
have any weapons yet I'm going to get
those soon so that's why I have to you
know fist pound everyone so now let me
go ahead and talk to my dad right here
and jump up here and go ahead and climb
this and there you go just all that you
guys listen
what's happened took a bit of a beating
but I'm all right what of your mother
and sister safe now aneta took them yes
wait moody's what happened not the way
it did not assume doesn't matter now
what do you mean explain there's no time
listen closely return to the house in my
office is a hidden door use your talent
to find it beyond lies it just take
everything you find inside much of it
may seem strange to you but all of it is
important do you understand yes good
among the contents is a letter and with
it some documents I need you to take
these documents to me Sarah vest oh he
was with me in the office this morning
the gonfaloniere II I remember oh please
tell me what's happening I depart see
behind this there was a note for you at
the pigeon Jewish oh she's get away
alright so now you talk to your dad and
you may be inclined to go ahead and you
know just go towards the other mission
but what you want to do first is you
want to climb this again and you want to
synchronize at the view point before you
you know return to continue on with your
game so go ahead and climb a right where
you climb before and at the top you'll
see a little note or a tardy popped up
the eagle represents see that little ego
on your mini-map that means that there's
a viewpoint that the that means that you
got a synchronized somewhere and you see
my minimap it's all grid right now and
once you synchronize you can see that it
turns into map and that's what we want
so let's go over this and I'll
synchronize and then I'll jump down and
I'll show because I know you guys love
to see me jump and remember so don't
forget to check out my other videos
don't forget subscribe and I'll show you
me jumping because I know you guys want
to see it so here I go so thank you for
watching and I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
