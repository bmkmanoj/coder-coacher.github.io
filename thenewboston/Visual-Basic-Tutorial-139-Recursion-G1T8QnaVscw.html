youtube.com slash on live gamer for the
new Boston and in this tutorial we're
going to be talking about recursion
now what recursion is is is it's
basically a sub or a function calling
itself over and over again so let's go
ahead and make a little demo application
for this we will create a new project
select windows forms application and we
will call it recursion we'll wait for
that to load okay so once it's open
let's go ahead and make the form a
little bit smaller and we will come into
our toolbox and we'll add a button and a
text box
okay so we'll set the text of button 1
to recursion and we'll set the name to
button recursion okay so let's go ahead
and we'll double click on that to open
up our form 1 class and the event
handler the click event handler for
button recursion let's go ahead and come
below this and create a function so
private function and we will just call
it recursive function and for our
arguments we will take an integer so
argh int as integer and we want to
return a double just in case we get a
decimal value so now let's go ahead and
create an if statement so if our int is
less than or equal to 10 then let's go
ahead and return Arg int now else if Arg
int is greater than 10 then let's go
ahead and call this function again so we
will return recursive function and then
Arg int and this time let's divided by 2
so that we get different values each
time because we just kept passing
argued to it it would keep calling
itself over and over and over and it
would never end so we're going to return
that / - it's going to keep doing that
until it is less than or equal to ten
and then it's going to return the
original integer not the original one
the one that was passed to little s
occur into the function so now let's go
ahead and whenever they click on the
button
let's output what the function sent back
so we'll just type message box show and
let's go ahead and show recursive
function and then we want to convert so
convert dot - in 32 and we want to use
what's in textbox 1 dot text so this is
all one statement right here we call it
a recursive function and the argument
that we're passing to it is the stuff in
text box 1 dot txt and it's converted to
an integer so let's go ahead and add one
more parentheses to finish this off and
let's go ahead and run this and see what
we get see here
okay
so here's our form let's go ahead and
type ten in here and when we click
recursion we get ten back because if
it's less than or equal to ten it's just
going to give us back the original
integer so we'll do four and it gives us
four now let's go ahead and do 20 now
before I click recursion let's try and
figure out what this is going to do so
since it's greater than ten it's going
to call itself again and it's going to
do 20 divided by two so that we should
get the value 10 let's go ahead and do
this with 30 so it's going to do 30
divided by two which is 15
then it's going to call itself again and
it's we're going to get seven and a half
or eight it rounds it automatically
rounds up to eight because we're using
integer in here let's go ahead and do
this with a larger number let's do 246
and if we click recursion we get eight
back because it keeps dividing by two
until it is the lesson on yeah until it
is less than or equal to ten so let's do
300 and you can see that we get ten back
so now I'll show you guys what will
happen if you don't have a way for your
recursive function or sub to exit so if
we just keep doing this it's going to
create an infinite loop and it's never
going to stop recalling itself so we'll
just do 23 and you can see that the
program freezes up because we've created
an infinite loop and we'll go ahead
we'll go ahead and have to stop it right
there
so make sure that when you're using
recursion you always want to have a way
for your function or your sub to exit or
else you'll make you create loops that
are infinite and it will crash your
program so thanks for watching guys
practice a little bit with recursion and
then once you've got that down I know
it's kind of a hard concept to grasp but
once you've got that down go ahead and
move on to the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
