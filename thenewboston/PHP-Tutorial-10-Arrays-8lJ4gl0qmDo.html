tutorial now that we're done with loops
it's time to move on to something a
little more interesting and this what
I'm going to teach today is called an
array now what an array is is something
that allows you to store multiple values
in a single variable so last time if we
wanted to write similar variables we're
type in the variable num equals some
number then we'll type in another
variable num B equals another number and
it got kind of confusing if you're a
little bit so this time I'm going to
show you how to put multiple values in
the same variable which is very useful
later on so let's make a variable called
people and to make an array instead of
just typing in one value after the word
people you need to type the word array
and then you need to make parameters to
put in it or multiple values to put in
it so inside once you have your array
and your parameters you can start typing
in people's names or anything you like
so I'm going to type in Tom and notice
the strings are enclosed in parenthesis
and you separate items in an array with
a comma so I type my comment now I'm
going to type Jake
I'll type Tony and of course outside of
your parameter end it with a semicolon
press ENTER to move on to the next line
now what the computer does is it doesn't
order items in their array like mean you
would count instead of saying first item
second item third item it starts with
the number zero so Tom zero Jake is one
and Tony is two so another when you want
to output this on a screen or reference
it here's how you do that type in people
and then in your square brackets you
type whatever number so this would be
equal to Tony people and your square
brackets two since we have the variable
people we have zero one two so if we
echoed this on a screen right now Oh
print Tony so as you saw that that was a
different way to write into an array so
of course you can also write them like
this if you like doing it better for
your oh sorry for your first one which
is actually zero we could set that equal
to Tom
and of course you ended just like that
and for your second variable value
that's stored in people which would be
one we set that one equal to Jake and
for the third variable storing people
which would have the second place holder
in it let's set that equal to Tony
so now just prove that this all works
let me echo this on the screen so if you
wanted to echo the people to which would
be Tony let me save that and show you
that it says Tony now again why does
this do this because we have an array
with a bunch of values in it and the
second value in that variable actually
it's a third but the two has the value
of Tony and of course up here is another
way of course we have the variable
people and we have an array which means
in this variable we're going to have all
these values this is labeled 0 1 &amp;amp; 2 so
as you see if you wrote 0 and saved it
should come up with Tom which it does
right here so that's how you if you want
to get a like variable and you want to
keep a bunch of similar values in it
this is how you do this and we're also
going to be using this a lot later and
it's going to come in handy for a bunch
of stuff and to keep it a lot more
organized thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
