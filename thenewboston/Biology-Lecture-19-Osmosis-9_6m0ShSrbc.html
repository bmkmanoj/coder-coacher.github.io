biology tutorial and in this lesson I
want to talk to you guys about the other
type of passive transport
that's called osmosis now before we
start talking about this I want to show
you guys a little demonstration and
throw out a few vocabulary words because
it's going to help understand exactly
what osmosis is so say that we had I
don't know just a cup say we grabbed a
cup from our you know cupboard and we
filled it up with water so let me go
ahead and throw some water molecules in
here pretty freakin sweet looking water
molecules if you ask me now you have
your water molecules right here and you
also have I don't know let me throw some
will say that this is salt water so the
red is salt and I might as well go label
a salt and the blue is the water
molecules let me draw a few more so the
blue is water look at that nice
color-coded diagram now let me go ahead
and choose another color because this of
course together whenever you add salt in
water mix it together it's called a
solution and you guys already know the
solution is I'm not going to go ahead
and talk about that I'm not you know
pretending that you guys are dumb or
anything but what I do want to go over
is the parts of the solution in this
well solution the first one is the
solute which is the salt so the salt is
also called a solute Sol u te now the
definition of a solute is inside a
solution which we're looking at right
here it's the substance that's dissolved
in another substance so basically
whenever you have salt water you have a
little bit of salt and it's dissolved
inside the water so the substance that
is dissolved in another one is the
solute so the salt is the solute simple
enough now the water also has its own
word and this is called the solvent so
Sol v E and T so basically whenever you
have a solution one of the substances
does the dissolving which is the water
and the other substance dissolves inside
it which is the salt or the solute
alright so now we got that done a
solution basically has a solute which is
the little thing that dissolves in the
bigger solvent so now what the heck are
we talking about this for because we
were supposed to be talking about
frickin osmosis and now you got us
talking about solutions well it's
because whenever we talk about osmosis
it's basically when the definition is
when water moves moves from where it's
more pure to areas where it has more
solutes okay let's go ahead and open up
another slide and see if we can
understand this a little bit better so
say that we have some membrane right
here and I'll just go ahead and label
this this is the membrane and we can say
it's any you know semipermeable membrane
of course whenever we're talking about
in biology it's going to be the cell
membrane but for right now just imagine
it as any semipermeable membrane and say
that we have a bunch of water molecules
on the left hand side so this is a bunch
of water and since we are trying to be
scientific I'll go ahead and label it is
h2o
now we have a couple on the right-hand
side I don't know maybe I don't know
three or so but aside from that we have
a bunch of I don't know let me think of
a good solu something like sucrose well
it can be like salt sucrose any kind of
sugar anything that dissolves in water
but we'll go ahead and draw sucrose now
obviously we looked at the chemical
structure for sucrose and we know that
it's a lot bigger than the small water
molecules so it cannot cross the
membrane if it tries to doesn't work out
and and again my sucrose looks like a
thing of grapes why is that every time I
draw to try to draw out a molecule
bigger than water or oxygen it always
end up looking like grapes
I don't know but by anyways what's going
to happen here
is if I grab a let's say I'll grab green
so what's going to happen here in the
process of osmosis remember it's when
water moves moves from areas where it's
more pure to areas where it has more
solutes so again this right here is the
solute and what to say that it's sugar
we'll say it's sucrose so basically if
this were a solution which this is over
here it would have a solute which is a
sucrose and it's dissolved in the water
which is the solvent so this process
osmosis what would happen naturally is
across a membrane the water would start
to move over here why is that because
when water diffuses across a membrane
from areas where it's more pure see this
is pretty much pure water 100% over
there to areas where it has more solutes
that is the process called osmosis it's
different than fusion because diffusion
is just from areas where it has higher
concentration to lower concentration the
key that we need to remember in osmosis
is water moves the areas where it has
more solutes right there so that's key
without the solutes osmosis would not
happen it would be called something else
so again one more time the process of
osmosis is when water moves from areas
where it's more pure to areas where it
has more solutes so water is still the
solvent and the solutes are still sugar
and of course whenever you combine mom
you have a solution through a process
called osmosis now of course one last
time whenever we're looking at cells
instead of a simple membrane this thing
right here would actually be the cell
membrane or plasma membrane but for this
demonstration just go ahead and you know
you don't have to remember all that for
right now so in the next tutorial what I
was planning on doing is I was going to
talk to you guys about something called
active transport
but what I decided to do is instead of
covering it in the next sorrow I'm
actually going to cover it in a couple
tutorials because I want to cover some
other things first
and once I cover those core concepts you
guys are going to understand a lot more
about active transport and a lot more
useful fashion but for right now just
remember that special proteins called
active transport proteins what they do
is they use the energy in cells to
concentrate molecules inside or outside
of the cell and actually you know just
remember this active transport uses it
energy from the cell to move large
molecules across the membrane so active
transport uses energy from the cell
passive transport like osmosis and
diffusion does not require any energy
from the cell and later on we'll talk
more about active transport but for now
just remember all about osmosis
if you don't understand watch the video
again and now that we understand about
diffusion and osmosis which are the two
types of passive transport we can go
ahead and move on to something a little
bit more interesting so thank you guys
for watching don't forget subscribe and
I'll see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
