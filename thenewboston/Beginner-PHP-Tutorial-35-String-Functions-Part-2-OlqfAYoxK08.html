whereas if we were not to specify this
here it would only produce words
themselves so we can specify words here
or characters here if you like so I
could say an ampersand and if I was to
say from say an ampersand and a full
stop I'd say this is an example string
and this is a tutorial you can see that
when we refresh we have a few things so
we've got this is an example string and
so we've included our ampersand as a
word well now that we've specified it in
here and also if specified a full stop
now you don't need any comments or
anything for this they're just literally
the symbols next to each other so I
could put an X exclamation mark for
example and asterisks anything I wanted
just next to each other and you can also
see the the full stops being included on
the end there inside tutorial again
let's say separate that full stop and
refresh and you can see that's been
included as well so this is the string
word count function and the many ways
that you can use it we're now going to
move on to string shuffle so let's go
ahead and get rid of this and let's
change our string back to how it was
okay so the string shuffle function
let's go ahead and say string underscore
shuffled equals it is written like this
so it's STR it's the same as many string
functions STR underscore shuffle and
we're only taking one argument here and
that's just the string so we're taking
in a string and what we're going to be
shuffling it now I'll show you what this
does when we preview it so we're echoing
out our shuffled string and you can get
an idea of what happens when I click
refresh now okay so what it's actually
done is it's just taking each character
of the string and it's randomly shuffled
it so let's keep refreshing and you can
see that shuffling each time now why
might this function be useful well in
the past I've used it for so let's say I
was uploading a file and I wanted to
give it a random generated name a great
way to do this
to actually use this STR shuffle to
shuffle the file name of your file
obviously without the JPEG extension or
the dot PNG or whatever file you're
uploading but you can always add that I
am extension on the end a string shuffle
is great for just randomly generating
you know some some text but giving it a
sensible value as well so instead of say
generating a massive round a number or
an md5 hash you can use this string
shuffle to shuffle some characters
another really useful way of our useful
use if you like for this function is
let's just say our string was a
collection of let's say letters and
numbers to ABCD efg hijk l and here i
won't bore you with the rest of the
alphabet and then we could do one tooth
sorry zero 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 what this
is actually going to do is it's just
going to generate a random sequence of
letters and numbers so let's go ahead
and refresh you can see that it's just
generating a random sequence of letters
and numbers again really good for a
random ization of you know of a file
name or a forward slash say you had a
website that created a shortened URL
what you might want to do is say string
shuffle equals this shuffle and then you
might want to actually split this string
in half so what we could do is we could
come and say what we could use the
substring function so what we could say
is let's go down here so we could say
1/2 is equal to substring choosing the
substring function we're feeding in the
string shuffled value and then what
we're doing is we are giving it the
start and the mid value so this would be
the string length of the string so this
is equal to half of the
of the amount of you know characters or
you could just simply say ten for
example if you wanted a 10 character 10
characters returned let's say 5 for now
so we can see the difference let's
refresh and you can see all note what's
up in there oh sorry yeah
so echo 1/2 what we're actually doing is
we're just returning a few characters so
this is really good for a for a random
character generation and in this example
I've shown you string shuffle and the
substring function as well however here
you could say string length of the
string divided by sorry divided by 2 so
that will cut this in half so we've got
half of whatever is in our string up
here so as many ways you can do this
obviously you can use different string
functions with different string
functions to create a really really nice
effect for for you you know useful
things so that's the use of the string
shuffle that's really really nice way to
use that function we also have something
not similar to this but something that
you may struggle to find useful
personally I've struggled to find use
for this function and it's the STR
reverse function so let's go ahead and
change this string to this is an example
string for example STR reverse and then
we can echo out string reversed let's go
ahead and change our variable name here
reversed so what we're doing is we're
reversing the string using the string
reverse function and then we're just
echoing that out so let's go and have a
look at that in our browser parse error
on line 7 so that's going to be me up
okay there we are</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
