this video for the new Boston we're
going to be looking at continued string
functions however what we're going to be
doing is we're going to be creating a
small program that allows you use it
input and then we're going to sense out
certain words that we don't want to be
included so it's quite a fun program to
make and you get to specify your own
words that you want to be excluded and
we obviously are taking user input so
it's interactive and it helps you learn
to that degree so the first thing I'm
going to do is create a form with an
action and a method now we've already
discussed this I'm going to create the
methodist post because we're going to be
sending a fairly large text area size
worth of data and the action is just
going to come straight back to index dot
PHP but obviously if you're creating a
program that let's say post a comment
you're going to want this value to go
maybe to another page too to process but
entirely up to you where your form is
being processed so now what we need to
do is we need to type or create a text
area so we're going to start and in the
text area and we're going to give this a
name of user underscore input and I'm
going to give it a rose and the Cowles
value and this is rows and columns so
rows about seven and we'll say columns
about 30 let's make this a six actually
so let's preview what we've got so far
in our browser let's just go to there
okay so we've got a small text area
we're going to also create a submit
button so let's break down a couple of
times and then we an input type of
submit and then we can give it a value
of submit to ensure this value is
displayed on the button so let's refresh
and see what we've got there
okay so we've got our submit button
we've got our we've got our text area so
what I want to do is I'm going to create
a horizontal line just up here and
that's just going to separate the
content that we display back to the user
and this form so now what I'm going to
do is inside PHP we need to do first of
all a few checks to ensure that this
user input value has been submitted and
that
contain some text so we're going to
create an if statement and then the
block here is what we're going to run if
inside here this block is what we're
going to run if this is successful so
we're going to say if is set and then
inside this function we're going to say
post user input and we're also going to
check using a logical operator and we're
also going to check if it's not empty
so I'm using an exclamation marks
another logical operator to say it is
not empty and this is obviously a
function if not empty dollar underscore
post user input so we've already
addressed this in other tutorials but
basically what we're looking for is the
user input to be there and to have some
content inside of it
so let's just echo this to test if it
works so let's get back on here so if we
click it without entering anything
nothing happens if we type some text
inside of it and click Submit it works
so now we are all set to process this
data that has been typed in this text
area okay so actually what I'm going to
do beforehand is just embed in here some
data and that's already been submitted
so the user can look at what they've
written look at what they've submitted
this is just purely for learning
purposes so you can get an idea of this
so let's first of all create a variable
up here called user input that's going
to be equal to dollar underscore post
user underscore input so we're just
taking the variables from our form of
the data from our form so we can echo
user input and now what's going to
happen is when we do submit data in here
when we submit it it's going to work out
what's happened there so look
try and submit that no
okay so obviously we're echoing out this
inside but we're not echoing out here
that's why it's not being displayed so
as it stands at the moment as we let's
come back and refresh this as we type
text into here we submit it's displayed
here and kept in here that's just a
little tweak to ensure that we keep
everything consistent so now what we
need to do we'll get rid of this is we
need to create two arrays which I'm
going to create up here and the first
one is going to be called find and next
one's going to be cool to replace so the
find array is going to be words that we
want to find and I'm just going to keep
these as names for now so I'm going to
have three names and that's going to be
Alex Billy down ok so the array to
replace is the values we want to replace
so we have the same corresponding values
so Alex will correspond to this one here
and I'm just going to keep that as Alex
with the two stars in the middle Billy
with the 3 stars just in the middle
there asterixis if you like and Dale
with exactly the same thing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
