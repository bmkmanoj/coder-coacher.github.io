like this world seven night cycles and I
have felt only the need to kill but you
something makes me speak seven night
cycles days it must breed them full size
ready to kill not much improvement over
regular marks if they need training bred
to kill no I kill because my blood and
bone tell me too but it's not why I was
flushed from glass mother survival is
what I hear in my head against the enemy
that threatens all my kind but I failed
even before wicking that is what the
voice in the water said that is why I
wait here can you show me the laboratory
I need to speak with oquirrh the glass
mother she is up as the broken parts
behind many of you fleshy things i will
show you
glad he's on our side for now you fleshy
things are slow when big things are in
your way can you show us the way help us
fight to the lab no a Krogan refusing to
fight I will fight if they come but I
feel it deep that I must wait I kill but
only here i am not perfect but i have
purpose i must wait until called
released hey son
