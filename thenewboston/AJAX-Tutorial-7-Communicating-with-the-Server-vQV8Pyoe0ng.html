know I think it's like the seventh or
something Ajax tutorial I don't know I'm
not freakin keeping track but anyways in
this tutorial hopefully we're going to
be finishing up the very simple Ajax
program so remember what we did in the
last video is we basically created the
object that's responsible for
communicating with the server behind the
scenes so we stored that object in this
variable right here so in this story
what I want to do is I want to code this
process function now remember as soon as
we made one of the first things we we
did is we made a HTML file we linked to
the JavaScript file which is this right
here and we call it a function called
process however there is no process
function in this file so let's go ahead
and create that right now so function
process and let me go ahead and give you
guys a brief overview of why we need
this function this process function is
basically going to be responsible for
taking that object that we just created
and sending a request to the server now
remember that this function is going to
get called as soon as your page loads so
this function is going to get kicked off
ASAP immediately so let me go ahead and
show you guys what you need in this
function and actually let me go ahead
and give me some space to work with all
right looks pretty good so the first
thing we need to do is we need an if
statement and let me actually build the
show for this it's going to be if else
now in our if statement what we're going
to test is we're going to get that
object and actually let me code this in
then I'll talk you guys through because
I don't want to mess anything up this
ready state equals equals 4 or it equals
0
it equals zero so remember now now let
me go ahead and explain all right so
basically this object right here it has
a bunch of different functions and
variables already built onto it things
to JavaScript one of them is you can get
the state of this object right here
now remember this object right here is
the object that communicates with
whatever your server behind the scenes
so since it's a communication object it
has different states now 0 and 4 what's
your test for oh good thing I said that
0 and 4 are the states where it says ok
the object isn't busy communicating
already it's free and it's ready to
communicate with the server so basically
I'll talk about States in detail later
on
but basically if this is true then your
object is free it's ready to you know do
what you want it to do communicate with
the server all right so what do we want
to do if our server or excuse me our
object is ready to go basically this is
what we want to happen well the first
thing we need to do is we need to get
whatever the user typed in here so if
they type like a cheese we want to go
ahead and get the value of cheese so how
do we do that well in JavaScript what
you do is you create a variable we'll
just call this food I guess and set this
equal to and code URI component and I
guess the easiest way to do this is this
document and if you guys don't know like
what all these attributes are the
document is basically your web page and
I talked about this in detail in my
JavaScript tutorials but with your web
page you can just go ahead and call
functions like get element by ID and
then what you need to do is you need
type of parameter in here and what this
is going to do is go user input so
basically what we're doing right here is
we're going scanning our webpage and
saying okay what thing has the ID user
input well this input section does right
here and that's this right here
but we just don't want that element we
actually want the value of the element
now the value is what the user typed in
so just write dot value and now this
right here just go ahead and end this
now this variable food is equal to
whatever the user typed in that input
box so now food would be equal to cheese
simple enough I know that's a really
complex way of getting the variable or
excuse me the text cheese but that's
what you need to do all right now moving
on the cool stuff how do you send a
request or how do you communicate with
the server using this XML HTTP object
well this object has a bunch of built-in
functions already to communicate with a
server we don't have to code them
ourselves we just need to learn about
them so the first function I want to
tell you about is open so in order to
use a function of course write the
object's name XML HTTP dot open now open
I'll talk to you guys about the
different parameters basically what this
function does is it creates whatever
requests that we're going to send to the
server so remember that I said that
basically with anything in PHP it can
accept information of one or two ways
one of two ways get and post now we can
send different types of requests but
let's just go ahead and keep things
simple and send it a get request and I
say that because well that's kind of
already accepted in our script basically
remember this
whatever request you send is the same
kind you have to accept in your PHP
script simple enough so the first type
is or the first parameter is what
requests do you want to send what type
get of course now the second parameter
is you need format if you're using it
you need to format it so remember in
order to send get with a PHP just go
ahead and type the name of your PHP file
which is food store dot PHP</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
