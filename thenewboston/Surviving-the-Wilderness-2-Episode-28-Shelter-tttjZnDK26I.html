by the river again as you guys can see I
didn't get any sleep last night
I hardly got any filming done yesterday
because yesterday as soon as I was done
eating those frogs I went to go get more
or go to find more at least and it
started pouring like crazy all of my
crap got wet my shirt is still wet my
pants are drying out all right now
Early's trying to and tough things off
last night I saw my first bear it was a
black bear probably 30 feet away from my
camp I don't know if he smell with the
frogs or he thought that I had food in
my bag I think that's what he thinks
that I had food in my bag and he was
gonna see if he could get some but it
really freaked me out and on top of that
I got soaking wet no sleep at all
terrible night so today what I'm gonna
do is I think the plan is I'm gonna
build a shelter right here because I
cannot get soaked again so I'm gonna get
something to keep me semi dry at least
and just try to eat and I gotta get
moving I gotta find something soon so
that's the plan now I'll give you guys
update whenever I can so I think that
I'm gonna build my shelter right here
for the night this one's real close to
the river as you can see it's my stuff
down there I'm gonna tie a branch to
this tree and another branch to this
tree and then I think I can just lean
sticks on it and I got a lot of rope
left so I don't know it seems like a
nice flat area and it's pretty close to
the river I don't want to stay right on
the river but uh that's fine right now
whoa check this out
I was actually setting up a camera angle
believe it or not so I could film me
building the shelter and this guy just
hopped right in front of me idiot
so I think what I'm gonna get to do
first of all I finally get to eat some
more and also um the last ones guts
I just left on a rock for this I think
I'm gonna use the guts to put on my
fishing hook and see if I can catch some
fish because I know fish eat frogs so
hopefully I'm begging that a fish is
gonna like this frogs guts right here
and I know it's not going to be
completely waterproof but anything
better than the trees last night because
these trees are here are the worst
protection against rain ever I got
soaked last night and I don't want to be
miserable again tonight
well that looks pretty good for the
frame or at least looks good enough to
me
not exactly a five-star hotel but I
think if I get some pine branches with a
lot of leaves and I lay them over the
top of it then it should at least keep
me protected from the rain so you know I
know it's not going to be waterproof
like I said but definitely a lot better
than last night
well I thought that was gonna be enough
but evidently I'm gonna need a lot more
pine branches than I thought
looks pretty thin now so I hope my frame
strong enough to hold them all
I really don't care about the sides too
much
so it's pretty good for now to me at
least between what I put on the roof of
that my makeshift shelter and also I do
have some covering overhead I got some
pine trees and I don't know they're not
maple trees but they kind of look like
maple trees so definitely if it rains
tonight it'll keep me a lot drier than
last night but uh that's it I guess I
don't want to spend too much time on it
because I got to get fishing cooking
those frog legs and also boiling some
water so I can get hydrated a game
because I'm frickin thirsty but anyways
that's a plan for the rest of the night
so there is my finished shelter again
not bad for about an hour's worth of
work I guess
so I got all this and I'm probably just
clear some of these leaves out right
here so I don't have to sleep on those
leaves but anyways I got this when it
rains tonight and also all this coverage
right here so I should be pretty good
I'm guessing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
