welcome to your 19th C++ tutorial and
you know what all these nice little
quick examples are fine and dandy but
let's go ahead and build a program that
is actually somewhat useful a program
that you can use and you know maybe your
teacher assigned you something or maybe
your boss came to you and is like you
know what Bucky I want you to make a
program that allows the user to enter
five different numbers and then I want
you to total the numbers for them but
you have to use a while loop so we're
saying alright no problem so here is how
I would go about making this program and
by the way this is some nice little
programming tips you start with the
basics of your program and you do it in
little baby steps so first of all I want
to make a loop that runs five different
times so what I would do is make a loop
int X set this variable equal to one
this is just going to be the looping
variable while X is less than or equal
to five let's just go ahead and print
out something make sure our loop is
working see out X end line so that's
going to print out X and you know how I
said that in order to add 1 to X each
time you go ahead and write x equals x
plus 1 well you can do that but let me
let you guys in on a little secret if
you go ahead and write x plus plus this
is the exact same as writing x plus x
equals x plus 1 it's just a quicker and
easier way to do things and that's
actually where the name c++ came from
they wanted it to be queue in you know
anyway so that's the history c++ it came
from an old language called C and they
added two little pulse signs to it
thought it was cute so anyways that's
your history C but what we're worried
about is making sure that we have a
working loop that runs 5 times so let's
go ahead and run this so all right 1 2 3
4 5 our lip is working perfectly we can
now move on to next set and by the way
this was just a tester line we don't
really need that in our program so
Centauri our boss told us to make a
program so the user can enter 5
for numbers so we already know that the
CIN is the way that the user can enter a
number but we probably need to store
that number in variable so let's go
ahead and store that number in a
variable number and since we don't know
the value yet we can't set that equal to
anything yet so what we would do in
order to have the user enter a number
five times is inside this loop go ahead
and write CIN number now our loop is
going to run five times and the user is
going to enter a number each time before
the program quits so what I would do now
is test the program again just to make
sure it's working all right
43:54 66 2 &amp;amp; 3 enter our programs done
so now we see not only do we got a loop
that runs five times but we also have
the user enter five different numbers so
our program is working five and dandy so
far service NRA now what's the last
thing he said oh yeah
he wanted to find a sum of all those
numbers and printed it out to the user
or something
so saying all right now not only a
number variable but we need another
variable to hold the sum or the total of
all those numbers so what I would do is
go ahead and put int total and by
default their total is going to be zero
because they didn't enter any numbers
yet that's what we know so now what we
can do is this you might be thinking
this so just go ahead and set total
equal to number but whenever we run this
it's not going to work because say they
enter ten the first time we're then
total is equal to ten okay it's working
fine so far but the next time they enter
eight and we are expecting 18 well this
isn't being added the total total is now
being changed to eight so instead of
being 18 it's just a so this isn't going
to work so what we need to do is do this
total equals the old total plus the new
number so now what happens is this
whenever they enter 10 it's going to be
0 plus 10
total is equal to 10 the next time they
enter 8 8 equals number so 10 plus 8
equals the new total of 18 so let's go
ahead and once this loop is done running
let's go ahead and just give them a nice
little print out on the screen on your
total is total and might as well end
that line why not
so let's go ahead and run this program
and now let's go ahead and run it and
make sure it works so let's go ahead and
put 10 enter 8 enter 2 enter 5 enter 5
enter your total is 30 so all right
let's go review this one last time it
seems that everything is working fine
let's just go ahead and make sure well I
guess I can cover that up that says end
line there now I'm covering it up so
basically the first time the first thing
we did is we got a loop that worked then
we wanted to have the user enter a
number and then we did something with
that number so what happened is this the
first time the user entered a number it
was 10 so the total which was zero
before is now equal to zero plus 10
so now total equals 10 the next number
they entered was 8 so now the new total
is 10 plus 8 which was 18 the next
number that entered was 2 so 18 plus 2
now total equals 20 next number was 5
now it equals 25
the last one is 5 also now it equals 30
so this is basically saying all right
take the new value of total and set it
equal to the old value plus the number
that they entered and at the end we just
said your total is 30 works pretty good
so let's go ahead and just to make sure
that it's working good let's really test
this add some big numbers like this
why why do I keep entering the same
number each time and so you know okay
I'm not going to check this in my head
but you guys can go ahead and check that
on a calculator and if it works then it
means we just built the best calculator
on earth so I'm actually going to go
ahead and copy this and email this the
Microsoft and hopefully they pay me you
know just a couple million dollars for
it so you go ahead and what I want to
stress in this tutorial is this not only
this is how you build a basic program to
you know it's just an example of why a
while loop would be useful but also
whenever you're building programs take
it in baby steps do the most basic thing
first and then once you got networking
going to the next step and then one stat
work and you can go on to the final step
and now we can do something like maybe
we can find the average of all these
number or maybe we can find the product
or the quotient or something stupid so
again take your program and baby steps
that way you don't try to build a whole
program and then at the end when you got
ten different errors you're saying all
right what went wrong so that is the
basics of not only how to be a good
programmer but also how to use the while
loop in a meaningful way so for now
thank you guys for watching um like I
said just going to go ahead cut this and
paste it to Microsoft and yeah I'll see
you in the next tutorial when I'm a
millionaire</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
