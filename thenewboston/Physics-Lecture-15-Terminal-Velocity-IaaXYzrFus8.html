15th physics lesson in this lesson I
want to talk to you guys about terminal
speed or as some people call it terminal
velocity now I know that that's a movie
but I'm actually not going to talk to
you guys about the movie I want to talk
to you guys about the physics term so
you know how a couple tutorials I don't
know if we were like on a plane or on
top of the building but I said that if
you were up high we'll say we're on top
of the building and you were holding
something we'll just say it's a cucumber
and you dropped it from that building
then it wouldn't just fall at a constant
speed what this object which just
happens to be a cucumber in this case
would do is it would accelerate towards
the ground at a rate of 9.8 meters per
second squared and I think I showed you
guys how to calculate of how fast it's
going to be going at what distance and I
gave you guys a whole bunch of cool
formulas however I need to mention this
that I kind of lied a little bit it
wouldn't accelerate forever and ever and
ever what it would do is it would
eventually reach a speed where it can no
longer go any faster now if you're
saying oh why what you mean like when it
hit the ground and Smasher what the heck
are you talking about well what I'm
talking about is terminal velocity when
this cucumber gets to a certain speed
then air resistance would be pushing up
on it as an equal force that gravity is
pulling it down now whenever it got to
this point then it would no longer be
able to go any faster so basically if we
zoomed in on this object here's the
cucumber flying through the air whoo
looks like a loaf of bread right now but
basically what weight and therefore the
force of gravity is doing is its pulling
this towards the center of the earth at
a rate of 9.8 meters per second squared
now due to wind resistance or errors
this is some people call it it's going
to be pushing up on that cucumber that
just happens to look like a loaf of
bread right now now if you guys don't
really understand how winters
since fights against the force of
gravity and speed let me go ahead and
talk to you guys about a little example
say okay very funny say you were driving
in a car but before you were driving
okay let me draw my awesome car right
here so here's you in your car and you
have a really long arm so your are in
park right now not moving at all and you
stick your hand out the car just like
that and you're like okay maybe I feel a
slight breeze but today it's not windy
at all so your hand you can raise it
very easy it's not going to get pushed
around now say you were traveling down
the highway at 80 miles per hour
well now you roll down your window and
stick up your hand and suddenly it's not
so easy to hold up your hand due to your
speed and wind resistance it's going to
be pushing on your hand this way even
though speed is going to be moving you
the car in your hand 80 miles per hour
in this direction the wind is going to
be pushing and making your hand go in
the opposite direction so again speed
and wind resistance are working as to
counter forces going in opposite
directions now the same exact thing
happens with this cucumber except
instead of a car you got gravity working
for your speed so gravity is pulling it
down and the wind is pushing it up oh
right wind right here so you guys know
what I'm talking about
and whenever pretty much the force of
wind or air resistance equals the force
of gravity then you pretty much come
across something called terminal speed
or terminal velocity so again one my son
the point in time when air resistance
equals the weight of the object the
object would no longer accelerate a KA
it won't go any faster and it would just
move at a constant speed so again this
point in time is called terminal
velocity or the object's terminal speed
and in the upcoming tutorials I don't
know if it's going to be the next one
but I'm going to show you guys how to
calculate terminal speed pretty much how
fast can an object go when you drop it
from
you know a building or bridge or plane
or something like that so that's what
terminal speed is hopefully you guys
understand thank guys for watching and I
will see you guys in the next lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
