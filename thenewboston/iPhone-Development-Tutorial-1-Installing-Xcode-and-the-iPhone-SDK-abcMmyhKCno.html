Bucky and welcome to your very first
tutorial in iPhone development now I
have created a lot of tutorials before
in the past for YouTube in my channel
but never before have I been as excited
to create a series as I am right now I'm
so excited to get started so uh you know
let's go ahead and jump right into it
now before you go ahead and just start
typing some code you're going to need a
couple things first the first thing
you're going to need is an intel-based
Mac that's running the leopard operating
system or any operating system later
than that and if you have a Mac that you
got since probably 2006 or later you
should be fine so once you have a Mac
you know you're ready for next step the
next thing you need to do is sign up to
be registered as an actual iPhone
developer and to do that go ahead and go
to developer.apple.com slash iPhone and
you can go ahead and register here now I
already am registered so I'm going to go
ahead and login and that's my username
and let me go ahead and enter my
password right here again when you
register you're going to have the create
a username and password but the
important thing is once you are
registered user you now have access to
download Xcode and the iPhone SDK now
Xcode in the iPhone SDK is pretty much
the program where you're right iPhone
applications now go ahead and click on
the link whatever one you want to
download of course I already have a
download to be cut in therefore I'm not
going to click it and another thing I
want to mention whenever you register to
become an iPhone developer you're going
to have a couple options the first one
is the free option you probably don't
want to do this the second one is a
standard and this costs a hundred bucks
a year in the third one I think is the
enterprise this cost like three hundred
bucks a year what you want to do is you
want to pretty much if you can choose
standard because what this allows you to
do is of course download it like all of
them but
the standard program also allows you to
run your applications on your physical
iPod so you can you know hold it in your
hand and test it out in a the free the
free one doesn't let you transfer any of
your programs to your iPod it only makes
a little simulator on your screen that
you can test it out so once we're done
downloading Xcode in the iPhone SDK
again I already have it downloaded go
ahead and quit Safari in the last thing
I want to tell you guys is you're going
to need some knowledge of objective-c
and what Objective C is is it's the
language that allows you to create
pretty much the language for the iPhone
now if you don't know Objective C I just
did a whole tutorial series about it it
has like 70 tutorials in it so go ahead
and watch that and once you're a you
know I'll watch that you're good to go
so we went ahead and we downloaded the
iPhone SDK and Xcode now in order to get
to Xcode in your finder go to
applications again your hard drive
applications or let me see if I can find
it I already have it uh yeah I already
have it on my toolbar so anyways you
know you can find it I'm sure you can
but anyways I already have it on my tool
bar right here since I use all time I
forgot where it is but go ahead and
launch Xcode and you're going to want to
create a new project first now a project
is pretty much where all of your files
are stored so go ahead and click a file
new project and you can name your
project uh well first go ahead and do
this under your iPhone operating system
this is where you create all your iPhone
programs the Mac is where you create
programs for Mac and since we're going
to be creating iPhone operating system
go ahead and click application and you
see to the right once you click it a
bunch of different things pop up now
what one do we want to use for the first
couple of toriel's we're just going to
be doing a view based application and so
go ahead and choose this and now you can
name your project that's where I thought
you could do before but now you do it
and I'm going to
name I like iPhone YouTube actually I
want to put a lowercase I fun because
that looks way cooler YouTube just like
that
so iPhone YouTube that's where I'm going
to be working you can name yours
anything you want so here is Xcode
welcome to your new project now the
first thing I guess I must do is a show
you guys around you see a toolbar at the
top with some common things what we
going over that later you also have the
groups and files to your left and these
are pretty much all the files that are
going to be working with pretty much
anything under your iPhone YouTube these
five files that's we're going to be
working with the most specifically in
classes don't mind all the rest of this
junk from now on um these give you
detailed views of pretty much all the
individual files give you some more
details and if you go ahead and open one
then the code is going to appear in this
editor but again we won't worry about
any of that until we get to just wanted
to give you a quick you know overview of
how xcode is set up so the first thing
that we're going to want to do is expand
this resources folder by clicking on the
little triangle now you're going to have
a lot of different options here that you
can click on but what we want to double
click on is whatever you named your file
it's going to have a view controller xib
file go ahead and double click this view
controller xib and this is going to open
a program called the interface builder
this is an awesome program that you can
just pretty much drag and drop stuff on
your simulator and it's really easy to
create iPhone applications the basic the
best starting point so you see a couple
um windows open you probably have this
iPhone pretty much this is the window
that stores all your files this is a
view of what the user is looking at your
iPhone what it would see pretty much the
basic view the screen if you don't see
this library what you want to do is go
to tools and click a library and then
it'll pop up I don't think it's popped
up by default I think I had to do that
and the last one the attributes is
whenever you add an item like a button
this gives you all the attributes like
if you want to change the color or you
know change the text on it so let's go
ahead and do something simple real quick
real click no I mean real quick there we
go so what we want to do first is well
you know what actually before I even add
anything um I think I'm going to save it
for next story because I'm running out
of time and I don't want this file to
get too big so in the next tutorial what
we'll do is we'll add something to our
first application save it and we'll run
it in our iPhone simulator it's going to
be awesome
so I just want to thank you guys for
watching this first tutorial and trust
me this series of tutorials is going to
be awesome like I said I am so excited
and if you need any help go to my forum
there's a link below ask me any question
there and I'll feel free to answer it
for you so thank you for watching don't
forget subscribe and I'll see you guys
later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
