is your 31st Java game development
tutorial and in the last tutorial we
implemented the key listener interface
and this is how we handle key events on
your keyboard but now we want to get in
something a little more exciting and
that's mouse input so there are three
different interfaces we need to
implement and that's mouse motion
listener mouse listener and mouse wheel
listener in these three interfaces you
can pretty much accept all input from
the user so let's go ahead and do that
right now the first interface we want to
implement is Mouse motion listener just
like that and your mouse motion listener
is for when the user either drags the
mouse or moves the mouse you can take
the events and respond to that and aside
from this we want to do Mouse listener
and what this is is the button clicks
Mouse press when they release in the
last one we want to work with is that
little wheel in the middle of your mouse
you can also handle events from that so
let's go to mouse wheel listener and
this one has built-in methods that
respond to mouse wheel events so I
already build my main method and it only
has one call to the run so let's go
ahead and start making some variables
let's go ahead and make a private and
all this program is going to do is
whenever you click is going to say you
clicked so we're going to need a empty
string and put mess for message or
whatever you want to call it I'm just
going to set mine equal to empty string
right now and now we need our
initialization method so let's go ahead
and make in it and it's going to call
the super init so let's go ahead and
we'll make a public void in it and let's
go ahead and first thing that we're
going to want to do in this is called
the super classes initialization method
so super dot in it and this will call
the super classes initialization and now
we need a window object to get the
entire screen so window I'll name my W
because I'm lazy set it equal to s dot
BAM look at that it's already there for
us get full screen window now aside from
the key listener we added in less story
we also need to add those
three other listeners so W dot ad and
hopefully they pop up Mouse listener
just like that and there's our argument
take this which is the window w dot ad
mouse motion listener too easy and I'll
take this as a parameter again and W dot
ad mouse wheel listener and all of these
take this and aside from this we want to
add that key listener again so W ad key
listener and the reason we're adding the
key listener even though we're going
over mouseland raise in this tutorial is
because whenever we press escape we want
to be able to exit our program and if we
don't have this key listener we're going
to not be able to respond to any input
on the keyboard so that's why we're
doing that if you were wondering next
let's go ahead and get our drop method
out of the way
and public I spelled that wrong didn't I
synchronize make sure you spell it right
void draw it and of course it takes it
takes your graphic variable right there
and now let's go ahead and get our
window object again get fullscreen
that's what we're drawing on set the
color of the drawing object and we will
set it equal to let's go ahead and set
equal to the background for now so W get
background too easy so I think our
background was a green I'm not sure but
so right now our drawing up to get is
green or whatever color and now we want
to draw a rectangle as big as the screen
so G dot fill rectangle if I can find it
oh come on Hoss fill erect and of course
it's going to be a zero zero top-left
corner and the width is going to be s
dot get width and the height is going to
be screen dot get height and this will
make it automatically the same size as
your screen using the width in the
height from our screen class
a couple more things we need to do is go
ahead and change the color so G set
color and we will set this to W dot get
foreground this time so now we are
drawing with white and now let's just
draw the string G dot draw string and of
course we want to use that message
variable which remember we set it equal
to blank string right now but we're
going to be populating this later on and
we'll just put it a forty fifty that
should appear somewhere in the middle of
our screen so now make sure you don't
have any errors and you are ready to
move on to the meat of this tutorial and
that is implementing your mouse pressed
mouse release mouse click enter and exit
methods and these are all methods in the
mouse listener interface so don't forget
your mouse listener interface which is
pretty much the buttons on your mouse
has five methods that you need to
implement so let's go ahead and do that
right now now I'm going to go ahead and
add one comment for all of them and it's
going to be a mouse listener interface
and let's go through these real quick
and all we're going to do whenever we
handle the event is just change the
string so public void Mouse pressed is
the first one and it's going to take a
mouse event and we'll just name e and
all we want to do is change the message
equal to something like you press down
the mouse and make sure you spell Mouse
like that or else the program will work
and now what we need to do is implement
Mouse released so of course this method
calls whenever you release the button on
the mouse if you couldn't guess whenever
you click the button down it's going to
say you press down button or the mouse
as long as you have the button held down
but whenever you release the mouse this
method is going to be called public void
Mouse released and of course this takes
your same Mouse event so let's copy that
and paste it
and just change your message to you
release the mouse good enough now there
are three other methods in here and
that's mouseclicked which is pretty much
when you click your mouse and that's a
combination of pressing your group and
releasing but we don't want to handle
this because it will mess up our other
two so let's go ahead and just we need
to implement it public void mouse
clicked and of course let's just put our
parameter in here and for the code just
run nothing just like that and the other
thing there are two other methods Mouse
entered and mouse exited now usually you
use these whenever they enter and exit
the window but since our window is
taking up the entire screen these are
really going to be useful so what we
need to do is do what we did before and
just call a method with no body
so public void Mouse entered and we
usually would handle this but the only
thing is we're working with full screen
so it will be useless for now public
void Mouse exited just like that and let
me fix that and we should be good to go
and of course don't handle this one
either because I mean why would we so
let's copy that paste and paste and
those are all your methods you need to
implement from Mouse listener again
mousepressed
is when you press the button Mouse
release is when you released the button
clicked is a clicking motion which we
don't want to mess with it right now
entered and exit are useless when you're
working with full screen so that's all
the time I have for this tutorial thank
you guys for watching in the next
tutorial we're going to be going over
Mouse motion which is dragging the mouse
and also moving the mouse without the
button held down and also that mouse
wheel in the middle so I want to thank
you guys one more time for watching
