part of the soul miniseries how to
develop at RPG and in this story we're
going to be adding our character to the
scene because you know what funds
role-playing game if you don't have
character correct answer it's not that
fun at all so the first thing we need to
do is we need to get the object layer
and this is the layer named oj that all
of our objects were stored on and by all
the enemy and our one object but anyways
that's what we need to do so if you're
saying re i already know how to get
layers just like this well actually
getting a tiled layer and getting
objects layer are two totally different
things so here is how you retrieve an
object layer CC TMX object group and
just go ahead and name your variable
anything you want I'm just going to name
mine objects and set it equal to this
the first thing you need is what map do
you want to use this is in case you have
several different maps in your project
I'm using the map because it's the only
map we made so far and now each map
might have a lot of different object
layers so object group named this is the
method where you write what layer do you
want to use well we only have one object
layer and it's named oj so let's go
ahead and use that one so now we have
the object layer oj stored in the object
objects preparation name that something
different but oh well now what we need
to do is remember in this layer objects
we had one little gray dot stored in it
and we named that start point so here is
where we need a retrieve the start point
object now check this out each of these
objects maybe I can bring this up
each of these objects has a bunch of
different information whether you know
it or not if you go ahead and right
click it and click object properties you
can see a couple properties the name of
it the exposition the Y position well
all of this information is stored and
that mutable dictionary so what we need
to do is retrieve this mutable
dictionary so ms mu2 what really mess
that up mu ta ble dictionary just like
that and go ahead and name your
dictionary start point looks good so now
what we need to do is say all right what
layer from the map do you want to use
well we want to use that objects layer
and from that layer we want to get the
object named start point because
remember that's what we named that grade
ah that object so now pretty much start
point represents that grade AA on your
screen pretty cool huh so now like I
said this dictionary has a couple
properties that has a name it has
exposition and it has a y position well
let's go ahead and take that expedition
and y position from our object in store
in local variables that we can use in
our program very easy just go ahead put
in X and set it equal to this in order
to get values from dictionaries here's
what you do start point you write the
name of the dictionary and then you put
value for key I shouldn't even have to
tell you this you should already know
how to get values from dictionaries if
you watch my objective c tutorials and
now whatever that returns we just want
the integer value of this so the x is
going to return 0 I'll tell you in a
second all right so now here we go X is
going to return 2.5 and y is going to
return 45 and some change so cancel
cancel that and now that we have x
and copy changes to Y changes to Y and
now what we want to do is let me recap
one last time what this line does is it
gets the entire layer what this line
does is it gets that one object from the
layer the start point object what these
lines do is to say are right where is
that object I want to get the
coordinates of it and store the
x-coordinate and X and the y coordinate
and y simple neff so now that we have
the x and y coordinates from that object
or point all we need to do is take our
dude and add them to that point simple
enough we did this in the beginning
cocos2d thoreau so self dot do that we
actually need to say what file do we
want him to represent and go ahead and
CC sprite and spray with file and this
rights what image dude ping so I want
this sprite to be represented by that do
dot ping and now what I need to do is
position this dude some around the
screen this is simple dude position
equals CCP X Y pretty simple way and now
what we need to do is now that he's
position on screen of course with
everything with cocos2d you just need to
add them to the scene and self which
means this class add child and add the
dude so here's what we did I already
explained this and yeah I pretty much
art explained everything I don't feel
like doing it again way too lazy to do
that so let's go ahead save and run and
check this out hopefully nothing messes
up now how awesome is this our dude is
positioned exactly where that object was
on the screen there is just chillin
there waiting to move around waiting to
a you know collect some gems or battle
some enemies or you know just waiting to
do something looking up he's like I want
to do something
the saying so let's recap one last time
what we did entitled we created an
object on the screen this object has
properties already built in it what we
did in our code is you say all right
this line right here retrieves this
entire object layer this line right here
retrieves that specific object that gray
dot on the screen and also with it you
get a bunch of information such as the X
and the y coordinates of where that dot
is located and all we did then is took
the X&amp;amp;Y coordinates and position a
sprite where that object was simple
enough so that's all we need to do for
this story so um that my friends is how
you take objects from tiled and position
sprites on your screen and you know
enough of me talk and I feel like going
to eat macaroni and cheese or hot dogs
or something so yeah you guys enjoy and
how about this we meet up for the next
story hi guys like that if you have any
question you just asked me on my forum
and I'll be happy to answer them for you
guys so thank you guys for watching
don't forget subscribe and don't forget
to buy my iphone apps because they're
pretty sweet so I'll see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
