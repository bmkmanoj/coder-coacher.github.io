another PI game tutorial video in this
video we're gonna be doing is fixing up
our barrier function right now I think
I'm still doing for ya but basically our
barrier looks like this even if we just
called it one time it's constantly
moving that's no good so what we want to
do is is fix this up so we just have one
barrier at a time so basically what we
want to be able to do is just call
barrier in the function just like we
call tank basically but it just been
it's bouncing around like this obviously
that makes maybe for kind of an
interesting game but it's not very
realistic as if our tanks game is
realistic but anyway we just don't want
that so the first thing that we need to
do basically is we come up here and this
is where we need to put the parameters
of our barrier basically every time game
loop runs that's when the random barrier
is there the random dimensions of that
barrier is drawn and then after that or
thought up basically not drawing yet
because it can be drawn every frame but
thought up and then we draw it every
frame but it's the same stuff every
single time but in order to have it be
random we just basically take the random
calculations that we use in our function
so let's get to function so here's
barrier basically we'll just take this X
location at random height control X
remove that and then we'll pass through
here um what was it X and then random
height so we'll pass through those
parameters to our barrier function and
since we use the same variable names we
won't have to go through that at that
nice so then we come down here to gain
loop and then basically up here before
you get to this while loops will paste
and we've got X location random height
no problem now we'll come down here and
I'm just gonna copy X location for now
and then for barrier we just paste in X
location
and then random height like that and at
this point we should have what we
actually intend play so you've got this
random barrier here and we can move our
tank and see well it's coming because we
can still run into this barrier so like
I was saying before pygame doesn't know
that hey you can't run into objects you
know you have to code that in but we've
got a barrier we saw it was like a small
barrier kind of over to the left so
let's run that one more time play and
now I've got like a giant barrier
basically in the middle not sure we'd
make a shot over that but maybe maybe we
got like right here got it over and
let's just let's try it one more time
make sure that we have things where we
want them yeah so it looks like now at
this point we've got the barrier where
we want it so now what do we have to do
well we still need two enemy take a
enemy tank or a target to shoot at I
would I think the game would be more fun
if we made actual enemy tank and I
actually have the enemy tanks shooting
at us so we definitely wanna have an
enemy tank here the barrier is all fine
and dandy we need to be able to shoot
the cannon which will find is somewhat
challenging but we'll get through it and
and we made it a little bit easier for
ourselves because we hard-coded the the
turret positions so we've got that we
want to make sure the tank can't
actually drive through the barrier we
already know code for that as far as
going off the screen is concerned we
could put in some code to stop the user
from doing that not in this type of game
I'm not really too concerned about that
simply because we're just gonna make it
so in order to fire the cannon
you can't move after you fired it so
it's not like someone can move like fire
and then move off the screen for the
other user to fire at them
so I don't really think that's a big
issue but we do want to make it so the
tank can't go through the barrier so
we've got barrier running into the
barrier shooting and we've got enemy
tank and we want that enemy tank also be
able to shoot at us with some sort of
artificial intelligence and don't worry
that sounds really confusing but
you'll see how simple artificial
intelligence can be as well as adding
like a degree of challenge to the
artificial intelligence we've got that
and then we also need some way of like
tracking like health of the tanks and
stuff like that like how much you know
is the tank like blowing up or about to
blow up or whatever dead or alive
basically so we've got that and then
basically those are the main things that
we need to have in this game still so we
definitely want to add that I'm probably
the most exciting thing will be adding
the artificial intelligence to the tank
and then with that that's basically how
we can make the game more challenging or
or not so with that I will conclude this
video and we'll carry on with our
barrier in the next video and then we'll
probably start firing our cannons that's
exciting too so anyway stay tuned for
the next video hopefully you guys
enjoyed this video
and till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
