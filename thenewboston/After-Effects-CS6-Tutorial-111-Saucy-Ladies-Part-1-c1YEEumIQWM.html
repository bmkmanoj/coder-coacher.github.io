After Effects cs6 tutorial
I'm your host buddy Blackford and in
this tutorial I'm gonna show you guys
how to stroke it really now I'm just
gonna show you how to use stroke in a
more advanced way and there's different
types so I'm gonna go over right now how
to show you how to use stroke better and
use it like a pro so the first thing I
want to show you is that up here in the
options panel if you click on this
drop-down menu in the character panel
there's a section called line drawing
and there's different types of stroke
right here so if I were to select this
actually I don't think I have to select
it I'll just try it real quick and I
select miter yep I got selected so you
guys select your text come down to line
join if I select miter look at the type
look at the edges of the stroke like
just focus on maybe this corner of the S
where my mouse is you can see that it's
now squared off and that's what miter
does it's gonna be probably defaulted at
miter for you guys if you've never
changed it before now if we go to round
it changes it to a round run it off edge
there we go now if I go to bevel now
you're going to get an extra cut in your
edge and it's going to be more beveled
put that back in the middle there so I'm
just gonna bevel all these for you quick
so you can see what it looks like all
together my join bevel and as you can
see I can add different bevels or
different stroke styles to different
parts of the text so this one I could
make miter if I wanted to and then this
one I could make round if I wanted to so
you're not stuck with just doing on
every the same one on every text however
usually you want to stick with just one
type if you want to look professional I
don't see too many bevels going on but
there there might be uses for it like
maybe if you're writing out like the
word diamond and diamonds have nice cuts
on them like that so use the bevel fill
on that one the next thing I want to go
over are the stroke styles here and I
didn't go over them a lot in the intro
but now I'm going to show you what the
different uses are so I have this text
here and maybe I want to push everything
closer together something like this now
it's originally going to be on fill /
stroke and this is what it's going to
look like now the fill this the fill and
the stroke interact like this here where
you can see it goes over top and when
you're like fill / stroke it means that
the next letter in line is going to be
over top of the next letter so you can
see the stroke lines inside the next
text for the letter that is to the right
so let me select it again and now we're
going to go to all fills over all
strokes and let me bring it in even more
so I can illustrate this even more there
we go
now you can see that when the letters
connect here the there isn't any more
stroke lines unless you're not all the
way connected in like right here in
between these two lines but it just goes
over all around the outside where
everything is connected so that's a
reason you might want to use The Awl
fills over all strokes it works good
with a like chunky letters and stuff
like that so here's Phil over stroke and
here is a stroke over Phil it's gonna
look like crap and here is all strokes
overall Phil's it looks like even more
crap so all strokes overall Phil's
it the you as you can see the S goes
into the into the a it's just gonna show
every single part of the stroke so let's
go back to what looks good this one
looks pretty good you can also access
your stroke up some of your stroke
options from the more text options so if
I click on my text in my text layer
twirl down there is a section called
more options twirl that down which mine
was already told down and now we've got
the fill and stroke here if we've got
per character palate all strokes all
fills over all strokes and all strokes
over all fills no no normally you want
to leave this at per character because
these opera these options here they they
override the fill and Stroke properties
of the individual characters so if I
come down here now if you want them to
interact individually you want this per
character palette so
and the individual ones are these two
right here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
