third physics tutorial and in this
lesson I want to start off by talking
about some basic acceleration problems
and then I'm going to talk about
something called the acceleration of
gravity an amazing phenomenon but let's
go ahead and take a look at this
acceleration formula one more time so we
already know that in order to calculate
acceleration we need to figure out the
change in velocity over the change in
time but just like velocity and speed we
can use this same formula to calculate
acceleration or change in velocity or
the change in time so let's go ahead and
take a look at a sample problem say that
we started it out at all right all this
info down started at 0 this is supposed
to be at sign up quite beautiful at sign
if you ask me at 0 meters per second
that was our starting speed basically we
started not moving at all
simple enough and then we decided to
accelerate so acceleration at a rate of
8 meters per second squared so this is
our acceleration right here that's how
fast we're accelerating so we want to
figure out how fast would we be going
after 5 seconds so for a time we have
five seconds well using this formula
what do we want to figure out we want to
figure out the change in velocity after
five seconds what is our velocity so
let's go ahead and plug in this baby so
acceleration we know equals 8 and I'm
going to leave out the meters per second
squared in seconds for now eight meters
per second squared
now the change in velocity is the thing
we're trying to figure out but what we
do have is the time so time equals five
and I guess I might as well throw this
in seconds so in order to get the change
of velocity what we need to do is we
need the times the acceleration or
multiply whenever I say times two things
together
I mean multiply I know I know it sounds
kind of dumb to say I want to times
eight and five but hey you know
guys got to deal with it I guess so
let's go ahead and multiply 8 times 5 in
order to figure out the change in
velocity so basically the change in
velocity is equal to 40 what'd I say
miles per hour or nope meters per second
so after five seconds accelerating at
this rate at a starting point of not
moving at all after five seconds we
would be going forty meters per second
and you could also write it like this
meters per second or meters - second
either way it's up to you take your pick
so I just wanted to show you guys that
that not only can we use this formula
for acceleration but also change in
velocity and change in time as well so
now I think we got basic acceleration
taken care of now I want to talk to you
guys about something called the
acceleration of gravity the phenomena of
gravity actually gravity is still pretty
big mystery to physicists and chemists
and a bunch of scientists but we have
the figures that we can crunch so we
know this whenever you have an object
that falls from the sky these are clouds
right here and this is an object what is
it I don't know take your pick and it's
falling from the sky we know that it's
acceleration is 9.8 meters per second
squared now I just didn't come up with
this figure right here a bunch of nerdy
people figure this out that the
acceleration due to the force of gravity
anywhere on earth is 9.8 meters per
second squared
seriously they figure that out not me so
basically if we were standing on top of
the building guys you better prepare for
like the worst drawing ever say we were
standing on top of the building means
you're a little dude that's me up there
Hey look at me and we decided to drop a
can of tuna off the building well let's
go ahead and figure out the speed of
that tuna after one two three four five
six seven eight nine a bunch of seconds
so time
and will say that the time is seconds
and the speed will just say this is in
meters per second now remember the
information I gave you guys already the
acceleration due to gravity anywhere on
earth is 9.8 meters per second squared
so that means after one second this can
of tuna would be going 9.8 meters per
second after 2 seconds the speed of this
Camp tuna would be going nineteen point
six meters per second that's a pretty
fast can of tuna now after three seconds
how fast with this can of tuna be going
it would be going twenty-nine point four
meters per second and after four seconds
it would be going thirty-nine point two
and you can go on and on and on but I
don't want to waste your time basically
what you do is you add nine point eight
to this each time now let me go ahead
and show you guys this graphically
because it isn't exactly what you guys
might expect because it's a little bit
different so it's zero seconds let's
just say at zero seconds let's just say
it's right here you are holding the can
of tuna you just dropped it immediately
now after one second we'll say one
second
the can of tuna is right here now at
this point in time it's traveling at a
speed of 9.8 meters per second now after
two seconds the can of tuna is down here
now notice that this gap right here is a
little bigger than this gap right here
and that is because it picked up speed
along the way so now it's traveling at a
speed of nineteen point six meters per
second squared now after three seconds
the can of tuna would be somewhere like
way down here so even though the speed
looking at the graph looks kind of
constant and uh yeah looks kind of
constant
it kind of isn't it's kind of deceiving
so I think my can of tuna is changing in
size in size a little bit but that's
alright so after three seconds this can
of tuna would be traveling at a rate of
twenty nine point four meters per second
so I just want to take kind of show you
guys a visual of what would be going on
here even though the acceleration is
kind of constantly moving up the
distance from the person is not the same
from one second to two seconds then
three then three seconds it's moving
further and further away and that's
because like I said the speed of the
tuna is increasing it starts out going
really slow and then by the end of four
and five seconds it's traveling at a
really fast rate so it travels away from
you faster so just keep that in mind and
that's a difference between a constant
speed and constant acceleration constant
expeller rate acceleration means that
things are speeding up traveling away
from you faster and faster so I just
want you guys to soak that in for a
little bit go home and uh well you guys
are probably home go get something to
eat and soak in this information and
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
take a drawing class so in the next
lesson hopefully I draw a little bit
better so anyways thank you guys for
watching and don't forget to subscribe
and I'll see you guys the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
