with a video tutorial for the new Boston
in this video I'm going to go ahead and
solve a problem of duplicating a
particular button we're going to be
creating a button on the page so just a
simple button around here when we click
it I want a message to be displayed but
then I also want this button to
duplicate now with the duplicate I'm not
going to be using clone I'm just going
to be creating a new element using after
and I'm going to be placing the code for
a button so the input type equals button
with the rest of the properties and in
particular class next to that I then
want that same class to be clickable and
for it to you know produce another
button and repeat the process
essentially so I'm going to go ahead and
inside of my text editor write out the
button so we'll go ahead and say input
type equals button value I'm just going
to say click and I'm going to give going
ahead and give this a class and I'm just
going to call this duplicate okay so
when I click on this I want a message to
appear a dialog window to appear and
then I want to duplicate the button so
just a quick overview of what files were
using obviously we've got jQuery Jes
included and we've also got exe ojs
which is the file that we're going to be
working in to append the event handler
to this and we're going to go on to use
the live event handler or the live event
handler however you want to pronounce it
or say it and we're going to be solving
the problem you know as we can't do this
at the moment
so inside ext ojs let's just wait for
our document to be ready so I'm going to
say document dot ready and then in here
we're going to go ahead
and run the rest of the code inside here
okay so what do we want to do first of
all well we want to go ahead and append
on an event handler for any class of
duplicate so let's go ahead and say dot
duplicate as our selector to look at as
our selector and then I'm going to say
dot click and then inside of this I'm
going to go ahead and run a function so
what do I want to happen when any class
duplicate is clicked I want to go ahead
and I want to alert you have clicked ok
so now when i refresh the event handler
clicked is called i guess or we found
this click event and it says you have
clicked fair enough but now what I want
to do is go ahead and I want to
duplicate this input field here so what
I'm going to simply do is I'm going to
say this dot after and then I'm just
going to rewrite in the code so I'm
going to rewrite the input class type
and the value so we're going to say
input type equals and that's obviously a
button the value I want to say click and
I'm going to keep the same class as
before which is duplicate now the main
aim here is we've clicked the duplicate
button the first one of the instance of
it on our page then we're alerting
something out and then we're placing the
same code for the same button using the
same class afterwards but the problem
that we'll find is this then will will
not be able to select our new button and
I'll show you and then I'll tell you why
so I'll click on click it says you have
clicked you can see it's added that code
that we specified in here after our
current button when I click this nothing
will happen and the reason for this is
it's been created on the fly essentially
using jQuery and therefore it's not
really you know part of the page like if
we view the source of this page
you can see that it only shows one
button on here so what we need to do is
we want to use the live event handler
that will actually take into account
both pre-written
you know page elements and also elements
that have been added during our jQuery
execution on our jQuery you know running
of our code if you like so we'll make a
few simple changes I'll go ahead and
just get rid of this in fact I'll get
rid of all of it what I'm going to go
ahead and do is and this is an extremely
simple explanation of the live event
handler there are loads more options so
if you go over to jQuery comm the
documentation will sort of show you a
lot more</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
