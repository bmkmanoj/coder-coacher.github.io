this video I'm going to show you how to
make a navigation bar and a navigation
bar is that main menu bar at the top of
the screen that is you know essentially
the main navigation for your entire
website and as you notice I took out
that container class because up to now
that container class has been the main
parent element but what we're going to
do whenever we make a navigation bar is
actually stick it inside a nav class so
it's kind of different but I'll show you
guys how it works so in order to make it
make a nav tag in the class for this is
navbar nav bar default so this first one
just says that we're making a navigation
bar and the second one is the styling of
it in other words the color but I'll
show you guys how you can style it or
give it a different color in just a
second now inside here again like I said
this is where we're going to be putting
our container and I'm gonna make a fluid
container because I want this navigation
bar to take up the entire width of the
screen and that's kind of standard for
navigation bars usually don't want them
you know just Center it in the screen
with a bunch of space to the left or
right so the class equals container
fluid all right now before you start
adding the actual menu item buttons what
a lot of people like to do is they like
to add their logo at the top left just
to I don't know kind of help brand the
website so I'll just add a little
comment might be a little bit easier to
read and if you decide to do this the
div class is nav bar header and that
just lets bootstrap know that this isn't
an actual button for you know the menu
that they're going to be clicking a lot
this is essentially just the logo and
you can actually just add a dead link so
you could link it to like the home page
or something but I'm just going to have
a dead link for right now and the class
for this is navbar brand
and I would just say uh I don't know the
new Boston all in caps so again this
lets bootstrap know that it's not part
of the main um it's not like a regular
generic menu item it's a something
special the header and this right here
gives it the styling so the styling is
going to make it stand out it it gives
it like a little bold and I think it
changes the color slightly so there you
go this is an optional logo so now we
can start adding the actual menu item
button so let me copy this menu items
and these are going to be your
individual pages or different sections
of the website now we're going to stick
these inside a div and inside this div
we're going to have an unordered list
now of course we're going to be putting
all of our list items in here but before
we get to that the class of the
unordered list is nav nav bar nav
there's a lot of redundant you know
naming conventions in bootstrap that's
one thing I don't like but you know what
am I going to do about it nothing so I'm
just shut up alright so inside here of
course we need list items and you know
how sometimes when you click a menu item
in the pager on it stays um like
highlighted and that's just a little
indicator of okay this is the current
page that you have selected if you ever
want to achieve that effect then you
change the class to active and again
this is just going to highlight the
button that says okay this is the page
you're on and I don't know it's just a
little bit more clear for the user now
inside here you're going to want to link
to some page whatever it is I'll let you
worry about that and see freaking
autocorrect so this is a generic one and
let me add a couple more just so doesn't
look too lonely now of course these two
you don't want to be active you only
want to have one item active at a time
and that's because the user can be on
you know multiple different pages at a
time
so say that this one is about and this
one it is contact alright so do I got
anything wrong
hopefully not let's run it and see how
it looks so this right here this is what
I was talking about the logo which is
technically called the navbar header and
since we applied that class navbar brand
that's why you see it's kind of bold and
the text is a little bit different than
this and also whenever I said that this
first menu item was active that's why we
got that highlighting and you know it's
so of course this would mean that I'm on
the home page and it's just a little
indicator for the user makes it you know
easier and understand now if I shrimp
these check out what happens so since
this is responsive instead of just
cutting off the menu items they actually
collapse so you never lose any of your
items now I'm going to be showing you
guys in a second um let's say that you
had like seven different items well
whenever you collapse it and we're
looking at on a phone that means that
most of your screen would just be a menu
bar and you have to scroll way down for
the content so I'm going to show you
guys how to add a button really easily
and then you can click it and it can
toggle this menu visible and invisible
or hidden and not hidden display not
displayed whatever you want to call it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
