video I'm going to show you a really
cool way to get the most frequently
occurring item in a list but before we
do I just want to give a quick shout out
to Caleb Haslam and Nathan Bradley they
each contributed 5 bucks to my patreon
account I love you guys I want to have
your babies and yeah let's get on to the
tutorial all right so let's say that we
have any list but in this tutorial let
me go ahead and copy this alright so
there we go so I just have this chunk of
text right here and I'll remember huh I
don't even remember where I pasted this
from somewhere maybe on my website or
something but we have any text you can
have any list and we want to get the
words that occur most frequently maybe
my PR guy was yelling at me he's like
dude you save the same words over and
over again and I probably do so how can
we do that well we can write our own
custom function or I'll show you guys a
cool little module so from collections
we're going to import the class counter
so this is gonna this is actually pretty
cool class if you want to dive deeper
well what it essentially does is you
pass it in a list and then you can run a
bunch of cool statistics on it now we
already have one issue and that's that
this right here is just a big ol long
string we actually need to convert all
of these words into a list so in order
to do that it's actually really easy
just say words you can name your
variable anything you want of course for
this text string in order to make it
individual a list of words all you do is
your right split so that it breaks up a
string into a list so now we have a list
that's I don't know like maybe 50 words
long or whatever and just to show you
guys real quick just print this out
alright so now we can see that we have a
list look at that looking good so now
that we have a list we want to get the
most frequently occurring word so how do
we do that well let me just make a just
name a counter wine
and I'm going to set this equal to
counter which is an object from the
counter class or an instance is the
proper term so whenever we initialize
this what we do is we pass in a list so
what that's going to do is it's going to
say this is our object run a bunch of
statistics about this list just
essentially this right here so boom
roasted it did that now once it's
initialized we can just you know print
out whatever we want so let's say that
we want the top three occurring words
well for counter which was our object
there is a function called most common
now inside here we can just write any
number we want a 3 5 whatever I'm going
to say 3 and that's going to give me the
3 most common words in that list so now
I'll just print top 3 and there we go so
this is actually pretty cool it returns
a list of tuples and the tupple has two
parts to it the first one is of course
the word itself the item in the list and
the second one is the frequency counter
so this says hey these are your three
most common occurring words the you
wrote 5 times 2 euro 4 and in was in
your list 3 times so a lot of awesome
information so there you go again a real
quick tutorial but definitely useful and
again there's a lot more to this counter
class but now that I you know got your
guys a feet a little bit wet you can
dive in a little more if you want thank
you guys for watching I'll see you guys
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
