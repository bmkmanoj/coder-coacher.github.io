your 33rd Python tutorial and in this
story I'm going to be going over a
little bit of classes and also something
called self now the first thing we need
to do is create a class so let's do it
again
you need the keyword class and you can
name your class anything you want I can
name my class name just to show you guys
where the name of class goes in again as
I told you you can create functions
which are called methods inside your
class and create it just like you create
a function you have to define it or
create it first I'm going to name my
first one create name since I'm just
going to well I'll show you guys what
does later but again the what I want to
stress is every parameter in your
methods inside your class has to take
the first parameter of self and then it
could take any parameters after that
this one takes one more called name and
you'll see why later and just a step in
the future a little bit anytime I write
self it's just a temporary placeholder
for the object so if you have an object
named apples then whenever you call your
object it's going to throw apples in
here and set itself so let me go ahead
and I'll say that again a later date and
it'll make sense so self dot name which
will be your object's name equals name
and let's go ahead and create another
method let's go ahead and display name
for one of them and I just want this to
output the name of our whatever we give
it later so I just wanted to return self
name again these are really simple
methods on the last one I want to make
is just a saying and you can name your
is any one you want
I'm just using it I'm just making mine
easy so you can see what's going on and
my saying is just going to print out a
saying it's going to be hello um some
variable and that variable is of course
going to be so name because that's what
we're learning today
and you can go ahead and check if your
class was created correctly by just
putting in class name you should get a
weird message right here that says where
it's stored in memory so now we created
a class which is pretty much a blueprint
now after we create a class in order to
use these methods we need to create
objects to use them so let's go ahead
and create a couple objects and just to
show you guys that you can create many
objects from the same blueprint or class
let me just do that so first class name
with empty parameters again once you
create a object you have to name your
object I named mine first you can name
yours anything you want and then put
what class you want to get the object
from and put empty parameters and let me
create a second one just show you guys
you get have more than one object per
class I'm going to well do the same
thing we only have one class so no
surprise there so now we have two
objects we have first and second so
anytime you create an object you can use
any of the methods inside that class
with the object so if you want to use
one of the methods all you need to do is
write the object you want to use first
and then write the method name so our
first one we had was create name with
our parameters of we need self in name
now self we don't need to put anything
for because it refers to the object
itself which is first but we do need a
name since
Python doesn't know yet and I'm going to
name mine Bucky so now what Python did
is said alright I'm going to take first
dot on Bucky and it's going to be equal
to Bucky now let's create one for a
second just just so I can show you
guys that it can be different second dot
create name and our parameters can be
something like Toni so what this is
doing is using uhm this method right
here and plugging in the parameters
Bucky for name
so now anytime we want to let's say
display our name in this function what
it's going to do is say alright well let
me just show you guys so let's go ahead
and write first since we want to use our
first object which we created Bucky and
put period in that put display name and
then put empty parameters and go ahead
and press Enter and as you can see it
gives us Bucky and let me show you guys
what happened here the function or the
method display name just outputted self
name which was Bucky and let me just do
saying maybe it's a little easier if I
do that one so let's go ahead and use
our first object and saying and empty
parameters and it says hello Bucky so
you guys can see clearly what this one
does for self it used Bucky sent or
excuse me it use first what it did was
print hello and then this variable self
name and it knows for self what one
you're using because of this whatever
self is before the period is whatever
your object is before the period and
whatever the name is is this what we
made up here when we created our name so
again self in all of these methods Self
Self Self Self Self Self that pretty
much is or not pretty much is a
temporary replace holder for the object
itself so once you create an object name
first this self could switch the first
first first first first first and so
when he says print hello
um self name it says alright do I print
second name no print first name which it
was in this case
Bucky in that and we did that using this
right here so again first takes the
place of self and it just does this so
you can create many or multiple objects
from the same class so again to recap
one more time we created kind of
print using methods and we put self
because we didn't know what the object
was going to be named yet so we just
named itself now after we named self we
can fill it in by creating an object
once we created an object it takes self
and replaces it with an object name so
if you put self name let's go ahead and
see self name equals name if we put
first name it would be Bucky because the
object and name of first is Bucky and
now this is kind of confusing now but to
the summary of this tutorial pretty much
itself is a placeholder for the object
and that's all you got to remember in
this tutorial I'm sure I'm sorry for
making guys suffer through all that but
in this tutorial all you have to
remember itself is a temporary
placeholder for the object name so
hopefully you guys learn a little
something on the way about how to create
methods or something like that but I
promise I'll be clearing this up for you
in the next couple tutorials so again I
apologize for the confusion but I will
make this clear in the Mexico pass
Orioles so thank you guys for watching
don't forget to subscribe to my channel
and I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
