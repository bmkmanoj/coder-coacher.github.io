youtube.com slash on live camera for the
New Boston and in this tutorial we're
gonna continue working on the paint
program now all credit for this program
goes to the writers of beginning
Microsoft Visual Basic 2008 the authors
are Theron Willis and Brian Newsome I
took this program from their book and
I'm teaching you guys how to make it and
walking you through the steps and
explaining everything so now what we're
going to do is we're going to allow the
user to change the size and the size and
the color of their pen now this part
isn't in the book I made this part
myself because what's in the book takes
a really long time to program and we're
already on tutorial 170 something and we
still have a lot of stuff to cover so
let's come over here to our solution
explorer we'll right-click on paint you
tube and let's add a windows form so
we'll select windows forms and we will
call it option form we'll go ahead and
click Add ok so now we have our option
form so let's go ahead and we'll come
over here to our properties of the
option form and we need to change the
form border style so we'll come up here
to form border style and let's make it a
fixed tool window so they won't be able
to resize it and they can only close out
of it so let's make it a little bit
smaller here and let's add a tool box
and we will have a combo box and let's
go ahead and label this combo box so
we'll add a label and we'll call it
brush size so set the text to brush size
and let's just set the name to
label size and we'll set the name of
combo box 1 2 combo box size now let's
go ahead and come over here to the tool
box we'll add a button here we'll set
the name to button color and we'll set
the text to change color so let's find
the text property here so change color
and we'll go ahead and shrink this down
some so now what we need to do is come
over to our tool box and let's add a
color picker dialog so we need to find
our dialogues and it will double click
on color dialog so we'll just call it
color dialogue brush so it's going to be
the color of our brush so let's go ahead
and we'll come over here to the combo
box size and whenever whenever they
change the index what do we want to do
well let's add a select case statement
so select case and we will do combo box
size dot selected index for a case 0
what do we want to do well we need to
come over here to our option form and we
need to add some stuff to our collection
under the items property so we'll have
small medium and large
ok so let me zoom in here a little bit
so you can see it better now
the only problem is we can't access the
color of paint canvas let's find it here
we cannot access the color variable
because we don't have an object of it in
here so let's go ahead we'll come over
here to our paint YouTube and we need to
find the main method now there isn't
actually a main method that we can
access so what we need to do is we need
to come in to paint YouTube right-click
it and select the properties now here
you can see we have our application
properties and we have a start up form
right here so we want our start up form
to be option 4 so now if we come back
into option for him let's go ahead and
access the load event so we'll scroll up
and we will find load where is it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
