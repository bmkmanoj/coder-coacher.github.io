tutorial that I'm making for the New
Boston and in this tutorial I'm going to
be showing you how to use the file class
a little bit more so all your need for
this tutorial is a button and a few
lines of code
so once you have the button on your main
form let's go ahead and double click on
it you're going to need to have an open
file dialog and an if statement checking
to see if the user actually selects a
file in the Open File dialog you're also
going to need to be using the system dot
IO namespace because the file class is
located in that once you have this if
statement down is go ahead and type file
dot copy because we're going to be
looking at a copy method first and the
copy method will basically this copy a
file to a different location and the
first parameter that have to pass
through here is a string called source
file name or this is going to be the
path to a file that we want copied and
we want it to copy the file that we open
an open file dialog we're just going to
do with the final link and the second
string parameter that we have to pass
through is path to the copied file and
we're just going to type it out right
here you want to basically just copy on
this text document or here into folder
one so we should end up with two text
documents and we're doesn't have to
specify where we want to copy key groups
you copy this piece did right there and
like I said in a previous tutorial we
have to double up on these on these back
slashes right here because the backslash
will allow you to have a quote inside of
a string and that's not what we're going
for it and you cannot just give the path
to the folder that you want the file to
be copied to being you have to rename
the file and we're just going to name
the file text dot dot X so basically
what it will do here is it will copy
with every whatever file that we open in
the Open File dialog to this location
and call it text dot txt and we're going
to be opening
text document three dot text open X dot
three should have copied it into folder
one yep we now have a text document
inside of folder one called text text
and that's exactly what we called it
c-sharp right here and since I copy the
contents of both text files should be
the exact same and this text document
reads hi I am Adam so so should the text
document that we copied into folder one
yep they both say hi I'm Adam the next
method that I'm going to be showing you
how to use is a move method and the move
method will basically allow you to move
a file not copy it so just like the copy
method the first string parameter that
we have to pass through here is the name
of the file to move or the path to the
file that we want to move and we want to
move whatever file that we open an open
file dialog and we wanted to move that
file into you on this atom folder right
here so we're just going to go ahead and
copy the location of this folder and
just like before looking at that double
up on back slashes and just like in the
copy method we also have to provide a
name for our mood file so we're just
going to call it text Docs gosh we'll
just call something bitter all right so
now let me do bug here click the button
select our text off should just move it
into this atom folder open now if we go
into this folder right here you see that
for that file of no longer there it
should now be inside of this folder and
it's called tech stocks tech so that's
pretty much it for this tutorial so see
you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
