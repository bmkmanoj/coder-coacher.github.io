awesome After Effects cs6 tutorial
I'm your host buddy Blackford and I want
to show you how to create some really
cool-looking motion graphics typography
looking stuff so what I mean is I'm
gonna use the text animator that's
within our text layer that you may not
have seen to figure out how to make this
stuff look cool so let's get started and
I'll show you really what I mean
so if we come down into our layer panel
here and scroll down and our text and
all I have is just one line or one set
of text here that I centered and put in
different colors to make it kind of look
cool and I just increased the size of
the middle word here I'm not allowed to
say or else my mom will ground me just
kidding
so we twirl down here and we've got our
text path options more options and
that's not what we want to use right now
we want to come over here to this
animate button click on it and we've got
a whole bunch of things that we can now
animate individually and we can always
add these to each other so what I want
to show you is we've got the transform
properties here we've got our character
properties here and then we've got some
other properties here that we can also
animate and and I'll go over those ones
later so the coolest one I think to show
you guys that first will be the scale a
lot of people use this scale in the
motion graphics on TV and and
commercials and everything so it's
really pretty cool-looking so we've got
our animator that just popped up called
animator one we've got our range
selector and our scale now if we come
and scroll down the range selector here
we've got start and an offset
well the start here if I if you look up
here on my textbook in my comp panel you
see this little line right here with a
little green arrow there or not green
red arrow I'm just thinking about comic
books too much apparently
so if we scroll our start here it's
going to move that little cursor there
and that it's how we're going to use
that's what we're gonna use to animate
across the screen and across the text so
this is the starting point and then the
end point is also the same thing in case
you wanted to go backwards for some
reason so what we're gonna do is we're
gonna make our scale 0 just type that in
because you can go negative on your
scale to it make it be upside-down but
see why you want to do that right now
not for this project so we're gonna put
that as zero and then we're gonna
keyframe our range selector from 0 to
100 and here we go and I'll show you
what that looks like so if I render this
we've got our characters animating on
word or a letter by letter so I mean
you've probably seen this a few times
this is kind of cool-looking
so I mean if this is what you figure it
out you can stop or this is what you
wanted to see how to do you can stop now
and just leave but we're gonna go over
some more advanced stuff and you know
into the Advanced section here because
you can really control what's going on
with your animation so I'm gonna stop
this I'm going to move in here to where
we have some of our words up and we're
gonna come down here into the Advanced
tab now we've got a whole bunch of
different things going on here and I'm
gonna show you how to use these pretty
thoroughly I think hopefully so we've
got our units here right now it's on
percentage and this means the units were
using for our range selector right now
you can see it's on percentage and that
means the percentage of our text here
that will be fully animated so if we
start here at 0 that means none of our
text is animated
now if we come into the middle here this
is a 50% of our text has been animated
and of course at the end hundred percent
we can change this here too
from units we can change it to index and
I'll do that real quick and you can see
the range selector has changed to 33 now
there's 33 characters in here so there's
probably a few less actual letters and
then there's actual spaces that they're
counting also now since each letter
counts as an index you can easily tell
which letter is going to animate rather
than when you're using percentage so if
I come up a couple frames I'm gonna
press page down to move frame by frame
now our index is at 1 that means that a
is totally animated right now if I move
in two to point a couple frames in we're
at 2.1 which means the n is totally
animated and then the eye is gonna start
coming in so you can you get the idea
here now our it counts the spaces here
as you can see there's a space in
between animate and whatever the next
letter is and it's pretending to animate
that space up the same way it would
animate the text so we got that going on
and you should understand that now
that's a way that you might be able to
change and finer or be able to finally
pick out what letters you want to
animate on and everything like that
now we've got this based on right here
and we've got characters characters
excluding spaces so if I change it to
that
it's going to animate without animating
or animate the characters on without
having to animate the space in between
now when that happens the range selector
gets a little mugged up sometimes and it
still thinks we have 33 characters in
there well we don't since the the spaces
aren't animated and I'll show you this
I'll come over here to where we're close
there and I'm going to go by pressing
page up and after the e normally the
space would try to animate on but it's
not going to it's just going to skip
right to the T so the range selector
once we get to the end is going to have
to be adjusted so once we get to the end
here with the exclamation point right
here is when everything should be done
so probably about 28 and the end here
should be 28 so if we come over to 4
seconds we'll change that to 28 and then
our key frames will line up correctly
and everything will animate within the
selected keyframe amount as we can see
there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
