tutorial that I'm making for the new
Boston and in this tutorial I'm gonna be
showing you how to use the font dialog
so all you need for this tutorial is a
button and a text box and make sure your
text box multi lines so you can take
multiple lines of text in our text box
once you have those on your form just go
ahead and double click on the button in
order to create on dialogue this is the
font dialog I'll just call it f d4 font
dialog I'm just going to go ahead and
set it equal to a new font dialog just
like all the other dialogues we're going
to make an if statement or create an if
statement making sure that the user
actually selects in the font dialog and
they don't like exit out of it or
something all right so now that we have
the font dialog created and we also an
if statement check and see if they
select a font we are going to set Xbox
one bond equal to whatever font the user
selects in the font dialog I'm going to
do FD bond bond property just for font
so we'll set equal to Xbox one spot so
now I may be bug here click this button
here just get a font dialog yep we can
choose fonts all this choose is delivery
or whatever and then get hold to the
side okay now let me type in here and
then type in that font and you can
change the font of that as well we just
change this playbill I guess okay yep
you do that as well there are many
different properties inside of the font
class for example you can make it so the
user can only select like max size and
minimum size you can change the size and
the font that the user can select so if
you only want if you want the minimum
size you can select for the font ve like
10 now when you open the font dialog you
cannot
set in any lower than tiny try to make
it nine they won't let you
yep sizes would be between 10 and that
very large number you can also set the
maximum so if you want the maximum size
of the user can set the font we like 20
then you can do that so now we try to
set a bond any higher than 20 dress ID
equal to 23 we're going to here yeah
size must be between 10 and 20 points so
if we set it to 11 okay
you can also choose whether or not you
want them to be able to select a color
so if you just to show color if you want
them to be able to select a color you
just have to be true so now we open our
font dialog feel the site select a color
yep so if we choose lime or something
you should see lime in this text box
alright actually know if you want to be
able to change the color of the text
inside of the text box we have two new
text box one dot or color and set that
equal to font dialogues color or
whatever color Jesus selects in the font
dialog so now it should work just fine
so now if you choose like blue or
something come here yep blue you can
also create or choose if they don't want
to be a help button so can you show help
if you set that equation true there will
be now be a help button on your font
dialog yet to see is health button but
currently when we click it nothing
happens and just like in a color dialog
tutorial you're going to have to do or
just create a new event handler for that
and just help them to us plus equals
three event handler double tap tab so
let's create it and yeah now we just
have this method that will be invoked
when the event is raised so now as soon
as someone clicks the help button
whatever code boopin here will be
a message box shows so now whenever we
look that Help button you should get a
message box saying choose the font for
the text box
yep choose a font for the text box so do
that now respond to the color strikeout
underline click OK now if I tip it
strikes out underlined and it's gray so
that's pretty much all there is to the
font dialog so see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
