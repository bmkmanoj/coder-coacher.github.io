tutorial that I'm making for the new
Boston and in this tutorial we're going
to finish our email sender so just have
everything we had in the last tutorial
and yeah so in the last tutorial we
didn't get a chance to test our email
sender code so let's go ahead and test
that right now I'm going to send it to
my email which is X need Adam X at
gmail.com the subject all the same hey
make the body hello You Tube and I'll
make the the from email be my other
email that I made just for this tutorial
call the Adams tutorials at gmail.com
and password click send email set the
email now let's go ahead and check my
inbox there we go
now we have the email says hello YouTube
perfect so that's exactly what we wanted
it to do however let's just add a few
more things down the feed email is sent
and do a few more things so first of all
let's put a try and catch on this first
let's put a try and catch up on this so
that if they type in the wrong
information it doesn't throw an error so
we'll put catch and we'll just have a
message box be displayed saying that
there was an air sending the message
make sure you type in and I'll do slash
are slash in so it's on a different line
oops
slash are slash then make sure you type
in your credentials directly next then
I'll make the title of this message box
the make it be air and then I'll make
the buttons of this message box be just
okay and the title or I mean image on
the message box the icon will be air so
now if you were to type in something
wrong like a good like typing stuff here
and stuff typed in a wrong email address
I'm gonna just type in something random
and click send email we're going to get
an error and now we have this our
message box you just created us as air
there is an error sending the message
make sure you type in your credentials
correctly and that you have an internet
connection perfect that's just what you
want few more things that we're going to
check is make sure that before they send
the message that the email is um has
Gmail in it because if it doesn't have
Gmail in it then that means it's not at
gmail.com address and it has to be in at
gmail.com address in order for this to
work so right here we're going to say
yeah text box this is text box three
your text box three dot text dot
contains and this will just check to see
if the string contains another string so
we'll just make sure that it contains at
gmail.com
and if it doesn't what we're going to do
is we're going to have a message box be
displayed message box show and we'll
just say you need to provide and email
from email or no add email and obviously
you probably want to put in there like
the title and the image and stuff but
I'm not going to worry about that right
now
so oh you have another semicolon and
then after it does that we're going to
have a return so in return we'll
desculpe and we'll just stop doing all
this code right here so now test it out
right here random stuff stop an email
that is not at gmail comm send email
then here we get a message box in any
deprived email at gmail.com and it
didn't send the message another things
we are going to do is as soon as it
starts as soon as go at the button we're
just going to make it um actually we're
going to make it to it if you put if
it's a correct email we're going to make
it disabled on the button so that you
can't click it while it's sending and
get an error so we're going to do dot
enabled equals false and then once it's
done sending it'll put 1 1 dot labeled
was true and we'll also put this inside
of the cache now instead of doing this
we could do something called finally and
we talked about this before
and finally that will do it no matter
what if no matter if this is true or not
it'll do fine so we'll do finally
but one navel equals true so if it gets
an error or not it will enable button
one again after it's all done in this
code so now type in random stuff type in
random stuff click send email up you
provide an email comm and you get past
that check there's an error setting the
message and then as you can see the
button is disabled so yeah and those are
just a few things or a few ways to
improve your program I'm not going to go
over and finish everything like add
stuff to this text box and run checks to
make sure that people actually provide
recipients and subject in a body but you
can do that on your own time so that's
pretty much it for this tutorial
so see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
