tutorial in PHP and then this is
turnaround gonna be teaching guys how to
return values for function functions and
it's real easy so pay attention let me
give some myself some more space here
and let's start out by creating a
function and again to do this just type
in the word function and now we have to
name it and says I'm going to be adding
numbers I'm going to just name this
function add
and unlike last time where we just added
one parameter I'm going to add two this
time two variables that we're going to
be adding together I'm going to add the
a variable it's going to be our first
number and B variable these are going to
be two numbers that we're going to
substitute and add together later so now
we have to create our function so add
your curly braces and anything in here
is going to be your function so now that
we have a function called add and we
have two variables now I have to tell
PHP what to do with it so I'm going to
tell you alright
to get the total I want you to add the
variable A plus the variable B and this
will give you the total but now what you
have to do is tell the function to
return something because since this is
outside the regular PHP
when you call this variable it's not
going to know what to do since this
variable is only in this function if you
call total outside it won't work so we
want to see all right return the value
of total so now here's what this
function is doing it's going to say all
right when we have two numbers we're
going to add them together and we're
going to give you the total so now let's
put this to work now
what we want you to do is echo the
function add and now you're saying all
right but what numbers are you going to
put where do you put them you put them
right substituted wherever your
parameters were in variables a and B so
let's say 8 and I just add 9 so now you
see if we save this and go refreshed it
would get to variable 17 and that's how
you use our return value on the function
I'm just going to show you guys that
don't have it set up let's add 12 and
343 save that refresh 355
so again to recap we made a function and
added two parameters that we're going to
fill in later we added we told pH we
want what we wanted the function to do
we say we want you to get the sum of
numbers a and B and give us the sum now
whenever we call our function we were
able to add our number numbers and it
gave us a sum so that's how you use our
turn value and your functions so study
this and hope you watch you're lying
