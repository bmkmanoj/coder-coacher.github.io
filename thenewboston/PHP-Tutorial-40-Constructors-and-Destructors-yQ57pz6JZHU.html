tutorial and this tutorial is going to
be on something called constructors now
what a constructor is it's a special
function that gets called automatically
whenever you first create an object
sounds confusing well trust me it isn't
so let's go ahead and create a class I'm
gonna name mine Bucky and let's go ahead
and create our special constructor right
now anytime you create constructor it's
the exact same as creating another
normal function inside your class it
just has a special name so public
definitely spelled that our own function
and instead we're just naming anything
you want you have to name it this
underscore underscore CO and STR UCT and
I definitely spread that on STR UCT
should definitely take a spelling class
alright now let's go ahead and put your
empty parameters and your body so like I
said you don't need to call this
function explicitly when you coding in
PHP as soon as you create any object
from this class this constructor is
gonna get called so in that way it's a
little bit different than another
function so let's go ahead and put some
coding in here let's just echo echo out
umm you never have called me come on
there we go I know how to get it
eventually
so well I guess that's really all we can
do with that constructor for now I mean
we could add some more code but I really
am way too lazy to do that so anyways
like I said this special function which
we call a constructor automatically gets
called whenever we create an object so
let's go ahead and make some object
right now and set it equal to new Bucky
and looks pretty good and check this out
you know how we would have to if we
wanted to use any function in this class
go ahead and use some object and
yadda-yadda called a function like that
well in this case we don't need to do
any of that
soon as we create this object is gonna
say alright what class did you create
this object from you created it from
Bucky so I'm gonna go up to the Bucky
class and I'm gonna look if there's a
special function name underscore
underscore construct in here if there is
then I'm gonna run automatically right
now whatever you told me to in that
constructor if there's not any function
at all in here called construct then I'm
just gonna you know do nothing at all so
let's go ahead and save this and see
what we got let me go ahead and refresh
a little bit of this a little bit of
call make on the beat and check this out
you never called me so now you can see
instead of having to explicitly call
this little bit of code and construct it
gets pretty much called
automatically so that is what a
constructor is in by the way let me just
add this little note in this example I'm
showing you right here it's pretty much
useless because I mean why couldn't we
just create another function and if
we're gonna say that then why wouldn't
we just write echo right in the body
then just having to go through a class
at all
well actually whenever you're working
with classes the constructor is useful
for maybe you want to initialize some
variables or maybe you want to call some
other methods automatically well in this
case I know that it's not really useful
but whenever we are actually programming
real programs and I'm not just showing
you guys an example you'll see how it's
useful and anyways enough of that let me
go ahead and show you guys one little
thing they may be wondering
you may be wondering alright why do you
have parameters after the class name the
parameters after the class name whenever
you create a new object are further
constructor a constructor as you can see
like I said is just like a normal
function except that it gets called
automatically whenever create object so
knowing that you know that you can pass
parameters to your constructor just like
you can any other normal function so
let's go ahead and pass our constructor
a parameter right now will pass the X
and say you never called me X and then
whenever you create our object it will
pass
in something like Sarah well I kind of
like that Sarah with no age anyways
we'll go ahead and pass in the name
Sarah to our constructor and that's what
these parameters are for right here your
constructor so then it's gonna say
alright you never called me Sarah so
oops almost forgot to save it and let's
go ahead a little bit of this a little
bit of this a little bit of behind the
scenes and check this out
you never called me Sarah or is it you
never called me love Sarah I don't know
depending if you want to make this
program to send me or we're gonna send
this to Sarah you know it's up to you
just follow your heart so anyways that
is why you see those parameters after
the class name those are for
Reconstructor if your constructor takes
a parameter so now I know you guys those
probably bothering you what those
parameters mean so you're saying alright
buggy so I know everything there is to
know about constructor well yes you do
so now I can teach you guys about a
Deconstructor now check this out way
back when in PHP for programmers set
alright now that you have a constructor
that's all nice and all but we want to
add something else we want to add
something called a Deconstructor and
this gets called when the PHP script is
complete and you no longer need your
object in your object gets destroyed
well right before it gets destroyed your
PHP code is gonna look for something
called a Deconstructor in your class and
if you have one this is the code that
gets ran right before your script
completes and right before your object
gets deleted now let me tell you guys
this in this code is where you mostly do
any of your cleanup like another
programming languages you might clean up
the memory or you might delete some
files well it's not as common in
pageviews up in other programming
languages but I'm gonna show it to you
guys anyways because you know I just
can't skip over information so let's go
ahead and name public function
underscore underscore de as
TR UCT destruct so it's not gonna take
any parameters and all its gonna do is
echo you know destruction or something
like that
so anyways down here in our object we
don't need to do anything different
because this object is gonna get created
and then right after it gets created its
gonna say alright your script is
complete
you no longer need this object so I'm
automatically going to destroy this
object but before I destroy it I'm gonna
go in your class to see where the object
was created from and see if there's a
special function called destruct and if
there is I'm gonna call it right now so
let's go ahead and save this and a
little bit of this yes and check this
out
you never called me Sarah and then your
script is completed so it's gonna look
for this special function called
destruct and it's gonna run whatever
code is in there and like I said your
Deconstructor is really useful in other
programming languages where you need to
clean up memory or delete files it's not
as useful in PHP but you need to have it
there and I mean I really never even
built a program where I used a
Deconstructor I just any code I needed
to run I just ran it before you know I
completed everything but anyways I need
to show you guys this because it's a
part of PHP that you need to understand
and if you ever come across that you
won't be like whoa what the heck is this
so anyways my point a Deconstructor is
not as popular as constructors but it
does exist so now you guys know it um if
you never use again sorry for wasting
your time you can send me some hate mail
if you like so anyways that's all I have
for you guys for this tutorial what a
constructor is how you can pass it a
parameter and what this useless D
constructor is so anyways thank you guys
for watching and I know in this example
just like most of my examples I'm just
covering the basics this isn't really a
useful program home pipo unless you
really hate it a girl named Sarah
but anyways in the upcoming programming
programs I guess
programming programs as a nice little
name you can see why this would be
useful but anyways for now thank you
guys for watching don't forget subscribe
in aus my guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
