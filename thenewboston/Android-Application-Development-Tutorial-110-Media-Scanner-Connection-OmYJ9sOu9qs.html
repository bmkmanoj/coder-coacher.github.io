and tenth Android tutorial for the new
boss in and this will be the last
tutorial for our external data class and
what is talking about quickly in the
last tutorial is we had to save it as a
PNG so you know another way we can proof
test is we can go up to our file where
we set up here and just say plus and
then in quotations dot PNG since that
image we were saving was a PNG file that
way they won't have to type PNG but also
if they do type PNG it probably given
area because it'll be dot PNG dot PNG so
that's just one quick way we can you
know fix that error and then also what
we can do or what we want to do in the
main what this tutorial is mainly about
is letting our letting our media scanner
update so the user can access those
files because sometimes it doesn't
update automatically or it takes a
little while before those files are
accessible to the user so if we just do
an update through the media scanner that
way we know for sure that that file is
available to the user so we're going to
do is we're going to set up a media
scanner connection or refer to that
class and we're going to hit dot scanned
file as you can see it takes four paths
or four parameters so for the context
what we're going to do we're going to
say external data dot this again the
external data is our class name if you
guys are just fault
just seeing this tutorial and having
been following along for our paths what
we're going to do we're going to create
a new string oops
whoa what's going on alright we're going
to create a new string array and we're
going to basically put one thing within
here we're going to refer to our file
name and then we're just going to say to
string that's going to convert our file
into a string and offer bracket
and we're good for that that second
parameter for the fourth parameter and
I'm just hitting enter after the commas
it's not really going to affect how the
computer reads it's just for simplicity
sake for you guys
the third one we're just going to set
null and the fourth one's going to be
quite long what this one is going to be
is basically we're going to setup a non
scan completed listener and you know
kind of do something after a scan is
going been complete so what we're going
to say is new media scanner connection
dot on skin completed listener so click
that and it sets it up for us let's
finish off our statement here with the
semicolon again this is just the fourth
parameter we can do something with in
here whatever you guys want again we can
set up a toast dot make text sternal
data dot this text scan complete
and duration toast is dot set length a
short there we go so now this is this
scanner will kind of update our our
filename so here are four parameters we
got the context which is this of our
class the second one which is our path
which we convert into a string array or
a file I should say into a string array
and the third one don't worry about it's
just going to be set to no last one
we're going to say on complete our scan
completed just if we want to you know
display a toast whoops got to put T
display something like that or show
sorry and there we go so that's it for
this tutorial
maybe leave a comment here for future
reference
update media update files for the user
to use something like that so alright
guys uh next tutorials we're going to
get into something else don't know why
yet
maybe SQLite or something like that so
I'll catch you guys in have a good one
