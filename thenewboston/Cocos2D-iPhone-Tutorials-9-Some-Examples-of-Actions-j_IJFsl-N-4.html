tutorial and yes this tutorial will be
amazing because see we already learned
what actions are and how to use them so
now we can begin covering the different
types of actions and trust me they are
amazing so before I even start talking
about that go ahead and delete
everything in your do this so we just
start with a blank slate so go ahead and
let's go to our first action now check
this out go ahead and type ID and just
name your action something like the
action and you're saying all right why
did I type ID and why is it pink like
void that's because like void ID is a
data type ID I don't know if I actually
taught this in Objective C but ID is the
generic data type for objective-c it's a
data type that can store any type of
object pretty cool huh so since actions
aren't really their own specific um
cocos2d object just store them an ID and
you'll be fine that's the only thing you
need to worry about that so we won't be
covering it anymore just want to show
you guys in case you're wondering ideas
is pretty much a data type that can hold
any object so let's go ahead and start
covering some of the basic actions CC
jump by is one of the more common
actions this is a well you'll see what
it is later on and check this out
anytime you want to get the parameters
just go ahead and press space escape and
then enter or return and this will give
you all the parameters escape whenever
you press this it brings up the list of
what you can do after it in by default
it will give you default parameters is
the first choice so that's why you can
just hit escape enter will give you all
the parameters the first one for this is
action with duration this pretty much
means how long do you want want the
jumping to last well only one second and
the next parameter is the position this
means after you jump where do you want
your sprite to end up and you need to
give a point CCP and just put 0 0 for
this tutorial this means just
up in the same position on that you
started up the height is how high do you
want the spray to jump and just go ahead
and be like 175 maybe a little bigger if
your sprites burger and jumps is how
many times in this one second do you
want your spread to jump well I'll have
mine jump twice and of course hit enter
and in order to run the action you got
to type the name of the sprite you want
to do it and then a run action and the
action you want to run and mines name
the action how can we get so go ahead
and build and run this will get any
hairs and check this out whenever I hit
my red button my little sprite jumps
twice according to my parameters pretty
sweet so you can see clearly the power
of this maybe we're going to develop a
game like doodle jump later on perhaps
sounds tempting alright so we know how
to jump pretty cool action another one
my favorites is scale by and in order to
do this put CC scale by just like that
hit escape enter and this will give you
all the parameters for scale by and this
is the easy one you write pretty much
how long you want to take and say one
second and how many times bigger than
the original sprayed do you want to grow
it and this is a float so you can use
decimal points three-point oh and of
course you don't need to change this
line of code because it's already saying
to run this action we didn't rename it
so go ahead press built by and actually
since the sprays in bottom left corner a
little bit is going to go off this oh
the screen but you're going to see
what's going on i press this you see it
grows by three times whatever size it
was now if i press this it's going to go
by three times that so you can see scale
by does you know exactly like you think
it will do scale it by a certain number
in this case three so if you're saying
all right why do they even have by why
don't they just have CC jump in CC scale
it's because this almost every action
has a cc
e 2 and a cc by right now we looked at
the buys but let me show you guys
probably the easiest example that I can
see see rotate by and let's bring up the
parameters for this and this of course
rotates it and just pressed by take two
seconds long and rotate it by 120 now
let me run this and remember we're right
now we're looking at the by action so
whenever we press the button it rotates
it by 120 degrees press it again rotate
it by another 120 degrees press it again
rotated by another 120 80 degrees so
it's 360 total but let's go ahead and
change this to rotate to with the same
parameters and see what happens so let's
go ahead and once this loads press the
button and now my sprite rotates to 120
degrees press it again and nothing
happens double D F something wrong with
my program no this isn't friends between
2 and x since my spray is already to 120
degrees whenever we press the button
again to rotate it to that it already is
at that location so that's why nothing
happens so that's why in case you reset
your area impressive again it will
always rotate to 120 degrees so another
example if you hit like um move to the
position 100 100 it'll move to that
position no matter where it is but if
you right move by 100 100 mi no matter
where it is it's going to move it and I
might not explain that correctly but you
know you'll figure it out so now now
that we cover that let's go over one my
other favorite topics and that's running
to actions together did I just hear
something I just get text message nope
weird must be going crazy so anyways
let's go ahead and first of all make
this easier copy this and name this one
the action too and now let's go ahead
and copy this and name this one extra to
servicing all right whenever we run two
actions right after each other what's
going to happen are they going to run at
the same time or as one action going to
run that's going to be completed and
then another action is going to start
running well let's go ahead and find out
right now so let's go ahead and do CC
jump by and action with duration in one
arm position just put like ccp 00 and
the height let's go ahead and put 150 in
the jumps just go ahead and put two can
see that let me scroll over jumps to
let's go enough re now for the second
action what we want to do is let's just
scale since that's pretty obvious go
ahead and CC scale by escape enter and
action with duration one and why does it
give me a scale scale three point why is
it not bringing up my scale perimeter CC
scale by oh well let's go enough alright
so now what's going to happen is it
going to jump twice and then scale by
three times its original size or all at
the same time is it going to jump twice
as its scaling well only one way to find
out build and run the shizz and let's go
ahead and see what happens succeeded so
as you can see it runs into the exact
same time when I press the button not
only does it jump twice but as is
jumping it's scaling as well pretty cool
huh we could do this all day all day oh
we're going to attack by the lips oh oh
here we go here we go and that's enough
of that so maybe you can make the game
with this called attack of the lips just
you know just an idea you don't got to
do it but anyways that's that for this
tutorial um in the next tutorial we're
going to be going over different types
of actions and I you know we have only
begun dip our toes into the pool of
actions so we've got a lot to learn so
uh don't forget to stick around don't
forget to uh you know download my apps
and I now go to my forum check out my
other store you know I got to plug
everything here so anyways thank you for
watching I don't forget subscribe enough
so you guys are laid up</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
