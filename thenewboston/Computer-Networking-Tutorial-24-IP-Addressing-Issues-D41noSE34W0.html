been pretty simple I mean whenever we
want to make a simple home network all
we do is you buy some modem buy a router
take all of our computers and start plug
them into the router and we need to give
them a unique ID number so we can
identify each one so for the unique IP
addresses we'll give this one one two
three boom look at that home network
taken care of now that's great simple
enough but the problem comes whenever
you try to get on the Internet
because what if this guy over here what
if he also signed his computer is the
idea one two three well whenever you
guys I don't know like go to some
website and request some information and
it tries to send it back oh no no no
this way the no this one or look at this
you see this diagram it's horrible so
that's the first problem that we have
the IP address that you have is actually
broken up into two parts and the reason
for this is because the Internet is not
one big network the Internet is a
network of networks I'm going to say
that one more time the Internet is a
network of networks so we have one
network over here this is you know some
college and this is just some apartment
and this might be an entire country that
just got internet for the first time all
of these networks are connected together
and somehow they got to figure out a way
to work together so whenever this
website right here gets a request to
send data I don't know maybe some images
to one of these computers and needs to
know two pieces of information first
what network am I supposed to send it to
this one this one or this one and then
the second piece of information is once
it gets to that network what device am I
supposed to send it to that one that one
that one that one that one that one so
the network ID I'll write these down
network ID and the host ID so if you can
read my handwriting that's the two
pieces of information that we need
whenever trying to send or
receive data what network you belong to
and what is your host ID was your
individual computers identification or
IP address so way back when whenever
they're first designing the IP
addressing system what they did I know
what they were doing probably
rollerblading around and smoking weed
and doing the disco whatever the heck
they did back then they were looking at
this thing and thought okay we have 32
bits to work with and we need to break
this up in such a way we're part of it
is for the network and part of it can be
used to identify the hosts so how are we
going to do this well one brilliant guy
probably took a puff on his little joint
and was like you know what man why don't
we just split it right down the center
this part of the IP address can be for
the network and this part can be for the
host now whenever we have 8 plus 8 bits
that's 16 bits and if we do 2 to the 16
remember that little math trick I told
you earlier on that means that we can
have 65,536 different networks that also
means actually write down networks that
also means that we can 65,536 different
hosts on each network so this is how
many different networks you can have and
each of those can have this many
computers connected to it but then
another guy was like you know what I
know probably rollerbladed around some
more he's like I've been thinking what
if a network wants to join that only has
500 computers 500 hosts well that means
that 65,000 would be wasted so if a
small network join you would have all
these IP addresses that would go to
waste now another guy who just walked in
he probably came in from Woodstock who
knows he's like oh I got it why don't we
just split it right here so we have more
networks but less hosts and then the
other guy was like yeah but what if we
have a big network and they need more
computers and you know what there's a
huge fight and I'm pretty sure that's
how one of the war started I'm not a
history buff but I'm almost sir
that is so you know you can quote me in
your scholarly papers if you can want to
but we need a way to dynamically change
the number or the size of networks that
can connect to the internet so how do we
do this and how do we keep all these
people from wanting to fight each other
well choosing an arbitrary number such
as just say okay I'm going to split it
here or I'm going to split it here or
I'm going to split here that's not a
good idea you never want a fixed number
so in the next video I'm going to show
you the solution they came up with and
how IP addressing saved the world</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
