first of all what is a starter a starter
is a really simple electric engine
basically whenever you provide an
electricity it spins
this little gear right here interesting
but now why would you want this on your
go-kart well this is how its hooked up
on your go-kart
whenever you stick the key in the
ignition switch it's going to suck
better
excuse me suck electricity from the
battery and provide it to this terminal
right here now like I said whenever this
thing gets electricity to it it starts
spinning this so why would you want this
to start spinning whenever you start
your engine well this little gear here
is actually hooked up the crank shaft in
your engine and as we already know once
that crank shaft starts spinning as long
as your engine is you know tuned up and
set up properly then it's going to
pretty much let the engines start
running on its own so as soon as you
start spinning that crank shaft the
engine is going to run over under its
own power of you know fuel air
combination and the combustion chambers
and everything so pretty much this kick
starts your engine and once your engine
is running it's good to go so now I'm
going to show you guys how to actually
install this on your engine now
installing the starter is actually a
really easy
the only thing before you put it in your
engine is you want to make sure that
around the seal it's really clean and
also if you want to apply a little bit
of oil to this gear it won't hurt
sliding it in so go ahead and place it
into your engine there we go and that
went in really easy but if it isn't
going in no matter you know how much
your wiggle in it we want to do is take
it back out and turn that gear a little
bit and then it might go in a little bit
easier so right now we don't have the
electrical hooked up to our engine
because I don't know we just aren't
there yet but whenever we do remember
that the big thick wire in our
electrical kit is going to go here the
starter takes a lot of electricity so
it's usually a thicker wire and that's
going to be hooked up right here but I
can't show you how to do that yet
because we didn't install the electrical
yet now the only other place said this
starter right here hooks onto our engine
is two bolts in the back of it right
here so let me go ahead and get a better
camera angle and then I'll show you guys
where to put those in now the easy part
just go ahead stick in the bolts that
came with the starter so there you go
our starter is now installed and now
only thing we have to remember is
whenever we hook up the battery and all
that electrical to plug the big thick
wire in here and we'll be good to go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
