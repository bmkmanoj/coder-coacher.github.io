last method we have to create in this
class and that is the able to type
method so again the April to site method
is the method that we want to pretty
much create to allow the user to type
text into their little text area so by
default we set the user text area to
they pretty much can't type anything in
set editable equal to false and that's
because like I said the user shouldn't
be allowed to type things in when
they're not connected to another
computer because not only would it be a
waste of time for you know them but it
would also cause problems when you try
to send something through a stream and
no one's on the other side so what this
method is basically going to do is let
the user type stuff into their box okay
okay you know good example all right so
now what I want to do is create private
void able to type I think that's what I
named it able to type and for here we're
just going to pass in final boolean true
or false so again this able to type
method whenever it's true that means
okay the user is able to type things
whenever it's false we want to say okay
the user is not able to type things into
their text box so actually what I can do
is I'm going to copy all of this right
here
first of all because I'm lazy and second
of all because we need it so it always
does out okay format format and there we
go that's how we want it so basically
just like before
since we're updating a portion of the
GUI in this case we're not updating the
chat window inputting text in there but
we're updating the GUI in another way
we're either going to set this form that
they have to fill out able to you know
type stuff in or not able to type stuff
in so instead of you know appending crap
in the chat window what we can do is set
the user text which is the area where
you can type stuff in we can set
the editable which pretty much means um
whenever this is true you can type stuff
in there whenever it's false you can't
stuff it's pretty much grayed out and
you can't type anything in and we're
going to pass it in T or F so now this
able to type method is ready to go um
let's see where I put it
well I can't even freaking find it
anywhere
RK so in this case whenever you are
connected to something and we pass in
true unable to type what happens is it
gets passed in true right here and it
pretty much updates the GUI where it
says okay you know that area that was
great out before because we didn't want
you sending anything in there well you
now can type stuff in there and guys
once I actually run this application and
show you guys what part is grayed out
and what part turns editable once you're
connected to someone else it's going to
make a lot more sense if you never work
with this method before but for now guys
pat yourself on the back because this
server class is now completely finished
so of course if you notice there is no
main method in here so we're going to be
doing in the next tutorial is creating
another class that kicks off or
kick-starts this and it's only going to
take one more tutorial and then we're
going to be testing out this half of the
program but guys remember what this
program is is basically a two-part
tutorial once we put this program on the
server we're going to have to make
another program that's actually a lot
like this to put on the client computer
and once they run the program and you
run the program you guys are going to be
able to have a conversation with one
another it's going to be awesome amazing
coolest tutorial that I made yet and if
you guys want any of this source code
then that's available on my forum tnb
forum calm so anyways thank you guys for
watching I'm going to subscribe and I'll
see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
