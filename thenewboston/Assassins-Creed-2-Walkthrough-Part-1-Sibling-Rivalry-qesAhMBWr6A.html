my first tutorial or walkthrough of an
assassin's creed 2 and this little
memory I guess is called deferred
siblings rivalry Ron and this is because
this is the first memory that people
really don't get right that often so you
see the first thing they do is try to
follow Frederico the whole entire time
but if you're following them the whole
entire time you're probably in second
the whole entire time so what I do as
you can see running right to the left
ally of the church and then go ahead and
pretty much shoot straight for that
green checkpoint right there and I can
see we get a huge advantage of them
right on the get-go and we win the race
easily so if you're having a problem
when this race just go ahead and do that
and you should complete it with these
now from here you pretty much completed
the mission all you have to do is follow
them up the sledge up up there now go
ahead and go to the left and again keep
following them just like this and this
is going to take you all the way to the
top where it's going back it's you it's
you I love you and by the way good luck
if you think this video is kind of jerky
I'm going to be turning up the bitrate
so the future videos you know this
quality is only going to get better so
happens it and now from here you just go
ahead and have to watch the title um
Zen's assassin's creed 2 so welcome to
the beginning of my walkthroughs in the
beginning of the game what a beautiful
moment ladies and gentlemen and now from
here just go ahead and hit some buttons
and you've completed the sibling rivalry
on memory weight so again you don't want
to just go ahead and jump down the next
memory is called nightcap and it's where
you have to go meet a girl and you don't
want to go doing this just yet the first
thing you want to do is go over this
little edge or legend it's called a view
point I think and go ahead go walk on it
and press Y to synchronize and what this
is going to do is it's going to give you
a piece of the mini-map and these are
scheduled scattered all throughout the
town every town you're in our city so go
do it first so go ahead and hit Y again
it's going to tell you how to do the
leap of faith and this pretty much means
how to jump off of it and you pretty
much just run off of it and that's
pretty much the basics of that tutorial
so thank you guys for watching don't
forget subscribe and I will see you next
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
