back with another tutorial for the new
Boston now in this tutorial we've
already looked at or in the past
tutorial we've already looked at
connecting to our database now to make
this a lot more efficient so we can
include it where we require it I'm just
going to get rid of everything in our
index dot PHP file and I'm going to
create a new file make sure this is
enclosed in PHP tags and the reason I'm
doing this is I'm now going to save it
as connecting PHP now what I can do with
this now is whenever I open up a new
page let's say it might be index.php or
something else dot PHP all I can do is
at the top I can require connect dot PHP
and this way we've required this file to
be the first will exist because require
will kill the rest of the page if this
can't be found
second of all connect connects to our
database so now what we can do is under
here we can start doing things to allow
us to grab some data from our database
okay so let's assume that we've
connected to our database properly let's
come into database and refresh from the
last tutorial oK we've got nothing up so
under here let's echo maybe okay out
just so we know that it's working let's
refresh okay so we've got okay so the
first thing we know is that we've
required the file correctly the file
exists
second of all we know that we've
connected properly because we haven't
killed here so this should always come
at the top of your page so let's go to a
PHP myadmin and inside this a database
I'm going to insert some some data so oh
well we need a table first I'm going to
call this table food a number of fields
I'm going to say let's say we need an ID
field we need a the name of the food and
I'm going to say the calories and
whether it's unhealthy or healthy
so I'm going to have four fields so
let's create these fields we're going to
ID with is going to be int we're going
to have the indexes primary because this
is a unique and AI which is auto
increment it's going to be yes so we
want this Auto increment next is going
to be food and then we're going to say
calories and then we're going to say I'm
going to call this healthy or unhealthy
I'm going to call it hu in fact let's
make it a bit easier to stay healthy and
healthy and this is going to be equal to
I'm going to say a varchar' length one
so if the foods healthy this value is
going to equal H if it's unhealthy it's
going to equal you the food I'm going to
save our chart of let's say 25 and
calories is going to stay an int because
we're always going to have an integer
number for the amount of calories in the
food so let's go along down here and I'm
going to click Save so let's hopefully
we're going to return yet we've returned
table has been created so let's browse
we can't browse the data but we can see
the structure got ID as a primary key in
into food of avatar 25 calories in
healthy unhealthy varchar' 1 so storing
either an H or au for this ok so let's
go and insert a row of data I'm going to
put the food remember the ID can be
blank because that's automatically gonna
equal 1 the food I'm going to say pizza
the calories I'm going to say a thousand
an unhealthy or healthy I'm going to say
u for unhealthy let's just uncheck this
ignore mal insert another row food let's
say salad calories I'm going to say 200
and I'm going to say it's healthy so I'm
going to put an H so let's click on go
that's inserted them two rows that's
successfully done now we can click
browse and view this data so we can see
that we've got an ID which is unique
we've got the food name the calorie
amount and healthy or unhealthy so let's
say I want to select all the data and
display
now to select all data we need to first
perform a query as we've discussed the
needs to select all the data so I'm
going to create a variable called query
and this is going to be equal to some
string text so I'm using double
quotation marks because remember we're
using singles inside the inside the
query so this query is going to be
select now we need to mention the field
names so select I'm going to say food
and calories so food calories separated
by a comma
from up with a space so from and this
table is called food so we need to
mention that where in fact we can encase
these in here as well so we're selecting
the filled food and calories which is
what we're going to display if we needed
to display for example the ID as well we
choose ID but we don't we just want to
we just want to keep that hidden for now
so food calories from food wear and I
want to say in fact no don't say
anything that's it we can specify an
order bias we can say order by ID for
example that's absolutely fine so order
by ID now what we need to do is we need
to actually perform the query as far as
this goes we haven't actually executed
the query within the database we refresh
our page you see that nothing's
happening we're not actually executing
the query so query I'm going to say run
equals now we're using this MySQL query
function to actually run the query so
you can either use the MySQL query
function on its own and insert your
structured query language in there or
what you can do is just then pop that
inside of it so we're popping this query
in here and then this is running the
query ok
what we can also do is we can use this
or Die
but what I'm going to do is I'm going to
say and so I've just deleted that I
didn't mean to comment that
I'm going to say if query run equals
MySQL query query then run this block
the reason I'm doing this is because if
the query is successful this will
evaluate to true and then we can
continue with our code but I'm going to
say otherwise query failed
okay so echo query success now what
we're not doing is we're not displaying
the result of this query just yet we're
just performing the query we can use
some functions later on to display the
results but for now what we're doing is
we're just saying query success if this
query makes sense and and return
something and is structured properly
otherwise we're saying query failed</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
