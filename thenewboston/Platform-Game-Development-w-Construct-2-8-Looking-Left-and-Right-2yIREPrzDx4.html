tutorial and in this video let's go
ahead and check out what we got to do
next so this is our game and if we press
the left and right you can move left and
right but check it out I'm pressing left
and he looks like he's doing like you
know like a fake moonwalk or something
so it would be really convenient if
whenever I pressed the left on my
keyboard he actually turned left
you know that's out what the player is
probably expecting so let's learn how to
do that right now so the first thing I
want to do is on this layout I want to
double click it you just insert a
keyboard object keyboard right here and
hit enter and that pretty much ensures
that the user can use all the keys on
their keyboard in the game so by default
in you saw that I can press left and
right but just to ensure that all the
keyboard um keys are being detected you
always want to do that so another thing
that I want to do is now that our game
can recognize all keyboard input let's
go ahead and basically what we're going
to do is this whenever our player or
excuse me whenever the dude who's
playing the game presses left we want
the exact same animation to occur but we
want him to look left so you guys might
be thinking alright that's gonna suck
because we have to import another sprite
sheet but this one we have to flip it
and make it left well not exactly
there's actually a built-in function in
construct 2 to make a mirrored object in
other words use the same animation what
you say face the other way so I'm gonna
show you guys how to do that right now
in the event sheet what we're gonna do
is we're gonna add an event and this is
actually going to be a keyboard event
and we want to hit on key pressed so
basically this is gonna say when the
user presses a key and now you have to
say well what key do you want to detect
and if you hit click the choose and you
can actually just press the left key on
your keyboard and it's automatically
gonna fill this in for you yeah okay and
then you just go ahead and hit done
basically this is saying is
whenever the user presses the left arrow
on their keyboard and then we need to
tell it what we want to occur so in the
action just press ok and the action that
we want to occur is this if you double
well what we basically want to do is
make the player look left so again the
object we want to affect is the player
now under appearance there's this cool
little function called set mirrored now
double click that and for this state
we're just gonna leave that as mirrored
and click done so pretty much we're
gonna say whenever we press the left key
under keyboard take this player and set
him mirrored to where he was before in
other words if he was looking right make
him look left so now if we actually run
the game right now
this is his default animation I'm gonna
press left he looks left I'm gonna press
right ok nothing hat is happening and
the reason for that is basically the
logic says start them out looking right
when we press the left arrow make them
look left but we didn't tell the game
when we press the right arrow again to
make them look back in the default
direction so in order to do that it's
actually really easy we need to add
another keyboard event on key pressed I
like this and hit right on your keyboard
yeah okay and done basically saying now
when the user hits the right area orcs
even eat the right arrow and why said
area what action do you want to occur
well just like for player and under
appearance we actually want to click set
mirrored again but instead of using this
as a mirrored which means pretty much
the opposite of the original we'll just
put not mirrored which pretty much means
back to the original animation so click
done and now check it out I'm gonna play
the game this is the original animation
whenever I hit left he looks left
whenever I hit right he goes back to the
original position or the original
animation
so pretty freaking cool that's how we
get our player to turn left and right
again once you understand the basics of
events it's actually really easy and in
the next video I'm gonna be showing you
guys how to add more animations for this
same player again it's actually really
easy once you understand the core
concepts so thank you guys for watching
and if you have any questions ask me on
my forum Bucky's room dog org slash
forum can't seem to talk today but
anyways I'll shut up now and uh well
hopefully I'll see you guys in the next
