androids tutorial for the new Boston and
what we're going to do in this tutorial
is we're gonna create another file we
have one file called path but we're
gonna create another one and this will
be actually from our edit text so more
specific way that they're gonna save it
so we're just gonna create another file
and we're gonna call this one file name
something like that or actual file
something like that now we're just gonna
say no to begin with and then you know
what was our edit text called save file
so now we're just gonna within our
actual save button we're going to set
this file up equal to basically or edit
text so we're gonna create a string to
kind of convert our edit text into a
string so we're gonna say string F I
don't know and we're gonna get our edit
text which we just looked at and forgot
already called save file dot get text
dot to string getting kind just quick
review and now what we're going to do is
we're going to have that file basically
equal our path that we set up and then
on top of that because the path is kind
of the folder it's gonna be within that
folder we're gonna reference basically
our edit text as the specific file
itself so a few tutorials ago we set up
a few paths which you can kind of think
about is the different folders so like
the music folder the picture folder and
the Downloads folder so we need our file
to kind of reference which folder it is
and then which specific path it is so
what we're gonna do here is basically
say our file and say equal to new file
and we're familiar with you know just a
string reference of some sort something
like that but we won't also refer to our
path so there's another file constructor
that we can use that takes two
parameters one for basically you can
think of the path or the folder however
you guys want to think about it and then
for the second parameter
the actual specific you know whatever
dot jpg or something like that P&amp;amp;G so
since we're using our you know our F
here for actual edit text we're just
gonna say F here so that's gonna create
a file for us and again our path
location with the specific file name
from our edit text pretty simple for the
most part and now what we want to do is
again we're gonna kind of check to make
sure we can read and write everything
and we've done that up up here a few
tutorials go with this state we get the
state and all that good stuff so what
we're gonna do is we're actually just
gonna say create a new method called
check state something like that
and it's gonna say hey I don't know what
that is create method and then we're
just gonna copy all this stuff here or
cut it I should say and then paste it
within that check state method that we
just created which is right here
so control V that's gonna check
everything update both our edit tags our
text views and also our boolean values
so now what we can do within our save
file again is make sure everything's
read can read and write so whoops we can
either do that or we can just use our
method that we just created so we're
just gonna say check state and that's
gonna update everything for us and then
we're just gonna say if you know we can
W which is can read equals can write I'm
sorry can write can equals can read
equals true we can read and write write
and within here is where we're actually
going to kind of do everything so before
we use file input streams and file
output streams but this time since we
actually have file a file setup we're
just gonna use input stream and output
stream so we're gonna do is create an
input stream or yeah input stream
called is equals and we're just gonna
get a picture we're gonna save a picture
no matter what path what file path were
using whether it be the music whatever
we're gonna save a picture to that file
so if you guys download the application
use this this activity you might want to
check your folders and see if there's
actually a picture in there so we're
gonna do get resources which is going to
refer to our resource folder and then
we're gonna say open raw resources I
think we've done this before
and then just start whatever we want to
save so our drawable dot let's say green
ball so that's our input stream what
we're gonna save now we also need to
create an output stream and we're gonna
call this OS and we're just going to say
new file output stream
and we're gonna refer to our file that
we set up right here so we're gonna say
file then we just got to import both our
file output stream and a file or and our
output stream and again we're gonna have
to surround this with a try and catch so
let's open up or try brackets a little
bit more and just throw an input stream
in there as well we what we need to do
again to set up a byte array that's
gonna kind of read all of our data for
us so we're just gonna you know set up a
byte array call it data and this is
going to be equal to new byte array and
within the parameter we're going to give
it our input stream and we just say dot
available again it's nothing too new
there and it says we just need to add a
catch clause to our surrounding try so
we're just going to click that adds the
input output exception and then what we
need to do is we need to do our input
stream dot read with the parameters
we're gonna give it a tard via break
looks kind of familiar to the last
tutorial we just read so this time we
are in a while loop so that's fine and
we're also gonna write it to our output
stream so we're gonna say right and
we're gonna write data and then we just
need to close both our input and our
output stream so just close and output
stream close and we're pretty much done
I mean this is gonna save a picture to
one of our path files and to the
specific location of our edit text</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
