tutorial for the new boss in what we're
going to do this tutorials basically set
up a new class as you can see I've
already done it for the most part and
we're going to do is call this class
camera and again what I want you guys to
do is go into your menu class change one
of those string variables to our class
name camera and also set it up in the
manifest
now I've basically setup this sorry I'm
cleaning up some stuff that I was just
practicing I make sure I got got this
application set up right for the most
part I basically set up the general
setup for any activity that we set have
setup so far I created the on click
around create method and then I set the
content view to that XML layout we just
set up and also initialize or created
this ver method called initialize that's
where I set up all my references and I
also set up my on click listeners now as
you can see I said this so we need to
implement and create a on click method
for the most part I just wanted to show
you guys that because you guys might
have some trouble setting that up for
the most part I've gotten emails
sometimes when I do tutorials like this
so again we say implement view dot on
click listener and we try and you know
import that for the most part and it's
giving us an error and we can't like you
know do anything we're like what's going
on what I like to do is just basically
type out view for the most part and then
let's see if we can import it like that
yeah just hover over it after you type
view within your actual class then you
just hit import view delete this here
and then it's pretty much good to go
if not it will just ask you to change
this to on click listener and delete the
view sometimes but hopefully that's good
to go I just want to show you guys that
that's how you get rid of that air for
the most part and now we can say add
unimplemented methods and i just copied
and pasted because i set up basically a
switch that would take in
well I need to change it now taking the
view that's press get the ID and
determine whether is the set wallpaper
button or again the take the picture
button so basically the same kind of
setup we've done already but now what
we're going to do is we're going to
basically get our application to take
picture and return some data so what we
want to do is we're going to kind of use
the same process that we did for our
forgot what we what we made for email
application so we're going to open an
intent and we're going to set that
intent equal to basically the camera app
application so we're going to say we're
going to define our intent up above our
classes so we can use it in multiple
methods it's going to say intent I so
we're going to call this intent and then
within the take picture switch in case
it you guys will set up just hit dot I
dot I'm sorry I equals new intent just
like we've always done
and basically the camera application is
in our manifest we don't see it but it
has an action name so we're going to
refer to the action name of the camera
by going Android dot provider dot media
store basically all our media is within
the media store package or class then we
hit dot and we have some choices we can
either get a camera capture I'm sorry a
image capture or video capture for
action so we're going to use image
capture because we're going to take a
picture and then try and get that data
back so now what we need to do is
basically start our intent so we're
going to say start activity
but we want it to return some about some
data to us for the most part we want to
get the picture that was taken so and
say instead of just saying start
activity we're going to say start
activity for result and this is an
actual method I didn't make this one up
kind of looks like some time make up but
we're going to start an activity for a
result and then within the brackets what
we're going to do is we're going to set
up our intent and then we're going to
hit a comma and basically set up a
variable that we're going to collect
that's going to collect the data and
it's going to be an integer type
variable so we're going to say camera
data is what we're going to call this
variable and we're going to set this up
since we don't have a variable yet
called camera data we're going to again
set this up above our classes so we're
going to say int for integer and camera
data and we're actually going to set
this equal to zero and you guys also
need to say final static which will
basically mean it's going to stay I mean
don't worry about that again that's for
Java for the moment but basically we set
up an integer variable that's equal to
zero and then we're going to start an
activity for the result and pass in an
intent which we'll be opening our camera
app activity and then we're going to get
some data back from the most part I'll
show you guys how to get that data back
in the next tutorial hope you guys watch
and enjoy so have a good one and see you
then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
