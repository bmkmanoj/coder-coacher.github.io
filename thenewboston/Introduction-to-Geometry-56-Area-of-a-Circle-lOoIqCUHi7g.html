circumference of a circle we're gonna
work on the unbinding the area of a
circle so we have a circle right here
with with radius R the area of a circle
is equal to PI R squared so this is when
if you're given the diameter you have to
use the fact that the diameter equals to
R to find what R is you would divide the
diameter by half to find out what art is
so now let's do some examples so area
equals PI R squared so 12 squared is a
hundred and forty for a hundred and
forty four PI centimeters squared we're
just gonna give the exact value for
these ones because it's more precise and
as a mathematician you always want to
make your answer as precise as possible
so area is equal to PI R squared area is
equal 6 squared is 36 36 PI centimeters
squared okay
find the area not just of this not just
of this we want the area of all of this
so first we're gonna find the area of
this square right here so if you
remember the area of this square is
equal to side squared and we know it's
square because these two are congruent
they have four but for right angles and
two pairs of parallel sides
so a is equal to 16 now in order to find
this I need to know what the radius of
this circle equals well the if you look
the length of this side right here of
the square has to be 4 and that side of
that square corresponds to the diameter
of this semicircle so our diameter is
equal to 4 so in order to find the
radius I'm going to divide in order to
find my radius I'm going to use this
formula and take half of the diameter so
1/2 of 4 is equal to R so R is equal to
do so in order to find the area of this
semicircle I'm going to take area is
equal to PI R squared but wait it's a
semicircle not an entire circle so we're
also going to multiply this by 1/2 to
get just this part if I was to multiply
if I was just to do PI R squared it
would give me the area of this circle
this whole thing but I've already
counted that area in my square so a is
equal to 2 squared is 4 times 1/2 times
pi so 4 times 1/2 is 2 so 2 pi so our
area of this part is 2 pi so I don't
want to use the approximation for this
so for my final answer I'm just gonna
write area is equal to 16 plus 2 pi and
if they had given us units of inches
we'd say inches squared well that's all
we're doing with area of a circle but
make sure you come back because we're
gonna start talking about surface area
of rectangular prisms and other
three-dimensional shapes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
