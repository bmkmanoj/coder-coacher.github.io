Jeff tutorial and this story I'm going
to be talking to you guys about
something called a conditional operator
now what conditional operators are is
pretty much another way of using an
if-else statement but it's really
compact and it's really small so go
ahead and create a variable called age
and set it equal to 21 or set it equal
to what everyone it's not going to
matter what a conditional operator is is
let me just show you make a simple print
statement system out print line and in
this print line this um operator is so
small that we can write the entire thing
as an argument and what it is is this
the first thing you need to do is give a
test so if age is greater than 50 after
you give it a test you add a question
mark and what this means is treat this
as a boolean expression so it's going to
see if age is greater than 50 is it well
now you have to give it two options if
this is true you're going to give it
it's going to execute the first option
if it's false it's going to execute the
second option so since this is already
in a print statement all we have to do
is add strings of text so if it's
greater than 50 put you are old and how
you separate the true from the false you
add a colon not semi colon that's a
regular colon and if it's false let's
put you are young so let me go ahead and
run this and let me show you guys what
it does it says you are young in the run
box and let me show you guys why this is
don't mind any of this that's not what
we're learning today what it does is we
asked it a simple question is age
greater than 50 well you only have two
choices yes or no so then after you do
this after the question mark you need to
give it what happens if this is true
if H is greater than 50 and this is true
we want you to do this if it's false
then and it's less than 50 then we want
you to do this
so again ask a question this is going to
come true or false if it's true do this
if it's false do this in that order
and don't forget this question mark and
also the colon right here and remember
it isn't a semicolon so that's your real
quick tutorial on how to use a
conditional operator and again this is
um sometimes can be substituted for
if-else statement but I'm usually going
to be writing just basic if-else
statements I just wanted to show you
guys in case you come across this you
actually know what it is in aren't loss
so that's it for this tutorial thank you
guys for watching make sure to check out
my next tutorial and make sure to
subscribe to my channel so again thank
you guys and I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
