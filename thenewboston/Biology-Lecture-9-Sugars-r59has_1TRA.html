biology tutorial and in this tutorial I
want to talk to you guys about sugars
sugars pretty cool right tastes pretty
good but now we have to learn about it
scientifically so an example of some
sugars would be like glucose um what did
I tell you guys about already I think I
talked about sucrose sooo candies Billy
sucrose fructose which is fruit sugar
and if you see a little pattern forming
then you are correct
basically oh s--- oh oh s--- anything
that ends in os-- is indeed a sugar now
sugars are a special type of
carbohydrate in a property that they
have is that they dissolve in water and
another cool thing is that they usually
taste sweet and they form crystals and
um just to show you guys the chemical
formula of this glucose would be a
carbohydrate with a chemical formula
probably showing two wrote that OSE go
ahead and get rid of that glucose has
the chemical formula of c6 h-12 o-6 and
interestingly enough fructose also has
the chemical formula of c6 h-12 o-6 now
the reason that you know glucose and
fructose aren't the exact same things is
that even though they have the same
atoms in each one of them they're bonded
together differently so that's why they
have different names and sucrose believe
it or not like I said in the last
tutorial is glucose combined with
fructose however it has a chemical
formula of C let me write this in a
different color be easier to see c12 h22
o11 now you're saying okay if you're
saying that glucose whenever you combine
it with fructose makes sucrose then why
isn't it c c 12 h 24 o 12 since that
would give you the ratio of 1 to 1 what
you said was needed to become a
carbohydrate and if you listen I said
carbohydrates usually have a ratio of 1
to 1 but because of the way
glucose and fructose bond together to
make sucrose it gives you a really weird
ratio and actually I want to talk to you
guys about that process of two
monosaccharides coming together and
that's a process code dehydration
synthesis now if you break this word
apart you can see that dehydration
what's that mean well dehydration means
a removal of water and synthesis
whenever someone says the synthesizing
something it pretty much means makes
something so pretty much if you look at
dehydration synthesis it means that when
monosaccharides joined together
it involves the two molecules bonding
and therefore losing a water molecule so
in glucose which is si and fructose
which is the same thing 12:06 come
together this is what happens through a
process of dehydration synthesis they
form
remember I said sucrose which is table
sugar which is c12 h22 o11 and this
process is called dehydration synthesis
so I know I got a lot of stuff written
down but one last time let me go ahead
and give you give it to you guys in a
simple you know kind of fashion
dehydration synthesis is when
monosaccharides this one and this one
join together and involves the two
molecules bonding and through the
process it loses a water molecule so
that's why the formula appears a little
bit weird and the opposite of this is
hydrolysis and let me go ahead and get a
new slide now hydrolysis would be
something like c12 h22 o11 which
remember is our disaccharide called
sucrose now whenever this would break
apart which is the opposite of
dehydration synthesis this process would
be called hi
Drossos and of course this would break
apart into c6h12o6 c6h12o6 so basically
one last time well I might as well go
ahead and go over everything real quick
all right so to recap one last time and
I'll explain it in a way that's going to
remain in your brain sugars are a
special type of carbohydrates that
dissolve in water and they usually end
in O s II like glucose sucrose fructose
that way if you ever read the back of
the label and it says something with O's
you know that you're about to buy
something with a sugar in it the sugars
also as you know taste sweet and they
form crystals so that's all we need to
know about sugars now dehydration
synthesis is basically the process of
when monosaccharides like glucose and
fructose they join together and whenever
the molecules bond they lose a water
molecule so that's why it's called
dehydration which means removal of water
synthesis which means making something
so dehydration synthesis whenever you
make something and take away water in
the process and the opposite of that is
called hydrolysis and that's s is okay
so hydrolysis is basically whenever you
have um well it doesn't always have to
be like this but in this instance
whenever you have sucrose and you break
it apart and then what happens is you
break down the sugars into their
original mono saccharides which is
glucose and fructose so there is your
kind of definition of what everything is
um now I hope you have a little better
understanding of sugars and also I
wanted to tell you guys about
dehydration synthesis and also how
hydrolysis because I'm going to be using
that terminology and the upcoming videos
and I didn't want to get you guys
confused so I think guys for watching
I'm gonna subscribe and I'll see you
guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
