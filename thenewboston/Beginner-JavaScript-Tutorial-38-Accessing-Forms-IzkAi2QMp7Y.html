welcome to your 38th JavaScript tutorial
and in this story I'm going to begin
talking about JavaScript and forms now
one of the reasons why JavaScript is so
popular today in web design is because
it has this built-in ability to work
perfectly with forms especially when I
talk about verifying data for example if
you had a form on your website and you
wanted the user to enter email well you
don't want just them to put in like tuna
fish or you know a bunch of numbers you
want an actual email with a @ sign and
the dot for like com so you want to be
able to verify this data and that's
where Java Script comes in handy so
again sometimes people learn JavaScript
only for form validation so that shows
you how big a part of JavaScript and
forms go together so if you're ever
reading a JavaScript book they devote
entire chapters to Java scripts in forms
so enough of me talking let me just show
you guys a quick example so in order to
start I basically want to tell you this
whenever you add a I'm not talking about
JavaScript now just basic XHTML whenever
you add a form to your web page in
JavaScript it creates a form object
automatically you don't have to you know
go through var X um new form equals UI
yada yada yada JavaScript automatically
creates a form object and all we need to
do is learn how to access the
information in that form so what I'm
going to be doing in this story is
creating a basic form using XHTML and
then we're just going to be you know
accessing it and I don't know maybe
print out a property or something so
let's go ahead and make a basic form in
XHTML since this is in JavaScript
make sure it's outside your script tags
this is just basic XHTML HTML whatever
you want to call it so form form and
let's go ahead and add three elements
user name
and this is just an input and again if
you don't know what I'm doing right here
go and watch my XHTML tutorials and I'll
tell you guys all about it so anyways
I'm just going to make a simple text
Bach text box first and then I'm going
to make you know to be honest you don't
have to copy my form exactly just go
ahead and make any form you want with
some elements in it I just want
something to work with on screen so make
another password box and then go ahead
and make a submit button so input type
equals submit value equals submit so now
if we go ahead and print this out we
should have a basic form with your
username a password and a submit button
so we have a website with a basic plain
old form on it easy enough so in this
soil like I said I just want to show you
guys how to access this form in you know
JavaScript language so before I start
typing let me tell you guys this
javascript has a very unique way of
identifying forms on your web page it
identifies them first of all it puts
them all into a form array so if you had
a website with eight different forms in
it it would have eight different
elements in that form away right and
again like I said you don't need to
create this explicitly whenever you have
forms on your web page javascript sees
that and creates your array for you
automatically so if you're saying
alright we know that it automatically
created an array object already and it
created that form array but how do I
access this form right here well just
like anything else interests
JavaScript numbers each object in your
array so the first form say you had like
three different forms on your webpage
the first form would be form 0 array
index 0 the second form would be form 1
the third form would be formed two so as
you can see the more forms you have on
your web page
um the more elements in the array and
that's how you access them so again
since we only have one form and
basically I'm going to be working with
one form in these examples we're going
to access that using forms 0 since
remember 0 and arrays are the first
element in the array so let's go ahead
and on one of the properties and forms
this forms object is length in the
length of a form is basically how many
items do you have in it well we have one
input right here one input box another
input box right here and a button right
here so this form has three elements in
it so if we were to print out the length
of this form it would be three so let's
go ahead and show you guys how to do
that just go ahead and we'll set equal
to the variable X why not and in order
to access the form you write document
dot forms and whatever form you on
access and like I said since this is the
one and only form this is going to be
form 0 if you wanted to access the fifth
form say you had five forms it would be
form 4 because 0 1 2 3 4 the fourth item
in your array or excuse me fourth index
would be 4 &amp;amp; 5 so easy enough this is
form 0 since it's the first one so again
your document which is basically your
webpage has an array object that's built
in already called forms now that forms
array object has a built in property
called length and that length property
like I said is how many elements are in
your form 1 2 3 so now we have the
variable 3 stored in X so now let's just
go ahead and print that out to verify it
document dot write X so now whenever
refresh and load our web page we should
get that form still but under it we
should have a nice pretty little 3 right
here and let me go ahead and take one of
these elements out take this password
out and just refresh it just show you
guys that indeed
it changes to two because now there are
only two elements the input box in the
submit button so that is the basics of
how you access different forms in
JavaScript again the form is part of the
document the document is basically your
webpage body itself
now that body has an object called forms
in its built-in forms array so that's
why how we access that using document
forms now this forms has a property
that's the length so that's why we had
to access that using dot length so again
what you want to take away from the
story is this whenever you have a lot of
different forms on your web page you
need to identify them using your built
in array object and that's called forms
and in order to differentiate between
different forms you need to say what
form you're looking at and each form has
a built in property called length and
that is of course how many elements are
in your form and then what we did is we
just counted the elements and print it
out on screen so now that you know how
to identify your forms and again with
these stories we're going to be working
with form 0 basically all the time we're
never going to have more than one form
and you typically don't but anyways I
just want to go over that so anyways
that's all I'm going to talk to you guys
about for this tutorial it's getting
kind of lengthy but thank you guys for
watching don't forget subscribe and I'll
see you next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
