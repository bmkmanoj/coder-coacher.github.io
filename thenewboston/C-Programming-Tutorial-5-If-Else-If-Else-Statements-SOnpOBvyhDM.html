your fifth see tutorial and in this
tutorial we're going to be going over
the if-else if-else statement now as you
can see in the last tutorial we I
thought you guys how to do a simple test
in if it passed the test or if this test
was true then I executed a block of code
but if it wasn't true or if it was false
it just went on with the rest of the
program but what if we had just more
than one choice just more than the true
or false and we want to let the user
pick a bunch of different options well
we could do a bunch of different if
statements but sometimes that's not that
easy
so in this story I'm going to be
teaching you how to do something called
if-else if-else to give the user a bunch
of different options and they can do one
single test and based on that test they
can have a whole range of options to
choose from so let's go ahead and get
rid of this right here actually get rid
of this variable let's make one variable
called age age and then for our print
statement let's say enter your age let's
say we're making a dating site or
something so here's where the user would
enter their age and in this whatever
they scan whoa press the wrong button
there they're going to enter their age
so we have a variable called age a print
statement says says enter your age and
whatever that number they enter is going
to be stored in the variable age you
should know all this from last time and
so the if statement is exactly just the
if statement we're going to be doing
things a little bit differently so let
me get my here we go so the syntax for
this to start out is basically the same
you type if and then you type your test
so we want if H equals and remember when
we set a variable equal to something we
use one but when we're testing we use
two equal signs so if H is exactly equal
to six
II uh what do we want to xq um there we
go actually knew your curly braces if H
is exactly equal to sixty then we want
to say print F and we want to put easy
Cougar since if this is girl and she
enters her age of sixty then we're going
to output easy Cougar on the screen but
and to give um our program another
option here is the code that you need
else if and else if pretty much means
alright if this is not true or false
we're going to give it another option
and we're going to say else if well what
test do we want to use now if else
um age is exactly equal to forty then
we're going to want to give some
instructions print F um let's say mom
since this is our mom we're talking
about here you move this up so you guys
can see um and again the beauty without
with eltz if you don't only have to give
a one sing option you can put as many
else if statements as you want so let's
say else if arm what do we want to test
so if H is exactly equal to 21
that's perfect I'm 22 so what are we
going to put on print F
call me as we're going to put so you use
the first um condition or the first test
you put it in your if statement and then
your right what piece of code you want
to execute if the age is equal to 60 or
if this is true but if it's not true
this test right here in this tests are
right here are two separate tests you
can use testing the same variable and
the last thing I want to talk you guys
about in the syntax if it runs through
all of these options and these are all
false you don't want to give it one
default thing
so if enters agent is not 60 it's not 40
it's not 21 then we're going to want to
have it do something but what are we
going to want to have to do well the
syntax for this is a little different
instead of else if you just use a basic
else statement and thus intense ence
you're not testing for anything it's
just going to be if all of these fail
then this is going to execute so you
don't really need a test all you need is
are really a set of instructions
um else let's say print F let's say if
they're younger than all that or they
don't enter any of those let's say
jailbait jailbait alright so again let
me run this program in let me show you
guys what this does and then I'll talk
you through it one more time hopefully I
didn't forget any semicolons or anything
like that it doesn't look like a any our
age so the percent enter sixty press
enter easy cougar and that's because the
age was exactly equal to sixty so it
printed easy cougar and let me run this
one more time and show you guys what
does if none of these values are entered
so enter age arms well let's put fifteen
jailbait so again what that did right
there is it took the age that we entered
it says alright is your age sixty nope
so I'm not going to do this LS is your
age forty nope
so I'm not going
do that are you 21 I wish but nope so
you're not going to do that or if you
entered any other value I'm going to
print jailbait so that is how you work
with if-else if-else statement to test a
single variable and give it multiple
options I'm going to copy all this code
to my website the new Boston comm so if
you want it you just go to my website
the new Boston comm and I'll have it for
you for free on there so again thank you
guys for watching make sure to subscribe
to my channel and make sure to check out
my next tutorial and I don't know what
we're going to be going over but it's
going to be awesome
so again thank you guys and I'll see you
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
