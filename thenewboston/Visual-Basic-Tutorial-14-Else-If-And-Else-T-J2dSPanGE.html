slash on live gamer for the new Boston
and this tutorial we're going to be
covering the else if and else statement
so the last tutorial we covered the if
statement now let's go ahead and get
started we're going to start off by
using console dot write line and we'll
just type what is your name and now
we're going to create a variable called
username and we're going to store the
information that the user types in as
user name so we'll declare username so
dim user name as string and we'll set it
equal to console dot read line so now
what we want to do is we want to ask
them for the password so we'll just type
console dot write line what is your
password and will declare the password
so dim password as string as equal to
console dot readline ok so now what we
want to do is we want to create an if
statement to see if they typed in a name
that is in let's say a list of possible
names that can be logged in so if
username equals Sam or if not Sam say
not same same then do something
so if username is equal to Sam then
we'll do console dot write line
welcome Sam now we want to cover any
other cases that could happen now I
could do this with a bunch of if
statements that's not very efficient we
can use what's called an else--if
statement so we just do this by typing
else if username equals Tim so if
username equals Tim then we want to do
something so we'll just type console dot
write line welcome Tim
so basically basically what we've done
is if username is equal to Sam then go
ahead and say welcome Sam but if
username is equal to Tim then say
welcome Tim and this is all in one if
statement by using else if in case
somebody else tries to login and we
don't know who they are we're just going
to tell them that they have typed in an
invalid name now to do this we're going
to type else so else they can go ahead
and do the code that is inside in
between else and then div so what else
does is it covers anything else that you
did not cover so if username equals Sam
they're just going to go ahead and do
this but else say if username equals Tim
it'll do this and if username equals
anything else other than Sam or Tim then
go ahead and do whatever we type inside
here so we'll just type console dot
write line you are not a valid user and
then after our end if we'll just do
console dot read line so that so that
the user has time to see if they've been
accepted or see if they type in the
right name so if we do what is your name
and I type in Sam you'll say what is
your password I'll just type in the New
Boston it'll say welcome Sam and then it
won't say anything else after that
because we haven't added anything that
will handle the password so now if we
run that again it'll say what is your
name I'll type in Tim or let's see
this is case-sensitive so Tim and say
what is your password type in a bunch of
stuff right there it says welcome Tim
now if we type in anything else other
than Sam or Tim it's going to say you
are not a valid user so we can do the
same thing with our password so if
password equals the new Boston
then go ahead and let the user know that
they have been granted access so we'll
just type console dot write line and
we'll say congrats and then we'll just
add their username so congrats username
and then we'll say you have been granted
access
now this isn't very secure but it's just
for the sake of this tutorial let's say
instead of you are not a valid user
let's just say I don't know who you are
so that way the person doesn't have to
have the right username but if they have
the let's say the administrator password
then they can go ahead and login so I
don't know who you are so if we go ahead
and run this say what is your name let's
just say Sam what is your password type
the New Boston it'll say welcome Sam
congratulations Sam you have been
granted access now what we need to do is
add a space right here so that Sam isn't
right next to that so now if we type an
invalid username it'll say let's just do
this and if we type in the New Boston
you see that will get the output I don't
know who you are and I'll say congrats a
da FA you have been granted access so go
ahead and practice some else if
statements and some else statements get
familiar with that and then once you
have that nailed down go ahead and move
on to the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
