exciting After Effects tutorial this is
buddy Blackford we're working with cs6
and this is for the new Boston and this
time we're going to be talking a little
bit about editing keyframes and I'll
give you some tips and pointers and
things to look out for well the first
thing I want to remind everybody that
the keyframes are down here you know
which keyframe you have selected you can
select it with the selection tool it'll
be yellow if you click in the area the
gray area and drag and create a like a
box you can select multiple and click
drag and then hold shift to click
opposite ones and that way that way when
you click on them you can skip ones in
the middle so if you oops if you click
on this keyframe and then click on this
keyframe you don't have to have the
middle one selected and then you can do
something like move these see alright
another technique that I like select all
the keyframes and if you grab the last
one and hold shift excuse me it's not
shift it is alt sorry it is alt it will
drag out the keyframes and keep the
spacing in between them that's really
really handy when you're when you think
you got like good spacing but it's a
little too slow go like move it in and
it will speed it up to preview your
keyframe our to preview your animation
you can hit spacebar and you can tell if
it's in real time by looking up here in
the info panel it'll say real time
sometimes your animation will hat will
be a little effect intensive or
something like that
and it won't render in real time so if
that ever happens then you go over here
to the preview section here and then you
click on this Ram preview button and
then that will it will render out a
section and then preview it in real time
for you and the amount that you can
render out in preview depends on how
much RAM you have so the more RAM the
more you can more you can render on
there more you can see your animation
sometimes it'll stop in the middle and
keep rendering so you get my point
another quick tip here is using this
workspace tool right here alright with
the workspace slider right here if you
drag it you can extend where you'll be
previewing to so well maybe I only want
to render these two keyframes right here
so click on the RAM preview button again
now it's only going to render to that
area it's good if you don't want to wait
forever to see the whole animation maybe
you just want to see a little bit of it
so click on that Ram preview again to
stop it now you can move this here and
move it out a little I like to always
leave a little bit at the end because
you can see your animation smoothly
without snapping back real quick I'll
show you what I'm talking about let me
drag these keyframes out a little bit
and then I'll put this right here at the
end
let's bring a preview it you can see how
you can't really see the end very well
and it snaps back so sometimes you can't
get a good feel for your animation
especially when it's fast something to
watch out for when you're editing
keyframes now if you remember I told you
that you could edit the points so some
sometimes you may select a point here
and go to edit it but you realize oh
crap it added another point and you
didn't want that when you scrub on the
on the sliders here in the position
panel and the position twirl down menu
it's going to put a keyframe where you
have your current time indicator so you
see that I have my current time
indicator right here so it made a
keyframe there now to delete a keyframe
just click on it and hit delete on your
keyboard and use your shift button to
snap there you go and now you can move
that keyframe you don't even have to
have it selected</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
