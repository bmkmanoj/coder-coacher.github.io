another PI game tutorial video in this
video early doing is talking about how
we can move our tank so we have
currently we haven't hard-coded anything
we've got all these variables basically
and now we want to do is allow ourselves
to move our tank so we have to in order
to modify these these values we could
use global but it's also just makes a
whole lot of sense to take main tank X
main tank Y and move those into our game
loops so I'm just like cut those there
and we're gonna come down to the game
loop eventually
there we go and paste them right in
there main tank X main tank Y all so
we're gonna have a new variable and
that's gonna be tank moves gonna be a
lot of like the previous variable where
we moved our snake basically so now what
we need to do is whenever we move like
basically this is the wild game over
equals true we're not doing that this is
the actual game loop so remember we've
just like threw in all these paths
instead of passing now we want to do is
if the left key is pressed then we want
to do tank move equals negative five and
then if the right key is pressed tank
move equals what up and down we'll just
leave for now and then finally this is
our tank function so under here right
before we call the tank function we're
just gonna say main tank X plus equals
the tank move and that should be it as
far as moving our tank around is
concerned so
screen here play uh-oh there there you
that's why I clicked it and now we're
able to move our tank around and you can
see we'd have up functionality
apparently or anything else right
I can't believe I can't stop the tank
for moving we do have clock tick update
quick do we
it's weird that it wouldn't change
because of the key Danny left to keep
right
but we still want to have she's curious
why our tank continued to move even
though we're hitting the other key okay
here we go we've got a typo amateur okay
so let's try that one more time my team
okay cool
so now our tank moves but if you recall
when we built our snake game we wanted
the snake to always move not just when
the person was pressing keys but
basically the keys would just change the
direction it wouldn't actually be moving
anything so in this game we might only
just want to move our tank slightly
because we're gonna be like shooting
orcs basically and so if you're playing
somebody they might move a little bit
and you might move a little bit because
if you stay in the same place and they
miss a little bit they're just gonna
make a tiny adjustment til they finally
hit you so you're gonna want to move
around every now and then so you're
gonna be able to stop them cuz we're not
currently able to stop so what we're
gonna be doing the next video is talking
about how we can program in stopping so
if you recall we actually already did
this with our snake game and I challenge
you to try to do it before we actually
get to the video but if you can't figure
it out I'm gonna be showing you guys how
to do that in the next video so anyways
that's it for this after that we're
gonna move the turret and then probably
after that we'll talk about firing the
turret and then as well as since our
game is only so big we'll probably add
like a barrier or something to shoot
over something like that otherwise
everyone's just gonna aim straight and
shoot at the other guy so anyway that's
it for this video stay tuned to the next
video as always thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
