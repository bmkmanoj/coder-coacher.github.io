slash on live gamer for the new Boston
and in this tutorial we're going to be
taking a look at using multiple forms so
sometimes in your program you want to be
able to have a whole bunch of different
forms open and you don't want to be
restricted to only using message boxes
or only using input boxes so what we're
going to learn about in this tutorial is
using multiple forms and creating
objects to this form so we'll go ahead
and create a new project we will select
windows forms application and we will
call it multiple forms and we'll go
ahead and click OK
and we'll just wait for that to load
okay so now let's resize our form some
and we'll come over here to our tool box
and we will add a button so we'll just
make this button a little bit bigger and
then we'll add a text box so text box
right there and we'll add a label right
above that text box and here let's
switch places
and we will just set the text of that
label to name so we'll come down here
and we'll set it to name and now let's
set the textbox name to text new form
name and we'll set the name of button
one to button new form and we'll go
ahead and shrink that down a bit
and we will set the text to show new
form okay so now what we're going to do
is we are going to open up the code for
our form 1 and we'll just go ahead and
set the title of the form 1
so let's come back here and we'll set
the text to form number 1 okay so now
what we're going to do is we're going to
access the click event for button show
new form and now what we need to do is
we need to create a new form object that
we can show so what we're going to do is
we'll type declare a new form as new
form 1 so it's going to create a new
form 1 object which is going to be an
exact copy of our form number 1 and
we'll come up here and create a private
variable so private form number as
integer you'll go ahead and set that
equal to 0 to begin with okay so now
that we've declared our new form object
let's go ahead and set the form number
so new form dot form number equals 2
let's go ahead and set this one equal to
1
okay so now that we've set our new form
we're going to go ahead and type new
form dot show dialog so what this is
going to do is going to pop up our new
form and it's going to let us use it now
what we need to do on under form one so
we'll come up here to form one load and
we will type me dot text equals and then
it'll type form number and let's just
add a colon right here and then we will
add the form number and form number so
what this does is it uses the me keyword
which me refers to form one and the text
of form one is this right here you can
see that in our properties we have
properties for form one and the text is
set to form number one and we're just
going to set it to form number and form
number so now let's go ahead and run
this and if we click show new form we
get form number two and we can show as
many of these forms as we want and you
can see that it will not let us go back
to the first form while form number two
is open because it's we use the show
dialogue method which makes it to where
it will only let us use that until it
close out of it now we need to do is we
need to get the name that is typed in
right here so let's come down here and
it will type new name as string and we
will set it equal to text or text new
form name dot text and let's go ahead
and create another variable so private
name as string and we'll set it equal to
nothing to begin with now we need to set
the name of our form one or about new
form so new form name equals
new name and let's go ahead and add that
up here so we'll say name and then we
will add the name variable
and we'll just go ahead and set this to
default instead of nothing so that the
compiler will quit warning us okay let's
go ahead and set this to form name
because the the error wasn't with the
Declaration and setting the value of it
was with the actual name because it
conflicts with the name that's already
in Visual Basic so we'll add this one to
form name and let's go ahead and run
this and you can see that if we type my
new form and we click show new form we
get form number two and name is default
so let's go ahead and see what we did
wrong
ah here it is we need to change that to
form name and not name so we'll go ahead
and run this again
type hello form - we click show new form
and you can see that we get for number
two
and hello form two</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
