your checkers and moving them off the
board and remember first person get all
their checkers off the board is the
winner now here are the rules
you can only begin removing your
checkers when all of your checkers are
in your first quadrant or your home
board if there is a checker out here and
there is a checker out here then you can
bear off if there is only one checker
outside then you can't fare off they all
need to be in your home board just like
that never saying all right
so how exactly do I bear up well
whenever all the checkers are in your
home board go ahead and roll and for
example you got a 6 and a 4 so that
means 1 2 3 4 you can take one off your
for point and one off your six point so
then I'll go ahead and play right now
and remember I can't bear off because I
got checkers outside of my home board so
well I'm going to try to do is 1 2 + 2 4
6 I'm going to go ahead and try to get
all my checkers to the home board so I
can start bearing up so now let's go
ahead and here's what you would roll a 4
and a 6 so again you can move one off
your six point and one off your four
point and you continue to do this until
you have no checkers left but here are a
couple little rules that you might want
to know alright so say you have a setup
like this in you have point and you have
checkers on your one through five point
but not on your six point if you go
ahead in your roll of six then what you
would do is since there's nothing on
your six point you can just move it off
the highest point so just like that and
for example if you rolled a 5 like this
and you don't have anything on your 5
point you can just remove it from the 3
point but you can't say you can't do
this if you rolled a 2 you can't move it
you can't like just remove it from any
point you want it has to be higher you
see where I'm coming from so here's what
would happen if you roll like a 2 and a
1 in this instance well you see you
can't remove
94 won and you can't remove any from two
so what you would need to do is you
would need to use your won by like say
move this one and you would need to use
your two by saying one two so if you can
play then you can just play like you're
playing normal but if not then you can
remove them so pretty much if there's
something on your point remove it if
there's nothing on your point then you
can eat you either have to play it or
remove the highest one under it simple
enough so that is the basics of bearing
off on hitting and re-entering uh let's
see I think that's really all we have to
cover so I can't think of anything at
the moment that I left out so in the
next story what I'm going to be doing is
covering some basic strategy that all
beginners must learn first so now that
we got all the rules of the game done we
can begin learning what our smart plays
would are really dumb plays and we can
now know maybe learn some more about
hitting our opponent donkey punching
them so anyways thank you guys for
watching don't forget to subscribe and
I'll see you guys next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
