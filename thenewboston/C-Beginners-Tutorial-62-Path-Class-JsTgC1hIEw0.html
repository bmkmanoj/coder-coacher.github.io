c-sharp tutorial that I'm making for the
new Boston and in this tutorial I'm
gonna be showing you how to use the path
class so all you're going to need for
this tutorial is a button and a few
lines of code so once you have the
button on your forum just go ahead and
double click on it you're going to need
to have an open file dialog and an if
statement checking to see if the user
actually open the file in the Open File
dialog you're going to need to be using
these systems il namespace because a
path class is located in there so the
first step in using the path class is
just simply find another path then just
use a dot operator to access all the
methods the first method that we're
going to be looking at in this tutorial
we they get directory name they get
direct your name will basically just
return the path to the folder that the
file is in and you want to do that for
the file that is open the file dialog so
we're just going to do ofd for the name
of our Open File dialog and then do dot
file and then we want to use a message
box to display um the path to the folder
that file is in so that we can see it so
now we're just going to debug here and
navigate to a file I'm going to use this
text document and since this text
document is inside of this test folder
right here should get the path to this
test folder inside of our message box
yep the next method that I'm going to be
showing you is the extension name and
the get extension will basically just
return the extension of the file that we
open so bug here and open the file we
should get dot txt and a message box
because that is the extension of this
file the next method I'm going to be
showing you is the gift file name and
the get file name will basically return
safe file name of the file or just this
it just return text document three dot
txt not the path to the file
protects document read text the next
method I'm going to show you is how to
get the file name without the extension
so we'll just get text document 3 in a
message box this dot text will not be
included the MPs have text document
without the extension another method
that I'm going to be showing you is get
full path and I think this is a much
like useless method because you could
have just use the path that you return
or the pass through here but no so yeah
but we could do the same thing just by
showing the Open File dialog name so not
too sure what that Matins for but I
guess it works for some people
and the last methods I'm going to be
showing you in the path class is the has
extension method and this method will
basically return a bool value to see if
the file actually have an extension or
not and you want to check or whatever
file to be open in the open file dialog
and again since this returns a bool
we're going to have to leave the dot to
sharing operator so that we can display
the result in message box and since this
file does have an extension which you
get true yep and obviously if you were
to open a file that did not have an
extension we'd get false so that's
pretty much it for this tutorial
on the path class I know I didn't really
explain a whole lot of things but
everything seems pretty self-explanatory
and the main purpose of this tutorial
was just to show you that this path
class actually lists and it can save you
a lot of trouble of having to go do and
create your own methods to just give the
safe file name or get the extension or
something like that
so see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
