After Effects cs6 tutorial
I'm your host buddy Blackford and I
wanted to talk to you a little bit about
the flow chart view and After Effects
cs6 so what I'm talking about here is
when you come into your composition
there's this button right here called
the composition flow chart and I'm
showing this to you now because when we
have a couple extra pre comps and
everything like that in our section or
in our within our main comp I can show
it to you a little bit better so if you
click on that it'll bring you to the
composition flow chart here now I admit
that the composition flow chart is
pretty much a mess and I don't use it
that often you can see your different
layers and how they are related to other
layers so we've got our teardrop a file
here which was our illustrator file and
I was able to create a few file are a
few layers from that illustrator file
called black right black left and brown
drop and there's also our text here and
all that is compiled within this pre
comp I made called
original logo as you can see here when I
go back to the flow chart actually now
we can close these within our flow chart
here to make it a little bit nicer
looking but then everything goes to crap
and gets all messy again we have a few
options that we can help to clean this
up and they're located down here we've
got show footage show solids and show
layers now if we uncheck some of these
we can get rid of some of the nonsense
if you think it's nonsense to like
lessen up what's going on now we've got
all these layers here which are pretty
much the same thing as what we have but
they're just the number of the layer
so we've got our back our background
here which was that picture and then it
has the layer name right after it so in
case like I wanted to change the layer
name of this to sunny VG now it has the
background name or the background
original image name and then the layer
name so now it's called sunny BG so we
can turn those off if we don't need them
and it actually helps clear up a lot so
now we can open these up and now we
don't have to see our layers anymore and
one thing that it does do though however
is get over it of like shape layer names
and everything like that so I mean it's
got its advantages and disadvantages
there I'm going to turn them back on
and we got our shape layers here now we
can see our layers of lights and our
camera layer when we turn those off we
cannot see them so we can hide things
like this we've got our arrows showing
the different flow that goes into this
and we can change the flow that we have
here by clicking on this area arrow and
changing the flow direction so we can go
bottom to the top we can go left to
right and you see sometimes when you do
this they overlap each other it's really
kind of weird you can't zoom out which
is kind of annoying - you have to like
you you have to zoom around
we can change it from we can just change
all different ways there then we've got
our straight and curved lines going on
here and if this is too a little
confusing for you we can change it to
straight lines and it'll be a lot more
nicer looking and our and our lines will
be a little bit nicer looking and more
straightforward I guess so we got those
and then you can obviously move things
around by clicking on them and dragging
on them and organizing them the way you
want I've had a client before tell me
that he wanted the composition flowchart
nice and neat so I had to come in here
one time and arrange everything so it
looked nice within the composition flow
chart so the person that was using this
next can use it also so it's just good
to know in case you ever have to come in
here and use the composition flow chart
now if you click on a layer and if you
click on a layer and press f3 it'll
expose yeah it's supposed to bring up
the effect and where it is for you in
cs6 you can just click on the layer and
I'll bring up the effect in the effects
controls panel now also if you right
click in an open space you get all these
different options here we got cleanup
which brings everything into a
nice-looking section or a nice-looking
area there so use cleanup when you
really need to we got our different we
can show our effects that that are on
layers so we can see our fast blur fill
and this makes it a lot more usable and
then we've got our different justifies
here so if we go to justify Center
everything will be like pretty decently
cleaned up and everything like that so
this is just pretty much for someone to
come in and look to see how your
logos I mean how your pre comps and
everything are all set up and how they
interact with each other and what's in
what really quick and I would only mess
with this if you're actually asked to do
it and pretty much just and you don't
really need to worry about it too much
so that's all I'm going to talk about
for this and I thanks for watching this
one and just I don't know not much to
say about the comp flowchart it's not
it's not super awesome and it's not
super crappy so I mean just use it too
if you need it
so thanks for watching the ones this one
and I'll see you guys in the next
