to talk to you about mix-ins now mix-ins
are a way to include in other word mix
in a bunch of properties from one rule
to another and I'm not just making this
name up that's actually what they're
called it sounds like I just made a
corny joke but this is you know a real
thing so when what do we want to mix in
a bunch of properties from one thing
into another well say that we're making
these panels all across our website
maybe there are these little sections
for like announcements maybe we were
using them for like in notifications
whatever now they're all going to look
pretty similar but a little bit
different for example we wanted big
panels little panels but they have the
same basic styling well what we could do
is we can make that basic styling and
just mix it in to every other panel
don't want to talk him out we'll check
it out so first make all of your generic
CSS that you want to write and I'm just
going to name it panel so every panel
that we make whether it's big little
medium it's all going to have this
styling and let me just add something
really stupid like we're a three pixel
solid Dodger blue and uh let me give a
background of like a light green I'm not
trying to make this look you know gray I
just want to you know have a couple
properties in there so you can see
what's going on and 10 pixels whatever
you want to do add whatever properties
you want alright so a generic panel
always has this border and this
background well what we can do now is we
can make something like a little panel
so with a little panel what we want to
do is we want to include all of these
properties plus maybe we want to you
know make the font size a little bit
smaller and add some padding well
instead of just taking this and copying
it and pasting it in here then adding
whatever other ones we want what we can
do is we can actually just include all
the properties like this so whenever les
sees this syntax it says okay what I'm
going to do is go up to panel grab all
of them and plop them in so it
essentially does the same thing as
copying and pasting it just does a whole
lot nicer than
you would have so now we can just do
something like font size and Ted to
equal 12 pixels and then I'll set
padding equal to 5 pixels let me copy
this and make the same thing for a big
panel so change this big of course for a
big panel I still want to inherit from
panel which is our basic coloring and
styling but I'll make this one a little
bit bigger I change the font size to 32
and padding to like 20 since this is a
big one so now this is our basic styling
and look how easy it was to include
right here now over in main CSS look
what happened exactly like I said but it
did it all in a blink of an eye and then
if we ever have to update thing anything
for example maybe we want to change this
border to 4 boom how easy was that it's
updated at all for you so now let me
actually show you guys what this looks
like
and what am I going to upper like a
little panel and of course the class for
this was little panel
big panel and class is big panel so
let's see how this looks so check that
out we got the same basic styling but
with using mix-ins we can take a little
bit of code a little section of
properties and easily include it in
every other rule that we want to add it
to pretty awesome that's mix-ins for you
hope you enjoy see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
