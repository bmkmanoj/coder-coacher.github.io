and in this tutorial series i am going
to be teaching you about Wireshark now
Wireshark is an awesome tool and it's
completely free and if you guys are
interested in networking or networking
security at all
then this is a tool that you're going to
need to know so basically what it is is
it's a program that lets you view and
analyze the traffic over your network so
let's say that I don't know maybe you
had some kids and you wanted to make
sure they weren't going to any weird
sites or doing anything bad online well
what you could do is you could actually
look at the traffic and then when
they're sitting in the room you can
actually see what sites are going to or
maybe you are let's say a network
administrator or a systems administrator
for a company or a bank well what you
could do is you can monitor all the
traffic on your network and make sure
that no one's trying to hack it or break
in or do anything that they shouldn't be
doing so basically like I said it's
going to allow you to view and also
analyze and it's not only good for you
know just monitoring but you can also
find bottlenecks look at system
performance see where things are going
slow and try to fix them improve them so
yeah there's a little introduction let's
go ahead and get started so in order to
download it what you need to do is you
need to go to Wireshark org now I'm
going to be showing you guys how to
install it and I'm on a Windows 7
machine right now but this program is
the exact same no matter your whether
you're running it on Mac or Linux once
you get installed and up and running
then the interface is the same and like
I said it runs on every platform so no
matter what you are using go ahead and
click the download button and it's not
an automatically going to detect what
operating system you have so for me it
shows Windows installer 64-bit if you
guys want to double-check and make sure
that it shows the right bit version if
you're on Windows then if you click this
button the start button in the bottom
left and you right click computer then
what you can do is you can go to
properties
and you can see for me I am indeed
running a 64-bit operating system so
that way I can install a 64-bit right
here I actually downloaded it before
this video began I thought I'd save you
guys a few seconds so I'm just going to
open this folder go to downloads and run
it now to be completely honest you guys
probably don't even need me for the rest
of this oriole you just click Next Next
Next
but if anything funny happens then you
can troubleshoot that so let me close
out of all this alright so like I said
all this is is a wizard you know you
guys install it stuff before I agree
make sure you read all that now you want
to install all of these components and
I'm going to be talking to you guys
about these different plugins and the
different tools that we can use later on
but for right now just make sure that we
install everything in alright so this is
probably the only part that is going to
be different for anyone and it's where
do you want the icons to be for me
personally I want to have a desktop icon
since we're going to be using this quite
a bit so if there you go choose whatever
icons you want and click Next now keep
it in the default location looking good
now for this thing this actually might
confuse some people so it says do you
want to install wind peak app now I know
a lot of the time whenever you're
installing new software then it tries to
install like toolbars and like you know
just like extra extra crap that you
don't need and a lot of people uncheck
this do not uncheck this WinPcap is the
application that's going to actually
capture the packets or in other words
the traffic over your network and what
your shark is the program where you're
going to be able to view and analyze
them so if you guys are like wait a
minute I thought that wire shark was
going to be capturing this package well
again like I said these programs kind of
work together and in my opinion whatever
you install wire shark shark it should
already come all with wimpy cap it
shouldn't even be an option but I don't
know why they install it uh you know
they make
two different programs I think it's
because you can use other programs with
wind pcap as well but anyways if you're
on Windows make sure you install win
peak app or Wireshark is not going to
work and if you're on Linux or Mac it's
going to be different you don't use
WinPcap that's only for Windows so you
have to see the application I don't know
it off the top of my head but anyways
pretty much just check everything check
all the options and boom let it do its
thing so alright this thing pops up yes
we want to install wind peak app as well
want to be able to capture those packets
and might as well start it up on boot
time dead on to downtown that was easy
now let's continue installing while
you're shark alright mates look at that
completed in just a few seconds not that
big of a program and boom might as well
actually I'm not going to run it right
now I'm just going to finish that and
check it out so if you chose to make a
desktop icon you get this pretty looking
icon right there and whenever you double
click it and it's going to boot up
wireshark now another thing I want to
say the last thing before I start
showing you guys how to use it and what
all of this stuff means is this so
basically what we're going to be doing
is we're going to be looking at the
traffic on our network now if you're
like me there's not a lot of cool stuff
that happens you know just on your own
home network I'm the only one that lives
in my house so you know there's not a
lot of different attacks or I don't have
you know a bunch of different devices
that are going up you know connecting to
my network however if you do want to
look at some you know more interesting
captures or just download some sample
files that other people have then you
can go to this website right here so
wiki dot water shortcut works slash
sample captures so these are pretty much
um this is pretty much traffic from
other people's network so like I said
maybe you want to look at what Bluetooth
traffic looks like or maybe you want to
you know look at what some kind of a
port scan or some kind of attack looks
like well obviously you don't want to go
out and buy a Bluetooth
device or start hacking your own
computer so you can just you know scroll
through these and choose whatever type
of traffic that you want now just so we
can all have a similar project file if
you guys go ahead and download this one
HTTP dot cap this is pretty much the
most simple example is just basically
someone going to a website and
downloading a file so in a lot of the
examples I'll stick with this one of
course I'm going to be showing you guys
live um you know how it works and all
that but go ahead and download this one
and then whenever we need to you know
look at something together then we can
use that file but there you go
now that you have Wireshark installed
and go ahead and install some sample
files start looking through those and
you're ready to move on to the next
tutorial where we are going to finally
figure out how to start using Wireshark</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
