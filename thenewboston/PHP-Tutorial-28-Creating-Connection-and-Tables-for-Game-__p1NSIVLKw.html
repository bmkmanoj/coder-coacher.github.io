tutorial and in this tutorial I'm going
to be connecting to the database to make
the game and also making tables so we
can make our first PHP game now just a
reminder to you guys anytime you guys
want the code that I'm working on if you
guys think you made an error or
something you can use my code as a
template just go to the New Boston comm
scroll down here scroll down until you
find the place that says a PHP right
here
and all of my source code is going to be
right here here's the source code for my
last tutorial it's right there and
another thing make sure you're watching
the videos and a high quality you see
how the text is kind of fuzzy on your
screen now if you watch in high quality
it won't be like that at all so go ahead
and watch in high quality now once we
have all that done and you're watching
the high quality you can go ahead and
what we need to do after our last
tutorial about a form we need to make a
way to connect to the database so you're
going to go ahead and have to create a
new file and you can name it um config
let's go ahead and file save as um con
so that is that PHP write right there
and let's go ahead and connect to the
database and we're going to be we're
going to have to use this file in all of
our other files so um let me just show
you guys what to do first we need to
make a PHP we don't need any HTML code
in this so we're just going to have to
include this and all of our files that
were working on when we need to connect
to a database so just to show you guys
real quick we new variable called host
and this is going to be host name and
inside your
it's going to be localhost and this is
just in case you guys forgot how to make
a data base which I showed you guys in
the last tutorial so make a variable
called host and this is going to be
where your host is 99% of time it's
going to be localhost the next is the
username and this is the username to the
database it's not the username for your
game or anything like that so your
username is going to be the username to
your database and whatever you name it
it's going to go in there the next thing
you want to do is create a variable
called the password for your database
and of course um database password and
it's probably going to be like something
like secret or something like that and
the last variable is your database name
I put DB underscore name and it's going
to be something like I know I spelled
that wrong don't you don't have to
comment my video a hundred times tell me
um Sakura
under score name so these are the four
variables that you need when connecting
to your database now um connect to
database to connect to your database
this is what you need to do my SQL
underscore Connect and this is the part
where you need to get right and in your
empty parameters this is a built-in
function that connects to your dad base
MySQL connect
it takes um let's see three parameters
the first one all we have to do is at
our variable host the first one it
requires the host location of your
database and since this is localhost
we're going to add the variable host so
add a comma the next parameter it takes
is the username to access your database
so let's add the variable username
and the last parameter it needs is the
password to get into your database so
again host username password now that is
going to connect but um let's say if it
can't connect or die arm so if we if it
can't connect we want to have the
message cannot connect to server' was
this shouldn't happen if you typed
everything correctly but maybe if your
server is down or something we just want
a message showing us why we can't
connect now that we connected to the
server we need to select what database
we want to connect you so the built in
function for this is my SQL underscore
select underscore database this selects
what database we want to connect to
since um whenever we're on our server we
might have a bunch of websites with a
bunch of different databases so this
says that we want to use what database
we want to use and for this the
parameter it takes is the database name
so let's go ahead and put a DB name and
if I can't select that database wear it
or die alright if you can't select it we
want you to output come on
select database so right here make sure
you connect and whenever you make your
database that's where you figure out all
these things the host of your database
that's all it's going to be the same for
me or you the three things that are
going to be different in this you're
going to have a different username a
different password and a different
database name and you need these two
things right here this is going to be
the same for us - the only thing that
you need to change again
just go get this whole file and just
copy it right on your site the only
thing that you guys need to change is
whatever username you
whatever password you using and whatever
you named your database other than that
you guys can just copy this code and
paste it right into your game that's how
easy I'm making it for you guys so again
once you have that and I'll remember
what your file name is because we're
going to be using that a lot once you
have your database the next thing we're
going to want to do is add some tables
in there so let's go ahead and um go
ahead and create a database and I'm
going to need you guys to insert two
tables the first table we're going to
make is called temp T EMP and this is in
the fields you're going to have to enter
in this is code and this is going to
generate a unique verification code to
make sure that no one or no spam can
just enter a bunch of usernames um it's
kind of just a spam prevention a
username email and password and remember
all of these we made the form for it in
the last tutorial so this is temp what
this is going to do is it's going to
make a temporary table for users to
register and then we're going to have to
send them a link in their email and once
they click that link in the email we're
going to insert all their information
into a permanent table called users us
ers and this is going to have a ID
username email password so you guys
don't have to understand that right now
but again make a table called temp that
has a fields code use your name email
password and this is temporary going to
store their data and once they verify
that they aren't spam it's going to move
it into the table called users with a
field ID username email password and I
know this is kind of confusing but a lot
of you guys were saying all right we're
done with the basic stuff we want to get
ready for the more advanced stuff so
here you go here it is so again go ahead
and make your confirmation connection
file remember what the name of it is up
here
and after that make a table in your
database called temp that has these
fields and one that has users that has
these fields well excuse me and after
that you are ready to move on to making
your next registration file so study
this get everything exactly as I have it
and once you're done and don't forget
that all of this code is going to be on
the New Boston comm so if you want to
skip all this and just get the code and
copy it in your website you can go go
there copy the code and put it right
into your website so again thank you
guys for watching make sure to subscribe
to my channel and I will see you guys
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
