Photoshop cs6 today we're going to be
learning how to use pattern overlays
pattern overlays are pretty much the
same as color overlays but it use it but
you use a pattern that you can either
import or Photoshop has a couple of them
already that you can already use so
let's go ahead and get started now have
a something brought up here like a
custom shape or some text and apply the
layer style pattern overlay to it so the
first thing that you want to you'll see
is that a pattern has been overlaid on
top of your layer and we've got our
pattern right here so if you click in
the pattern here you can pick different
patterns so we'll stick with the bubbles
and then we've got all our different
pattern options here you can pick from
other different types of patterns that
are in here you can load patterns and
whatnot there something cool is when you
are have your layer style up here this
you can move your pattern around by just
clicking and dragging and then if you
need to get it back you can click on
snap to origin and that will bring it
back to the center
oh sorry and then the next thing that we
want to do is check out the blending
modes and we can use different blending
modes to work with the color that was in
the background or the color that was on
your original layer so this these blue
bubbles are being multiplied by the
light blue backlight blue color that was
in my shape layer first we've got our
all pasty here where you can mess with
that to blend it in more or make more
transparent and then we got our scale to
change the scale of the of the pattern
and then the last one here is linked
with layer and if you check that it
physically links the active pattern with
the active layer so it's always on
checked on default and you can
pretty much as leave that on there so
you can always leave that checked if you
would like to so that's all the
properties for the pattern overlay
really easy and simple to do so thanks
for watching this tutorial and I hope
you guys learned a lot so thanks a lot
see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
