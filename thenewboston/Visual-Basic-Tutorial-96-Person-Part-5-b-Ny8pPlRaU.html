what we need to do is handle in case
there is no person inside of the list
people so we'll go ahead and type an
else statement right here so if there
isn't anything selected then we'll just
go ahead and type message box dot show
please select a person
and then we'll set the title to warning
we'll set the message box buttons dot to
okay and we will set the icon to warning
so message box icon dot let's just do
exclamation okay so if we go ahead and
run this we'll go ahead and click the
play you can see we have our form under
our form one right here we click new
person I'll just add Sam click OK you
can see we get the current weight the
current money and the current income and
now we can have Sam eat work and
exercise and you can see that it's going
to update and I can increase the income
you can exercise even more can work even
more and I can also eat and get fatter
now before we finish the program there's
a couple things we need to do to make it
work better and to prevent errors so on
the form one load we're going to have we
we're going to have to disable these
buttons right here because they click
them it's just going to crash the
program because there's no selected
person so come back to form or VB and we
will add a sub that will disable all of
those so what is called private sub
disabled buttons and we will type button
eat dot enabled equals false button
exercise dot enabled equals false and
I'm going to go ahead and type all this
in and then come back when it's fit okay
so you can see that I created the sub
disabled buttons and I just set each one
of the buttons enabled to equal to equal
false so button exercised that enabled
equals false and I made a reverse sub of
this called enable buttons which will
just set each one of those equal to true
so now we need to do is come up here to
form one load
and when the forum unloads since by
default the selected index is going to
be negative one for our list box we're
just going to type disabled buttons and
now we'll come down here and let's see
list people so I can index change so if
the selected index is not equal to
negative one then go ahead and enable
the buttons and else we'll just disabled
buttons okay so now let's go ahead and
run this and you can see that we have
our program right here we got the
current weight which is nothing current
money which is nothing current income
which is nothing and you can see that
these buttons right here are disabled
because there's no person so let's just
create a new person we'll call him Sam
and when we select that person you can
see that it updates right here we can
have a meet we can have him work we can
have we can increase the income and
we'll do whatever we want to now we can
create another new person let's just
create John Doe and see that when we
click on John Doe it gets the current
weight and the current money and the
current income which is default now we
can add as many of these as we want and
we can keep accessing different people
so let's have him exercise having eat
some more I will have him work to make a
lot of money you can see that when we
select these we get the values that are
attached to each one of these people so
this is the end of working on our person
program what I want you guys to do is
create input boxes that will get the
pounds to eat how many hours to work how
many hours to exercise and how much to
increase the income so that your program
is a little bit more functional and it
just looks a little bit nicer and it
works better so I'm thanks for watching
guys and stay tuned for the next
