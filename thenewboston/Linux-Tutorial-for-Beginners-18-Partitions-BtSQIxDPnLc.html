video I am going to show you how to
partition advice now if you guys have no
idea what that means let me explain what
partitioning is and also when you would
want to do it so for example let's say
that you just went out and you bought a
laptop from Best Buy
now you got home and it came
pre-installed with Windows you're
looking at it and you're like you know
what it would be pretty cool if I could
install a boot too on this as well but
of course that's impossible one
operating system per hard drive right
well what a lot of people don't know is
you can actually take that hard drive
and break it up into different chunks
now this is called partitioning and
whenever you partition a hard drive in
other words break it up into different
parts you can install an entirely new
operating system on each part so with
one hard drive you can actually have
windows on it and then on a different
part of the hard drive you can have a
boon to and then on a different part you
can have you know another distribution
of Linux so that's a way that you can
have multiple operating systems on the
same hard drive you can also do this
with USB drives so if you want to carry
around a USB Drive with a bunch of
different operating systems on it or you
know broken up for whatever reason you
can do it and it's really useful it's
really cool so let's figure out how the
heck to do it now in this example what
I'm going to be doing is I'm just going
to be getting a USB Drive that I found
at the bottom of my closet and I'm going
to be playing around with this however
whenever you're using a virtual machine
and you plug a USB Drive into your
computer then windows or your host
machine is going to try to read it and
we actually want our virtual machine to
read it because you know this is a linux
thoreau so what we need to do is we need
to tweak these settings so if you just
select your virtual machine and go to
edit virtual machine in the USB
controller right here make sure you have
show all USB input devices checked right
here it just hit OK I already have it
checked
so anyways whenever you select that and
we plug the USB Drive under our computer
then our virtual machine
is going to be able to recognize it so
let me just play this it will be good to
go alright guys so I'm now in a boon to
and before you plug your USB Drive in
make sure that this is the active window
so just click somewhere in the
background and now when I plug in my USB
Drive it's in my hand right now let's go
ahead and slide that in the computer
hopefully a boot due should recognize it
and boom there we go so that's my USB
Drive again brand new nothing on it um
it's kind of old actually a 32 gigabyte
so let's close out of that let me open
up my terminal so I can show you guys
something change as you guys can see a
little bit better and art so in order to
better understand how partitions work
actually want you guys to download this
tool called gparted
and this is a visual editor so you guys
can actually visually see um you know
partitions being made in all your
different devices so if you run sudo apt
- get install gparted I already have it
installed so just going to update for me
so what it's going to do for you is it's
going to go online find it and install
this program on your computer and in
order to run it all you do is you're a
sudo gparted and then it's going to pop
open so let me minimize this and this is
gparted
right here how beautiful is that alright
now before we actually start
partitioning our USB Drive breaking it
up into chunks I want to talk to you
guys a little bit about how a Linux is
different than Windows
as far as naming conventions go so
whenever you're with Windows and you
know you want to go to your hard drive
you're going to look for something
called C maybe you plug the USB Drive in
there you're going to look for a drive
name called e so windows what does is
whenever it has a new disk or device it
labels them with letters CD e you know
maybe F well Linux is a little bit
different now right now I only have two
main devices my hard drive
in the USB Drive so in this top right
corner we're going to see that those are
labeled dev SDA in dev SDB now my hard
drive is only 20 gigabytes because I'm
on a virtual machine but usually this
main one will be a little bit better or
excuse me a little bit bigger now if I
were to plug another USB Drive in that
would be dev SDC and then dev SD D so
basically any new device you have in
whether it's your hard drive a USB Drive
or whatever it's going to have a new
letter so just remember that Linux is
different than Windows in that aspect
because your different devices follow a
different naming convention so let me
just keep my hard drive selected and I
want to show you guys something else so
if you guys are like ok so this is all
your hard drive you're looking at right
now then what the heck is all this SD a
1 SD a 2 SD a 5 well whenever you have
different partitions on the same Drive
then they label those with a different
number so SDA one is one part of your
hard drive SDA 2 is another part of your
hard drive and these could be SD a 3 4 5
so on and so forth
now unallocated this means that this
part of the hard drive it doesn't have
any partition assigned to it you know we
didn't do anything with that yet so
basically this is all my hard drive
right here and we can see that it's
broken up into different chunks called
partitions now if I switch over to the
USB drive I just plugged in this is a
little bit more easy to understand so
whenever they sold the USB drive they
just stuck one huge partition on it and
of course it's SD B which is the device
one now whenever we add another
partition that's going to be SD b 2 SD b
3 depending on how many partitions we
add to it and of course with each of
these partitions if we wanted to we can
install an entirely new operating system
but let's not get ahead of ourselves
right now now I know that this is kind
of overwhelming but I just want to
explain one more thing before we
actually start a you know looking around
and actually deleting this partition and
making new ones and that
is whenever you make a partition what
you're going to do is you're going to
set aside a certain amount of space for
example let's set aside 8 gigabytes
theoretically so we have our partition 8
gigabytes set aside and then the next
thing we have to do is we're going to
make a filesystem on it so a filesystem
is just saying how your files are going
to be organized on that partition so
once you have your filesystem you're
going to mount it or lock it on your
partition so again you have a disk
you're going to break it up into
partitions you're going to make a
filesystem that says this is how the
files are going to be organized and then
once it's you know created you're going
to mount it on so that's all we're going
to do so now let's go ahead and get our
hands dirty</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
