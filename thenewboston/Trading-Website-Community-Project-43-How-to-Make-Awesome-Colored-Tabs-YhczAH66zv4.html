and in this video I'm gonna teach you
guys how to add a cool feature to the
website that you see right here you see
how we are on the add an item page well
on the links on the left hand side all
of the backgrounds of these links are
white except for the page run on add
item page or add item link the
background is orange now this is the
same no matter what you go to you can go
to your inbox and now check it out all
of these links are white except our
active page or current page is orange if
you go to pending then this one is
orange you can go ahead and do your
stuff on the page and this is kind of a
cool feature because instead of just
having static plain links all of them
having white background it kind of gives
the user a more interactive feeling kind
of a more GUI or a graphical user
interface feeling more than just a plain
old website so that is a feature that I
thought was awesome and I'm gonna teach
you guys how to do that right now so
before I show you guys the code I want
to give you guys the concept by default
every single page has a white background
or every single one of these little
links has a white background now what
I'm going to do is in my PHP code I'm
gonna determine what page they're on and
depending on which page they're on I'm
gonna say okay overwrite the CSS for the
white background and make it orange
instead now not only do we change the
backgrounds to orange bowi also change
the color of the arrow to white and the
color of the text to white as well so
now that I showed you guys what this
feature is let's go ahead and code this
baby now if you guys were wondering why
the heck I passed in that number zero
it's because the number represents which
page we're on for example every single
page gets designated a number the add
items page of course has zero shipping
info is three offers declined as six so
what we're going to do on every single
page we're going to include these links
except we're going to change this number
they're 9 12 0 so on and so forth that
is how our website knows which page
you're on
aka which link to color so now let me
show you guys had to do that in code
what you do is go ahead and add a switch
statement and the first thing that I
want to do is pass in the variable X now
what X represents is basically which
page or which link do you want to color
well in the case of 0 just right K 0
this means that we want to color the add
items link so make a variable called add
whoa not a DD caps-lock
add items and set this equal to this now
the cool thing is I'm gonna type some
CSS one line of CSS and it's gonna be
kind of confusing but after this I'm
gonna use the same line of CSS like 16
times so after your get done this boring
CSS then you can just copy and paste so
what we want to do is we want to
overwrite the current style of the link
which is of course the plain white
background so right style set this equal
to color white which changes the text
color to white text shadow and for the
text shadow just go ahead and put one
pixel one pixel three pixels and black
which I don't know I just think that
shadow looks cool now the last thing
that we need to do is we need to change
the background now the background isn't
actually colored orange it's actually an
image and the reason I chose to use an
image is because then I get the white
arrow as well so instead of having to
add the arrow and then a color orange I
did it all in one nice swipe so
background is actually a link to the
file in and whenever you're working with
a file in CSS put URL and put dot images
account nav dot ping and by default the
white image with the gray arrow is zero
zero this image look at the image you
understand what I'm talking about
is it location zero negative 26 which
means don't go any pixels over but go 26
pixels down and that's gonna give you
your orange image if you were zero zero
it will give you your white image this
is called image mapping or tile people
call it different things but you know
call it whatever you wanna call it tuna
bacon ham for a lot care now after this
we just want to break now since we're
going to be working with a lot of
different cases what I did is I made
this a whole lot easier for you in order
to easily edit this what I do is I
actually add this all on one line
so the break in cases are like this now
just so you guys can easily see the
tutorial I don't have a word wrap on but
whenever I'm coding I turn word wrap off
so it looks like that see that so it's
one big long string of text but what I
did already is I coded the rest of this
switch statement why because I don't
know hold on let me go ahead and paste
this first I coated it in another file I
coated the rest of the switch statement
because like a lot of the things I'm
teaching guys I don't want to waste your
time and show you guys the exact same
code over and over and over again so the
only thing that changes is the number
what page you're on and the variable
name so you guys are going to see later
on when we utilize these variable names
whenever we're creating the div boxes
and we need to include that CSS but guys
I just want to remind you guys that the
style of every single one of these is
the same so aside from that the last
thing I want to mention is make sure you
put case 99 break at the very end
and there's a reasoning behind this and
of course I know I say this a lot but
you guys are gonna understand it in the
upcoming tutorials so for now just go
ahead and save this and if you guys
don't want to you know pause the video
and type all of this then what you guys
can do is just go to my forum and
download the file and everything will be
set up for you many ways that is why we
passed a number into this function
basically to let our website know which
tab needs coloring so for now thank you
guys for watching in the next tutorial
what we're gonna be doing is making the
rest of those links on the left hand
side so like I said thank you guys don't
forget subscribe and I'll see you guys
in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
