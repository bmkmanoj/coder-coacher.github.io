isn't complete so we need to find a way
to change this text value here
dynamically when we press the button and
what all we really need to do is go
ahead and set another variable you hold
it that holds a new type so I'm gonna
say the new type is equal to and we're
gonna create an inline if statement or a
one-line if statement and this is
essentially going to check if the type
is equal to password in fact let's do it
the traditional way first and then I'll
go and show you how to shorten this out
so I'm gonna create an if statement the
condition is going to be if the type is
equal to password then we obviously need
to change this value here to text so we
can create a variable saying new type
and that's going to be equal to text now
otherwise if the type is equal to text
we want to go ahead and set the new type
to password and what's gonna happen now
is this is gonna allow us when we
replace this value here with this new
type to switch between the two because
each time we put each time we change the
check box
ie we ticket or unta care we'll grab the
type and modify it accordingly so
essentially what we're doing is we're
swapping password for text or text for
password so let's go ahead and
substitute this in so new underscore
type and that will just change the type
to either text or password depending on
what it's currently out so I don't
really like this long if statement here
it's slightly unnecessary so I'm gonna
go ahead and show you how to make this a
bit shorter so I'm gonna save our new
type is equal to and in brackets we
create our condition so I'm gonna say
type equals password now if the type
does equal password we set the value of
new type
we set the value text into new type
otherwise we set the value password to
new type so essentially this is saying
if type equals password then new type
equals text otherwise new type equals
passwords that's just a shorter way to
write out that long and unnecessarily
five six line if statement so let's go
ahead and check this in our browser so
let's just run through the process when
we type in a password that's password
and we click the show password checkbox
we grab all the relevant information we
check what the current type of the field
is and then we move the previous field
so we remove this field entirely then we
create a new field in its place using
dot before with the new type so this
will just switch between types so I'm
going to click show password and you can
see that the password has been shown but
now when I uncheck it it it checked for
the type and obviously like let's just
take an example at the moment the type
of this is password so when we check the
button it will check the type is
password and it will create a new field
with the type text and then when we
uncheck it it'll check and see if this
is text and if it is text it will change
the type to password so it's quite hard
to see how this works in jQuery because
it's so quick at removing and reading
elements in the Dom but essentially what
we're doing is just you know changing
over the type of the input field
obviously in reality that's not what
we're actually doing we're actually
removing it and replacing it with a new
one but you know it works the same way
it has the same effect now like I said
before if you wanted to go ahead and add
something like a maximum length to this
you would have to go ahead and say we've
got max length equals ten here you'd
have to go ahead and grab this just
under here so I'll go ahead and just
demonstrate this quickly so I'm going to
say previous attribute
max length and inside here what we can
now do is specify this afterwards so max
length equals and then we can just go
ahead and append on just pull that over
we can go ahead and append on the value
for max length so now what's going to
happen is regardless of what we type so
I'm going to I'm gonna just have load of
characters my well the max length
attribute has stopped me here so now
when I showed the password oh okay so
something has gone wrong there let's
just check
oh yeah okay so that's max L not max
length I've called it up here okay so
back let's go ahead and refresh I can
type a load of characters once again and
it stops me when I press show password
it shows what I've typed however I still
am pressing keys on my keyboard I'm sure
you can hear it on the microphone me
just pressing keys and nothing's
happening when I go back to my original
password and I try to press more keys
you can see that the max length
attribute has been retained now if we
didn't include this let's get rid of
that and let's go ahead and get rid of
that then what's going to happen is when
we have the original password field
that's fine it stops us at the the point
of 10 characters however when we show
password because we didn't pass this
attribute back over we can continue to
type in here and then when we uncheck
that again we can continue to type even
more so it's important that any
attribute you think your that you're
going to give your password field that
you retain and actually again like let
me just undo all this that you grabbed
the attribute using Optra and then you
place it back into the recreated form
field or the for the field so we've
successfully created a nifty little
script that's going to allow a user to
obviously check and uncheck a password
to show it like I said it is cross
compatible with all other elements or
all other you know password fields on
your page so that should put a break
there if you were to go ahead and use
two of these on your page for example
when you type them they won't interfere
with each other you can do you know two
things at once and you can you know show
a none show each one and because we're
referencing them correctly in our code
there's no conflict they're available or
there's no conflict at all so that's
just a short but quite easy in terms of
you know how it
written is not too much code and a great
way to add this to your page for every
password field</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
