and in this video we're going to be
talking about how to add an item to the
website but before we do I want to
mention a little side note and that is I
know I kind of been slacking off making
videos but the reason for that is
because a couple weeks ago I wanted to
start teaching physics and I was doing
this tutorial series as well so I'll
teach some physics and then teach this
and teach more physics and they're all
getting tangled up in my brain so about
a couple days ago I want to say I
decided you know what I'm going to knock
out all of the physics lessons so I
finish that up and now I can concentrate
solely on project Lisa so guys good news
for you I'm concentrating all my effort
into making these videos so we should
knock them out shortly so now let's get
to the tutorial now that you heard my
apology so basically whenever the user
logs into the website they're going to
be taking to be taken to their account
now their account it's pretty much there
I don't know Central Station for that
user they can view their items whether
they are active or trading whether they
are pending review or whenever they want
to add an item a new app item to the
website they can go ahead and do that as
well also under their trade section of
course whenever you have an item you can
offer it to other people for their items
or you're going to have offers coming in
to you and you can choose whether to
accept them or not so those are all
right here and of course whenever you
and someone else someone else agree on a
trade it's going to be under completed
trades I also built in a messaging
system where you have an inbox pretty
much like your email sent messages trash
whenever you delete one and you can also
compose a new message and your account
which is just your profile like personal
preferences and shipping information and
I made shipping information so every
item that you trade you don't have to
send the user your address it pops up
forum automatically just save you guys a
little bit time but what we are going to
concentrate on in this tutorial is how
to add an item for the website why did I
decide to start
here well that is the very first thing
you need to do before you use anything
else on the web site before you can
offer your item or accept items of
course you need to have an item on the
website so that is why we're going to
start with how to add an item for the
website on the website so you can get
there in one of two ways you can go
there from my account or once you're
logged in at the top of every page
you're going to see this my account and
add item button just go ahead and click
add item or the link rather and it's
going to take you to this add item page
now let me go ahead and show you guys a
real quick example of how to add an item
the form to add an item has several
different areas the title I already
filled this out so they would pop up say
we're going to sell some used x by x box
games it's kind of a tongue twister the
subtitle would be like arm all there we
go i knew i forgot what i typed all used
but in great condition the description
would be these are all my games if you
want to trade make me an offer I don't
know something stupid like that items
wanted other games or a dirt bike now
for category what i did is i put in
several predefined categories just like
you would find on eBay or Amazon or any
website like that so we choose our
category in this case it would go under
video games and we now have the option
of uploading several images so say I
took two pictures of my video games
under image 1 i'll choose my first one
and under image to i would choose
another picture and now of course item
location would be united states because
that's where i live and i now hit submit
now once i submit it uploads all of my
pictures and data to the website and it
says gives me a little prompt that says
item added successfully i can now go
back to my account and make sure ok
pending it's now pending review
and whenever you add an item to the
website since this is a free website and
you know it doesn't cost any money to
use I was worried about spammers adding
fake items like ooh this is you know
Taylor Swift's book her a quarry you
know something stupid like that so all
items have to pen a review for
moderators and if it's a valid item
which this is it's not like porn or
anything then it gets approved and then
goes to your active items but anyways
that is a you know a tutorial for
another day what we are worried about is
just how to add an item so let's go
ahead and get started so let me go ahead
and minimize this now what I did already
is I already created the core template
for add item PHP I made you know all the
HTML stuff the header now the only other
thing I want to mention in the head I
don't want to say the header because you
know that's something else the head of
your HTML file is I linked to a new CSS
file called account CSS now I know I'm
not going to talk you guys through all
of the CSS for account CSS because it's
simple stuff that we already covered
before if you guys want to take a look
at it then go ahead and download the
file that is on my forum and there's a
link in the description box below but
guys it's already all the concepts that
I already told you I don't need to you
know reiterate it it's all there for you
go check it out if you guys have any
questions then I'll leave me a comment
on the forum and I'll answer for you
guys but other than that in my body the
only other thing I wrote is the rapper
now of course the rapper is where all of
the pretty much everything that the user
is going to see is going to go so that's
where we're going to be started on in
the next tutorial so now that you have
an overview of the account page in the
first thing that the user needs to do is
add an item and how the form is put
together in the next tutorial I'm going
to show you guys how to start coding the
form so sorry I didn't get to any coding
in this video but trust me we will very
shortly so then guys for watching and
subscribe and I'll see you guys in the
next
