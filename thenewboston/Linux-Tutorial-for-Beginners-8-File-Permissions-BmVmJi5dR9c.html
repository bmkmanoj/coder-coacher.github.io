video I want to talk to you about file
permissions in Linux now I'll admit
right now that this takes a little bit
of time getting used to but is
definitely worth it one of the most
important concepts in Linux so let me
show you what the heck I'm talking about
so I'm just going to list the contents
of this directory so we have some files
look at now whenever we're looking at
these files and directories we can
probably figure out most of this stuff
ok the name date uh okay get into this
part right here what the heck is this
crap um ok I see a bunch of RW some
minuses in these ok no idea what that is
well those are all the file permissions
and each file has its own permissions so
let's learn what all of these symbols
mean and I actually type this right
before this tutorial because this what
I'm typing is just an easier way to see
this all I did is there are different
sections of file permissions and instead
of having everything bunched together I
just added a space to space amount
so this first symbol which would be
either a minus or a D in all of these
what the first symbol means is if what
you're looking at is a file it's going
to have a - if this thing is a directory
it's going to have a D so you see that
all of these are files and like bacon
right here that's a file and all of
these are directories movies in other so
that's why they're the directories have
a D and all the files have minuses
alright well that was easy so let's go
on to the next thing
well all of this stuff right here is
actually pretty easy to understand once
you understand that this isn't um don't
look at it as 9 different characters
it's actually broke up into three
different groups so 3 then 3 then 3 now
the three letters that you can have or
symbols are are W and
X so let's just break this down one
group at a time so for every file there
are three things that you can do to it
you can read it you can write it or you
can execute it now we already know what
reading and writing it means execute
means if you ever have executable then
you can do that too
so on a computer you have files those
are all the things that you can do to it
all right so those are the permissions
for the file but why do we have three
different chunks don't we only need to
give it one set of permissions well I
know I didn't talk to you guys about the
owner of a file or groups or different
users on the computer but that's why you
need three different ones the first
group are the permissions for the owner
of the file the second chunk of
permissions right here is for the group
and this last one is for everyone else
so not the owner not the group just you
know like global regular users so in
this example right here what this would
mean is this would be for file since it
has a - or a - whatever you want to call
it the owner of the file can read write
and execute it the group can read and
write it but they can't execute it in
everyone else all the normal users they
can just read it so maybe this is
something for like a file on a website
those would be you know a pretty good
example of their permissions and what
I'm about to teach you right now is
probably easier if you guys have a
little cheat sheet to look at so let me
type this so when I'm explaining it guys
can see what's going on so the letter U
is for user and that would be the like
the main owner of the file but the one
that usually has the most privileges so
G this stands for the group and oh these
are the people with usually the least
privileges these are just other people
and I'll say like a from the outside
world
so just keep these characters in mind
right here because now I want to teach
you how you would space this so as you
can see the whole thing alright so what
if we want to change their permissions
for let's say this bacon file right here
so we want to say that we want to change
it for normal users from the outside
world and right now as we can see they
can only read the file well let's say
that we wanted to um I don't know have
them be able to write it for some reason
well to change the permissions use chmod
and then it takes on well three pieces
of information the first one is what
group are you trying to change the
permissions for well we're just trying
to change it for other people the
outside world
and then it's saying okay what do you
want to do well we just want to give
them the right permission and now it
just takes what file which is bacon and
check it out so now if I do the list L
again the outside world can now not only
read the file like it was before but
they can also write it now if you ever
want to take those permissions away
write the group what permissions you
want to take away and what file so check
it out we just took it away now let me
hear clear and clear that stuff out all
right that's simple enough but imagine
that you wanted to you know change the
permissions around for I don't know
maybe the user the group and other
people that's going to take a bunch of
commands and you know it's not going to
take that long maybe a minute but we
don't have time for that so shoot I'll
show you guys the incredibly easy way
I'll give you guys a little cheat sheet
right here to easily set all of the
permissions for every group at once and
you guys are going to love me after this
so I'll give you guys an example like a
chmod what you can do something like 754
and then the file name which is bacon so
in this order I'll write a 7 5 4
represents the individual permissions
for and I'll say in this order um yeah I
guess that's the best way to do is so
user group and other so this first
number right here is for the user the
second one is for the group and the
third one is for other so you know just
kind of the way that you would think of
it so alright that was easy enough so
we're given seven to the user five to
the group 4 to the other alright so what
the heck do these numbers mean well for
I'll just say um stands for read let me
copy this so I don't have to type it
again
alright so whenever you see the number
four it stands for read so we are giving
others the ability to read this now to
whenever you see a two if even if it
even though it wasn't in this example
this means right so if we were to change
this to two then we would give the
others their permission to write it so
let me change that back to four and
whenever you see a one this stands for
execute and guys I know that this is
kind of overwhelming right now but after
you see this a couple times you actually
get the hang of it and most people don't
even understand what this is so you guys
are going to be like pros alright so for
whenever you see a four it means we're
giving this group the ability to read to
means right and one means execute now
zero why the heck aren't you type in
because I got num lock on all right zero
stands for no permissions so anytime you
would see a - like before that would
just mean a zero all right so that's
simple enough 0 1 2 4 for each
individual group but why is the 7 right
here what the heck is a 7 well this is
the last thing I'm going to teach you
and this is where things get a little
bit tricky whenever you see a 7 we
you're doing is you're combining all of
these numbers so you can just give them
so for example you can just give a group
right permission or you can just give
them read permission or what you can do
is you can combine read and write and
that would be six now whenever we see a
seven that means for this group they
have read write and execute permission
so let's figure out what this thing
means it means we're going to change
your privileges for bacon or their
permissions so users which is the first
one they have a seven so they can read
write and execute it all right
so group they have a five
so what adds up to a five well they can
read and execute it all right what about
other people other people only have a
four so that means that they can only
read it so I know that you're like
sitting there but um solo okay I'm
getting it now okay that makes sense now
what you're going to see a lot is
something like this and if you ever see
chmod 777 bacon this means that you're
giving every group all their permissions
to read write and execute it so that
like I said is a pretty common one seven
seven seven means let anyone do whatever
they want with this file but uh yeah
there you go that's what all of the crap
about file permissions are in Linux now
you understand so go out um you know
hexam computers change their permissions
do whatever you want thanks for watching
see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
