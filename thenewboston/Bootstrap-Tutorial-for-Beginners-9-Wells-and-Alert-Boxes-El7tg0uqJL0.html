video I'm going to be talking to you
about wells and before you do I want to
mention that I'm going to keep the
navigation bar in the rest of my
tutorials that we made in the last video
because I don't know I just think it'll
be a little bit cooler if it looks like
we're making an actual website instead
of just a bunch of different you know
individual examples so I set it up so I
can type all my demonstrations right
here and they're going to appear right
here but if you guys want to do the same
thing as me then just take your
navigation bar and just stick it right
above it I'm going to keep it collapsed
because we're not actually going to be
tweaking any of the code in there but
you know just want to show you guys
what's going on all right so make sure I
got my tabs right so a well is
essentially just it's kind of like a
floating island they look Li like these
individual sections with a border and
usually a gray background and let me add
a heading real quick so might wells are
um sections with orders in by the way is
grey spelled with an A or an E I want to
get your guy's opinion I never know how
to spell it I mean I know that you can
spell it either way and it's technically
correct but I don't know like what's
more common kind of bothers me moving on
let's learn how to create a simple well
and you know figure out what they
actually look like now just to make a
real basic one the class is well easy to
remember and I'll just write basic well
so this is the text that is going to
appear inside it and if i refresh this
is our heading and as you can see this
is a basic well just a floating island
that's gray and it has a slight border
so whenever you have some content and
you want to separate it from your main
website that is what you do and there
are a bunch of different types of Wells
that we can make aside from just a
simple one we can have well
well small and this just kind of takes
away some of that padding makes it a
little bit more condensed and people use
these a lot for alert boxes so say that
you're filling out a form to let's say
sign up for a website if you filled it
out correctly then a well will pop up
when my have like a green background say
congratulations is signed up now check
your email to verify it or you know just
a bunch of different examples maybe a
notification of one of your friends
birthdays who knows possibilities
unlimited so anytime you want to create
a well in that fashion it's actually a
different style it's called an alert so
for the class what one can I show you
I'll show you guys this success one so
alert success now inside here I'll just
write like how do you spell
congratulations you and are a tu le T
illness is that right hopefully all
right so congratulations you just won
the game now actually actually you just
refresh this and check it out so an
alert all it is is a colored well now
another thing that you're going to want
to do whenever you pop these up
especially if you're making a single
page app you want to give the user the
ability to close these so maybe it's
just notification then you want to have
a X on the right hand side and whenever
they click it it goes away so let me
copy this one
all right so there's my success one I'll
make an info one so info you can use
whenever you just you know want to give
a little notification to the user
obviously they don't want these staying
on you know their webpage forever so I
just like don't forget Kelly's birthday
today and again this is just going to
create a really um basic well but in
order to add that X that you can click
on it's actually a link so right before
it and I know it's coming after on the
right hand side but a href what the head
cursor is obviously you know I'm not my
cursor obviously just hit something
wrong all right so a href it's going to
be a link you might want to have this
actually do something you might not in
the class you set to close now one other
thing that you're going to do actually
two other things you want to have data
and it's not popping up dismiss so what
this is going to do is it's going to
dismiss the alert box and the last thing
is label there we go and this is close
it's a little bit easier to read
all right to now inside your link did it
actually work impressive what symbol do
you want to appear as your link well
let's just have a Oh X and it's actually
called x so this is going to be HTML
that's going to be rendered into a
graphic so if we refresh this check it
out so this is that x and I it's called
x because I guess you use it during
multiplication but whenever we click it
the link is going to make this disappear
just like that now if you noticed
whenever I click it it just disappears
immediately and a lot of people what
they like to do is have this fade out
instead so if you want to have
eight outs what you can do is this it's
really easy to change so I'll keep that
one so whenever I post it on github you
guys will have it and let me just say
danger
so infos blue danger is going to be red
and what can we have the text on this a
like are you sure to your account
alright now inside this div right after
alert danger we're going to add another
quest called fade space in so it's two
different classes so now whenever I
refresh just check it out so this blue
one whenever we close it is just going
to pop away immediately and this red one
you might have to look closely but I'm
going to click it and it fades out if it
was kind of hard to see on YouTube then
you can definitely see it great whenever
you run in person but that is the basics
of wells and alerts and how you make
your alerts closeable and also how to
add a basic fading animation to your
alerts see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
