Blackford here with another Photoshop
cs6 tutorial and in this tutorial we're
going to start creating with creating a
new document and I'm going to give you a
little bit more information than I did
last time about creating a document with
the different color modes and things
like that mean so the first thing we're
going to do is come up to file and we're
going to come over here to new and ctrl
n is the hotkey for creating a new
document so let's add new and then we'll
get our new document menu now before you
even start working in Photoshop you need
to figure out and pre plan what you're
actually going to make so there's a
couple of things that you need to think
of during the planning process you need
to think of what is my image or my
design going to be used on so for
instance is going to be used on full is
it going to be used on the web is it
going to be used on print mobile or on
video because the different types of
color modes and resolution and
everything like that is going to be
different when you're working with those
types of media for example when you're
creating things online you need a
resolution of 72 pixels per inch and in
RGB color mode but when you're working
for commercial print you need 300 pixels
per inch and the color mode is going to
be CMYK so these are the kind of things
you need to ask yourself you need to
figure out the size of the
yeah the object of the project your
resolution your color mode your
background the color profile which is
down here in the Advanced section and
then you're going to have to think of
the pixel aspect ratio that you need and
most of the time you are going to be
able to leave this at square pixels but
there's other times when you're not now
a pixel if you're not if you're
wondering what that is a pixel is just a
unit of information that holds color
detail and an image and Photoshop works
with documents that are composed of
pixels and each of these pixels is going
to have like the color detail in it just
like I said so we're we're you're going
to have to pre-plan what you're doing
that way when you're working on the
image it you don't have to go back and
do it again for example that's one time
I was asked to create a logo for a
person that does photography
and they needed a new logo for the
photography business and what I did was
I created them a logo that would be good
on a website because that's what they
mainly wanted it for then they decided
later on that they wanted this logo to
be printed onto some of their foot onto
their photographs so she could have our
little logo on some of the photographs
well you can't use 72 pixels per inch
resolution so I had to redo it over
again and make it into a 300 pixels per
inch resolution and I just want to make
sure they get everything right so you
don't have to do that
I learned the hard way so I'm hopefully
telling you guys to figure out the easy
way and don't have to do that again and
then you can always keep track of your
image how big your image sizes here and
this is in megabytes 24 megabytes for
this one so that's pretty pretty nice
there so let's go over selecting your
color modes and resolution and things
like that because I just went over those
for a little while I mean you probably
understand the width and height it just
just the size the dimensions of your
object of your image so what's going to
resolution and to the color mode so
let's start with the color mode first
and color mode has also been then called
a color space and it determines how
Photoshop displays and prints your image
so you can choose from a few different
color modes here we've got bitmap
grayscale RGB CMYK and the lab now I'm
just going to talk about grayscale RGB
I'm going to talk about the last four
because I never have used a bitmap
before we might come back to it at a
later time but it doesn't seem like
something I need to go over with you
guys right now so grayscale is the best
for black and white or dual tone images
and it uses just one channel and that
channel has 256 shades of gray in it so
not like that crazy book I didn't read
it but I heard it was pretty graphic you
know what I'm talking about 50 shades of
grey well this has 256 shades of grey so
you can see how graphic this will get
oh yeah yeah dumb joke I know oh well
let's go to the next one we've got the
next one we can pick is RGB and RGB
stands for red green and blue and this
is the best for online and multimedia
color images so red green and blue are
the primary images on your monitor so
that's why it's best for online</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
