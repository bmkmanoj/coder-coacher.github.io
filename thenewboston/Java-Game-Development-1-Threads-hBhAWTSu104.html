first tutorial in the series that I've
been waiting for so long to teach you
guys this is going to be my favorite
series of all time by far because in
this series we're going to be learning
how to create games in Java now this is
the reason I'm in teaching guys Java and
these tutorials are going to start out
pretty intermediate in kind of advanced
so if you don't know Java I recommend
actually you need to go check out my
Java tutorials it's like one through
it's like an ad part series and once
you're good with that you're ready to
move on to this next step how to create
games in Java now what we're going to be
creating is full screen games such as
like um games kind of like Super Mario
Brothers and then later we're going to
be getting into 3d games and this is
like first-person shooters like both
Eric and they're going to look as cool
as Modern Warfare's and stuff but if you
you'll get the point about how to use
three graphics to interact with a Java
3d class and create 3d games in Java and
this is going to be awesome I'm going to
give you guys a bunch of tutorials
probably over a hundred tutorials on
this and by the end you're going to be
awesome Java game developer so the first
thing that we need to learn is aside
from all the basics that you guys are
should know is something called threads
now what a thread is on your computer is
it allows you to do two tasks at once so
instead of having all your tasks in a
row then this would be like a single
line at the DMV it can go kind of slow
and to make it easier Java made
something called threads well thread
would be is to take that line at the DMV
and split it up into three separate
lines so that you can get three things
running at the same time and I said
three but it's actually as many as your
computer can handle so that way your
whole computer program goes faster and
it can do multiple tasks at the same
time so for saying alright I know what
thread is now it lets you do two things
at once so how exactly do you create a
thread well in order to create a thread
most
I'm in way or at least what we're going
to be doing is you need to implement an
APL e implements runnable and what this
means this run bolt interface right here
it takes a method called the run and
there's only one method in the run bowl
class and this is the run method so
whenever we create our thread the method
run and that's what you're going to be
seeing right here right here
the type apple must implement the
inherited app sharing method run will
run
so whenever whenever you create a thread
this method run is automatically going
to run so if you had something called
print out hello world and you started
your thread without even calling this
run method it's going to print out hello
world so let's go ahead and do some
stuff to our Apple class that's where
we're going to be treating this as a
thread class now let's go ahead and make
a string variable called name an integer
variable called time and this is going
to be the length this is going to be the
name of your thread the length of time
it pauses pretty much and just our
random R and set this equal to new
random and if you can't see bb4 I
already imported the random class right
here so we can use random numbers and
this is going to be just for
demonstration of the threads so now
let's go ahead and make a constructor
public apple or whatever you name your
class and for my argument I'm going to
take the name of the thread and we're
going to be naming it later on but let's
go ahead and set the name equal to s and
this is going to be the parameter we
passed in and let's also set that time
and set this equal to R or whatever you
named your random object next int and
put like 999 so the time is going to be
anywhere in milliseconds between pretty
much zero time in one second this is
milliseconds a thousand is a second but
let's just go ahead and put 999 because
it looks way cooler so now that we got
our constructor let's go ahead and
implement that run method so let's go
public void run
this isn't going to take any parameters
and again like I said whenever we start
our thread this is a code that's
automatically going to run so we don't
need to call this method explicitly so
let's go ahead and try and let's just go
ahead and catch everything get this out
away catch I can type right exception II
and we won't handle it because we're
lazy so what do we want to try to do as
soon as we start our thread go ahead and
insist them out actually we don't need
to omit that indebting is for suckas so
print f actually you've probably should
I just don't have enough room / F put
the name of the thread which is purse s
is sleeping for % D which would be the
time and let's go ahead and move to new
line I want to do it right there that
probably helpful just put name time make
sure we don't get in errors so the first
thing that's going to do is print out a
little statement the name of the thread
is sleeping forward and give you the
time well that statements all nice and
pretty but we actually need to UM make
good on our promise so let's go ahead
and put thread which is the thread the
current thread and put sleep and for our
time the sleep parameter is how long do
you want to sleep for so if you put this
1,000 sleep for one second if you put
5,000 oh sleep for five seconds but
since we want each of these threads to
sleep randomly we're going to go ahead
and put time here and this is going to
give us a random number a whooping cough
from zero to one second
so each of these threads whenever we
create it it's going to sleep randomly
from zero to a second and this is just
demonstrate point in my next tutorial
and now after it's done sleeping
I just put system.out.print F and for
print app let's just go ahead and what
if you want to write um let's put the
name of thread s is done and for our
arguments let's just put name
so now what we have is pretty much a run
method and actually I'm going to be
explaining all this and finishing it up
in the next tutorial so I know this
doesn't look like much but I need to
teach guys about threads because they
are used a ton in games for stuff like
um if you have a lot of different things
going on once pretty much whenever you
build a huge program you want to use
thread so it can run more effectively
and in the next tutorial I'm going to be
clearing all this up for you and we are
finally getting started on game
development so thank you guys for
watching don't forget to check out the
next tutorial and I will see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
