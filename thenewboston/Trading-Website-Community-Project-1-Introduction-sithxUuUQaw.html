Roberts for those of you people who may
not know and I wanted to make a video
real quick to welcome you guys to the
first official the new Boston community
project so what I've been doing for the
past couple weeks is I wanted to make
something that takes all the knowledge
all the skills that we learned so far
such as HTML CSS JavaScript PHP MySQL
and I wanted to show you guys how you
can use all of this knowledge to make
something awesome so I've been
developing this website as you see right
here and what this website is is it's
basically a huge social network that
users can add items and then once they
have an item add it to the website they
can trade it for other people's items so
let me go ahead and show you guys the
site real quick here's the homepage with
everyone's items here's some most wanted
items the newest items now you can go
ahead and just search for items and look
at all this cool stuff you can search by
category and whenever you click an item
it gives you you know a little more
information about it a description what
items they want to trade for as well as
the owners information and I also made a
place where if you are new register or
you excuse me if you are a new user that
hasn't registered yet you can go ahead
and register if you already are a member
then you can just go ahead and login
Bucky I'm gonna go ahead and show you
the account page now for the moderators
or for the people who are kind of
controlling the site they can approve
any items that are pending for example
whenever you first put a item on the
site um you need to get it approved and
this helps cut down on spam and also
when item is already added to the
website if anyone you know I don't know
changes their description add a bunch of
spam people can report it so you can
review that as well and for each
individual account they have the items
that are available for trading items
that are pending approval you can go
ahead and add a new item right here now
for trading any offers that you receive
on your items you can look at those
right here any offers that you have made
to other people right there offers
declined
whenever someone rejects your offer it's
right here the completed trades so once
the trade is completed and you and
someone else agreed to trade items you
can go ahead and look at their shipping
info to see where you're supposed to
send the items to or send them a message
and I also put a messaging system in
here so you can look at your inbox your
sent messages of course the messages you
delete and trash um any message you want
to make any new message there's area for
that as well as well as a personal
profile and your shipping information so
there's a bunch of awesome features that
I want to show you guys
especially the search page because I
work forever on the search page you can
go ahead in a sort in different ways it
tells you what page you're on and also
just a whole bunch of features I put in
here and I was like you know what it
would be cool if I just taught this in a
tutorial but I wanted to do something
better what I wanted to do is I wanted
to make this a community project and
what I mean by that what I'm going to be
doing is not only telling you guys how
to make a website like this I'm going to
be making videos showing you guys the
framework how to put this website
together and then at the end of the
videos you're going to have a couple
options you can just go ahead and walk
away with the knowledge of how to make a
sweet epic website or if you want to
help develop the website you guys can do
that too if anyone wants to help upgrade
the website add new features help
improve the website in any way then what
we can do is we can work together and
make an awesome website now the cool
thing is anyone like I said if you just
want to watch your videos go ahead feel
free they're all going to be free but if
anyone does decide to help develop this
website I'm going to be adding a page on
the website for all of the developers
names and that way you can get your name
on the website is a developer and you
can add it to your resume or portfolio
and it's definitely going to help you
get a job whenever your potential
employer sees that you worked on such a
huge project and made such an awesome
site it's definitely going to help your
chances so that's what I'm going to do
be putting all of the source code
and database files available so anyone
who wants to help develop the site there
you go so another thing that I want to
tell you guys is for all of the
developers I set up a section on my
forum tnb forum comm and if you scroll
down you're going to see something
called project Lisa that's the key name
or code name for this project any
developer chat or any source code is
going to be available here so if you
have any questions any suggestions about
the project there you go that's where
everyone can kind of get together and
have the discussion about everything we
need to talk about it's kind of going to
be like the main headquarters for this
project so there you go there you have
it in a couple of technicalities I want
to talk about is this site is going to
be written mainly in PHP the programming
anyways of course it's going to use CSS
and HTML and all that but mainly PHP and
we're not going to be using any
frameworks like Zend or anything like
that and also I decided not to make this
website object-oriented at all because
there really isn't a need for it and
you'll see whenever we start developing
that it's easier just to make it
procedural it makes it a lot more simple
and clean so I think that we're going to
be building this I a whole lot easier
without object-oriented so you'll see
that whenever we start development but I
think that's pretty much it for now I'm
super excited to show you guys this
website and super excited to get my
hands dirty and start showing you guys
how to code this thing and also working
with you guys at the end to you know fix
any bugs and just working with everyone
for the first time bringing all of our
skills and knowledge together to build
an awesome amazing website many ways
I'll quit rambling for now that's all I
have so in the next tutorial we're going
to start development so anyways thank
you guys for watching don't forget to
subscribe and I'll see you guys in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
