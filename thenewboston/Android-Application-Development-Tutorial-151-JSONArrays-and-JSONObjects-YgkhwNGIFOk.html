Android tutorial for the new Boston
where we're still going to work with
this getting the last tweet of a
specific user name method and it's going
to be pretty similar to what we did with
you know before we were working working
with the HTTP client and get in response
all that stuff so we're just going to
kind of go quickly but I'll still try
and explain some new stuff just further
you guys is a learning here and so what
we need to do again is set up HTTP
response we're going to set this equal
to response or something like that and
what we're going to do is we're going to
say our client that we set up within our
you know our our on create method we're
going to refer to that client and then
again we use the method execute and what
we're going to pass in here is basically
this get this get method so we're just
going to say get and add our imports now
what we want to do is we want to check
if it cleared so we're going to set up
an end called status returned or status
is fine and we're going to set this
equal to our response which is our dot
get status line dot get status code and
that's going to return a number for us
obviously since this is an int but let's
just take a look at it I pulled this up
it's the Javadoc and for this get status
code that we just use if it returns like
200 that means it's like success 100 is
just informational 300 is redirect 400
air and 500 service area so what we want
is actually the 200 if it's successful
so what we're going to do is we're going
to set up an if statement if our status
is equal to 200 then we're going to set
up a HTTP entity called e and we're
going to call this our our dot get
entity again nothing to new there
we're also going to set up a string and
we're going to call this data set this
equal to entity utilities dot to string
and we're going to pass in our entity
which we call the e and that's just
basically going to create some data
returning you know the string of our
entity we need to set up a JSON array
and a JSON object that we're going to
return so again we're just going to say
JSON array and we're going to call this
time line and we're going to set this
equal to a new JSON array passing in our
data and that's going to create a JSON
array for us and then what we need to do
is we need to or then what we need to do
is set up a JSON object so we're going
to say JSON object and we're going to
call this last for referring to the last
tweet because basically now what we're
going to do is refer to our time line
that we just set up which is our array
and that's going to return a lot of
different objects JSON objects and we
have different indexes and basically the
first or the zero index is going to be
the most recent tweet like the next one
is going to be second two most recent
etc and since this method is called last
tweet we're going to say zero here
that's going to return a JSON object
from our array that we set up again
according to all this stuff that we set
up here as well and we want position
zero because it's going to be the most
recent we could also say you know v mo v
most recent tweet or I'm sorry that'd be
the sixth but that'd be fifth etc but we
want the most recent tweet which is zero
then all we're going to do is return
again our JSON object so we're going to
return last so there we go we also need
to return if you know this status is not
equal to 200 if we got some sort of an
error so we're going to say else
return null and we can all set up like a
toast or something toast at make text
referring to our HTTP example class dot
mentor dot this air some sort duration
toast dot set length be short and then
we know we have some sort of an air or
we're hitting this else statement here
so there we go we're returning again a
JSON object and that's pretty much it
for this tutorial in the next tutorial
we're gonna finish up this little
application and probably after that I'll
show you guys a little bit more
information of everything that we did so
I'll catch you guys then and hope you
have a good one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
