slash on live gamer for the new Boston
and in this tutorial we're gonna be
talking about the font dialog so what
the font dalek dialog does is yet let
the user select basically whatever that
font they want whatever color font the
size if it's bold italic and this is all
built into Visual Basic so that you
don't have to create your own window for
this so we'll go ahead and create a new
project we will just call it font dialog
we'll go ahead and click OK and once
that's done loading we'll come in here
and we will add a text box and a button
okay so we'll come over here to the tool
box we'll open that up we'll add a
button and a text box
we'll make it multi-line and we'll just
stretch it out a bit
okay so let's set the text for a button
for a button one to change font and we
will set the name to button font so
we'll just make this a little bit bigger
so you can see everything and we'll
double click on change font so whenever
change font opens what we want to do is
we want to show a font dialog that will
let them change the font now we could do
this by coming down here go to dialogs
and selecting a font dialog but I want
to show you guys a different way of
creating one so whenever they click
click font what we want to do is declare
a new font dialog so dim my font as new
font dialog
and we just need to create a we have to
use Windows soft forms dot font dialog
okay so now that we've created a font
dialog what we want to do is we want to
show it so we'll type my font dot show
dialog so now what we want to do is
whatever font they selected in there
let's go ahead and set that to the text
box so text box one dot font it's going
to be equal to my font dot font so let's
go ahead and run this now you can see
here that we have form one so we'll just
go ahead and type some stuff in here
we'll click change font looks like we
need to create a new window stormshock
font dialog and we'll go ahead and just
drag this arrow up right here so it'll
start running from there okay so now you
can see that it has created our font
dialog let's go ahead and select
something like most wasted
we'll make it bold oblique it'll make it
a little bit bigger so go ahead and
click OK you can see here that we can
type whatever we want and it's going to
show up in that new font now we can keep
changing the font here to whatever we
want so we can leave some symbols so go
ahead and mess around a bit with the
change font dialog there's a bunch of
stuff that you can use with it and once
you've got familiar with that and you
know how to use it go ahead and move on
to the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
