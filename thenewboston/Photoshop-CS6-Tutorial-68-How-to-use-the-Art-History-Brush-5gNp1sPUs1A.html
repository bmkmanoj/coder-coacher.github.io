Photoshop cs6 tutorial
I'm your host buddy Blackford and today
I'm going to show you how to use the art
history brush or at least one technique
that you can use with the art history
brush now the art history brush gives
you the ability to create some painted
effects using information from snapshots
or our history States so what that means
is that you can paint on another layer
and bring out another type or bring out
some of the information of another
history state or snapshot now this is
gonna use the history panel so let's
start out from the beginning and let's
just pick an image to open up that
possibly doesn't have like a whole lot
of detail in it but has some detail like
maybe a person just maybe a just like a
head shot or something like that okay
now you want to make sure that you have
your art history or your art I mean your
history panel open and that's this panel
up here remember this is cs6 so this is
we're gonna the history panel is going
to be if you can't find it go up to
window and then go to history and click
that and it'll show up for you now what
we need to do is make some changes to
the document so that we can like start
start using the art history brush so
what we're gonna do is we're gonna
create a new layer and it's just going
to be a transparent layer and it's going
to be on top of the background layer the
next thing that we're gonna do we're
just gonna grab the Paint Bucket let's
make sure the background is white and
we're just gonna fill in that
transparent layer with white now you can
see that the layer over top is just a
white Paint Bucket bucketed layer I
guess so we've got in our history panel
we've got our things that we've done we
open up the picture we created a new
layer and we have the
bucket if I go to new layer it's going
to show me that what was on during that
step and then you as you can see the
layers panel is changing when I go to a
new step in the history so what we're
gonna do now is we're gonna start
working with our our history brush so
come over here to our tools panel and
click on this icon it could be the
history brush tool or the art history
brush tool but we want to select the art
history brush tool so make sure you have
that selected and it has like the little
swirly thing around the paintbrush the
next thing that we want to do is we want
to make sure that we have the layer that
we want to use selected and this time
I'm going to use the snapshot up here
that comes when you have Photoshop when
Photoshop opens it takes the snapshot if
you don't have a snapshot already go to
your very first history where you have
your picture that you opened so click on
open and then take a snapshot of that
using this and then use the snapshot as
your history our history brush reference
so just make sure that this has the
brush icon next to it so what we're
gonna do is we're going to take the
history brush here and we're gonna start
painting and you can paint my moving
your brush around or you can just click
and hold so what I'm gonna do is just
gonna click and hold and you can see
what's going on here and you're like
what the heck is that now if you have
your brush at a small size then it's
going to put pick up more detail if you
have it at a bigger size then it's gonna
pick up some bigger detail so by using
your left or right bracket on your mouse
or if your right click you can adjust
the size of your brush now you probably
want to have some kind of brush that's
one of the basic brushes so just a
circle with something so you can see
that my brush is just it's just probably
this brush right here
so what I'm gonna do is start drawing
again so
you can see what's going on here now you
can see that there's not a lot of detail
in this brush here it's just a bunch of
blobs pretty much so I'm gonna lower my
brush size down a little bit and start
drawing again now it's picking up
information from the background you can
see that not a lot again is going on and
we just need to address our brush size
down even more so let's go down to
pretty pretty low light maybe eight
there I'm gonna start drawing here and
then you can see that we're getting more
detail here in our brush and you can
start making out that it's an actual
person that's back on here now it looks
like we're starting to get like a mosaic
II painted effect on our image so you
want to pretty much experiment with this
brush and see if you can get some really
nice effects I'm gonna go down to the
smallest that I can get which is one
pixel and I'm gonna start drawing again
on here and we'll see how much detail we
start getting I'm just clicking and
holding to paint now you can see how
much detail is coming out in this this
is a pretty cool brush you want it you
get the most detail out of the smaller
brush sizes so here we go now it's
starting to look like the original
picture that I create there that we had
in the beginning so if I turn this layer
off this is what we had this is what we
have now so you can mess around with the
brush size to get some different effects
now not only the brush size creates the
effects for you we've got a whole panel
up here at the top that has a bunch of
different stuff so we've got our
blending modes we've got our opacity
this button right here is the
pressure for opacity button no if you
hold your mouse over top of it I find I
just hold my mouse over top of it it'll
tell you what it is always use pressure
for opacity and that's when you have
like a pen tablet so if you have a
tablet while you're using a pen if you
push down more you get more or less
opacity when you hold it off a little
bit then you get less opacity then we've
got our style here and this is one of
the bigger effects that define how your
image is going to look so if we come
down we've got a list here I'll come
down to loose curl and then I'll maybe
make my brush size a little bigger and
then you can see here what it's doing so
we've got a like a little curl kind of
looks like little Cheetos I guess bring
my brush size down even more and we got
this kind of curl going on we got a
tight curl which is even tighter as you
can see hopefully you can see this you
should be all to it I mean you can
definitely tell that it's like a curl
and then something like loose long or
it's just like a loose line that's just
long and then when you use less of an
amount it comes out more a smaller brush
size it comes out more in more detail
and you can use these effects to your
advantage to make some cool-looking
things so that's it for the art history
brush use it like this this is just one
way to use it there's probably a whole
bunch of other methods that you can use
to make this brush cool experiment with
using different types of brushes like
this
his eyes were all like messed up his
mouth is kind of messed up so let's
bring that in there a little bit and
then you can use like the different
styles to make different
things in your brush are different types
of looks with your brush so thanks for
