tutorial and in this tutorial you will
be happy to know we are covering the
last string functions
so after this tutorial no more string
functions for a while so I bet you guys
are glad about that so the first thing
I'm going to be covering is the string
erase function now what this function
does it it erases everything from and
including whatever element you tell it
to so let's go ahead and string I'm just
going to make a shrink out string one
and all right something like hi my name
is Bucky and I love bacon and ham
something stupid like that
and why not explanation point you know
spice things up a bit so let's go ahead
and first just print this out on the
screen so we have something to compare
it to after we change it later on so now
what I want to do is I want to let's say
I want to erase let's see I want to
erase everything from the xx character
on so it's going to be like somewhere
around here and say this is the xx
character right here I want to erase
everything from here till the end of the
string well we need to use something
called the erase function and it's
probably already in there right there
erase and it takes one parameter what
character do you want to begin erasing
that erasing it and remember it includes
the xx character as well so it doesn't
start at 21 and actually erases xx
character as well so now let's go ahead
and print out the new-and-improved
erased sring and we'll go ahead and run
it and see what it looks like
so the original string is hi my name is
Bucky and I'll a bacon in ham and the
new string is hi my name is Bucky and
then erased everything from here on out
so that's all the erase function does
so now aside from the erase function I
guess we can go ahead and keep this and
this and this the only line of code
that's going to change in this story is
this so now that we know what the erase
function is I want to talk you guys
about another function and that's the
replace function so press s1
replace functions already filling in for
me all right
the replace function takes three
parameters the first parameter it takes
is what character do you want to begin
replacing it and Bucky I already know is
the 14th character since this was the
20th character right here so this B is
the 14th index the next parameter so
let's go ahead and put 14 in there right
now before I forget the next parameter
it takes is how many characters do you
want to replace so let's count one two
three four five Bucky is five characters
long so we want if we want to erase this
entire thing or in other words replace
it we're going to start at the 14th
character and replace five characters so
that's going to replace the entire word
Bucky so the third parameter it takes is
what do you want to replace it with so
now that we have Bucky replaced I think
it would be only appropriate to you know
add a new name like arm I was just going
to enter right there that'd be way too
easy like Samuel Jackson and I spelled
that wrong but it doesn't really matter
so you don't have to replace it with the
same number of characters you're pretty
much saying all right what do you want
to replace and what do you want to
replace it with uh so if we go ahead and
run this we can see that the original
string was hi my name is Bucky and I
love bacon and ham and now the new
string took Bucky out and added Samuel
Jackson so it says hi my name is Samuel
Jackson I love bacon in him and he
probably does so what replace does is
basically takes a certain bit out of the
string and replaces it with something
else
easy enough so now I want to talk to you
guys about one last string function and
that's insert now what insert does is it
inserts a substring into the string but
it doesn't take anything out like it did
Bucky before so if we wanted to change
the strength - hi my name is lucky Bucky
and I'll a bacon ham we don't want to
take anything out we just want to insert
something right after is so what will
you do is put s1 as string we're working
with the function is called insert right
like that and it takes two parameters
the first parameter it takes is where do
you want to begin inserting it well we
already know 14 is the beginning of
Bucky and the next parameter it takes is
what string do you want to put right
there what substring do you want to add
into the main string and just go ahead
and press lucky and we'll add a space
after lucky so it would be lucky space
Bucky if we didn't add this space it
would be like lucky Bucky one big word
but I want my name is lucky
Bucky so I'm going to begin at index
number four and I want to insert the
word lucky with a space after it so
don't forget your semicolon and whenever
you run this you can see the original
string hi my name is Bucky and now we
inserted lucky so the new string is hi
my name is lucky Bucky and I love bacon
and ham so that is how you insert words
you know into a string and one other
thing I forgot to mention let's see if I
can go ahead and ZZ replace just like
that usually people use replace whenever
they they usually use it in conjunction
with fine so remember in the lesser
toriel i told you about find how you can
find like all the AMS in a string I
think that was an example I showed you
guys people typically loop through your
entire document and find all instances
of something and use this replace
function to replace it with this for
example here's a great example if you
ever use Microsoft Word and it saw that
you know you did your whole homework
assignment and you saw you spelled the
word dictionary with a k' and you typed
it like 18 times well whenever you right
click it and spell check it it says
replace all this is how they made it it
just loops through finds all the time
you take dictionary weather okay and it
replaces it with a proper spelling of
dictionary which of course doesn't have
a K in it so if you're ever wondering
how Microsoft coded that fine and
replace these are the methods they used
to do it so if you think you know you
know Microsoft is a bunch of genius
programmers in a program in ways that
you can never even learn well that's one
of the techniques we already learned
that we just you know learn the concept
of it instead of applying it in the main
program ball they did is they use find
if they loop through your entire
document found all the instances and
each time they found it they called this
replace and replace it with a proper
string so there you go there's a you
know nice low example of when this would
be useful in real life so with that
being said that's all this well I don't
want to say that's all the shrink
functions are probably like 200 string
functions but those are all the main
ones that I want to cover now that we
covered all the main string functions
whenever your program in games and
documents and applications later on and
we come across you know a string
function we don't have to look up what
it means again there are a bunch of
different other string functions but
these are the main ones that are going
to come across in your programming so
that being said take take a deep breath
and we only got a couple more topics to
cover so I am ready for it and to be
honest I'm getting kind of tired of
learning C++ I'm ready to move on to
game development with C++ and 3d
modeling we C++ in the fun stuff but hey
we got to cover the born stuff before we
get the fun stuff those are the rules of
life so thank you guys so much for
watching and thank you guys for sticking
with me for what was it like 73
tutorials already I had super fun I had
super you know I'm just going to quit
talking right now before I mess up
anything else but anyways thank you guys
for watching and I'll see you guys in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
