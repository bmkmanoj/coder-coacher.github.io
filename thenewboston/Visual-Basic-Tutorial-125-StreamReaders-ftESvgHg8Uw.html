slash on live gamer for the new Boston
and in this tutorial we're gonna be
talking about stream readers now if you
remember from the previous tutorials we
learned how to write text to a text file
well now we're going to be learning how
to read text from a text file so we'll
go ahead and create a new project we
will select a windows forms application
and we will call it streams again go
ahead and click OK and looks like lots
to do streams 1 click OK and wait for
that to load okay so now now that is it
has loaded we'll go ahead and add a text
box we will make it multi-line and then
we'll make it read-only so read-only is
going to be equal to true and then we'll
add a button and we will set the button
name or the text we'll set the text to
load file and we'll set the name to
button load ok so now we'll just double
click on load file and this will open up
our click event handler for it now just
like before to use any kind of any type
of stream we're gonna have to type
imports the system dot IO namespace so
this gives us the classes that we can
use to read and write to text files now
there are a bunch of other ways to read
and write to text files but this is just
how we're learning it in these tutorials
so we're gonna go ahead and declare a
stream reader so private file to load as
new stream reader and we'll go ahead and
set the path of this to the same path
that we used for the last tutorial so
we're going to get my file dot txt in
the g-drive now you can see that I have
it right here and we
can edit that with notepad plus plus and
I have hello YouTube on life gamer and
the new boss stand in there so we'll go
ahead and close this out and we'll go
ahead and minimize that so now that we
have our stream reader and we have our
location that we're going to load from
whenever that I click load what we're
going to do is type file to load dot
read and you can see that we have read
read block read line or read to end read
reads only one character read block
reads a maximum of count characters from
the current stream so you can tell it to
read a certain amount of characters you
can read one line so it really reads
until it hits an escape key or down to
the next line and it ends reading and
what we're going to use is read to end
so it's going to read everything inside
of the file so now that we've called
read to end what we're going to need to
do is put all that text inside of our
text box so we'll type text box 1 dot
text is going to be equal to whatever is
in that file so let's go ahead and run
this hopefully we won't get any errors
and now when we click load file we get
hello YouTube on live gamer and the new
Boston so we can go ahead and close out
of that and let's open my file again and
we can edit it so we'll add a visual
basic.net and programming so now that
we've added some more stuff stuff to our
text file let's go ahead and run this
again and see if it shows up when we
load the file so you can see that when
we load the file we get hello YouTube on
live gamer the new Boston visual
basic.net and programming so go ahead
and practice loading files using a
stream reader you can also load files in
add stuff to them and then save them
after that so that's what I want you
guys to do is make an app that will do
that if you don't want to you can just
go ahead and move on to the next
tutorials if not and you make one feel
free to leave it in a video response so
thanks for watching it stays tuned for
the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
