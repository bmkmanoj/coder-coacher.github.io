make a real quick tutorial because one
of my subscribers or at least viewers
sent me a message on YouTube any ask me
hey I have some pictures in my computer
of my ex-girl and I don't want my
girlfriend to find out what's the best
way to hide them so if you don't want
your girlfriend to see any pictures but
you want to keep them on your computer
even when she's snooping around here is
going to be your best options so I made
a folder right here it's called secret
but you're going to be called anything
you want I have a picture of a fat guy
and this is going to represent the
embarrassing photo of my girlfriend
right there we're going to want to hide
that one in these this is picture of a
cat and some guy with a bowl upside down
and say that we want to keep this folder
but we want to hide certain files or
certain pictures in it the best way in
the easiest way to do this is right
click whatever file you want hide go to
properties and click hidden now once you
have that check box go ahead and press
ok and as you can see your file still
appears right there so to change this
what you need to do is go to your start
panel you need to go to your control
panel go to appearance and
personalization folder options and under
your folder options under View you're
going to want to put do not show hidden
files and folders and now once you click
that and apply it anytime you change one
of your files to hidden as you can see
it's not there anymore and so whenever
your girlfriend is snooping around looks
at files oh just a cat and a bowl no fat
guys here well I guess he fooled me and
again if you want to see that file again
you just have to go click control panel
appearance and personalization folder
options view show hidden files
folders apply okay now when you're all
alone feel free to look at all the fat
guy pics or ex-girlfriend pics you want
another thing that you can do if you
don't want to only take out part of the
folder and hide an entire folder is put
your folder deep somewhere in your own
computer so put it somewhere here where
she isn't looking and when it is in
there here's what you do go to your
folder properties go to customize change
icon of your folder and change the icon
so it doesn't look like a folder change
it to something like a printer like this
if you press this and press apply and
press ok as you can see this folder is
now a picture of a printer so she's
never even going to think to look here
and that's the last people last thing
people want to click on pictures of
printers because they think as soon as
you click it you're going to have to
deal with a bunch of printer stuff so if
you do this and double click on that
look at that it still acts as a person
or as a also folder just as the before
the only difference is it now has a
different icon so again changing your
secret files to hidden and changing your
computer settings to do not show hidden
files and changing the icon of your
folder to something that's undesirable
to click on is the two best ways that
you can hide pictures of your
ex-girlfriend from your current
girlfriend so thank you for watching
