tutorial and in this story I'm going to
teach you guys how to draw circles so if
you guys are thinking about using
circles in your game which is like a
ninety-nine percent chance to probably
will this soria might be kind of useful
so let's go down to it and let's get
started now when we use our circle
function to draw it's going to take four
parameters one of them is is the screen
in the three other ones our color
position and radius so let's take care
of those right now the first is the
color function so let's go ahead and
make a basic color let's make it
something new something like 230 by 170
x 0 I just make it something random make
sure they're in range 0 from 255 so now
we got a color I have no idea what color
it is we're going to find out together
the next thing you have to do is
position your radius or excuse me
position the circle somewhere on the
screen so i'm going to put mine
somewhere in the middle and probably
need a variable first i'm going to put
the position at like three hundred
that's somewhere in the middle by 176
close enough so that's going to be
summer in right near the middle of the
screen so the last thing I need is the
radius and the radius in case you don't
know from like oh no urban ninth grade
or something the radius is the point
from the middle of your circle to the
edge of it so it's pretty much half the
diameter if you know what the diameter
is so I'm going to put the radius equal
to 60 so now we got three variables
colored position and radius so now we
can go ahead and draw our circle between
our lock and unlock so let's go ahead
and pie game a draw circle is a name for
this who would have guessed that and in
here again like I said we take four
parameters the first one is what we want
to draw two that's our screen color
which is that random color we don't know
what it is maybe you do but I don't
position make sure i spelled both of
those are right and radius so now
whenever we run this if we don't have
been errors we can go ahead and see what
we just did and as you can see we drew a
circle in the middle of her screen that
was uh I forgot there we go that was
this color evidently it's a kind of an
orange color the position was 300 across
x 176 down and the radius from this
middle point right here to any edge
doesn't really matter is 60 pixels so
this is 120 pixels wide so that is your
basics on how to draw a basic circle um
i guess if you're watching this your
challenge would be to draw a circle and
then another circle in it and whoever
can draw the best pair of boobs wins and
post it to me in a video response and i
will announce the winner and one of my
upcoming um tutorials so that is your
challenge i gave you all the skills and
tools that you need it so I bid you
farewell have fun and don't forget
subscribe and make sure to check out my
next tutorial so again thank you and
I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
