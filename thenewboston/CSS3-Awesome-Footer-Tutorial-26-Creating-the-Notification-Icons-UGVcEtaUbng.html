video and I think this is going to be
the last video so if it is it was a
pleasure working with you guys on the
greatest footer of all time in the
history of the universe and the Internet
so in this video what we're gonna do is
we're gonna add three little image icons
and I'm also gonna be showing you guys
how to make a little cheat pop up for
those people too lazy to click on the
icon and they just want a brief overview
so as you can see whenever you hover
over it a little brief drop up pretty
freakin cool but pay attention to what
I'm about to do because if you don't
you're gonna get messed up now all of
these buttons right here we were
creating as individual list items in
unordered list however for the
notifications section what we want to do
is we want to add it in a separate
unordered list so before we were working
in this unordered list but now go
outside your unordered list and create a
new unordered list so unordered list
unordered lists and guys make sure that
you are still in the footer itself or
else it'll disappear somewhere in the
web page so inside your footer but
outside your unordered list create a new
unordered list and give this the ID of
notification is plural
I sound like a little bumble bee that's
embarrassing
now anytime you add a list item to this
with a special class it's going to
create this little section right here so
basically we're saying okay we want to
work in the footer but we don't want to
create a normal button like this and
this is gonna allow you to create these
cool little notification icons so each
list item here instead of a button is an
image or a notification icon so let's go
ahead and create a very simple one right
now so let's go ahead and create like
this Twitter one we'll say we're
creating this is that all the
housekeeping to make sure it's you know
spaced properly and now a
href of course this would link to you
know Twitter maybe or whoever but you
need to give this the class of
notification icon now that's very
important and actually let me go ahead
and my anchor right there now in between
this anchor you're going to have one
thing and one thing only in that's an
image now the image of course you can
either go ahead and you know copy image
URL if you want to use mine or use your
own image but depending on the size um
how big you made your footer is how big
you want to make your images so you know
just keep that point in mind many ways
in between your anchor add image um you
know the source would be whatever you
want like a Twitter JPEG or Twitter DUP
ping for right now I'm just gonna make a
blank image and that is all you do so
again I want to recap one last time
because this is actually your very
important outside your unordered list
that you made railer buttons and make
another unordered list but give it the
idea of notifications all of your
notifications going here this is a list
item this is a list item this is a list
item so we created one list item which
is basically an image which was actually
a link so whenever you click that it
takes you to somewhere now if you go
ahead and copy this you know say that
one would be your Twitter this one would
be you know your Google+ and this last
one I want to make different because
note that on some of them you can just
you know have it click it take you to
your inbox or take you to your friend or
crest but you can also have a special
one where if you hover over it you have
actually let me scroll so that looks in
you have notifications that appear in it
allows the user to more easily see and
more quickly see their notifications so
who posted on your wall who liked your
picture so on and so forth so as you can
see this little hover that appears
whenever the or text that appears
whenever the user hovers over the icon
has three different sections each with a
small line in between them similar to
the programs menu so let me show you
guys that do that okay so right after
your image link right here in one of the
sections anytime you want a span this is
what you need to do and let me make sure
that I get this right image make sure
that you guys can see what's going on
and how am I gonna line this up probably
like this would be the best way yeah I
think that's the best way all right
so remember you want to make sure that
this goes in between your image tags
because you want to add a span here now
maybe it'll be better if I show you guys
all right where yeah where yet where you
all right right here now what we said is
whenever we create a link with a class
notification icons and we created a link
with a class notification icon and that
needs to be plural I'm going to check
that
s s s and whenever we hover over it we
want a span to display now this span
right here that we developed is the
thing that pops up it's basically the
drop menu so span equals drop up menu
now by default it doesn't display only
displays on hover so again by default
displays none display block which
basically means display when you hover
over the link so span</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
