with another Adobe After Effects cs6
tutorial this time we're going to be
talking about position on the graph
editor because it's different than any
of the other values here so it won't be
the same as rotation because it has
different coordinates so let's get
started here I'm gonna click on position
and go into the graph editor and let's
see what my settings are okay now you
can see that there are two different
colored lines here one is for the x-axis
and one is for the Y values I mean X
values and Y values as I hover over you
can see that green is y and X is red and
this will always be the same it's not
gonna change color and then if you have
the position in 3d you can I can make
this 3d by clicking on the on this
little cube here this 3d cube and it
adds the Z value which U is represented
by blue now you can't edit these X Y and
Z's in the graph editor but you can edit
the speed which is this white line here
and that's how you'll be editing the
editing the position values you you got
to edit the position values up here in
the comp so if I edit this then you can
see how the graph changes you can see
that the green line will lower or dip or
or whatever I do too if I move it so
that's pretty much how you read that
graph you can tell in pixels where the
position is by holding over the line in
the graph editor
and that's just a quick intro to
position keyframes and I'll get more
into them later because position is
probably one of the harder things to
learn how to make realistic there's
different types of keyframes that we can
go over in the future about making
you're making your position look a
little nicer and how to edit the graph
to make your position keyframes look
nicer and have a nice smooth realistic
animation so looking forward to teaching
you guys that in future tutorial we will
I will see you guys later
and make sure you guys have a good
weekend</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
