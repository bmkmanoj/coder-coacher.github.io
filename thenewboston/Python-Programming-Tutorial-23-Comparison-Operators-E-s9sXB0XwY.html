python tutorial and in this tutorial I'm
going to talk to you guys about
different ways to test stuff now so far
the only test I showed you guys is
double equals to say that one thing is
equal to another thing but there's also
different ways you can test and those
include the less than sign like 9 is
less than 7 which would give you false
the greater than sign and of course just
that's just that you can also do the
less than or equal sign which is like 9
is less than which is not or equal to 9
it's not less than but is equal to so it
would be true um you can do therefore
greater equal to in something that you
guys might not know how to syntax ghost
is explanation point equals and this
means it's the opposite of this
explanation point equals it means not
equals to so is 9 not equal to 3 it's
true because it's not equal 3 without 9
not equal to 9 so anything besides
itself would be true so those are some
different tests besides equals equal is
that we're going to be using the test
number strings and stuff like that so um
I'll repeat it again when I'm testing
but just be aware for now another thing
is that people use a lot but is
different it's called the is operator
now what the is operator is is a lot
like the double equal sign but it's a
little bit different say you have a list
like 1 equals 21 22 23 just create that
and we have list 2 which equals 21 22 23
now if you put 1 is equal to 2 it's
going to come out as true because the
lists have the exact same value but if
we have 1 is 2 it's going to be false
because the only way in is can be true
it's the same object so for example you
have one and equals actually let's get
some new variables three and oops has a
new one equals four equals a list of
like three four or five if you have
three is four then that would be true
never mind this that's a key that
accidentally hit so the only way and is
would be true is if that they are
actually the same object like this even
though this and this have equal value
once you put is it's not false because
even though they're equal one is not
actually two they're not actually the
same object in on the subject of weird
comparisons there's also the in we
talked about earlier so say we have a
variable called a pizza and set it equal
to something called Pizza Hut and we can
test using the in or let me just show
you guys say test for s in pizza and
it's going to come across as false
because the letter S is not anywhere in
the value of pizza which is Pizza Hut
but if we test it for something like p
and pizza on keyboard then it would be
true because there is a p in pizza so
that is just what the in operator means
in that's just a different way where you
can use compare and we can use it in if
statements like get my cursor if p in
pizza and that can actually be a test
condition then you can run a block of
code or right here so that's how you use
in and is and test conditions such as
like if statements and loops that we're
going to be learning later on and stuff
like that so again those are some
different ways to compare including the
is operator in the in operator so uh
pay attention love
we'll be using those a little later on
so I thank you guys for watching make
sure to subscribe and I'll see you next
