optical so they're gonna use shadows and
lights kind of more like opacity is
getting changed in some of them but
there you go
mechanical
kind of like a machine is being used to
put these guys on these bad reception
things that deal with things that things
that deal with machines I guess so this
one's like a TV Pistons
I guess yeah I'm sure you guys can
figure it out but that's a machine
related text effects
we got miscellaneous here which is gonna
be a bunch of random stuff so you'll
just have to come in and see if there's
anything you like in here I'll go on to
the next one because this one's not easy
to explain multi-line so if you have
several lines of text there you go
and there we go that's multi lines of
text Organic is things that like kind of
like flow and nicely I guess
so these ones are moving in like a more
organic kind of way organic usually
means like alive pretty much in visual
effects so you've got things that are
like mechanical that move in a very set
pattern like up and down or left and
right and then you've got things that
are organic that move around as and in
like a more alive fashion paths these
are gonna follow a path
so I'm sure these will come in with a
path I included with them so let's go to
the next one rotation and I'm sure you
guys get to these things just rotate
around just like something like this on
really know when you would use it maybe
even like a circus or something like
that who knows let's go to scale and you
probably realize that they're just gonna
scale up or scale down or whatever easy
enough and all these things can be
created using your animation properties
with the animation text and tracking
so I mean this seems to be like the
amount of space in between the letters
is what this tracking seems to mean so
they get closer together or further
apart so that's it for your text presets
and then you can find other presets in
here also I mean I'm not gonna go all of
them right now but there's the color
correction presets that I added in
before and we won't be able to see them
on any footage because they are now they
don't have a video preview file
associated with them like the text does
things like the sound effects don't have
a video preview file so we can grab them
either so all I'm sure of right now is
the the text I didn't really go through
all these because I haven't been in the
abridge program you know in a little
while but you guys can use this to view
After Effects presets there are and just
mess around with it and see what's got
going on now I'll go over a bridge at
another time but I just wanted to show
you the text presets because we've been
going over them recently so you can
always create those presets on your own
when you click on this animate button it
and add any of these things in there
like the tracking will be right here and
then we have like organic which will use
like your different transfer your
different transform properties here and
then you got your fill and Stroke one
that you can create any of these things
on your own so just when you bring them
in you can always edit to them and we
have gone over how to use the this
animate and how to use the different
property selectors and the range
selectors and the wigglies and all that
stuff so put all your knowledge to good
use to be a pro at using text presets
and be and a pro at using typography go
on the internet and look at what other
people have done and get some nice
inspiration and try to make something
really cool like those guys have
and a base your work off them and even I
mean you basing your work off of
somebody else's text is not cheating or
anything like that it's just making
things better so well everybody thanks
for watching this one and I hope you
have a good day today see in the next
tutorial bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
