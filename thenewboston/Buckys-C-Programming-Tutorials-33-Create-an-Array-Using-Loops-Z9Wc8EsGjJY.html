oral and in this story I'm going to
teach you guys an easier and quicker way
to create an array and that's through
the use of loops so in the last tutorial
I tell you guys what an array was and
also that we can create an array using
something called an array initializer
list and this is actually pretty useful
when you're dealing with smaller arrays
but whenever we're working with bigger
arrays say that store a hundred elements
or a thousand elements we're going to
need a quicker way to create that array
instead of making a huge long list so
let me go ahead and show you guys
exactly how to do that so in our very
first line we're going to declare our
array we aren't going to set it equal to
any values just yet so I'm going to make
an array called Bucky and Bucky can hold
nine integers so in this line of code
we're pretty much telling our compiler
and compiler whenever you run this
program you better set aside some space
in our memory enough space to hold a
nine integers so our compiler says yes
sir now what we need to do is well let
me just go ahead and whenever I'm done
with this tutorial I'm going to print
out the elements on one side and the
value so I might as well give it a nice
little prompt now element and value so
what we're going to be doing is we're
just going to print out the element on
one side and the value on the other side
so let's go ahead and take a look at
this right now one space for elements
and I'm going to list those on this side
and right across from it I'm going to
list their values right here so we're
saying all right you talk to talk now
time to walk to walk one way to create
an array like I said before is the use
of loops and in this tutorial I'm going
to be using the for loop so let's go
ahead and see what parameters we add for
this so we already know that whenever we
create an array that holds the nine
elements every array starts at zero so I
think whenever we created this int X
zero would be a good place to start and
we also know that if we created an array
that can hold nine integers the last
index in that an array excuse me the
less index in that array is going to be
8 because count with me get your fingers
out 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 I only counted to
8 but since we had 0 in there that takes
care of our 9 elements pretty cool huh
so we only want to loop from 0 to 8 so
that's why you're right X is less than 9
we can make it easier X is less than or
equal to 8 oops not X comment less than
or equal to 8 either way it works fine X
is less than 9 is a little bit quicker
but you know what's one extra character
so now of course we're going to use X
plus plus the increment X by one each
time so now whenever we see out X and
line let's go just go ahead and run this
real quick so I can show you guys we get
that 0 through 8 and you're saying
that's pretty cool
so now we have the numbers 0 through 8
and those just happen to be the exact
numbers that we need in our array so now
what we can do is something like this
Bucky X equals 99 or something stupid so
what this is going to do is it's going
to go through your array each element
one by one and assign the value 99 so
the first time it loops it's going to
set the Bucky zero element to 99 the
next time the Bucky one element to 99 so
it's basically going to set every
element in your array to 99 until it
gets to eight and then it's going to do
it one more time and stop at 9 so pretty
cool huh so let's go ahead and print
this out and see exactly what I did so
see out first we'll go ahead and print
out X which is the element number same
as this so this is going to be 0 through
8 on the left-hand side and now just go
ahead and give us some space to work
with
and after this just go ahead and write
the value of whatever element is stored
in there so this is going to be 99 if we
coded it correctly so let me go ahead
and end this line and whenever I run
this you guys will clearly see what's
going on so what we did is we loop
through each array element one at a time
first Bucky 0 then Bucky 1 the monkey 2
3 4 all the way to 8 in each time we
loop through it we set that element
equal to 99 so now we have an array
called Bucky that has nine elements 1 2
3 4 5 6 7 8 9 and each of those elements
is equal to the value of 99 there are
actually a lot of nines in this soil but
you know it's good number so you know it
feels appropriate so let me talk you
guys through this one more time in the
code in this line of code we're
basically declaring a 9 element Bucky
array we're telling our computer make
sure you set set aside enough space to
hold 9 integers in the array Bucky so it
that's what it did in this line and this
line all we did was print out a title
basically and in our loop we knew that
since we're creating Bucky 9 array that
the indexes that it need was 0 through 8
so we made a simple loop that basically
loop through the numbers 0 through 8 in
with those numbers we could reference
the Bucky element and assign it equal to
the value of 99 for each one and then of
course we just printed out the index
which was 0 through 8 and then the value
which was 99 each time so simple enough
so that is basically two different ways
to create an array um again whenever
you're working with a really big arrays
in I don't know it's just a lot easier
than using an initializer list because
if you created an initializer list with
like a hundred values then you would go
ahead and have to type a hundred values
in here and it will just get messy
really quick so this is a faster way um
it takes a little more thinking but it's
definitely worth it so for now that's
all I have for you guys thank you
thanks for watching don't forget
subscribe and I will see you next door
