new tutorial diet you pumped up
hopefully not because if I did then that
would be a little weird but anyways in
this video I'm gonna talk about
formatting a worksheet I cannot say that
word work sheet I would say work chic
what the heck is that I don't know maybe
I'll just keep saying it who cares
what are you going to do oh all right
I'm just kidding so the reason I want to
talk to you guys about this is because a
lot of the time whenever you have data
that you're working with in Excel it's
going to look ugly by default one of the
biggest case scenarios of this happening
is whenever you're looking at a website
and this website I just found it pretty
much in this example go to any website
with the table on it and try copying it
and pasting it in Excel if you want to
use this example this is the URL and
what this website is is it's basically a
table of McDonald's food and all the
calorie information all the nutritional
facts so for example the Big Mac it
gives the calories total fat yada yada
yada but anyways like I said just go to
the internet and find any table and say
that you wanted to crunch some numbers
in Excel or turn this into a spreadsheet
so what you can do is actually just copy
this I'm just going to go ahead and copy
that and also I want to point out for
this example
apparently McDonald's has a crapload of
food on the menu that I didn't realize
and I don't want to work with all of
this so I'm just going to grab the
burgers and sandwiches at the top
alright so anyways I copied that and in
Excel I'm working with a blank worksheet
go ahead and just paste it in alright so
looking pretty ugly right now I mean
this is really hard to read I have like
a random column over here and okay as it
says burgers and sandwiches on four
different lines instead of on one nice
one so we paste it in the data and it
wasn't exactly as expected so
first thing I like to do whenever I
start cleaning up data is just look for
crap that I don't need so this column it
accidentally grabbed some blank thing so
I'm just going to select that
right-click and delete it so now I don't
have any blank column another thing that
I want to do is who is texting me right
now Gerrard asking if I did my fantasy
hockey thing all right so another thing
is this row right here this is pretty
much it's a blank row and websites have
these blank rows a lot because it just
makes your data look a bit a little bit
prettier and easier to read but for
Excel it's going to cause some problems
if we're trying to add up columns or
total numbers or anything like that so
I'm going to go ahead and right-click
and delete that all right so all the
extra crap is deleted we did it manually
simple enough it took like two seconds
so now let's go ahead and make this a
little bit more readable so the first
thing I want to do is actually just get
rid of all the default styling this is
bold um you know this is a different
text than this and I don't know they're
all different sizes let's just go ahead
and wipe everything away and start from
scratch so what we do is we need to
select the entire worksheet so this
little symbol right here between the
column names in the row names with a
little arrow click that and it's going
to select every single cell so now in
order to clear the formatting make sure
you're in your Home tab now in your
ribbon in this little editing section
you see this little clear icon now if
you hover over it it says delete
everything in the cell we don't want to
do that all we want to do is we want to
remove the formatting so click the arrow
and drop down to clear formats and check
this out holy-moly it just looks like 10
times better already so basically what
it does is it wipes away any styling any
bold any variances and font-family any
differences in font sizes it pretty much
takes all those away and
you default styling or default format
pretty sweet so it already looks a bunch
better but check it out
we still have a couple problems and
that's I don't know all of these are
getting cut off they're not the proper
width okay I can't read any sandwiches
and I need to know what ones I can eat
for my diet so of course we have a
couple options we can go through each
column ok double click that at Auto
fetch double click ok this is taking a
while so what is the shortcut to pretty
much resize automatically every single
column in a row well go ahead and select
your entire worksheet work sheet again
that's going to tick me off in like 10
minutes go like it's already taking me
off or whatever alright so the first
thing that we want to do is in this home
tab in your ribbon go over to cells and
we want to format the cells so in this
drop-down the first thing I always do is
hit auto fit column width
so as you can see it automatically
resize each column it's basically the
equivalent of going through each column
in doing this one by one but it does it
for you all in one click of the button
now you can also do this through the
rows right now all my rows look pretty
good but if they were different sizes
like this I just mess them up real quick
then what you can do is just again
select all the cells format auto fit row
height and it makes all my rows auto fit
to a consistent height pretty sweet the
style sheet is already looking pretty
dang good so actually I got I don't know
I always like when I'm at 6 or 7 minutes
in my video I'm like should I continue
or should I just stop and go on in the
next tutorial so actually I'm going to
wait to the next video because I don't
know I like to break it up into little
pieces so thank you guys for watching
for now in the next story I'm going to
show you guys some cool ways that you
can align the text in these cells and
you're actually going to do
this pretty much every single time
whenever you throw data into your Excel
workbook so it's going to be handy thank
you for watching I'll see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
