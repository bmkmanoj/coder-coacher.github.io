tutorial and in this tutorial I'm gonna
be talking to you guys about arguments
and functions now what those are is
what's inside the parenthesis so example
four last time we had square root and we
had a number like six point three four
whatever's inside these parenthesis or
parameters is called the argument now as
you see square root only takes one
argument but some math functions take
more than one and some taken none at all
so that's what we're gonna be going over
today and I hope you understand how to
use functions that require more than one
or none at all
so we have our basics right here and
inside our function body let's type a
couple of statements the first thing
that we want to do is declare our first
variable so let's make a variable called
num one and it's going to be a real
number so let's write double and let's
use the power of function so we put num1
equals power
remember less than we use square root
this time we're gonna use the power and
that's pio w thats built right in and as
you can see right now when you're using
power you always have two numbers such
as 6 to the power of 8 or 2 to the power
of 4 right now let's do 2 to the power
of 4 and to do this put 2 point 0 comma
4.0 and what this does is automatically
assigned to ^ 4 that's a function built
right in and how you separate functions
with more than one argument is with a
comma so again a comma separates
arguments that have more than one and
again if I had just one you would just
type it in plain like that but since
this one has two I'm gonna separate that
with a comma
now let's output it on the screen
remember see out and let's just type
num1 and actually let's begin a new line
so as you can see we declared a variable
we set that variable equal to the power
of 2 to the fourth what should be 16 I
believe and then we put we just
outputted it right on the screen so
let's save that compile and run and as
you can see we have 16
and that's how you use a math function
with more than one argument but let's
say there's a math function with no
arguments
such as a function random number and to
do that just type in the word or and and
this will provide a random number to our
user and as you can see you don't need
to type in a number or anything like
that because our C math library is gonna
make a random number right for us so
let's execute compile and run hopefully
I don't have any errors and our random
number it generated this time is 41 and
that's just a random number didn't come
from anywhere but space so as you can
see some doan math functions have one
such as square root - such as power and
or none at all such as random numbers so
I hope you can understand arguments and
functions and remember inside the
parentheses are called parameters they
just call parameters instead of
parentheses for because I want to sound
cool so I hope you enjoyed my video I
hope you learned something about
functions remember to subscribe to my
channel if you like my videos thanks for
