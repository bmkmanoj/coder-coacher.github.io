Touro in JavaScript and in this lesson
I'm going to be talking to you guys
about something called loops now a loop
is extremely useful in JavaScript in
pretty much every computer program
language because it basically saves time
anytime you need to do something
repetitive a loop comes in handy for
example if you wanted to write like um
document dot write that's very something
super I love Rebecca black and if you
wanted to write this like ten times on
the screen then yes you could go ahead
and copy this and paste pace pace pace
pace pace pace but you know what that's
going to get jumbled look how messy it
is already in you know it's just not a
very efficient way of doing things so
would it be cool if there is a way where
we could take a line of code and write
at once and just tell JavaScript
do that ten times or do that 20 times or
do it 100 times well it's going to save
you a whole lot of typing so let me show
you guys one way to do that one way to
do that is called the for loop and it's
f o R in the syntax the basic body to
set up this loop is for and then you
write two parentheses and in your curly
braces or curly brackets what's a heck
is like the regular the professional
educational name for these because I
always always say curly braces and I
know they're not parentheses because
these are parentheses so if someone
knows let me know send me a message so
anyways this syntax for this is you have
four and inside here you're going to
tell how many number of times the run
and here you write what bit of code do
you want to run so document dot write
and then just go ahead and write um you
know
I love Rebecca black and let's go ahead
and add a break to that actually that
needs to be in here brick and this would
just whenever we print it out Oh move on
to the next line so you're saying all
right simple no but you don't go ahead
and just write a number like 10 in there
or else whenever you try to run it it's
not going to work that would just be way
too easy for syntax or excuse me the for
loop is set up in a very specific way
it takes three different statements
inside this little condition the first
statement is you need to make a variable
and you need to give it a starting point
so you actually don't even need the name
var like that you just need to go ahead
and name it because it's going to be
expecting a variable so go ahead and
make a variable named X and set it equal
to zero zero and one is basically always
your starting point and now you need to
give it an ending point so you don't
just say something like x equals 60 you
actually need to say X is less than 10
in the reasoning behind this is X is
going to start zero and it's going to
keep printing this out until X reaches
above ten so ever saying all right so is
it automatically going to add one to it
each time or add 3 to it each time or
how do I know how much to increment X by
each time well that is actually the last
statement we're going to put the last
statement is how much do you want that
value to go up by so remember that X
plus plus plus plus was a special sign
for add a 1 to it each time so you can
put something like X plus equals 3 and
now if we go ahead and save this it's
going to print it out four times and it
printed this out 4 times because the
first time it said x equals zero so is 0
less than 10 yes so print it out the
next time is 3 6 &amp;amp; 9 so 0 3 6 &amp;amp; 9 is 4
times where it's less than 10
next time 12 it's greater than 10 so
that's why it doesn't run so that's what
you can do but most people just always
put X plus plus and this means start at
0 go all the way until you get more than
10 so let's go ahead and save this and
check it out it starts at 0 it goes 0
and I'm talking what the value of x is
right now x equals 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
and then the next one when X is equal to
10 it doesn't print out in the reasoning
behind this is is 10 less than 10 no 10
is equal to 10 so that's why it doesn't
print out so that is how you can get
Java Script to print out a certain line
or a certain bit of code a certain
number of times you can either do this
and you know you can start at 5 and you
can go to you know 450 if you want by
once check it out refresh oh yeah look
that huge list there I love Rebecca
Black's so anyways just keep this in
mind if you ever like get in trouble in
school and as your punishment you have
to type out I love Rebecca black which
would be a very good punishment 150
times this is a nice little trick to
save you from actually having to type it
out so um that's all I have for you guys
for this story I hope you guys enjoyed
and uh yeah I guess I'll see you in the
next door</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
