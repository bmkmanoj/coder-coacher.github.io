tutorial and in this tutorial I'm going
to show you guys what to do when you're
done making all your tables so I showed
you guys how to make one table right
here and you probably then have a couple
more but once you're done making all of
your tables this is what you need to do
the first thing you're going to need to
do is make an else statement since this
whole thing right here is a big if
statement and as you can see it ends
right here
there is our curly brace from it so now
we need to make the else so the if
statement is if all of this happens if
all this goes right
but if else and this is going to what's
happen this is what's going to happen if
everything goes wrong let's just make an
echo wrong confirmation code add a
semicolon so if everything goes right
then it's going to insert all this data
into the database but if something goes
wrong then we just want you to echo run
confirmation code now outside your echo
statement we want you to do something
that says all right if you did all of
this and you didn't have wrong
confirmation code then if um we're going
to put if result number two which is uh
let's see where as a result number two
right here that was supposed to be
result two actually if you inserted this
data successfully then we want to take
you to another page that says are a
thank you for registering and you can
now log in because if all of their
information is correct and inside inside
the permanent database then they're
they're then going to be able to login
so to do that this is what you need to
do let me try to move this up a little
bit so you guys can see a little better
all right you have to write if and then
in your parameters right result two then
inside your instructions what we want to
do is put header and what this built-in
function does is redirect your website
so we're going to write header and put
double quotation marks location colon
confirmation two dot PHP or actually we
can just make it a HTML website censor
is not going to be any PHP on it so
let's I'm going to copy this and so I'm
going to show you guys what this site
actually looks like so if everything
goes right and if this result two worked
out fine it's going to take you to a new
web page that's going to say well I'll
show you guys what it says later
actually I'll show you guys why not
right now why not here is my website
right here let's go to score com
confirmation to HTML this is what your
site's going to end up look like it's
going to say your account has been
successfully activated please log in
here and as you can see I have this is
HTML extension instead of a PHP
extension and this is because
this isn't any PHP code right here this
is just a regular plain old website with
a regular link to go home to a tecora
com so you can just again if result
number two then it's just going to
redirect you to another page saying
thank you but if none of that does go
right then we're going to need to build
actually if none of that goes right then
you're pretty much screwed so you don't
really need a else statement but let's
alright another if statement since if
that does go right we're going to want
to do one last thing and remember from
before we took all of their information
and put it into a temporary table and if
they click that link and every
right we turn it into a permanent user
table so all that information from the
temporary table is still there just
taking up our space in our server so if
everything goes right and your data is
already in your permanent table why do
you need it in your temporary table so
if everything goes right removed from
temporary table and this is how you do
that make one last SQL function I will
name that SQL five and again our
quotation marks as always and say delete
from temp where and again anything
that's capitalized you need the same as
me but anything that's lower cased
that's going to be your table name
delete from temp word code is equal to
and remember our variable is called
what was it called passkey and since
this is the same variable we didn't
change it it's going to take all your
information from where you had that
temporary data look for the passkey and
it's going to delete it and if you're
saying why would I want to delete that
is because you already have the
information now if result 2 which means
if all the information was stored in
your permanent database you can delete
it from your temporary so the last thing
the very last thing we need to do
finally is make what the heck was that
result 5 and we want to set this equal
to my SQL whoa whoa whoa Bessie what am
i doing now my SQL underscore query and
in your empty parameters type SQL 5 and
what this is going to do is pretty much
perform the action so in this tutorial
we learn how to take if everything went
alright we learned how to direct you to
a website saying thank you you can now
log in and in the next tutorial we're
actually going to be learning how to
create a session and how to have the
user log into their account and lastly
we took
all their information from the temporary
database and we deleted that this is
actually optional or right here you
don't have to delete it but why would
you want it in there it's just going to
take up space and it's just a neat
little trick so thank you guys for
watching again I'm going to be posting
all of this on my website the new Boston
comm so if you don't feel like typing
all this and you just want to go ahead
and get creating your game just go ahead
go with my website copy all of this and
just paste it right in your code so
again that's the new Boston comm so
study this I hope to see you next
tutorial and I'll see you next time and
don't forget to subscribe thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
