Photoshop cs6 tutorial where we're going
to learn about how to use the Dodge and
burn tools what these tools are used for
is to lighten or darken specific areas
of the image and you use a brush tool to
pretty much get exactly what you want to
modify now to lighten up the shadow
areas of an image you would want to use
the Dodge tool and absolutely if you
wanted to darken areas of an image you
want to use the burn tool now those
tools are over here in the tools panel
and they're over here in this section
where there's either a like lollipop
looking signal or icon or a hand and
then there's also the sponge tool within
it and I'll talk about the sponge tool
in a later tutorial and go over more in
depth about that but this time I'm just
going to stick with the burn and dodge
tool so let me show you what the burn
tool actually does and I'll just
duplicate my layer that way I can do a
comparison this is going to darken the
image so I'll just pick up something
that's really bright such as this shirt
here and I'll just keep on using this
burn tool in here to make it a little
darker and now you can see it looks like
it's actually burning it the the shirt
so that's what the burn tool does so if
you got something that's like a
highlight that's like blasting out your
pictures maybe like a window that's
really really bright and you can't even
tell what the hell it is it then you
would want to use this tool I'm going to
go back in my history to the very to
where I duplicated the layer so that
none of the burn tool is on there now
let's check out the Dodge tool now this
is going to lighten stuff up so if I
come down here to where it's all dark
and stuff on the bottom of the shirt and
I start applying this you can see that
it's lightening up the bottom of the
shirt
and you just hold click and hold and you
just drag around it let's see here
alright so that's a pretty much been
lined up and we can compare it by
looking at the comparing by turning off
the visibility of the background copy
and comparing it to the untouched
background and now you can see how much
different it has been lined up so that's
how you use the Dodge tool now there are
a couple options up here and the menu
bar up here that you can use to
customize your tools we've got the range
here and you can affect the shadows the
mid-tones or the highlights and I'm sure
you guys know what those are so I'm not
gonna go over those too much and then
we've got exposure next to it now
exposure is pretty much the intensity so
if I put the exposure all the way up to
100% there we go and I start trying to
lighten stuff up you can see immediately
that it's lighting things up and I'll
just go back and forth
obviously there we go and I'm gonna step
back in the history real quick and now
I'm just gonna put it down to its lowest
amount 1% and start trying to use it and
you can tell there's not as much of a
change so it's a little lighter on there
and then I'll do you can barely tell any
difference I can kind of see it probably
because it's on my own screen but
hopefully you guys might not be able to
see it not hopefully I'm sorry I said
that you guys might not be able to see
it on your screen because it's such a
miniscule value so it's good to keep it
around 50 and if you really really need
to lighten something up a lot put it at
a hundred percent if you don't need to
then put it at one percent this checkbox
here called protect tones is a you can
turn it on or off obviously and you just
check it too to minimize the clipping
and reduce
shifting and I'll just turn that off
real quick let's put this at a hundred
percent and then you can see how this
works
you can see that the hue is definitely
shifted it's changing all this and it's
not really blending in it with our
blending in with what you're using too
much so usually you want to have the
protect tones on so that doesn't happen
so here's protect tones and you can see
that there it protects basically to you
the same options are on the burn tool as
well so these are pretty much one are
pretty much the same tool but they do
opposite things so we can choose our
different brushes here the hardness is
going to show how much like pretty much
it fades into the image so with a
hardness of a hundred percent you're
going to be able to definitely tell the
edges of your definitely tell the edges
of your work of your brushstrokes now if
I put this to something like 25 percent
its close close to 25 percent it's a
little harder to tell where and and it
kind of blends in more so usually when
you're using these you want to use the
soft brush so keep it down pretty low
and that's my opinion so there there's
the the basics of the burn tool in the
Dodge tool so use them if you want to
lighten or darken things and you need to
get like a specific thing so they're
good because you can just apply it to
certain parts of the image you can get
exactly what you want with the brushes
and if these circular brushes don't work
for you you can always change to
different looking brushes like this ones
like the splatter splattered brush and
you get different like effects like that
if you use the different brushes
obviously so thanks for watching this
tutorial be sure to check out some more
tutorials on Bucky's room goerge and
just look around
I'm gonna want everybody good luck on
your projects</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
