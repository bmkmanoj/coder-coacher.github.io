tutorial that I'm making for the new
Boston and in this tutorial we're gonna
continue working on the writer class but
before we do anything in this tutorial
just make sure that you have a method to
write all these different data types
right here alright so once you have all
that done just go ahead and create a new
method to write a string so just save
public Lloyd Wright drink alright and
then just have user pass through the
string that they want to write a string
to right
alright and we're just gonna use the
write method inside of the binary writer
class to write our string so we can just
say pw dot right and you think you could
just pass through a string right here
but if you ever pass through a string
just write through this right method
inside of this binary writer class what
it's going to do is it's going to write
the string but before it writes the
string this is going to have a body with
a length of the string so if we were to
write Adam I'd write out a DA and then
right before it would write the length
of the string which is four so write out
a zero four out there so when it goes to
read it it would read zero hornbook
alright we're going to read off four
characters to get the string well we
don't need to do that because in our
reader class we have to user specify how
long your string is so we don't need to
write the length a string before they'll
just make it all messed up so what we're
gonna have to do is to learn the string
into a character array and write as a
character array so just going to say to
write and then convert that into a
character right all right and now if
once we do that it won't actually write
the length of the string before it will
just simply write out the characters
alright so the next thing we have to do
is create a method to write unicode
strings so just going to say public void
right unicode and now we're just gonna
have you
scusi unicode's during that they want
written and remember Unicode strings
each character takes up two bytes and
they're used to write strange characters
usually like applications dealing with
multiple languages all right so we can
call this to write right here and since
each character takes up two bytes we're
gonna have to use the encoding class to
actually convert it into a Unicode
string so what we're gonna be right here
is just say all right called baccarat
equals and then we're just gonna use the
ternary operator to see what type of or
what the byte order is so it's gonna say
if the byte order is a big-endian now
we're just going to convert this string
that they pass through here and to
big-endian so it's going to say if it's
big endian then we're going to set this
byte array called buck right here equal
to the bytes of a big-endian unicode
string so we're going to say code pink
dot big endian unicode since it will do
this if the buy orders big endian and
then instead of getting the string we're
actually going to want to get the bytes
from the string so we're just going to
pass through the string that we want to
convert them to Unicode bytes and that
would be just to write string right
there
but if it's little endian then we're
gonna want to convert it into little
endian unicode sorts gonna say encoding
dot plain old unicode is this little
endian unicode and then we want to get
the bytes or a little on Unicode out of
this string right here so it's gonna
pass through to run all right so
basically what this will do right here
is just if the by order that the user
set is big endian and it's gonna convert
this string into big and unicode bytes
if it's little endian then it's going to
convert the string into little endian
unicode bytes and now we have this fire
a called pop rivets equal for those
bytes that we want to write so we're
just gonna write them using the write
method inside of the binary writer class
they're just going to pass through that
buffer right there all right so now we
just have two methods to write that to
be different
strings so that's pretty much it for
this tutorial
so see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
