Android tutorial for the new boss in
what we're gonna do is we're gonna set
up kind of our widget class again called
pointless widget and we're just gonna
get this working and show you guys some
of the methods that we can use and
create a widget we need to extend from
our extends the app widget provider
because again this is a provider that
we're working with and we again just
import this and let's see what methods
we can use for this so we're just going
to right click source override implement
methods and as you can see we can use
five methods on DeLeon disabled enabled
receive and update we're gonna click
update because that's gonna be the most
important one again within our XML file
we called this update to happen roughly
every 30 minutes and again that's just a
rough estimate it's not exact so keep
that in mind if if your activity isn't
where your widget isn't updating exactly
at 30 minutes it's just kind of rough
timeframe that we're gonna work with and
it's gonna call this update method we're
also gonna do the delete method and
again if you guys remember and I'm just
gonna move this up above the delete
method and as you guys remember when I
dragged that that that widget into the
trash can what it does is it calls this
on delete method so what I did is I
created a toast to make sure that this
method was being called and you know at
least that's what I did when I first
started working with widgets and you
know it's always a good good idea just
to create toast and display them and
hopefully they show up when they're
supposed to so we're just gonna say
toast make text we're gonna refer to the
context that's being passed in as you
can see we get a context called context
so that's we're gonna refer to and then
all we're gonna do is display a text
like see you sucka
and you know something like that and
also set the duration so just toast that
set short and all we have to do is dot
show shot show and there we go well
we'll show this toast when we delete our
widget just kind of an introduction for
creating a widget
this on delete method hopefully you guys
kind of understand that and then what we
want this widget to do within the update
method is change change that bottom
textview to a random number and we've
worked with like random before when we
were doing random colors for text play
activity but again just to review it's
pretty simple we're just gonna create a
random object called our set this equal
the new random and then we're all we're
gonna do is say int ran random and so
that's equal to r dot next we wanted to
find how many you know numbers that can
choose from so we're just gonna say
something like that so has a lot of
numbers to choose from and then all
we're gonna do is convert that's that
into a string because again our textview
it displays a string so we're gonna call
this R and set that equal to the string
value of the nth so we're gonna say
string value of our integer which we
called random and so there we go every
time this you know we call this update
method we're gonna get a random string
which is going to be basically a random
integer and convert it into a string
we're gonna display that I don't want to
get too too much into you know I don't
want move too fast so that's probably
gonna be it for this tutorial
again the update method is called when
we defined it within our widget stuff
XML or provider here and that's
hopefully gonna be every year roughly
every 30 minutes and also I don't know
if you guys want to do this I'm gonna do
this just to show you guys examples but
I deleted the config and we're gonna add
that back later but so you can either
delete that and re put it in later when
I do or you know leave it in there as
well and just look at the examples I'm
gonna show you guys and the next few
tutorials so hopefully I'll see you guys
in and have a good day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
