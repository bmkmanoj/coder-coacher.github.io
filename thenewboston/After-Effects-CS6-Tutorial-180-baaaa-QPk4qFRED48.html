Effects cs6 tutorial I'm your host of
buddy blackford and earlier I was trying
to make a tutorial about how to
composite this scene into this
background composite this hand and gun
into the background and I ran across
this After Effects
what they call it an easter egg I'm like
what the hell I thought my computer had
a virus or something like that and I was
like trying to figure it out but my
computer bought at me like a sheep and I
was like man I'm I going nuts or
something like that so I looked it up
and apparently you can come up to if you
like click on a layer and you come up to
it where it says compositing and then it
says gun right there if you hold shift
and you click on it your computer will
buy you like a sheep it's awesome
there's like the one of the funniest
things I've had and I thought I was
going nuts but let's listen to it again
I'm holding shift and I'm clicking on
this and I also found a couple other
things that happened so apparently
there's a secret preferences menu in
here if you hold shift and you come to
edit and you go to preferences and then
you click on general all the time
holding shift we got a secret menu down
here and it's got a couple of things
down here and we got some danger here
and disable the lair cache where we can
purge and everything like that I'm not
sure what these mean but I just found
them today and it's kind of funny and
there's a Simpsons joke so if we make a
mask let's create a mask real quick
awesome
and we come down here to open up the
mask properties we come to masks
expansion here and control shift all and
click on massive expansion it goes away
now if we open it back up it's now
called a mask and bigan and that's a
Simpsons joke apparently and I think it
means let me see what it means it means
the opposite of belittle so it works
same as mass expansion though but it's
just like a little secret Easter egg
week and we can access so I thought
those were pretty cool and I thought I'd
share those Easter eggs with you to
lighten up the mood and everything like
that so here we go I love that sheet
noise and I'm probably gonna click on it
all the time and I wish I knew that when
I was in a studio I'd be clicking on
that all the time and nobody would know
what's going on so well thanks for
watching this one on the after-effects
Easter eggs we'll see you soon
and mess around with that stuff and make
your friends be like hey what the hell's
going on so see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
