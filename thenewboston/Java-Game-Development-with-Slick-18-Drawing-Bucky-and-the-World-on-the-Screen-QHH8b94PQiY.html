and in this video we can start drawing
stuff on the screen because you know
right now whenever you play the game
just black right here so let's go ahead
and the first thing that would probably
be a good idea to draw is the world or
the map itself so in order to do that
world and someone is sexting me who is
it right in the middle of my frickin
tutorial Ralph thanks Ralph
ok world map in order to draw it on the
screen draw and where do you want to dry
it is 0 0 but actually we have variables
for that so lucky position X and lucky
position Y so what this does is
basically trout or wow not world draw
world map draws this on the screen at
position 0 0 so now if we go ahead and
play our game check out our I want to
say chicken herb check it out our map is
now appearing on the screen positioned
in the top left 0 0 so now what we want
to do it would be a good idea to
actually draw Bucky in his world
so same technique Bucky draw and in
order to get his position what we want
to do is we don't want to position him
at 0 0 what we want to do is position
him at remember the center of the screen
so in order to figure out his position
of the center of the screen we coded
these two variables shift X and shift Y
so instead of 0 0 this is going to make
him appear at um what is a 321 60
basically the center of the map so let's
go ahead and look at this right now
play it and ah great when I made my
friend so we'll just say that he's
starting out in a treehouse or something
use your imagination who cares
so the other thing that I want to do
aside from this is remember that I told
you guys that obviously this game
wouldn't be very interesting if Bucky
couldn't move around his world so later
on we're going to be adding
functionality to allow Bucky to walk up
down left to right all around his world
but before we do that I want to go ahead
and draw a string on the screen
gee draw string and what the string is
going to do is it's going to be a I'll
just say like 400 over and 20 down what
the string is going to do is it's just
going to allow us to track the
coordinates of Bucky so we'll just say
something like um Bucky's exposition and
we'll set this equal to
Bucky position X and then on a new line
alright um
Bucky's Bucky's Y position and that will
be at Bucky's position y
so right here hopefully I didn't code
anything wrong whenever you run this we
should go ahead and say okay I know it's
a little hard to see right now because
you know it's white text and the grass
is pretty light but it says Bucky's
exposition is a zero zero in Bucky's Y
position as is zero zero now whenever he
moves around this position is going to
change relative to where he is right now
so at the very beginning of the game
he's positioned at zero zero now why is
this important well we need to track the
coordinates not only because it's um
interesting but we need to track his
position because whenever we're moving
around and bumping into buildings and
stuff we can use those coordinates for a
collision detection as we're going to
see soon so right now the starting point
is zero zero as he moves either Y
increases or decreases and when it
decreases from zero it actually turns to
a negative value same thing for X so
right now let's go ahead and finish
coding this render method are you
freaking kidding me everyone freaking as
soon as I started tutorial they're like
waiting outside to see when I start just
so they can like start texting me all my
friends it's absolutely ridonculous so
now what I want to do is just add that
little functionality that basically
gives the user the option of quitting
the game so here's what's going to
happen whenever they hit the Escape key
a menu is going to pop up pretty much
in any game whenever you hit that skate
beat escape key a menu pops up usually
it's like sound settings video settings
quit resume game we're going to make a
really simple menu right now so if that
quick variable that we made earlier on
is equal to true this pretty much means
okay do you hit the escape button are
you thinking about quitting the game
well this is going to make a menu pop up
and the menu is just going to be three
simple strings so G draw string and the
first one is going to be a position
we'll put all of them at 250 and the
first one will be 100 pixels down and
this string will say resume R so if they
hit the Escape key and they accidentally
hit it or maybe they you know we're just
taking a break and want to resume the
game then we're going to add
functionality that they can press R on
their keyboard and it could return them
to the game so that's one option another
option is if you want to go back to the
main menu because you know how awesome
our main menu was we want to give them
the option of going back there so
basically main menu which it will be the
short key M on their keyboard will be at
250 150 right underneath there and the
last option will be of course option to
quit the game however you know what
would ever want to quit this game
because it's pretty freaking cool game
so this will be Q if they hit escape the
menu is going to pop up and if they hit
Q it's going to exit the game so now let
me just go ahead and move this so first
resume main menu and quit those are
their options now we need to add one
more if statement in here if quit is
equal to false G clear which pretty much
means get rid of all your graphics or
I'll wipe out what you just drew on the
screen so now that's all we need to do
in the render month method what we did
here is we pretty much are creating menu
that whenever the user hits escape they
can look at decide what they want to do
either resume the game go back to the
main menu or quit the game altogether we
also drew the map as you can see we drew
Bucky in you know silly us but we put
them right in a tree
and we also drew the string right here
which pretty much allowed us to track
buckey's coordinates whenever he moves
these coordinates are going to change
from his original position
so right now buggy starting out at zero
zero and if I hit any of the keys on the
keyboard he doesn't move but we're going
to be changing that soon but so for now
think guys for watching in the next
tutorial hopefully we'll get Bucky
moving around his world</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
