first Android tutorial for the new
Boston and in this tutorial we're
basically going to refine kind of what
we've done and also get kind of a
desired result like I showed you with on
touch method so the first thing I want
you guys to do is go into the my bring
back surface class and change our is
running right when it's started here to
false because again you know our thread
is gonna go through is on resume method
before it actually starts our thread and
that's where we're gonna actually gonna
change you know our is running it true
so not too big of a deal there but then
we go into our surface class what we're
gonna do is we're gonna implement the on
touch listener so we're gonna say
implements on touch listener just like
we did with onclicklistener
the difference between on touch listener
and on click listener is basically we
can attach this to a view just like the
on touch or on the click listener but
this has a touch down right when you
touch the screen or touch whatever
object you set this on click listener to
right then is down and then there's a
move when your fingers like press down
and moving around on the screen and also
when you release or when you let off of
of your touch there so we can kind of
find those three events as well and then
what we have to do is just say add
implement methods and there we go here
we have everything set up for the most
part the only other thing we want to do
is we want to set you know something to
be looking for a touch method right here
and what we're gonna have do that well
our surface view because our surface
view is going to take up the whole
screen or it's the whole canvas so we
want our touch event to be accessible by
the whole canvas for the most part so
we're gonna say is our surface view dot
set on click list or on touch listener
just like when we did with on click
listener and then we just say this
because again we're implementing the
on touch now what we can do is we're
basically going to touch screen and
we're going to get the X and the y value
of of that information and process it
and kind of handle it as well so what I
did is I set up a float and you want a
float value of an X and a float value of
a Y and then that's what we're going to
kind of define now we're also going to
set up this x and Y to equal something
initially so x equals zero and y also
will equal zero and then we're going to
change it within our touch our on touch
method so we go into within this you
know this method because when our
surface is touched it's gonna call this
method and it's gonna give us which view
was touch which is our you know our
whole surface and then which event
whether it be a down move around or you
know a release of some sort we're just
going to set our x and y values so we're
gonna say x equals and we're gonna say
event event yeah event I'm sorry or
whatever your second argument is which
is your motion event we're gonna say and
as you can see here it's labeled event
so you say event dot and then we we go
get X which is a really nice method
because it can return the X in pixels
for the most part the x value of what
was pressed or where is pressed on the
screen and then also we just say you
know y is equal to event dot get Y and
there we go we have our x and y values
every time the the screen is touched it
does that through grabbing the event and
getting the value for the X and then we
set it up to you know this variable so
that's probably it for this tutorial
pretty quick it's still not doing
anything yet
the next next tutorial we're gonna piece
everything together and get our
application working so make sure you
watch that and I'll catch you guys in
peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
