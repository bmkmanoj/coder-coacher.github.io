video I'm going to teach you guys two
new awesome functions and those are
called puts and gets now puts and gets
our two awesome ways of a printing
strings to the screen and be getting
strings from the user if you guys are
like Bucky we already have a way to get
stuff and that scanf they can type crap
into their keyboard but if you remember
scanf has one huge problem and that's
whenever it tries to scan in a string
with a space it pretty much um breaks
our program for example if the but if
the users try to type in something like
Bucky Roberts it would scan Bucky and it
would view this little space right here
is the end of the string so it wouldn't
even read this last one this last name
at all well in this video what I'm going
to do is I'm going to show you guys way
to scan and strings incredibly easily
that can have spaces in them as well so
let's go ahead and make a couple
character arrays I'll just print out
something like cat's name and make this
equal to 50 or something so the goal of
this program is it allows the user to
enter a cat's name and also we'll say
like a cat's I don't know food or
something and I'll just print it out on
the screen will say like cat's name eats
cats food now
the last thing I want to do is I want to
make a blank you know set this equal to
75 can't even talk when we type in I
want to make a blank character array and
this right here is where we're going to
be storing the final result that we're
going to print out on the screen so
pretty much the user is going to scan in
a string for this and this and then
we'll use the functions that we learned
before to develop a new string so in
order to just print out a string on the
screen we can use printf but I got to
tell you guys in new way and that's puts
now in between plots it only takes one
parameter
and that's what's the cat's dumb name
now another thing I want to mention is
this whenever you use puts unlike printf
it automatically adds a newline to the
end of this so you don't need to add one
explicitly unless you want to new lines
or in other words a space in between the
next line so again even though you can't
see it there is a newline character
there so this next function gets which
is going to act like scanf at least
thumb it's pretty much a scanf that you
can use spaces with and the only
parameter that this takes is where you
want to store the string that you're
scanning in so again if we just run this
right now you guys are going to see that
this cursor is on the next line because
that's how puts works by default so we
can just enter a name like hey because
nothing it doesn't have any
functionality right now so let's change
that so right now whatever the user
types in is stored in the character
array or the string cats name so for
this next puts right here we can put on
what does he eat now you can type
anything you want and it's going to be
stored in cats food and that's all you
have to do that's how simple it is arm
so again like I said it's a lot easier
than using printf with a bunch of
different parameters or scanf for gits
with like the ampersand and all that
confusing crap so we basically have two
arm
strings that we could use so how about
we use one of those cool functions
string cat and what this is going to do
is tack on one string to the end of
another now since this sentence is the
final string that we're going to be
using let's go ahead and first tack on
the cat's name to this so after this
line completes this sentence is pretty
much just going to be equal to the cat's
name
we'll say it's Bucky so after this we
need some text in between and which is
put loves to eat so after this line it
says Bucky loves to eat and now we can
just go ahead and add the name of the
food which is cats food and the last
thing that we need to do is since we
built the string piece by piece
it started off blank and now it has
three parts to it all we need to do is
print it out on the screen and of course
the print stuff out and screen using
this cool new function we use puts and
the string that we want to print out is
sentence so let's see how this program
works right now so what's the cat's dumb
name well my cat's name is Mick
stanky and again I'm using a space in
between here hit enter what does he eat
bagels I just make a simple shrink for
that to show you guys that it can also
take simple strings without a space hit
enter builds the string and our final
one is mix thinkI loves to eat
bagels and indeed he does so again puts
prints a string out on the screen gets
can get a string from the user and the
cool thing is that that string can also
have spaces and this string cat can
build a string piece by piece by piece
and print out the final one on the
screen so pretty cool shrink functions
and definitely a lot easier than using
printf and scanf with a bunch of those
optional parameters and ampersand
freaking weird stuff like that so for
now thank you guys for watching don't
forget subscribe and I'll smell you guys
later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
