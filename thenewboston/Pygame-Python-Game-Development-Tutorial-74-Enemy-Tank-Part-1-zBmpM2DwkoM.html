PI game tutorial video this video what
we're doing is adding an enemy tank so
right now we're just kind of playing
with ourselves and that's not cool so
what we want to do is go ahead and add
an enemy tank now since there's just two
tanks it's okay to go ahead and and just
we're just going to copy and paste this
function for the most part and then
we're gonna just edit the turret
position and then yeah that's basically
it so so just copy the old tank function
and then paste boom now and so tank
we're gonna call this enemy tank so
enemy underscore tank and then what we
do is we'll because we just leave all
this but eventually we'll have to change
the turret positions because the enemy
tanks turret needs to point the other
way but we'll leave those there for now
and we'll hit those in a minute we just
want to make sure this tank will even
just show up so so yeah we'll leave that
now what we'd want to do is we're gonna
come down to the game loop and basically
where we've defined it you got like
these basically these things right that
correspond to your tank for the enemy
tank I vote we keep things simple we
want the enemy tank for sure to be able
to like move because that'll add a
degree of difficulty otherwise if the if
the enemy tank can't move then we'll
just lock into the perfect fire and
we'll just keep bombarding at that same
one so the game would be kind of boring
once we found like the perfect
combination it's like power and angle so
if we do want the enemy tank to move but
as far as the enemy tank like moving is
a little turret there's not much point
the ideal turret position is I like
straight up there's really never gonna
be a time where you would want like to
put your turret down a little bit we
just add it for functionality but in
reality you know the turret position
that will satisfy hitting every target
that's possible is like as high as
possible so we're not going to mess with
the tank the enemy tanks turret very
much we're just gonna leave it probably
stationary but we'll go ahead and leave
the code in just in case somebody wants
to make the enemy tank crazy smart or
something and obviously if we didn't
have that barrier they're like maybe if
you were playing on you know some sort
of field that you know had some terrain
maybe and you got close and a straight
shot was the smartest shot but still
even in that scenario still you know you
still could hit them by shooting it up
but anyway enough on that so let us go
ahead and we're just gonna add an x and
y for the enemy tanks so we're just
gonna say enemy tank X and that is
basically gonna be kind of like a
counter opposite to these ones here so
initially we had done display width and
and then width accidentally but now we
have the right stuff so I'm gonna try
and basically do this exact same code so
only just point one right so paste that
and then make it point one instead and
then enemy tank y can equal display
height and just be 0.1 okay and then now
that we've done that the other thing
that we want to go ahead and do is when
we call the gun to show up like right
here this is for our tank right and now
we want to have the enemy tank
so we'll say enemy underscore gun and
then enemy gun equals enemy underscore
tank and then we have enemy tank X
capital comma enemy enemy tank Y and
then we have for now we'll just throw in
current to position he will mimic the
our turret but we'll just throw it in
there nap for now just to make sure that
that was working just in case but that's
basically it for this so now we'll go
ahead and run that hit play oh did we
not change something to a point Oh
so so we modified the x and y variables
here so he's up a little too high there
so he's way up there so what we need to
do is some my microphone is like in the
way of the scrolling bar so it has been
kind of annoying I moved it let's go to
the very top here uh-huh fix this
problem oh it's on the very top my bad
so where the heck was this maybe the top
of the game loop I'm totally lost yeah
okay so expert 1.1 but why we still
wanted to be point nine so let's try
that now
saving run play there we go senses made
okay and then as we move our turret the
enemy tanks turret moves just simply
because it's tied like directly in and
we didn't hit him let's try again
get this guy there we go perfect shot
three times a charm so so we can move
but the enemy tank can't move and so
that's what I was meaning before like
once you found the perfect shot you
would just keep firing at the enemy tank
and that would make for a relatively
boring game because you would have like
the perfect shot every single time so we
don't really want that so we do want the
enemy tank to be able to move like
physically on the map but his turret
position is really not not an issue so
those are this and so that's gonna be it
for this video and the next video will
start working more on the enemy tanks
functionality so right now he's just
like spawned here but pretty soon first
of all we need to move him a little bit
but we also needed to turret to face
like the correct direction then he needs
to actually fire back at us and actually
he needs to fire back at us and he needs
to have like some sort of artificial
intelligence about him so we need that
and then we also have to do like damage
and all that kind of stuff like you know
actually a hit that does something so we
got to do that kind of stuff but we'll
start piling those together and pretty
soon we'll find that we have a pretty
pretty cool game so anyway stay tuned
for that thanks for watching and until
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
