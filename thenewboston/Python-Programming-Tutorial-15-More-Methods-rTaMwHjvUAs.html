playtime tutorial and the last story I
talked to you guys about methods and
objects and stuff in this story I want
to cover some methods that I didn't go
over there are going to be useful later
on the first one is called index and
what the index method does is pretty
much search for the first occurrence of
a value and say um where in the list it
is so let's go ahead and make a quick
saying you can name your list say and
let's put pay now brown cow
and go ahead and put your little quotes
around every word make sure I spelled
everything right brown core what the WTF
turns out the cow now go ahead and press
ENTER in order to have say make sure
list is created so let me show you guys
what index foot does first puts a index
again you have your object and then you
have your method and the parameter index
takes you have to type in any element
that you want to search for in your list
so let's go ahead and search for Brown
so and what it's going to do is once we
have our object our method and our
parameter long search for brown air
returns - and remember this is 0 1 2 so
that's how you can search for words or
numbers and given list another thing
that you can do is insert um or any
elements into a list or sequence and you
can do this by using of course the
insert method so have say insert and
then you have two parameters first where
you want to insert it and second what
you want to insert so say you want to
insert Hoss into position two this is
what you would do and now do that press
ENTER and it says hey now Hoff's brown
cow of course is 0-1 your new - is Hoss
and it kind of just push everything over
a little bit and besides that when you
have insert of course you have to have a
way to remove elements from a list - so
that method is pop so puts a dot pop by
donna me period
in the parameters you have for this is
what position in the list you want to
remove it so let's say we want to remove
let's remove now so this is 0-1 so pop 1
again object element parameters press
ENTER say and of course hey Hoss brown
cow and another thing that pop does is
unlike delete or anything like that
it actually returns the value to you
that you delete it from the list or
popped out of it so that's a little
different way where it differs from
another or all other types of common
deletions so unless you want to use this
value like in a program or something you
would use pop if not you to use another
deletion method um the second the last
one I want to talk to you guys about is
remove and what this does is remove the
first occurrence of any word and of
course that would be your parameter so
have your objects a list we want to
remove and get out of your list what do
we want to remove um let's remove brown
one um so let's go ahead and do that and
once we do that you should have hey
pause cow and again this is a little
different because instead of returning a
value like pop and this is you would
return a value if you want to use this
value in a program it just deletes it
from the list and doesn't return at all
so that's one way to remove differs from
pop and the last one I'm going to talk
to you guys about is reverse so say I'm
not even going to tell you guys what
this one does pretty self-explanatory
again our old list hey Hoss cow our new
list cow Hoss hey can't figure out what
went on there with the keyword reverse
well that's a shame so that is how you
use all those methods um in the next
tutorial I'm going to be showing you
guys some awesome way how to sort so I
would pay attention if I was you and I
would also subscribe if I was you so
thank you guys for watching and I look
forward to teaching you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
