video I'm going to show you guys how to
convert image modes from a photo so
right now all of these photos baby Bucky
all of these are RGB and actually 99% of
the pictures you see on your computer on
your smart phone on your tablet those
are all RGB because that's what
computers and electronics they work with
easiest they display it really easy and
crystal-clear however there are going to
be times when you want to convert your
image to something else for example your
printer chances are that it doesn't use
RGB whenever you print out on like a
picture it usually prints in 4-color
CMYK cyan magenta yellow and K is black
I don't know why they just don't use B
but they're going to be times where you
want to take an RGB image and convert it
to something else so again um if you
ever print something out then it's a
smart idea to convert it to CMYK first
but just for this example I'll show you
guys how to convert it to black and
white now there are a couple different
ways that you can make a black-and-white
image you can just take your RGB image
and remove all the basic saturation from
it and end up with a black and white
image but that isn't how true black and
white image that's just a an RGB that
looks like a black and white one so if
you actually want a true black and white
um photo then what you can do is you can
take your original photo actually this
is called baby and you call something
called convert now convert basically
says okay what format do you want to
change this to so by default this is RGB
so if we call this nothing what happened
because it's already RGB we can also do
CMYK for printing but just for this
example on type L now L stands for
luminance it basically means black and
white they should have named it
something a little bit more clear but
apparently they decided that L was
best symbol for black and white so now
if we take this new object which is
pretty much this image of a baby now
converted to a black and white file type
check this out whenever you show this
run main black and white now if you guys
are like alright so how do I know that
this isn't just the RGB image still and
I don't know they just like remove some
color from it so right now keep the file
open and if you go to channels you see
that we don't have those RGB red green
blue channels anymore we just have this
one channel just for black and white so
that way we can verify that indeed it
does work and well I'm not lying all
right hold on just my microphone a
little bit so that was kind of boring so
now since you guys had to suffer through
that I'll show you guys something really
cool now pillow or pill hota
oh these gusting all right so right now
we've been using bunch of functions from
the image class but it also has another
um class that it's actually a lot cooler
in my opinion and that's image filter
now this class comes with a bunch of
cool built-in on filters that you might
use like blur if you ever want to blur
your image if you ever want to uh do
something like find the edges of it
that's a nice little cool effect oh my
that uh that was embarrassing but uh
probably not even going to edit that out
all right so first let me show you guys
how to blur your image so do we want to
use this actually let me use Bucky
actually alright let's use sister
because look at this look how adorable I
look in this one I am one hot piece of
meat
alright so sister
sister and just make any object I'm
going to name my blurry because I'm
pretty much just going to blur the image
so if we take sister that original image
and we add a function called filter to
it what this does is that allows us to
pretty much pass in one of these
parameters and the parameter I want to
pass in is blur so pretty much from the
image filter class we're going to call a
function called filter and it's going to
blur this image so let me just show you
guys real quick so blur dot show is
pretty much the same image as before but
now it is blurred pretty cool pretty
cool so as you can see um you're like
okay when the heck would I want to blur
image because this is just stupid it
like um is the same image but less
quality actually if you ever um I'll
show you guys an example and this is
actually a really useful tip if you ever
have an image like a flower or something
and you know on those high-end cameras
when you get that depth of field it
looks like the background is kind of
blurry if you ever want to add a photo
filter like that then what you can do is
you can actually um pretty much overlay
this blurry image on top of the regular
crystal-clear image and blur it as it
fades out and it'll look like kind of
give you the fake effect of depth of
field if you don't know what that the
field is then just ignore everything I
just said because I'm not important I'll
show you guys the effect later on
alright so another one that you guys
might find pretty cool is detail and she
let me write both of these first and
what this does is it pretty much just
gets the detail of her image it's kind
of hard to explain but uh you'll see it
later on sure
let's uh name this one edges and the
property is find edges
there you go so now we already sub blur
so now let's go ahead and print detail
see what that one does and also edges
should let me clear this out alright so
run all those make sure I didn't do
anything wrong
all right so this is blur
we already saw this this is detail you
know without comparing them side by side
they kind of look weird but if you look
at the other one
then um it's pretty much like the
opposite of blur it gets the detail and
you guys can see if you compare them
side by side and this one obviously what
it does is it finds the edges it's best
guess and it highlights them so again
you probably just want to want to use
this stand alone but combined with some
other filters and effects they cannot
produce some pretty cool image effects
so that ladies and gentlemen is image
filter for some really basic built in
filters and again the power of this
actually comes when you combine it with
other stuff we're going to be taking a
look at that later on but for now thank
you guys for watching w subscribe and
I'll see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
