tutorial by the way 20 is my favorite
number and this is probably gonna be my
favorite video I made in a while because
in this video we're finally going to be
finishing up this CSS file so basically
we made three different layouts one that
can hold one column one that can hold
two columns and one that can hold three
columns so now the only thing we have
left to do is make the individual
columns so let's go ahead and do that
right now so footer whenever we have
something with the class column one and
what I want to do now is I want to style
all of the columns so you know up here
even though each of these different
layouts has a different width they all
have similar properties so let's go
ahead and style all the similar
properties of these columns first so
when we're working with a column that's
one wide two wide or a three wide column
which is pretty much a big fat home it
doesn't matter the first thing we want
to do is display these columns as inline
and also float them to the left now if
we display them as a block then what
would happen is you see how these
columns appear right side by side next
to each other if we display them as a
block then they would be stacked on top
of each other like blocks so whenever we
display them as inline and float them to
the left that makes them appear side by
side of course now another thing that we
want to do is position them relative and
also give them a margin left of 5 pixels
and also oops
not 1 5 pixels and a margin right of 5
pixels
and this just allows us to whenever we
have multiple columns that it has
spacing to the left and the right of it
if we didn't have any spacing at all
then it would look like one big text
paragraph and of course we need spacing
because you know if we wanted one big
text paragraph then we would just write
one big paragraph this is a layout with
columns so that's why we want to give a
spacing to the left and the right
otherwise what's the freaking point all
right so this is the same property in
all columns you want them pretty much
not to be stacked on top of each other
in some space on the left in the right
hand side all right
simple enough however how are these
columns different well the only thing
the only way that they're different is
the width of them so column and I
probably shouldn't mention this if I
didn't already so basically what we're
doing is we're gonna create a layout and
we're going to be placing columns inside
that layout all columns must be placed
inside a layout so column one remember
whenever we have a layout that can hold
one column the entire layout is a
hundred and forty pixels wide now a
single column is let's see I can
actually I didn't even do that yet all
right now a single column has a margin
left in a margin right of pretty much 10
pixels altogether so we have 140 pixels
that we can work with and we already
took away ten pixels so that must mean
that a single column width can be a
hundred and thirty pixels wide now I
want to say this one more time because
it's important all of these columns a
single column a double column and a
triple column they must go inside a
layout a single column has to go inside
a single column layout or actually it
can go inside either but a single column
layout can only hold a column that's one
wide the layout is a hundred and forty
pixels wide now when this single column
is one hundred and thirty and then it
has a five pixel to the left and right
that makes up the one hundred and forty
if we made this one thirty one then
column would be bigger than the layout
in and wouldn't work out so now let me
go ahead and style the other two alright
so when you have a double column in a
triple column a double column is 270
pixels now why did I do this well one
more time whenever you have a two column
layout like this one right here this
entire thing is 280 pixels wide so what
you can do is you can add two single
columns which make up 140 plus 140 which
is 280 or a double column which is 270
plus 5 on the left and 5 on the right
which is 280 so if you guys can figure
out what this one is going to be 410 so
you remember you guys should remember
this a 3 column I house 420 so you can
either do 140 plus 140 plus 140 or 280
plus 140 or just for 2015 420 so that is
basically how we're going to arrange
this these are individual columns that
are either one two or three wide single
double or triple and they have to fit
inside a layout that takes them so
basically you can't put a triple column
inside a single column layout
you can't put you know eight doubles
inside a triple column every your
columns have to add up to the layout
that's it boom roasted simple enough so
anyways in the next tutorial we can save
this file freakin forget about it and
we're gonna be moving over to the HTML
file and then and only then finally
we're gonna see how everything ties
together into a beautiful ballet of the
most brilliant footer the most beautiful
footer ever created in the history of
mankind
so thank you guys for watching don't
