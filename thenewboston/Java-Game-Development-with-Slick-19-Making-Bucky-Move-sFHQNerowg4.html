video and in this video we're going to
get Bucky moving around his world but
before we begin that I want to mention
something that you guys might have been
confused about before and I probably
should have mentioned it see whenever we
play this game right here remember that
I said that Bucky is now as you can see
position in the dead center of the
screen which basically means we drew him
at coordinates 321 60 however even
though he's at coordinates 320 160 the
coordinates up here that say Bucky's X
and Bucky's y are both set to 0-0 well
why is that if they should be 320 in 160
or whatever I said well this is because
whenever we play this game and move
Bucky around the Bucky character isn't
going to move himself the map in the
background is actually going to be
moving and it's going to make it appear
like Bucky is walking so that is why you
know we're not tracking Bucky's
coordinates on the screen because if we
were to do that they would just stay the
same the whole entire time there would
just be 320 and 160 and not changed at
all what we want to do is track Bucky's
coordinates relative to where he's
starting or basically track the maps
coordinates and that would allow us to
you know do things like um take care of
collision detection and crap like that
so that's where we're going to be doing
in a this tutorial well actually we'll
probably do collision detection and
tutorials for now let's go ahead and
worry about getting Bucky moving so go
ahead and hop over to the update method
and what we're going to be doing is
we're going to allow Bucky to move
whenever we hit up down left and right
on the keyboard so the first thing we
need for keyboard input is the input
class if I can type it an input object
name input and set this equal to GC get
input so now all of the input
information from the mouse and the
keyboard is stored in this variable
input right there so what we want to do
is pretty much say this during the game
if the user hits the up arrow move Bucky
up so we need an if statement to
determine when they are hitting the up
arrow so input
is key down and basically what key are
you listening for inputs and the code
for this is key underscore up so
whenever they hit the up arrow this code
is going to run so what code do we want
to do well the first thing we want to do
is right now check it out
Bucky is facing down or towards us
whenever he moves up we want it to look
like Bucky is moving away from us so we
change it - Bucky's back so basically we
already created all the animations for
this it's really easy set Bucky the
animation of Bucky which is the
character equal to moving up and this
will make it appear that he's moving up
so go ahead and play this game right now
and check it out whenever I hit up Bucky
looks like he's about to move up but the
map or the character isn't actually
moving so that's what we need to take
care of right now
so um this is how you do that might as
well just go ahead and explain it so
whenever he's moving up what we need to
do is we need to change his Y position
so Bucky's why or what was the variable
forgot it already
Bucky's position why just go ahead and
copy that
Bucky's position Y of course we want to
add to this because he's moving up so
plus equals plus equals Delta and
remember this is the UM
value that gets passed in to the update
method in I haven't worked with this
before and you guys are probably like
why the heck do you have this Delta well
it's for uh you know things like this as
you guys are going to see arm times 0.1
F so this is pretty much saying okay as
a really simple explanation pretty much
increase the Y position of Bucky so
whenever we increase the Y position of
Bucky now this is going to actually do
the moving what this does right here is
basically just change Bucky's picture so
instead of the front it's his back and
this actually makes things move around
on the screen so now if we go ahead and
run the
play now and we hit up check it out
Bucky can now go up but as you can see
we have a couple problems here first of
all he can't go down left or right and
also if you guys can see he can only go
up and you know he isn't supposed to be
allowed to walk off his map so what we
need to do is whenever we run our game
we need to go ahead and add some
collision detection so whenever he gets
to the edge he can't just keep going off
the edge like this and he actually can
recognize to say hey dude I'm not
supposed to keep going so I guess I
might as well and go ahead and show you
guys how to do collision detection right
now well should I yeah might as well all
right so the first thing we need to do
is go ahead and this is why I said that
we need to get the coordinates actually
you know what I think I'm going to wait
and do collision detection in the next
tutorial because it's going to take a
little while for me to explain and I
want to set aside a whole tutorial for
it so anyways thanks for watching don't
forget subscribe and I'll see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
