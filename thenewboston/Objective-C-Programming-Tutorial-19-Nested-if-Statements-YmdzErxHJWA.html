objective-c tutorial and this tutorial
is on compound relational tests and also
a nested if statement now we already
learned how to do really simple tests
when using an if statement and that was
like if age is less than 60 or we
limiter doing like if number is greater
than 10 but sometimes and quite often
you need tests that are a little more
complex so let's go ahead and add to our
dating website by not only seeing if
your age is above or below a certain
point but within a range of something so
let's go ahead and make int age and
we'll go ahead and do something like if
age and what we're going to do is we're
going to test if age is let's say if
it's less than 17 or if it's greater
than 80 then we want to kick them off
the site so let's go ahead and put let's
go ahead and set a value to this age if
age equals 21 so let's go ahead and
write if age is less than 18 but we also
want to test if it's greater than 80 so
there are a couple cool
the syntax for doing this testing if
both conditions are true is the or
operator so the or operators is hold
down shift and above your Enter or
return key hit the pipe line twice and
go ahead and put if age is greater than
80 now here's what this means this is a
test right here and this is also a
simple test the two pipe line pipe lines
means or that means in order for the
code to execute below it and might as
well make code right now NS log on so if
they're below let's see if they're less
than 18 or greater than 80 then what are
we going to write just write something
like go to another website because we
don't want them on ours
and I know I spot another rung and this
let's go ahead and put we won't even
make it else it doesn't really matter
for this tutorial so like I was saying
this is the or operator two pipelines
that means this is a simple test and
this is a simple test if this is true or
if this is true then this code gets
executed so if either one of the options
are true then the code gets executed now
if they were both true say if it was
greater than five and it was greater
than ten then it would also get executed
so in or either one or the other or both
have to be true for the code to get
executed so let's go ahead and build and
run this and see what we got it said
nothing it didn't say go to another
website now let's go ahead and fail one
of the tests and make the age 90 so save
it and we'll see what we got it says go
to another website so why did this
happen
it said all right age is 90 is H less
than 18 no it's greater than 18 is age
greater than 80 yes
so since this entire statement right
here was true this entire statement here
is true and that's why this got executed
now there's another one called the hand
and what this is is two ampersands above
the seven and what this would mean is
that this and this would have to be both
true it just can't be one or the other
both of these conditions would have to
be met in this case it's not possible
because you can't be less than eighteen
and greater than eighty but that I'm
just throwing that out there for a later
on now let's go ahead and delete this
whole thing in so I can actually build a
really sweet program here int age and
sex and now I'm going to teach you guys
about something called a nested-if
statement so let's go ahead and make NS
log and just go ahead and put like
enter H and now let's give them a scanf
and we'll give them a place to enter
their h % i and that is of course stared
in the variable H and now let's go ahead
and do the same thing for sex copy
enter sex and we'll give them a little
prompt put like arm one boy to girl so
now not only on our website well let's
show you what happens it gives you
premises enter age in your interior age
then it gives you a place to say enter
sex where they were enter one for boy or
two for girl and it will store that
variable either one or two in the
variable sex so let's go ahead and make
our little program again we go ahead and
write if age is less than 18 or age is
greater than 80 then we don't want them
on our website
I know it's mean but NS log go to
another website pause and forgot our
semicolon else and what this else is
going to be is this is what a nested if
statement is if they pass one of the
tests or fail it it's perfectly valid
but a whole entire if statement and
substitute for one of the statements in
the other if statement so check it out
instead of just writing a statement here
with a semicolon you can actually put
another if statement so if they pass the
test and if they are in the proper age
range then what we want to do after
since they're allowed to enter this site
is check if what sex they are and give
them appropriate message so if sex is
equal to one what do we want to say is
ns
log and this means that they're between
18 and 80 and they're also a boy because
if they entered one they're a boy
so at be like welcome man not that time
else well if they put else then we know
they're a girl because they must have
entered too so let's just give them
another NSLog copy that and put welcome
girlie so let's go ahead and build and
run this and see what happens first of
all it says enter your age and no matter
what you're going to enter both of them
um just goes so enter age let's make
this one Val 34 enter enter six I'm one
a boy so it says welcome man so let's go
ahead and run this again so the first
time it said welcome man perfectly just
like we planned
now the second time it says enter age
I'm 103 and I'm a female so I'm going to
enter 2 and it says go to another
website Hoss so this program is working
fine so what it did one last time is
this it gave you two variables right
here agent sex because that we're using
is set and your age you enter to age it
said any or sex you either entered one
or two and a store that number in sex
first it checked if you're between 18
and 80 if you weren't then automatically
kicked you to another site and then if
you were it went on to go to another
test right here and that was an entire
if-else statement nested inside this
else block right here and what it did
was it took sex and if it was equal to
one then New Year dude if it was equal
to two or anything else besides one and
knew you were girl so those are the
concepts of not only nesting if-else
statement in another if-else statement
but also how to use a compound
relational test to test more than one
simple
so thank you guys for watching don't
forget subscribe and I will see you next
