really fun stuff you know how making the
chat work and everything we need to make
a custom air handler first of all
because it's cool to learn how to make a
custom air handler because that way you
don't have to rely on you know whatever
PHP gives you and another thing is that
inevitably we're gonna get some airs
whenever we're creating this program so
it's better to handle them first before
you start you know typing any code
rather than you know dealing with them
later so let's go ahead and take care of
this one boring file first which is
actually a pretty cool file and then in
the next video we're gonna be getting to
the real good stuff so this is how you
create a custom air handler go ahead and
make your PHP tags now there's a built
in function in PHP that's called set air
handler how creative of a name right now
in this function it takes two parameters
the first one is what is your function
going to be called it's pretty much
allows you to set a user-defined
air handler function so later on we're
gonna be creating a function called
Bucky air handler and this is the
function that's going to be responsible
for handling any mistakes that we get
with our code and the next parameter is
e all and don't worry about that right
now it's just housekeeping
you can either it pretty much says what
errors do you want handle and you can
set this to shrek the but just set it to
e all for now it's not really important
the important part is this is how you
make a custom air handler or tell PHP
whenever we get an error in our code we
don't want you to you know handle the
errors for us we're gonna be making our
own air handler so now let's go ahead
and do that so we set our function was
going to be named Bucky air handler and
now what we can do is we can pass in a
couple pieces of information so whenever
we get an error in our program what
information do we want to output to the
user we're the first thing that we can
have is just a number that says you know
you know out like whenever you're
running a program and each error message
has an error number so you
the developer can tell where the air is
coming from basically that's what this
is going to be the next parameter is
just a text that says like you miss the
semicolon or cannot connect to database
or something like that so that's a
little text or the message the next one
is the file and what this tells is
basically what file are you getting the
air from and of course to narrow it down
so we don't have to go looking through
the entire file let's go ahead and
output the line
what says this is the air or this is the
line number that the error is occurring
on so those are the pieces of
information so now whenever we get an
error in our program we know exactly
where the air is coming from will file
what line number and also a little
message saying what exactly the error is
pretty frickin cool so the first thing
we have to do to make this program work
is we want to do a little housekeeping
and that is get length of the output
buffer now let me go ahead and code this
first and then now what this basically
means right here is we want to clear the
output buffer if the output buffer has
anything in it already so what we're
gonna do is we're pretty much gonna say
okay if your output buffer get length is
equal to anything then it's gonna be
true so that means if there is something
in your output buffer then go ahead and
clean it and this is just housekeeping
to you know pretty much start everything
from new so now that we did all the
little housekeeping stuff we can go
ahead and build the error message or the
text that's going to display so let's go
ahead and store this in variable error
message and the first thing we wanted to
display is and we're pretty much going
to display all these things right here
so air
number of your air and chr 10 now you
guys may be saying okay so this is text
that's going to display and this is you
know whatever number we passed in but
what the heck is the CHR 10 what this
means is it's a special symbol that PHP
understands the only two that I know of
actually our CHR 13 which means move the
cursor it's kind of like move it to the
left like you're typing on a typewriter
I know that's kind of like an old
analogy but CHR 10 means go to a new
line so move the cursor down one line so
now each of our messages are going to be
on a new line I think it's just a little
bit easier to read that way so we can
actually go ahead and copy this save us
some time so you got error which says
your error number the message which is
just the text
and you guys can probably see where I'm
going with this now the next one is the
file that the bug occurred on and we're
going to be passing it in the file now
for the last one what we want to do is
one output the line number so the line
number we could say what line did it
occur on in you actually don't need this
return for the last one because you know
you don't need to go to a new line now
what we did is we built the format that
the error message is going to display on
and we actually built the entire error
message however if you notice that we
didn't display it or print it out on the
screen yet so now all I have to do that
is echo this bad boy out so echo error
message and that pretty much you know of
course you know it prints it out on the
screen and exit so boom roasted check it
out save this file and all of the boring
stuff is taken care of congratulations
you built your database you added the
table we built our own custom air
handler by the way this is actually
really cool I know I said it was boring
but this is actually a really cool
feature that anytime you want to build
your own custom air handler this is how
you do it now you know so in the next
video we're going to be getting into the
really awesome good stuff getting our
hands dirty filling our brains of
awesome knowledge learning how to create
the actual Ajax chat program so thank
you guys for watching don't forget
subscribe and by the way check out my
new social network built especially for
programmers
Bucky's room comm boom roasted I'll see
you in the guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
