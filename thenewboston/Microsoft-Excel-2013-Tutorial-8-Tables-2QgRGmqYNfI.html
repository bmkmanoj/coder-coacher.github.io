video and in this tutorial I want to
talk to you more about tables and I know
that we cover tables like a real brief
overview and like the second tutorial or
something but in these next couple
tutorials it's probably going to be this
one and one more after this we're going
to be getting a little more in depth
about tables learning exactly what we
can do with them and also I'm going to
demonstrate why you would use a table
rather than a normal spreadsheet so if
you guys are kind of confused on when to
use each one hopefully this clears
things up so first of all I'm going to
be working with this fantasy hockey game
example you can work with any data set
just make sure that it has a numerical
column in it for this tutorial so if you
want to follow along go ahead and open
fantasy hockey game and the first thing
I want to do is actually make a table
now if you remember in order to make a
table go ahead and select any cell in
your data set and go to this insert tab
and click table so it's going to give
its best guess in get these little
marching ants around your data set and
if it didn't get it exactly then you can
just go ahead and drag with your mouse
exactly where your data set is but it
got it right this time so I'm just going
to go ahead and click OK and look at it
it just converted that data set to a
table added styling and added some cool
functionality as well now I don't know
if you guys notice because you're
probably looking at this area down here
but as soon as it made the table what it
also did is it popped up a new tab right
here this table tools design tab and
actually if you click away you can see
that it disappears so this tab right
here only appears when you have a cell
within the table selected it's specific
to tables so if you're ever like ok
where the heck to that tab go just make
sure you click in your table in there to
reappear again so what is this tab this
tab allows you to add some cool
functionality and also how to style your
table now we'll get into exactly what's
in this ribbon later on
but the first thing I want to show you
guys one of the coolest things about
tables is that you can really easily
sort your data so before what you would
have to do is you would have to select
the column go up here to sort and filter
and you know it was kind of pain in the
butt not very intuitive with tables it's
a lot different because in every single
column they have this little drop-down
menu right here in this drop-down menu
it gives you a bunch of different
options but one of the most popular ones
is the sorting option so just like if
you go to any website in your shopping
for items they allow you to sort the
columns really easily in quickly Excel
does the same thing with tables so I'm
going to go ahead and take average
points per game and sort it smallest to
largest look at that pretty stinkin
sweet
now something I like even more than just
easily sorting your data is filtering
data so check this out this is of course
like I said I know probably five times
already is a hockey game that you pick
whatever player is going to score the
most points so this is the average
points that they scored up to this point
in the or pretty much the past games
that they played in the season this is
what they've been averaging so far so
the average is it looks like right
around two and I have this theory that I
always want to pick players above
average so I wish that there is a way
that we can just filter this entire
table to only show the players above two
points now of course you could just go
ahead and select everything and okay let
me just get to and let me just delete
that but you know what it's not very
efficient and if your data isn't sorted
by the criteria that you want it's going
to be kind of a pain in the butt so
instead an easier way is this click this
again and go to number filters and this
gives you a bunch of different way that
you can filter data what I want is
greater than
so whenever I put two right here well
I'm basically telling Excel is only show
me the players who have averaged point
per game of greater than two and of
course you can do equals to less than
but of course I want greater than
because that means I know kind of like
the better players so now check it out
not only did I sort it really easily but
I'm only looking at the players who are
in my eyes above average pretty sweet
some really quick built-in functionality
now the last thing well I don't want to
say the last thing but one other thing
that I want to show you guys is this
whenever you're just working with normal
columns in a normal worksheet and you
have some header like um I don't know
I'll put like price look what happens
whenever I scroll down it disappears so
if I'm looking at a bunch of data and a
bunch of numbers right here I'm going to
have to keep scrolling up okay that was
price maybe this column was the item
name okay kind of a pain in the butt
however go ahead and select the cell in
your table and start scrolling down here
check out what happens as soon as I
scroll down the columns which were a B C
D and E they change to the table header
so no matter how far you scroll down you
always can see exactly what each column
is so this is the salary this is the
average points per game this is the
position pretty stinking sweet so for
this small example it doesn't really
look useful but trust me once you have
large spreadsheets with a bunch of
columns and rows it comes in handy a lot
so that's kind of um you know I'm
getting kind of winded because I'm
getting a little too excited about these
tables so I'm going to take a break I
might you know have a hot pocket maybe a
Gatorade I don't know but uh thank you
guys for watching in the next sorrow I'm
going to be covering more about tables
and hopefully I didn't get too excited
and you know creamed my pants or
something so thank you guys for watching
and I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
