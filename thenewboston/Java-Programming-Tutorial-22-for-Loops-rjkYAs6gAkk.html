twenty second Java tutorial and in this
story I'm going to be talking to you
guys about for loop now the less couple
tutorials I've been going over a while
loops and this was a different loop but
a for loop is something totally new so
let me show you guys what the syntax for
this is go ahead and type four and as
you can see it pops up in purple and
that's why you know it's a built-in
variable or excuse me a built-in keyword
and the for loop takes three arguments
or three statements inside it the first
one is where you want the loop to start
the second one's where you want the loop
to end and the third one is how much you
want to increment it by so if you want
to step one at a time or three at a time
so let me show you guys you need three
you need to use the variable three times
so the first statement you want to
initialize a counter variable and let's
go ahead and set it equal to one and
this is because we want our loop to
start at the number one the next one is
the same thing you did in a while loop
it's the loop condition so let's go
ahead and put counter less than or equal
to ten so now our loop starts at one and
it's going to go until it's less than or
equal to ten so it's going to go until
ten so next thing on we want to say how
much do we want our counter to increment
by well we just want to go one two three
four five six seven eight nine ten so we
want to increment it one at a time so
it's going to start at one as long as
it's less than or equal to ten it's
going to keep going and we want you to
go one at a time so that's the three
parameters your for loop takes so now
let's go ahead and write something in
our for loop let's just write
system.out.print line and we'll just
print the counter counter now let's go
ahead and run this see if we got any
errors and we don't and as you can see
down in our run box one two three four
five six seven eight nine ten and again
this happened because it started at 1:00
our Cameron variable the next thing it
did is ran until it was greater or equal
excuse me less than or equal to ten once
it got to eleven it says all right and
my greater or excuse me in my lesson or
equal to ten
no so I'm not going to do this loop
anymore and then I incremented it one at
a time you can also increment it like
something like three at a time by
pressing plus equals three remember we
learned that in a one the previous
tutorials now once you change the
increment instead of stepping by one it
steps by three at a time one four seven
ten the next one is thirteen which is
outside our condition so it proves false
but again we can change the starting
point say we wanted to start it at six
and go until let's say twenty one so now
it starts at six and goes to 21 and
steps by threes so let's go ahead and
run this and as you can see 6 9 12 15 18
21 and then it stops so that is how you
use the basics of the for loop again it
takes three um statements or parameters
the first one is where you want to start
the second ones where you want to end or
it's going to run as long as this
condition is true and the third one is
how much you want to increment by so
this is a variation um there's also the
while loop and the for loop we learned
this far there's also a couple other
loops that I'm going to be teaching you
probably in the next couple tutorials
but for now play along with the prytt
what's it called play around there we go
not play along with it play around with
a for loop until you get good at it and
once you do you're ready to move on to
the next tutorial so again thank you
guys for watching make sure to subscribe
and I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
