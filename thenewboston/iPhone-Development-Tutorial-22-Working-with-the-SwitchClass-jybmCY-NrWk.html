development tutorial in the last
tutorial we were working in the
interface file and in this tutorial
we're going to be working in the
implementation file so you know no small
talk here let's just jump right into it
let's go ahead and of course let me go
ahead of course we need to import switch
class H look at that I already typed it
in for us and now under synthesize a
window what we want to do is we also
want to synthesize that switch class
object we made I don't forget that's the
one that we are retained you know we
created that in that story we're just
synthesizing it so we don't have to
build it setter and getter methods so
after this what we want to do is we want
to start working in the application did
finish launching and this is the method
decades runned or excuse near an
automatically when your application is
done launching so what do we want to do
pretty much as soon as our application
launches we want to add that switch
classes view to the main window so in
order to do this go ahead and window
that's your main window we want to add
sub view and this view that we want to
add is pretty much says all right as
soon as your application starts running
what view do we want to add well we want
to add switch class the view from that
class because remember this is the class
that's going to manage all the other
views so this is the one we want to show
them first so after this all we need to
do is enter the allocation method just
go ahead and release that switch class
object so switch class release because
don't forget in our interface file we
retained it right here so anything that
we retained our students this one anyone
that we retain we have to release it
eventually so now that we did that I
mean what we're saying is pretty much
all right as soon as our main window
pops up as soon as we press our program
to start our application up show them
that switch classes view so essentially
said show them that switch class of view
I think it would only be fair
to start building something and switch
class so go ahead and your interface
file force which class and delete all
these dumb comments I was sure way it's
like automatically don't give me any
comments but you know I don't think
there is so i knows all right now check
it out like i said 100 times for all
this class is is pretty much a manager
for all the other classes so let's go
ahead and import class blue class and
class red class so now what we need to
do is we need to build objects to be
able to access those classes so red
class build object called red class and
blue class oops build an object called
blue class make sure I spelled
everything right close enough alright so
now let's go ahead and add property
retain non-atomic red class and red
class not just copy this right here copy
and paste blue class and blue class so
what we did here is pretty much build
objects to access anything that's in the
red class and blue class and we pretty
much built the setter and getter methods
for us without having to synthesize it
yet but we'll do that later on so aside
from this what this switch class needs
to be able to do is it only has one
other action in it in the action then it
needs to have is to be able to switch
from one view to another view again
that's cool thing we only had to build
one method in here and that's going to
be the extra so I be action just name
this like switch views and of course
going to take a parameter ID sender like
everything else we type so far so what
we did in you know what that's probably
enough for this tutorial that's all the
code i'm going to type and in next story
we're going to be hopping in interface
builder and connecting everything but
what I did is pretty much
import my classes of course and then
build an object's build objects to
access my classes and then we're going
to build property because we want to
build setter and getter methods for
these objects but we don't want to have
to type manually so that's why we did
this in our action what this action or
method is going to do is it's just going
to whenever you click that button it's
going to switch from one class to the
other class really simple so that's all
I'm going to show you guys in this story
will be a connecting everything in the
next story oh and be going over some
other stuff but you know I won't explain
it now because what's this that's what
the next tutorials for so I think you
guys for watching don't forget subscribe
and I'll see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
