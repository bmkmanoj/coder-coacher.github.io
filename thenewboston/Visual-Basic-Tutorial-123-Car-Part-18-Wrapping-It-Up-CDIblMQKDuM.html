slash on live gamer for the new Boston
and this is the final tutorial for the
car program now I know I got real deep
into the logic and the coding of this we
got over 200 lines into this program and
it got confusing at parts probably
really confusing confusing for some of
you so this is gonna be the final video
because I don't want to keep confusing
you even more and after this we're gonna
go back to some of the more core
subjects of Visual Basic instead of
making a specific application now if you
remember my created car sub right here
it wasn't the best made but it worked
and hopefully it gets the concept across
to you guys about how to work with
objects how to store objects use
inheritance and polymorphism you learned
the with keyword and a whole bunch of
stuff sorry I had to pause there for a
second but anyways you're gonna be
learning you learned a whole bunch of
stuff about inheritance polymorphism I'm
using objects ArrayList and stuff like
that
so if this didn't confuse you too much
then I'm gonna challenge you guys to
expand on this program add some stuff
with the truck and the sports car and
you can add buttons here that will get
different information about the car and
lets you set values of the car or the
truck and create new forms for like a
new car and your sports car in your
truck and stuff like that and if you can
do that and if you want to do that then
go ahead and leave it down in one of the
video responses so that we can take a
look at the program you've made sorry
I'm kind of just like dropping out of
this program right now but I got all the
stuff across that I wanted to teach you
and I don't want to jack it off for too
long so if you want to work on it you
can so let's just do one more final demo
of this so we can create a new carb
let's create a truck will click new car
we got the name of our truck so we'll do
Dodge Ram we'll set the color of the
truck to red we'll give it four two
doors also the horsepower to 300
and we'll click Add now we can show the
info about this we can do a whole bunch
of other stuff we can show the info
about these cars we can set values of
this so we can make it Orange we can
accelerate by let's say 45 miles per
hour and we can show the info and it
updates that now we cannot get the
power-to-weight ratio because it is not
a sports car so what I'm challenging you
guys to do is disable this button unless
they have selected a sports car so that
they can't they won't get any errors
then we can add more trucks we're gonna
have a sports car the name of the sports
cars who will do a challenger even
though that's like more of a muscle car
will make it blue we'll give it two
doors and we'll give it 400 horsepower
we'll click Add and we can get the
power-to-weight ratio we can change the
doors whatever we want so as I was
saying you can expand on this if you
want but for now we're gonna move back
to the core concepts of visual basic so
thanks for watching and stay tuned for
the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
