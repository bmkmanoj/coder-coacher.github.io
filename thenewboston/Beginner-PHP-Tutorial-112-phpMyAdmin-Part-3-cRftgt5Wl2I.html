are returned with here the first thing
we see is a confirmation we've got a
little tick here so one bro inserted
which we haven't sent one row and row ID
one okay so that's out on Ingram out
Auto increment value so here we have a
query that's been constructed for us and
shown back to us and remember earlier
I've talked about queries and how they
can insert data here we've got insert
into a database we're inserting into
this database dot users so it we're
accessing this database and this table
ID username and password and then with
the values null for ID we're not
specifying anything because it's
automatically going to increment for us
Alex and password so null corresponds to
ID
Alex corresponds to username and
password corresponds to password which
is the password I gave this could be
obviously anything so now what we can do
is we can click on this browse tab and
we can go back and have a look at our
data so this is a representation of our
data inside the database so let's insert
another row let's call this this time
Billy and past one two three I'm going
to click go so now we've inserted
another row with ID two
now remember that's auto incrementing
and we performing more or less the same
query but just with different values
let's go back to browse okay you can see
the data here now browsers won't be
available if there isn't any data inside
your integer table however structure is
what we were looking at before remember
we can always go back to this and change
things around that if we want to for
example now if we change password to a
numeric data our passwords here would
now be invalid so there'd be a they'd be
gotten rid of okay so we've got an idea
of one and two you can see these auto
incremented and we've got username and
password now we're going to it now what
we're going to be doing is adding
another row on to this now we've already
specified data you can imagine this may
be say hundreds and hundreds of rows of
later however now what we want to do is
we want to add on let's say a first name
and a surname so how do we go about
doing this well we come over to the
structure tab and this can be done even
though we've already got data and stores
inside our database what we can do here
is we've got add a certain amount of
fields at the end of the table at the
beginning of the table or after a
specified field in our table so what I
want to do is I want to say at the end
of the table I want to add two fields
and I'm going to click go now we've got
two fields up that we can specify
everything in here so I'm going to say
first name and I'm going to say sterling
and these types always going to be
varchar' and considering some people
salem's might be really long I'm going
to go for let's say 40 characters say 40
and 40 just to be safe so now I can come
down I don't need to specify any other
data inside here and I'm going to click
on save okay so you can see how query
here has been read back to us we've got
alter table users add first name
varchar' not null so it has to contain
some data add surname varchar' 14 not
know so this is our query to alter our
table and add two field names at the end
of the table so now you can see that
we've if we click on sorry about that we
click on browse we can a constructor we
can see that we've got our two added on
here all the relevant data if we click
on browse you can see that we've now
added two field names on but obviously
there's no data specified but what we
can do now is we can click on edit and
we can change this so we can then go
ahead and change Billy as well
and click go so we can see that we've
been given back again another query so
every time we perform a query in PHP
myadmin it usefully gives us the query
back so if you're struggling to
understand the concept of queries and
how to structure them and what they do
and how they work later on then a really
good thing to do is just play around
inside here insert things delete things
change things and just take note of the
query so in this case what we've done is
we've updated a particular row in this
case we've updated the Billy Garrett row
so we've updated the one with the ID of
two so our query reads update users
table inside a database and we're
setting first-name equals Billy and
surname equals Garrett where users died
equals two so the idea of this equals
two set first name to Billy and surname
to Garrett okay and limit one just means
we're obviously not doing this for
anything else it's just sort of
something that you don't need to add on
but you know might be beneficial so
let's return to our data so you can see
that it's all updated now you can
perform a variety of operations inside
PHP myadmin it's an extremely powerful
tool so maybe before you start using
queries and things inside PHP have a
play around here and just understand how
MySQL and its structure and its data
types and how to do things work and then
go on to the PHP side of things but for
now that's just a quick introduction to
PHP myadmin and how to use it in the
ways that we're going to be talking
about with the tutorials there's
obviously a lot more functionality
behind it but that's just a brief
introduction and how to perform simple
operations</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
