can use algebra to solve geometry
problems so we're gonna use these
polynomials to find the perimeter of
this rectangle now if you remember from
geometry or if you haven't taken it yet
just to remind you that the perimeter is
the sum of the length of each side of a
shape
so it'd be width plus width plus length
plus length so we have to add up each
one of these polynomials to find what
the perimeter of the shape is and we're
gonna leave it in the polynomial format
because we don't have any idea what the
perimeter equals we're just gonna
express it using polynomials so we're
going to take Y squared plus 2y minus 4
plus y squared minus 3 plus y squared
plus 2y minus 4 plus y squared minus 3
so we're going to combine all our like
terms so we have one two three four Y
Squared's and one two two two y's so
that's two y plus two Y is four Y and we
have negative four negative three
negative four negative three is negative
4 plus negative 4 it's negative eight
negative 3 plus negative 3 is negative
six now you have 8 plus negative six is
negative 14 so this polynomial right
here tells us what the perimeter of this
shape is in terms of Y
so now we're going to do another example
so for any shape the perimeter the way
we find the perimeter is the same so
we're still going to add up each one of
these sides and combine our like terms
so x squared minus 6x plus 4 plus x
squared minus 6x plus 4 plus y squared
minus 7x excuse me
x squared minus 7x plus 13 so we're
going to combine our X Squared's and we
have three of them X Squared's negative
6x negative 6x makes negative 12x and
negative plus negative 7x makes negative
19 X and 4 plus 4 is 8 plus 13 is 25 so
once again this polynomial that we ended
up with at the end expresses the
perimeter of this shape in terms of X so
now we're going to do the same thing but
with area now if you remember the
formula for area of a rectangle is
length times width though this little
note right here that says it is a square
lets us know that we can use the the
area of a square formula which is your
side squared so we have to square out
this binomial in order to get our area
polynomial so remember when we square
binomials we write it as two binomials
and then we foil it out
so first is 2x times 2x which is 4x
squared plus
outer - x - x negative three so negative
6x negative 3 times 2x another negative
6x and negative 3 times negative 3 is
positive 9 so this is 4x squared minus
12x plus 9 we're gonna do one more
example with area and this time it's
with a triangle so I wrote a little note
over here of the area of a triangle in
case you either don't remember from
geometry or you haven't taken it yet so
area is equal to 1/2 base which is this
one x squared minus 2x plus 6 times the
height which is X plus 4 and remember we
always use the perpendicular height so
that has to be right angle right there
so the first thing that we're gonna do
is distribute this X plus 4 to this
polynomial and then we'll distribute the
1/2 later so one-half x squared times X
is X cubed x times negative 2x negative
2x squared x times 6 positive 6x 4 times
x squared positive 4x squared 4 times
negative 2x negative 8x 4 times 6
positive 24 so now I think it's easier
if you combine your like terms first and
then distribute this 1/2 so 1/2 we only
have one X cubed negative 2x squared + 4
x squared gives you a positive 2x
squared positive 6 X plus negative 8x
it's gonna give us
negative 2x and we just have a positive
24 at the end so now we're going to
distribute this 1/2 so 1/2 x cubed 1/2
of 2 is just 1 so this is x squared 1/2
of negative 2 is negative 1x and 1/2 of
24 is 12 so that's the area of that
triangle so that's all we're gonna do
with our geometry applications of
polynomials make sure you come back and
check out our next lesson where we're
going to talk about how you can use
polynomials to solve word problems</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
