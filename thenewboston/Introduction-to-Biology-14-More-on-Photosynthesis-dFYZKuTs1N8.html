this video i'm going to go through the
light phase of photos this is the light
phase is composed of two components
you've got two photosystems you've got
photosystem 2 i'm also called p680
because the chlorophyll a absorbs light
at a wavelength of 680 nanometers
photosystem 1 or p700 the chlorophyll a
molecule absorbs light at a wavelength
of 750 700 nanometers the whole purpose
of the photosystems is to capture light
energy and then that light energy is
transferred to other molecules to
produce energy intermediates basically
the light is going to excite pigment
molecules in both photosystems one and
two photosystem to the excited electrons
are going to travel to photosystem 1
water is going to be oxidized to form
oxygen gas and hydrogen ions and the
energy release in the electron transport
chain which transfers the electrons from
photosystem 2 to photosystem 1 and
eventually to NADPH is also used to form
to contribute to the hydrogen ion
gradient and photosystem 1 its main goal
is to produce NADPH another important
aspect of the light dependent reactions
is the formation of ATP synthesis and
this is driven by the flow of hydrogen
ions from the thylakoid lumen or the
space within the thylakoid into the
stroma by the enzyme ATP synthase and
the hydrogen gradient is generated by
the addition of hydrogen ions and
thylakoids by the splitting of water the
addition of hydrogen ions by the
electron transport chain pumping
hydrogen ions into the lumen and the
removal of hydrogen ions by the
formation of nadph in the stroma and
it's a removal because you take those
hydrogen ions and stick them on to an
adp to form NADPH
so a quick overview of what happens
you've got oxygen produced in the
thylakoids by the transfer of two
electrons from water to the oxidized
form of the chlorophyll a the p680
molecule NADPH is produced in the stroma
from the high-energy electrons being
transferred transferred from photosystem
2 to photosystem 1 so you've got your
nadp+ two electrons plus a hydrogen ion
all come together to form NADPH and then
nad excuse me ATP is produced in the
stroma from the hydrogen ion gradient so
you have two types of electron flow in
the light dependent reactions of
photosynthesis you've got noncyclic
which is where electrons flow from
photosystem to the photosystem 1 and
eventually to NADPH and in noncyclic
flow equal amounts of ATP and NADPH are
produced but then you've got cyclic
phosphorylation this is when the
electrons in photosystem 1 are excited
and they release energy which causes the
transport of hydrogen ions into the
lumen of the thylakoids this drives the
synthesis of ATP but instead of these
electrons being transferred to NADPH
their return to photosystem 1 to be
recycled to produce more ATP this
normally happens when the cell is low on
ATP so the first complex involved in
photosynthesis the light dependent
reactions you got your photo system two
got two components components there's a
light harvesting complex or antenna
complex this is going to directly absorb
photons and transfer energy from
residents or transfer bot double bonds
electrons all that good kind of stuff
then you got the reaction center which
has your p680 molecule your p680
molecule is going to be oxidized
whatever it gives up an electron this is
very unstable so whenever the electron
from your p680 is transferred to a
primary
after your p680 star which is the
oxidized form is going to want to remove
an electron from water to replace the
p680 star and reduce it back down 2 p-6
steady p680 and this is going to yield
oxygen and this is the only transfers a
one electron at a time it takes to water
molecules to break apart to form the 02
but basically this what's happened
photosystem 2 reminds me of the giant
brain from blaster master I think it's
at the Boston level 1 or level 2 or
whatever so I drew a little picture of
blaster master here the giant branes
little electrocution thingies spending
around him and blaster masters like WTF
giant brain oh my god but anyways light
is going to come in here and it's going
to hit this it's going to cite excite
these pigment molecules one of these
pigment molecules is going to kick off
an electron which is going to be kicked
up picked up by the p680 this p680 is
going to absorb a photon at the 680
nanometer wavelength it's going to
excite these electrons and then it's
going to kick one of these electrons up
to the primary acceptor molecule or it's
going to go down the electron transport
chain all the way to photosystem 1 so
it's going to be picked up by the p700
where p700 is going to be read by a
photon of wavelength 700 nanometers is
going to kick out this electron to
another electron acceptor and it's going
to travel down the electron transport
chain until it reaches NADPH and this is
what's known as the Z scheme because
it's the electron starts at a relatively
high energy it's passed down to a lower
state of energy and then it's kicked up
again to a higher state of energy and
ends of it NADPH so now we have all this
ATP
nadph so in the next video I'm going to
cover the Calvin cycle which uses as ATP
and nadph to make sugars</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
