illustrator cs6 tutorial my name is
buddy and today we're going to learn
about rotating and scaling objects and
we're going to use the rotate and scale
tools that are over here in the tools
panel and they're pretty much like it's
pretty much like using the selection
tool and doing it but you have a little
more control when you use these tools so
you can change an object orientation by
rotating it and you can change its size
by scaling it and you can you don't have
to do these in certain increments or
anything like that so go ahead take the
selection tool and select the object
that you want to work with and you can
take the rotate tool and just rotate in
a circular motion and then you'll start
getting different rotations going on
here so if I just rotate I can rotate at
different ways so pretty easy get it
back to where it was and that's pretty
much it with the rotate tool if you hold
down shift you can do it in 45 degree
increments you can rotate in alright
let's go to the scale tool there's a
couple more option with the scale tool
if you drag away from the object it's
going to scale up sometimes it goes nuts
all right
and if you scale towards it's going to
make it smaller and if it's as you can
see on my guides over here it says
uniform on and when it says uniform is
going to scare uniformly or if I get it
sources horizontal it's going to scale
horizontally so you can check those out
to make sure you know you or you can see
what you're doing you can scale and flip
across the entire object see if I can
get it so it does it correctly sometimes
it it's not the easiest to do as you can
see is flipping now you can see I'm
flipping it by looking at the blue
flipping and I actually flip the object
over there can't tell because of the
shape is uniform here so you can see by
the blue outline that it was flipping
and if you hold down shift and you drag
your gonna scale proportionally and
let's go let's go on to the next set of
things so the next set of things I want
to talk about are reflecting and
shearing and those are also underneath
these tools so if I hold down this hold
on left click it'll get me to the
reflect tool and this and that's oh is
the hockey and then for the scale to up
shear is underneath it and that does not
have a hotkey so reflecting is pretty
much mirroring an object it creates a
mirror image of the object and the shear
tool creates a slanted image of the
object so let's go ahead and check those
out so make sure you have your object
selected you'll see the bounding box
when is selected and go ahead and select
the reflect tool and
you click to establish a reference point
and I'll just click here and you can see
the reference point moved I could click
and start flipping mirroring it along
that reference point I click again you
know that Europe's my bed you know that
you're changing the reference point when
you have a cross hairs as your cursor so
here's the reference point if I just
click here in the middle now if i go to
drag since the mirror is right in the
center all i'm going to be able to do is
kind of like rotate but if i put it
towards like the end here i can mirror
across that and it mirrors like that so
it depends on where you put your
reference point now for the sheer tulle
if you select that just dragged away
from the object and it's going to start
shearing for you and that's easy enough
put our reference point back there start
clicking in the when it's in the middle
it's easier to shear and there you go so
those are the rotating scaling
reflecting the shearing and if you need
to you can always go up into the
transform panel to put in exact
measurements so your transforms over
here on the x and y values you're
scaling is over here your rotations are
here and then your shears are here and
you can type in any value that you want
so that's it for how to use those tools
and if you like those tools get good at
them and use them if you don't like them
go ahead and use the free transform tool
which is right here and there's a
tutorial about that it's the one right
before this one and also the selection
tool allows you to do some of these
things you can't share with the
selection tool but you can rotate you
can scale and you can reflect using the
selection tool and be sure
check out other tutorials on that so
thanks a lot everybody thumbs up the
video if you had a good time and you
learn something and otherwise thanks a
lot for watching I'll see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
