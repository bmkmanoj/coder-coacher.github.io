tutorial and in this tutorial I'm going
to be talking about how to use an array
with a loop and I'm pretty much gonna be
teaching you guys how to spit out all
your elements in your array at once so
the first thing we need to do this is of
course an array and so I'm just going to
call my tests you can call yours
whatever you want and then you type
array and I'm just going to make a
simple array right now I'll add some
names you can add either numbers or some
text the ears on my Tom Tony Greg and
just use another one
so I got my array it's Tom Tony Gregg
and Mike and that with a semicolon and
then the next after we created an array
let me move that so you can see the
whole thing we want to create one of our
loops and we can use any of the loops we
learned in to spit out all of them the
easiest way is to use the for loop and
I'll tell you why later and remember
when you're creating a for loop inside
your parameters you don't use the
variable you created inside the
parameters has its own entirely new set
of variables the first one will set X
equal to zero
remember the first one we just have to
define the variable so we're going to
set it at X and we're going to make it
equal to zero and after it add a
semicolon and then the next one we
define the parameter and we'll just say
so the every time the variable X is less
than the size of the variable test
and this might be new to you guys the
size of automatically gives the size of
this so it would be one two three four I
could say every time it's less than four
but then later on if we wanted to change
it if we change the size of the array we
would have to come back and change all
this code so when you're doing this
always use size of its built-in function
in PHP in order to automatically correct
your array for you just a hundred
percent better than anything out so
don't learn anything else and the last
element of our parameter we just want to
tell it how much increment it by so
we're going to say just increment it by
one every time so now that we have that
we have all our parameters we say at
first start out equal to zero
in right here we just have to tell it
that there's this many elements we're
going to be working with and we're just
going to say add one every time so what
this thing does is a loop it's going to
loop through this go this this this this
but now we have to tell it that we want
to see it on the screen so I write echo
write your variable test and
and then you write in your braces the
variable X because that's what we
defined so this tells us to loop it
through and this says put it out on the
screen so we can see it when you're done
so if we saved it and went and refreshed
it you see Tom Tony Gregg Mike and of
course you can add spaces or line breaks
to make this more readable but I just
wanted to give you guys the basic
version of how you loop through an array
now in a review one last time create
your array up here in any loop and it's
easier to use the for loop you can use
this exact syntax every time you can
just copy and paste it and just change
the variable with whatever your variable
is here and here so you define your
function and says it's equal to zero to
start and we just want to increment it
by one just a regular every time this is
just your basics and then spit it out on
the screen and whatever value X is at
the time that's the one you use
so study this and learn it and the next
time I'm going to be talking about how
to go through a different different loop
and make this a lot easier thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
