second tutorial in Java game development
and in this story I'm going to be
actually finishing up the last tutorial
where we pretty much are going to finish
creating a thread and well let's just go
ahead and get started so actually we
need a main method in this so let's go
ahead and I probably should have done
that before but I can do now public
static void main string come on Hoss
args and let's go ahead and put the main
method right there so in our main method
again I should have done that before but
oh whoa you guys got some time what you
need to do in order to make threads is
call caps lock on you the thread class
go ahead and put thread and then name
your thread I'm going to name my t1 and
set equal to new thread but as your
parameter for this third class you have
to write the object that you want to
treat as a thread so new Apple remember
I made this Apple class right here that
we're going to be treating as a thread
and the constructor took a parameter and
I'm going to name it one so this thread
that has the variable T 1 is going to be
named 1 so let's go ahead and make two
more right now again we're going to be
creating 3 threads from the same class
and I'm going to name this one to 2 and
the variable to 3 and the threads name
is going to be 2 and 3 and if you're
wondering why I type in 1 2 3 it's
because this Apple constructor remember
we passed it in a string variable to
give it a name right there and then upon
construction of the object it creates a
random time so now that we have a thread
this pretty much means each of these
things instead of running a write after
another like they would if they were
just a regular object they can all run
at the same time so before we learn
about threads whenever we created a new
Apple class it would have to do the
constructor
and do everything and did first before
moving on to this one and then after
that and moved on this one but now that
we have three threads instead of a one
long program in essence this is three
things running at the same time so it
gets done three times as fast is it
usually you would so now that we have a
thread we need to start it so let's
start whenever we call start the objects
or if threads run is automatically going
to be called we don't have to cover run
we all we have to do is call start in
any code in here and threads run is
going to automatically be called so how
do we do that all we do is t1 dot start
right there and this is going to start
the thread or in other words start the
code in here so t1 just copy this t2 and
t3 and why did I make this random time
well I'll show you why in a second if I
go ahead and click as application run it
and I forgot to put a new line right
here embarrassing and now let me
demonstrate that again it says one is
sleeping for for 19 3 is sleeping for
876 and 2 is sleeping for 189 and if
you're saying all right why doesn't it
just go 1 2 3 well that's because your
computer doesn't do it in it doesn't
have to do it when you're creating
threads in order one right after another
and that's the beauty of threads these
pretty much start all at the same time I
mean there's little bit difference but
in essence they all start at the same
time and why did I put how long it
sleeps for because when a thread sleeps
it pretty much does nothing but wait
there it doesn't um pull a burden on
your CPU processor at all it just sits
there and waits there and it pretty much
allows for other stuff to happen so if
you're saying all right when this thread
gets done I want you to sleep and wait
for other threads so what when 2 is
leapin it pretty much is just sitting
there and chillin so that's why when it
sleeps for a tenth of it or excuse me
like a twentieth or 0.1 eighth of a
second then this one gets done sleeping
first the next one to wake up is threat
number one because it slept a medium
amount of time but three it was lazy and
decided to sleep the longest that's why
three got done running so late so again
what I want to demonstrate is instead of
going right after another one two three
these things run pretty much all at the
same Sun same time so it's pretty much
randomized what one is going to appear
first and this is also random and I want
to display this because this says while
it's sleeping it allows other threads to
continue doing what they do so this is
kind of the beauty of threads one more
time that you can have multiple things
running at the same time in this speeds
up your program that's all I want to
explain for this tutorial there is a ton
more to go over in threads but for the
sake of this tutorial that's all we need
to know for now as we continue
programming in games we'll learn later
and even if this doesn't make sense now
when I start using it in the game
sometimes these just examples using it
can be kind of confusing because it
doesn't really do anything it's just an
example but trust me why you'll see why
this is useful later on but I needed to
give you guys quick intro or else I
would never forgive myself for it
so that's all you need to know about
threads for now if you want to learn
more then go to the Java website or
something or just wait for my tutorials
but for now thank you guys for watching
don't forget to check out the next story
where we will be pretty much building
our very first beginning of a Java game
so thank you again don't forget to
subscribe and I'll see you next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
