tutorial on XHTML in the last tutorial
we learned how to create a block quote
and we also learn how to make an
unordered list and today we're going to
be playing around with a font tag
changing the size and the color of the
font on our website and maybe some other
stuff too if we have enough time so
let's get started and go ahead and clear
out anything you might have in your body
from last time so you have a nice empty
body to work with and just type any text
in it to get started that this is text
and I'm gonna go ahead and copy this and
paste a few times to represent what a
paragraph might look like and if we save
that and we go ahead and look at it
right now then we could see that it's
kind of plain right now just black text
average size white background so say we
want to do something different to change
the color or the size of the font in
this paragraph you need a tag called the
font tag and I'm gonna split this up
just to show you what it looks like
before and after
so let's say we wanted to make this font
red so you would put the beginning tag
and it's called font at the beginning of
where wherever you wanted to apply and
wherever you want it to end put the end
font tag now right now this and this are
formatted the exactly the same way they
look the same way but say we wanted the
changes to red we will need to add an
attribute to the font tag and the
attributes name is color so type in
color equals and you can type anything
you want I'm gonna type right because
it's easy to show up on the computer so
here's your attribute and here's your
value color equals red and it's all
enclosed in the beginning font tag and
here's our ends and anything in between
it right here is going to be red so
let's say not only did we want it red
but we want it a little bit bigger too
to change that the attribute to use is
called size and you pick any size from 1
to 7 1 being smallest 7 being the
biggest and I'll make it size 7 since
it'll be easy to see so size equals 7
and quotation marks so now this font
should be red and a bigger than average
so let's save that and take a look at it
in internet explorer and as you can see
it's instead of using the body
attributes what would which would apply
to the entire body using the font tag we
can apply attributes the certain parts
of paragraph and this is very useful
when you're trying to make certain words
or sentences stand out as you can see
this
is all that we applied with our font tag
in this is what we left normal you can
see the difference see the color and
that it's bigger now you can also use
one more attribute that's very helpful
and that's called the face attribute and
this changes the font now by default
it's Times New Roman and say we wanted
to change it to Arial so you put face
equals and type in Arial and end it so
let's save it and take a look at what it
looks like as you can see not only is it
red in size 7 but has also changed from
Times New Roman
which is just font to Arial which is
this fun so say we wanted to apply this
to an entire paragraph so say we had a
paragraph right here some text right
here and let me copy this text and paste
it and this is where the paragraph would
end so now we have a beginning paragraph
tag and an end and this is all our
paragraph if you wanted to apply it to
an entire paragraph we would simply type
the font tag right here and end it right
here so both of the font tags are
enclosed inside the paragraph tag and
you would simply change the color or
whatever you want to change about it
and as you can see when you view this in
Internet Explorer that the entire
paragraph is now whatever you want it to
change using the font tag this is also
also useful if you want to change one
paragraph believe another just like it
is or just wanted to format them in
different ways
so let's get rid of all of this so we
have an empty body and I'll show you
some other things that you can do with
text you can make it bold and how to
make italics so let's just type in this
is text and say you wanted to make this
text bold what you would use is a tag
called the strong tag and you put a
beginning tag beginning wherever you
want it to begin an ending strong tag
wherever you want it to stop it from
being bold and say you wanted something
else where you wanted to make a italics
do that
you would open with the e/m tag and
write whatever you want to make it Alex
this is italics and end it with the
ending eeehm tag so anything you want to
make bold you surround the strong tags
and anything you want to make italics
you surround with the EEM tags so let's
save that you take a look take a look at
what it looks like and as you can see
what we surrounded was strung is now
bold and what we surrounded with e/m is
now italics and I'll show you guys a
couple more symbols that are quite
useful so let's close out of this say
you wanted to add a copyright sign to do
this you wouldn't put the symbol above
the 7 the ampersand and type copy and
type semicolon now this character is
special it's not like anything else it
doesn't interpret these symbols
individually and interprets this as a
whole this entire thing together is a
copyright sign so you might have
something copyright 2007 the new boss
then it so let's save that and take a
look at what it looks like and as you
can see you now have a copyright symbol
so like I said using the ampersand the
symbol above the 7 typing copy and then
using a semicolon you can achieve this
copyright symbol now let's say that
let's clear out our body so we have an
empty body and type this is text then
let's add a bunch of spaces and let's
type something else so let's save that
and take a look at what it looks like
right now and as you can see even though
we added a bunch of spaces there is only
one space in between this and this is
because that whenever you add a bunch of
space it's just so people can
make things easier to view when they use
your notepad editor and this is so that
you can you know put things in different
places and no matter how many spaces you
have in between them only one space
she's gonna show up but what if you
actually wanted spaces in between them
well to do this you would need to add
something called a non-breaking space
and it's a lot like the copyright symbol
you use the ampersand the symbol above
the seven type in n/b sp4 non-breaking
space and the semicolon now I'm gonna go
ahead and copy that and paste it a few
times just to show you guys I'm gonna go
ahead and save it and not in Internet
Explorer and as you can see when you add
those you have space in between your
text and this is very useful if you just
keep adding spaces without this then
browser is not going to recognize this
as an actual space if you want to make
an actual space that your viewers can
view as a space you need to add the
non-breaking space symbol and again
that's an ampersand n be s P and the
semicolon
and we're out of time for right now but
in the next tutorial we've got we're
going to be learning about how to create
links and if you're not already there
