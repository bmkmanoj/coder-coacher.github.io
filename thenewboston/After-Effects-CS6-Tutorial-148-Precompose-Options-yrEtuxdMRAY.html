name is buddy Blackford and today in
After Effects cs6 I want to go over the
pre-compose options so there's two
different options that you can select
when you decide to pre compose a layer
for example if I go to pre compose this
layer we've got these two options here
and I'm gonna go over what these mean
because these little these little
captions here that are underneath that
describe it don't really give you a good
idea what's going on so I'm gonna have
to show you two so you know what is
happening so I'm gonna show you what I
did real quick because different things
are affected by the different pre count
options so if I look at this layer here
and I press you to bring up everything
of keyframes I've got a position move
I've got a mask that I just put in there
and I increase this or decreases scale
so this is just a simple animation and I
just threw these in here randomly I
didn't even care how this mask was
moving as long as there was just a mask
in there and then I also added just a
fast blur in there just so I can have an
effect on there so when I precompose you
could see what happens when there's an
effect and then I've got this other
layer above it which is the same exact
thing just duplicated so these two are
the exact same now what I'm gonna do is
I want to end up pre composing this
layer so I can fix some problems that I
might be having rendering so sometimes
you might render and something isn't
looking quite right and you're like what
is going on and you figure out what
layer it's it's screwing up on so one of
the ways you can try to fix this because
it's usually a program error and user
error when this happens when you're
rendering and everything looks nice but
it renders out crapoly is to pre-compose
the layer and there's two options you
get which I'll show you again so just
you can
is right click on the layer and go to
precompose or you can come up here to
layer and come down here to pre-compose
and you can see that ctrl shift C is the
hockey so let's pre compose this and
when you only pre compose one layer you
can't you have these two options a bit
available for you leave all attributes
and text which my main composition is
called text so whatever the name of your
main composition that your layer is in
is going to be right here or move all
attributes into the new composition nine
times out of ten I use the move all
attributes into the composition but the
leave all attributes and text also has
its uses so what's uh what's view though
so let's go to move all attributes into
the new composition first and see what
that happens and I'm gonna name my new
composition move and my other one I'm
just gonna name leave so I hit okay now
what it's done is created a new
composition and if I open this up we've
got our layer in there and if I press u
then I can show everything that I have
keyframed
and my mask path position and scale have
been moved into the new composition as
well as my effect that I have up here so
there we go
and you can see that know if I go if I
go back into my main my main comp here
and I press you to reveal my properties
that have been keyframed
I pressed you right there and nothing is
showing up I can twirl down and I don't
have any of the properties on the actual
composition now they're all inside of
the composition now let's uh this is a
duplicated layer which is the exact same
thing so I am going to turn this layer
on and I'll show you that it's the same
thing see
and we have our effect up there so now
when I pre compose that I'm going to
choose the other option so I'll bring
this down here so you can see it better
and I'm gonna select leave all
attributes and text and hit OK now it
has created a new composition again for
us I'll open it up real quick and this
is what it looks like now and within
this composition nothing is happening
anymore see there we go and if I pressed
you to review my keyframe properties
they're not there I try to open this up
and nothing is there my mask isn't there
anymore
if I click on it you can see that the
effect is not there and that the
position and skill keyframes aren't
there so let me go back into my main
composition here if I press you you can
see that all the properties are now on
the pre composed layer see as we can see
here and that's the main difference my
effect is up there now say some of your
key frame properties weren't working
that well and you didn't really want to
change anything else or whatever try one
of these - just pre compose the layer
and that may possibly fix some your
render problems so I mean that's all I
got have to say about this it's only two
options so not a lot of not a lot of
extra to say about it but just a like a
troubleshooting tip there for you guys
to figure out what's going on with your
renders so thanks for watching this one
I look forward to seeing you guys on the
next one have a good one everybody</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
