and in this video what I want to do is I
want to explain pretty much the overall
structure of a really basic simple app
so make sure that you have in these
files should are to be open because they
probably open by default whenever your
created your project but if you
accidentally closed them make sure you
have this activity main.xml open and
that's of course an app res layout
activity main in this one right here
mainactivity.java and that's of course
an app Java your comm dot the new Boston
my app or whatever you named a package
and this file right here so again these
two files open and remembering the last
couple tutorials I said every single app
is made up of these things called
activities now for now just think of an
activity as a screen so if you're making
an app for I don't know like your
website you might have an activity for
your profile page you might have an
activity for the home screen you might
have an activity for like the About
section for your company or something I
don't know but each app like I said is
made up of these screens in these
screens the technical technical bula
name from is an activity so with that
being said we can now talk about this
each activity within your app is made up
of two parts the first part is the part
we see right here right here it's the
user interface is where all your colors
your text um pretty much the design of
your activity is going to be right here
in this XML file now the brains of your
activity is this Java file right here
for example whenever you have a button
on your activity and you click it well
you need to tell that button to do
something so the smart intelligence of
your activity is going to be all in this
code the Java file so again your app is
made up of activities different screens
now each screen has a pretty much a user
interface the design and the smarts of
it or the brains of it and that's a Java
class so pretty much if
ever wanted to make another activity
what we would do is we would create a
new class with the new name and a new
XML file simple enough so now that we
understand pretty much the basic
overview of what an activity is in what
they're made up of we can start talking
about the different components of it so
hop over to this XML file which I said
is pretty much the interface the layout
of your entire app what it looks like
now if you look at the bottom we have
two different tabs right here the design
view and the text view now I want to
mention this because this might confuse
some people this is actually just two
different views of the same exact file
what Android studio did is they built
this tool that is pretty much just a
user-friendly tool of working with the
interface but what it's actually doing
whenever you I don't know like edit part
of your interface is it's actually
editing an underlying file for you and
that's the XML file so you can either do
that with the design tool by dragging
and dropping stuff in editing some
settings or just editing the source code
directly so let's actually go ahead and
look at an example of this the first
thing I want to do is get rid of this so
hop over to your XML file in design view
click on this hello world and then just
hit delete on your keyboard so we have a
blank nothing here so the first thing I
probably should mention is this what you
can do to each of your activities is you
can add widgets to them now widgets are
just little thingies that you add to
your interface and I say thingies
because there's not really one word to
describe all these things for example
let's add one of these large text areas
and this is pretty much to add any
static not changing text so let's just
go ahead and drag that in the middle and
type anything you want so if you
actually drag it in the middle you're
going to see these little green
gridlines and that's just to align
everything properly if you double click
this then you can edit the text of it
and I'm just going to like them like the
new Boston hit enter and it changes so
it's really intuitive like that
really hard to figure out so you can
also add some more widgets if you want
again like I said I'm just demonstrating
how to use the basic tool so feel free
to drag any of these widgets on if you
just want to play around with it for
example you have radio buttons and
progress bars all that stuff
so again widgets are just thingies that
you can add to your interface now again
you can either do that in design mode or
text mode so whenever you click text
mode it actually shows you a little
preview right here which is actually
nice so let's go ahead and just add one
little property so in your XML file
right here just so um you don't you know
I don't leave you guys hanging and I do
explain everything if you guys never
work with XML before it's pretty much
like HTML but you can use cool names for
your tags so if you don't know HTML or
XML then I'll probably recommend going
to watch those tutorials but as long as
you know HTML then you guys will
probably be able to follow along with
these tutorials fine so again a real
quick overview we're going to be talking
about this in detail later on this
tutorial is just to give you guys a
basic understanding so right now our
main tag right here is a relative layout
now a layout is just a general overview
of it's saying how widgets should be
positioned on the screen and there are
different types of layouts that we can
have but it's pretty much the overall
rules of how things can be laid out arm
now this text view right here is just
this widget right here
so each widget you add actually adds a
new XML element to your file so say that
we wanted to change your background
color of this right here what we would
do is actually go up the relative layout
and add a new attribute right now I just
want to show you guys if you type
Android colon and type background then
what you can do is you can actually type
in a value here now this is actually one
of my favorite color is zero zero six
six nine nine oh it's a blue color that
I use on my website a lot so again you
can also um pretty much edit the
interface this way through the source
code
so again the XML is your interface we
looked at how to change it with design
this design tool and we're probably
going to be using this one more often
and also the source code directly is
pretty much it's like a website arm kind
of like Dreamweaver if you ever use that
so yeah and actually what I want to do
is actually click this widget right here
and you see that I just click that and
it gave me some problems what I'm going
to do is hit ctrl Z and I'm going to
show you guys this little tip over here
and their component tree is pretty much
an overview of your entire activity so
this is your entire screen this is the
layout of how the widgets are supposed
to be arranged and right here I'm going
to click text view so if you ever a
bunch of widgets and they're kind of
hard to select maybe they're close
together or whatever you can actually
just select it right in this component
tree and it's going to select it for you
so again deselect it
select it again make selecting your
Ridge it's a little bit easier actually
what I want to do this is change the
color of the text to white so I'm going
to select that widget and I know the
property for this is text color so if I
find that I'm just going to click in oh
I guess it's type it in I know the value
the value of white is ffffff and hit
enter and check it out your text is now
white probably the coolest app ever
again this tool right here it isn't
really that hard to understand but we'll
cover more about it later on got your
widgets component tree properties drag
and drop tomato tomahto so now let's go
ahead and hop over to this now there's
actually one more file that I want to
show you before I let you go
so each activity like I said is XML and
Java file however go up to your app and
you're going to find a directory under
it called manifest now expand this and
you're going to find another XML file
called Android manifest XML now double
click that to open it and let me drag
this all the way to the left all right
so to recap one more time
your app is more likely than not going
to have a bunch of different activities
now
this Android manifest right here think
of this like is the main manager for
your app or it's where everything comes
together if you have a bunch of
activities floating around they can be
kind of hard to keep track of so what
this does again it's the main file that
pretty much manages your entire app so
each activity that you create this is
actually going to be a new element in
the Android manifest file so I'll
actually talk to you guys about this
right now as soon as your application
starts of course your phone doesn't know
what to do it says okay where do I go
you have a bunch of different activities
or what am I supposed to be doing the
very first thing that your phone is
going to do is it's going to look for a
file called Android manifest XML so it
says okay I'm always going to look for
this file right here and right after I
open this file what I'm going to do is
I'm going to look at all of your
activities now right now we only have
one activity so it shouldn't take it too
long to find but it's going to look
through all your activities right here
and it's going to look for a property
called actually all these properties are
kind of important but it's going to look
for a property called launcher now this
launcher is pretty much saying that this
is the main activity that you want to
launch first this is where your apps
starting point is so it says okay I
found it
now let's check out this activity
alright so it says the launcher is the
main activity so from here you want me
to go to the main activity so it hops
over here and then it says okay well
what's the deal this main activity well
all of this we'll talk about later
essentially all this activity does right
now is it sets this as your layout
activity underscore main right there so
again three very important files but
that's essentially all our app is doing
right here again I'm going to be
covering the details of everything later
on
but your phone is going to look at this
first androidmanifest.xml it's going to
look for the activity that it's supposed
to launch now ours says go to main
activity and all main activity does T
does right now I can't talk is it
launches this layout so what the user
does is they click to open this app and
they see this layout but now we know
what's going on behind the scenes so we
can edit it and start making some really
awesome stuff so for now thank you guys
for watching don't forget subscribe and
well I'll see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
