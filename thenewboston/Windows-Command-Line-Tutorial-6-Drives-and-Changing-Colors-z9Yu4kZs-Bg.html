video I want to start off by talking to
you guys about drives now a drive is
essentially just part of your computer
that you can read and write to so pretty
much a chunk of memory that is connected
to your computer now I'm sure you're
going to be familiar with most of these
so I'm sure everyone has a hard drive
and if you have you know a desktop or
maybe a bigger laptop you probably have
a DVD drive or a CD drive and I'm
guessing that most of you also have some
USB flash drive also plugged into your
computer so again all drives are are
pretty much just chunks of memory
connected to your computer in one way or
another so if you notice every single
drive on your computer is assigned its
own letter so your hard drive is usually
C and that's what we've been working in
right here just our main hard drive and
if you have a DVD drive or any optical
drive it usually gets assigned D and if
you have a USB drive in it's usually
assigned letter E or F or maybe G if you
have a bunch of stuff plugged into your
computer but basically every single
drive on your computer is assigned a
letter now these letters themselves they
don't really mean anything so actually
if you want to change your hard drive
letter to like K you can do that but the
convention is your hard drive is C now
just a little tidbit of information if
you guys are like c d e f okay this kind
of makes sense but why is your hard
drive OEC why isn't it a or b well again
this isn't really important but just
some background info
the drive letter is a and B were usually
reserved for floppy drives way back when
when you know windows was first starting
out and everyone had floppy drives so if
you're really cool then you had then you
had two floppy drives one was your
primary one and that was a and another
was your secondary one and that was B so
that's why people don't typically use a
and B on a kind of like tradition or
whatever so that's you know what would
be cool if there
actually an iPad air 2 with a floppy
shirt oh man that would look awesome
would probably be the size of a
briefcase but you know okay I'm getting
kind of off-track here what was I going
to talk about all right so from your
command line in order to see all the
available drives will you do is this if
you type in wmic logical disk and by the
way this command is not easy to remember
but you can type in get name and this is
going to give you all of your available
drives on your computer so C D E and F
of course my hard drive optical drives
and my USB Drive that's plugged in so
what if we actually want to hop into our
USB Drive and start you know creating
files the leaving files whatever we want
to do well if you just go CD and try to
move up our in CD hmm can't go back
anymore it seems like I'm stuck in my
hard drive no matter what well actually
in order to switch drives or change
drives what you need to do is you need
type in the drive letter and it doesn't
matter if it's capitalized or not so
type in E which is my USB Drive and then
: so this means okay I want to change
from my hard drive to my USB Drive so
now I can go dir and you know do
whatever I want just like I was doing on
my hard drive so now I actually want to
hop back in my hard drive so I'm going
to write C : and now I'm back so again
that is how you view all the drives and
also change drives now another thing I
want to point out real quick is if you
want to view on the directory structure
then we can do is here let me change
directory to a user's blocking actually
let me go to desktop might be a little
bit easier to see all right so there's
actually a cool um what's it called a
keyword called tree and what this is
going to do is it's going to list it's
pretty much like your dir command but it
doesn't just list the contents directly
inside it it lists the structure of
everything so not only in the folders
but what is inside those folder
as well so that's pretty cool and since
I have some time let me show you guys
this alright so right now I'm in my main
hard drive is far back as I can go and
I'm just going to type dir and I'll talk
to you guys about a few of these things
just cuz I have a few minutes so a lot
of these you should never touch because
these are just system files and you
actually don't even know type this in
just kind of watch what I'm doing I
don't want you guys accidentally delete
any B's so this program files directory
this is where most of your normal 64-bit
programs are going to go so most people
just have 64-bit operating systems
nowadays unless you have kind of an
older computer but again most of your
normal 64-bit programs are going to go
right in Program Files Program Files x86
this is where if you have any 32-bit
programs that's where they're going to
go it's really confusing that they named
x86 because it kind of sounds like that
would be the higher one by x86 this is
where like I said your 32-bit programs
are going to go now another let me move
over into users another really common
folder that you probably want to get
familiar with is this users so users of
course you guys probably already know
any user that is on your computer and if
you have a family it might be like your
son your mom your brother or whatever
every user has its own profile so right
now I'm the only one that uses this
computer so I only have one Bucky but if
I had some you know friends or roommates
or my mom and dad use it too then they
would have their own profile so yeah
some you know real quick overview of
your hard drive and the last cool thing
I'll show you for those who stuck around
this is the most important thing of all
time whenever you're learning the
command line and that is how to change
the colors of the background and the
foreground so it's really easy all you
do is you type the key word color and
then you type two digits so I'm just
kind of type in something like zero
zero capital B and that's going to
change as you see the font so let me
just do color zero I don't know
something like seven and that's going to
change your back normal let me change
color seven B in a holy crap that is the
hardest to read color ever alright now
if you ever play around with your colors
and then you're like umm yeah I met
something else supplement up 7 B is the
ugliest color ever how do I get back
normal then you can just type in the
keyword color and it's going to reset
all your colors now if you're like
alright Bucky
first of all who's texting me right now
second of all how do I know what color 0
or B is supposed to represent well if
you type color ford slash question mark
then this is going to give you a little
key code of all of the colors so 0
equals bat black 1 equals blue 2 equals
green so on and so forth so the reason
that you have to type two digits like
zero B is because whenever you're
changing colors for your command line
this first digit represents the
background color so zero is my
background in this case black now the
second digit right here which is B that
represents my foreground or the text
color so let's say that I wanted a
background of blue so I'll type 1
remember the first one is for your ball
background I was going to say black
round that's kind of a cool name for a
black background black round huh guys
you cannot steal that alright so so
let's say I want a blue background and I
don't know maybe a red foreground or red
text color then I'll just write one for
looking good what if I wanted cool
matrix well that is a green background
or excuse me a black round with a light
green foreground oh yeah look at that in
the matrix now hacker style boo-boo-boo
alright should I keep this color for the
rest of my tutorials probably not or I
would lose all his subscribers but uh
alright so there you go
enough to be playing around pretend I'm
in I'm in the matrix um actually I'm
going to keep this for the next tutorial
but anyways thank you guys for watching
I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
