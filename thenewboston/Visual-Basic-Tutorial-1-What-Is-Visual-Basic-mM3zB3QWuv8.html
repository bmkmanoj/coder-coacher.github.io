Microsoft Visual Basic tutorial and in
this tutorial I'm going to be
introducing myself letting you guys know
what a programming language is for all
you beginners out there who are just
looking to learn a language and let you
know a little bit about the dotnet
framework and about what we're going to
be doing in these tutorials now let's go
ahead and get started my name is Sam and
I run the YouTube channel youtube.com
slash on live gamer currently have about
80 videos and they're over Visual Basic
Java visual C++ and C sharp so you can
go ahead and go check that out if you
want I'll be making a lot more c-sharp
videos in the future so if you want to
go ahead and subscribe and now that my
little advertisement is over what is a
programming language what a programming
language does is it uses code that the
developer writes and it makes the
decision and what I mean by this is that
it can solve a problem or make a
decision for the user and to do this it
uses data and algorithms all programming
languages use data and algorithms it
takes that data pushes it through an
algorithm and then you get an output so
now that you know a little bit about
what a programming language is I'm gonna
try to explain to you what the dotnet
framework is now the dotnet framework
was made by Microsoft and what they
wanted to do was they wanted to create a
programming language or not a language
they want to create a framework that was
independent of Windows and what I mean
by this is that when you create a
program that runs on the dotnet
framework it is not dependent on the
system it runs on the framework itself
which is kind of like a virtual machine
if you've ever used used a virtual
machine or for you Java programmers it's
like the Java Virtual Machine it keeps
it independent of the computer that it's
running on but in my opinion it's a lot
more effective than the Java Virtual
Machine and there's a lot better job now
I may have already told you this but
Visual Basic is a very high-level
language now what I mean by this is that
it is easy to understand it's very much
like English
and it's one of the highest program
highest level languages that I know of
and an example of a low level language
would be C++ or something similar to
that now what are we going to be doing
in this tutorial well well not this
tutorial all the tutorials we're going
to start off by covering data types
variables we're going to do some math
we're going to work on simple stuff to
begin with just in the console and then
we're going to move on to windows forms
now this is one of the things I love
about Visual Basic is that it's easy to
make windows in it unlike C++ or Python
or other programming language or Java
you don't have to use the code to make
your windows and in the Visual Basic IDE
you can just drag and drop objects onto
your windows and the IDE will
automatically generate code for you that
creates that window so that when you run
your program it looks exactly like you
want and now if you do it by yourself
such as in the language like Java
sometimes it's hard to see to visualize
what your window is going to look like
by just by typing in the code and using
coordinates so this is one of the
reasons I like Visual Basic and all of
the visual other languages in Visual
Studio so if you guys have any questions
you can go ahead and leave them in the
comments I'm I'll be monitoring these
videos on the new Boston and I'll try to
answer as many questions as I can I know
they're going to be a lot because he has
a lot of subscribers and I hope you guys
stay tuned for the next tutorial
also one more thing is that if you guys
want to learn more about the languages
in that run on the dotnet framework or
just other stuff about development with
this you can go ahead and head over to
the Microsoft developers website at
msdn.microsoft.com to read up about
their languages they have and the new
stuff and the new releases that they
come out with so that's about it thanks
for watching and don't forget to comment
