need to write a little bit of code it
only takes like five lines to say
whenever you click this button go to
this activity so hop over in your apples
dot Java file and we need to import two
quick things import Android they spell
import right I did for once actually
content dot intent and that's so you can
actually use intents and of course
import Android to view dot view tighten
this up a little bit and of course
remember since all we did is we created
this unclick attribute on the button in
the XML file we don't need to add any
listener at all we can just jump right
down under on create and public void on
click so again this is the method that's
going to be called whenever the user
clicks the button simple enough
easy wheezy cheesy alright so the first
thing we need to do is actually let me
click this first intent I new intent
this bacon class alright so the first
thing we need to do is we need to create
an instance of the intent class and this
is just the way that Android switches
between activities so in order to do
that it's just like creating anything
before but the only parameter we have to
look at is this is the activity that you
want to launch of course we only have
one other one the bacon class so simple
enough so pretty much just set up an
intent that say that pretty much says
this is the activity we want to launch
simple enough and now the only other
line of code is to launch it and the
method to do that is start activity and
this launches an activity it now says
okay well what one do you want to launch
well we only made one and it points to
the bacon class so just pass I in right
there so how easy is that
now my emulators no not ready yet so I'm
going to wait a second and actually why
that's booting up I noticed that there
is one more thing that I forgot and that
is we need to throw view view through
this unclick all right now let me go
ahead and run this and here we are so of
course our apples say apples apples
activity is the first one that launches
and when I click go to bacon
hopefully sweet it goes to that bacon
activity and of course if you ever want
to go back and do the same thing make
bacon go back to apples it's the same
exact technique I mean I don't want to
waste your guys this time and showing
you guys the same thing over and over
again well what I do want to show you
now is something else and that is what
if we want to take a piece of data from
the apples activity and whenever we
switch to the bacon activity we want to
send that data along so we'll be a
real-life example of this say that you
had a messenger app and of course all of
your friends were in a list and you also
had another activity where you could
write someone a message well what you
wanted to happen is you wanted to click
on one of your friends maybe their
profile picture and then it would say
okay you're writing this friend a
message or if you clicked on another
friend you would write that friend a
message so what you need to do is you
would actually need to pass some data
along from one activity to another in to
accomplish this it's actually really
easy so what I'm going to do is if you
go back to your apples activity right
here ahead one this alright
so add just a plain text field right
here drag it anywhere on the screen and
I'm just going to set the width of this
to like 250 DP so the user has something
type in and we'll just run this example
real quick well first of all let me give
this an ID all right so I'll name this
apples input and we'll say that the user
can type something in here I don't know
maybe
a name of their friends or something and
what we're going to do is we're going to
take that data and we're going to send
it along to bacon and then we'll just
print out whatever they typed right here
so again a real quick example but it'll
teach you the basics of a very important
concept so again make sure you have
input so we can get some data from the
user and named apples input so now hop
back over to your apples dot Java class
and import Android dot widget dot edit
text and that was of course that input
field all right
so scroll down to on click and now what
we want to do between these two little
lines of code is essentially get the
text from that input so final edit text
I'll just leave my apples input remember
I'd like naming my Java variables the
same as whatever that ID was so now of
course edit text find V by ID are da ID
apples input so now this is just a
reference to that input field so now
what we want to do is actually get the
data or get whatever text they typed
into it so string I'll just say that I
know it's user message you set this
equal to apples and put dot get text dot
to string so that's going to take
anything they typed in convert it to a
string and store it in this user message
variable so now that we got that taken
care of the only other thing we need to
do is we need to figure out how we
transfer it to bacon activity and it's
actually really easy anytime you have
extra information that you want to pass
along to another activity you call the
put extra method now the put extra
method takes any extra extra information
in the form of a key value pair so the
first parameter is okay
what do you want to call this piece of
information and now just name it like
Apple
ceej now the second part of course is
what information do you want pass along
and of course the user message so
eventually we're going to say okay
switch to the bacon activity and when
you do pass along the user message
whatever they typed in and just so they
can arm you know have the ability to
print it out or whatever they want to do
with it
we'll just reference it with the keyword
Apple message so pretty sweet so now
that we're passing it along we need to
add the functionality in bacon not Java
to handle it
now all baking that job is going to do
is it's going to pretty much take
whatever message and set it as the text
right here simple enough so let's just
go ahead and import Android widgets dot
text view because that's the only thing
that we need a reference and of course
it's going to allow us to reference that
right there now the code for this we can
actually just stick on oncreate because
this is a code whenever you create or
launch this activity so the very first
thing I need to do is I need to allow
this class the ability to accept extra
information and in order to do this you
actually just call bundle and I'm just
going to name it apples data and the
method for this is gets intent get
extras so essentially what you're doing
is you're getting any extra information
whenever you get launched from somewhere
so this is gonna call the intent this is
the extra information and any extra
information we're just going to store in
Apple's data simple enough so now what
we have to do is actually want to test
something first so say if Apple's data
equals null in other words there's no
data I don't know maybe this got
launched from another activity or maybe
you don't have any data for a reason
maybe they just
type anything in whatever then what we
want to do is we want to handle it
appropriately and we can just return
because of course you don't want to try
to change this text if there is no text
to accept so that takes care of it make
sure that we never get any errors or
anything like that however if it gets
passed through that test that must mean
that the user gave us some extra
information so the first thing I want to
do is just store this in a variable and
what did I name that Apple message so
I'm going to make a variable called
Apple message and of course this is
equal to apples data get string and the
parameter that you need for here is that
keyword so again this is the keyword or
the key but it's actually going to be
equal to the value which is whatever
they typed in like I love Bucky that's
something that a lot of people are
probably going to type in because it's
so awesome and I am the coolest dude in
the world I should just talk for like
ten minutes about how awesome I alright
rambling again all right so the next
thing I want to do is of course just get
a reference to this text view and set it
equal to our newly formed variable
simple stuff here so text view and them
in a bacon text and set this equal to
text view fine view by ID art I have a
date bacon text and of course you guys
already know what all this those bacon
texts if you ever want to change the
text on something you just call the
method set text and of course remember
that Apple message is essentially the
string that the user typed in simple
enough so now let's go ahead and run
this alright now just let me type
something randomly like Bucky is awesome
go-to bacon and check it out what it did
is it took that text and it passed it
along
and a pretty cool app so we got apples -
bacon Bucky is awesome tomato tomato so
now we pretty much know the basics of
intense not only how to switch gear this
out-of-the-way from one activity to
another but we also learn how to pass
information along with it pretty stinkin
sweet so there you go thank you guys for
watching and I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
