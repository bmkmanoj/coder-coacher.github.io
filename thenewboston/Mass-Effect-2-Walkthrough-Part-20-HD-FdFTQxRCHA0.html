I've got
sorry i am back down
have a nice trip
ah
ah
tarpon
looks like we're in Fortune territory
the Blue Suns have given up a lot of
turf
no funny business once you're in the
clinic
use the ladder in plenty on hand almost
as good professor Morton solace touring
and physiology Brazilian with simple
immuno booster should we find out now to
greetings human curious don't recognize
you from area too well-armed to be
refugees no mercenary uniform quarantine
still in the fact here is something else
fortune crew to clean them out I likely
fortune a symptom not a caused the
plague investigating possible uses
bioweapon no no no too many guns not
enough data equipment soldier not
scientists yes yes hi guns maybe I'll
give her something relax morton i'm
commander shepard and i came here to
find you i'm on a critical mission and I
need your help mission what mission no
no no no too busy clinic understand
played spreading too fast whose thank
you ever heard of an organization called
Cerberus crossed pants on occasion
thought they only worked with humans
during an involvement surprising racial
tension with humans unlikely to help a
human centric organization this mission
reaches far beyond mere human interests
professor we all have to work together
to take down the collectors collectors
interesting placating these slums is
engineer collectors want a few groups
with technology to design our goals may
be similar but must stop play first
already have a cure need to distribute
it at environmental control center
vorcha gardena need to kill them I'll
get in and deal with the wardship
that wasn't a good noise fortune have
shot down Environmental Systems trying
to kill everyone need to get power back
on before district suffocates here take
precure also fullness in good faith
weapon from dead blue sense marks may
come in handy against fortune one more
thing Daniel one of my assistants when
did the vort to territory looking for
victims hasn't come back if I see him
I'll do what I can to help thank you
told her not to go but he's smart bright
future I hope let's head for the
environmental plant</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
