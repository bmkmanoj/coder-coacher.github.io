welcome to the third episode of don't
try this at home
and yes I know I'm wearing very nerdy
glasses right now by actually I ran out
of context so the eye doctor gave me
these to wear in the mean time so he
laughs it up
but anyways in this episode we're gonna
be working with sulfuric acid and sugar
so for this experiment of course the
first thing you need is sulfuric acid
and you can actually get this off of
amazon.com you can get a lot of
different concentrations this is the
most powerful concentration it's 98%
concentration
pretty much the more warning labels in
the more danger signs the better it is
another thing that you need is some type
of sugar now I'm going to be using pure
cane sugar and this is a type of sugar
that you find on you know if you go out
to a restaurant the kind that you put in
your coffee I'm also going to be using
sugar cubes in powdered sugar to get
different effects now the scientific
equipment that you need are just a few
beakers and also I'm going to be using a
glass stir rod to stir the mixture now
before we start messing around with
sulfuric acid we need to make sure we're
safe so the first thing you should do
before we start working with it at all
or even handling the bottle is you
should make sure you have rubber or
latex gloves on some kind of gloves that
fit tight to the skin because this is
the most common type of sulfuric acid
burn whenever it gets on your hands now
another thing you want to do is you want
to make sure you're wearing either a
long-sleeve shirt or a lab coat if you
have the choice I recommend a lab coat
because they usually make them out of
material that's a little bit more
chemically resistant and we definitely
don't want any of this getting on our
skin so go ahead and button it up
because you know you don't want your
flaps waving around whenever we're
messing with these experiments and also
you definitely want to put on goggles
make sure the goggles fit tight to your
face because if this stuff gets in your
eye you're gonna have a very very bad
day now the last thing you want to do is
you want to make sure that you have
baking soda or some type of base on hand
because if we spill this we're going to
need to neutralize it and baking soda is
a really good base to neutralize any
acid spill now for the first experiment
I'm just going to be using basic table
sugar this is pretty much the kind of
sugar
put in your coffee and I have a 250
milliliter beaker and I'm gonna float up
about half full spray around 125
milliliter and it's probably good and
now we'll go ahead and make sure that's
all even and then you can go ahead and
carefully add the sulfuric acid so you
want to add just enough so it saturates
all of the sugar and at first it's not
going to be saturated so that's why you
need your glass stir rod so go ahead and
take know of the color of this reaction
it's going to start out as kind of tan
and then as you can see as I'm stirring
it parts of it turned black and parts of
it are getting more dark dark brown and
even though you can't feel it or smell
it it kind of smells like well burnt
sugar and there's a lot of heat coming
off this right now it's getting really
warm so I'm gonna go ahead and stir this
and as you can see basically now it's a
really dark brown almost black and
that's what we want so right now is
getting a really high I can hardly keep
my fingers on there anymore and that's
why I got these tongs right here so I
can go ahead and handle it this a little
bit closer and now let's just go ahead
and make sure that this is moved away
my tongues got stuck in there but there
you go so that again is sulfuric acid
ninety-eight percent concentration and
pure table sugar I think Kim Kardashian
would like that experiment so that was
pretty cool but now let's go ahead and
try it with powdered sugar now powdered
sugar has a greater surface area than a
regular table sugar so let's see if we
get a little bit of a different reaction
put pretty much the same amount in
powdered sugar the first thing I notice
is of course it's changing color a whole
quicker and also it absorbs and I didn't
even have time to stir it all in
so clearly since the powdered sugar has
a greater surface area than the regular
sugar they reacted more quickly now the
last thing I want to do is I want to
perform this experiment using sugar
cubes now if sugar cubes of course have
the least surface area out of all of
these things but it still should account
for a pretty cool looking experiment
just one more okay just one more okay
just one more just one more
and just one more okay so that's pretty
good so now let me add a little bit of
acid and we'll see what happens of
course I can't mix this or anything so
we're just sit back and see what happens
all right guys now let me go ahead and
explain the chemical reaction now
whenever sulfuric acid reacts with sugar
and remember a sugar molecule consists
of three different elements carbon
hydrogen and oxygen so what it's going
to do is it's basically gonna split the
carbon separated from the sugar molecule
so you end up with pure carbon and you
also end up with hydrogen and oxygen
which is going to form water
now we could tell that this was a
exothermic reaction because we could see
that a lot of energy was being released
now even though you guys couldn't feel
it the energy that was being released
was in the form of heat now that was the
heat that caused the water molecules h2o
to convert to steam now the reason for
the color change is because pure carbon
is black so whenever we have pure sugar
which is white converted to pure carbon
which is black we get a pretty cool
color change now the reason that it
appeared to be growing was because of
the carbon whenever pure carbon atoms
bonded with each other they take up a
lot of space so that's why it not only
appeared to be changing color but it
appeared to be growing as well and
whenever you mix the two together you
get a really awesome chemical reaction
so thank you guys for watching the third
episode of don't try this at home
hopefully in the next episode I'll have
my contact so I don't have to wear these
dorky glasses anymore but anyways like I
said thanks for watching don't forget to
subscribe and I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
