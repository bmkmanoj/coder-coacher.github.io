actually get to that level let's go
ahead and start building it the first
thing of course that we need to do is
just put our main character on the
screen so these are the graphics that I
have this is just the bullet that shoots
out of his gun this star ball that's the
thing that's going to be falling in
we're going to try to shoot it now the
main character I put in a Florida called
shooter dot atlas and it's not just a
single image it's actually six different
images and you can see that these are
actually frames of an animation so
whenever you have um any animation in
your game made up of different images in
different frames you want to stick
inside a folder called Atlas now this
isn't any you know you don't have to
make it any special type of way you just
make any folder and name it the name dot
Atlas now the reason you do this is
because dot Atlas it means something
special to Xcode and sprite kit whenever
it sees the name dot Atlas it knows that
the images inside it are grouped
together they're part of the same image
in some way either frames of an
animation or if you have like a huge 2d
world they can be part of kind of like a
bigger image but what we want to do from
here is this take that folder and we're
going to want to drag it let me expand
this so you guys can see what's going on
expand supporter supporting files and
just take all of your images and drop
them right in supporting files and now
just click finish everything is good to
go
so we now have all of our images right
there in a folder called Atlas so right
now they're just in our Xcode project we
didn't add them to the screen or
anything so actually let me get rid of
this and what we want to do here is go
to shooter scene da SKS and zoom out a
little bit now from here if it isn't
already open go to your media library
and I'm guessing that you have this open
by default so the media library is
it's just a little icon that looks like
a piece of film I guess that's what it
is and what you're looking for is the
very first image a very first frame
because whenever the user first opens
this level this is the first image we
want to appear so mine is shooter one
dot ping and just drag it out somewhere
I don't know on the left
looking good whatever and I also want to
change the background of this so click
anywhere on the scene and I'm just gonna
make mine white everything else kind of
annoys me all right
so anyways that's just a little nuance
y'all and I actually have to do that so
select that object again and from here
what you need to do is go up to the name
and we want to give it a name so we can
reference it and I'll just name it
shooter node it Center and also what I
want to do is I want to scroll down to
are a physics definition right here now
the physics definition is essentially
for collision detection and it's the
outline of whatever object you're
looking at now if you look right here
it's just a rectangle and that's all
right I mean that'll be pretty good for
a collision infection that's what people
do mostly whenever they're making games
but you can also choose alpha mask now
what it's going to do you see that thick
blue line instead of just making it a
square based on the height and width
what it does is it actually looks at the
Alpha value and it's just a really
accurate way to quickly get really
awesome collision detection so again
it's all built-in you just have to
change it to where is it again alpha
mask and it takes care of it for you now
check this out the cool thing about this
is SKS environment is if you click
simulate watch what happens it pretty
much simulates your game real quick
without having to go and running it and
launching it in the simulator
so again you just click it and it just
simulates it real quick pretty cool
feature but obviously we see that we
have a problem with our game whenever
the game is gonna start the dude is just
gonna drop and fall down like on a never
ending world and that's obviously not
what we want well I want for this game
is for this dude to stay in this same
location and then the things that are
gonna be moving are those balls so we're
just gonna tap and shoot out our bullet
and then he obviously can't be like
moving around going off the screen so
how do we change that well if you select
them again and then if you scroll back
down to physics definition this is all
the gravity and dynamic stuff what we
want to do is pretty much put the
opposite of the default so we actually
want pin to be checked and unchecked
everything else so no dynamic no ill our
rotation it's not going to be affected
by gravity and it is going to be pinned
in the same location so now if we hit
simulate you can see that it's now
staying in the same place and so verify
that we can actually just run in our
simulator if you don't trust me and
we'll check out our game so far so we
tapped to play whenever we do it takes
us to that new level and our dude is
there ready to shoot some crap looking
good so in the next tutorial I'm gonna
show you guys how to animate this dude</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
