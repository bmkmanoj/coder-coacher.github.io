50th wow this is like a milestone of
50th udk tutorial and in this tutorial
I'm going to be teaching you guys how to
use the switch action in unreal kismet
so before I continue I want to tell you
guys that I did jump back into our old
map um if you remember this map let me
just go ahead and play it this is the
map that I think I taught you guys how
to use announcements so whenever you go
up to the switch box and hit eat it
plays the sound and it says Bucky is
awesome like a hoss so if we go ahead
and actually take a look at the coding
for this we go ahead and use the trigger
and I thought you guys how to use this
announcement right here so again
remember this trigger isn't a contact
trigger we actually have to go up to it
and hit e rather than you know just
running or bumping into it so let me go
ahead and first disconnect this wire
right here and position this right over
there now remember this announcement
just says Bucky is awesome like a hoss
ray on the screen so if I just go ahead
and hit ctrl-c to copy this and paste
that two more times I can get two more
announcements that both say the same
thing however I want this announcement
to say Bucky is awesome like a house in
this next one to say arm but he's not as
awesome as Natalie Portman and make sure
you spell that wrong and for this last
one I'll just put dot or is he again
this little story doesn't have to make
sense I just want something to go kind
of in a sequential pattern I could put
one two and three but you know one two
and three come on that's boring who does
that so now let me go ahead and ctrl alt
and drag and actually move these over
because in the middle I'm going to be
adding something called a switch oh you
don't believe me do you let me go ahead
and do that right now go ahead and right
click and hit new action had a swallow
there and if you go under switch you're
going to find something called a switch
hmm who would have thought to look there
now let me explain you guys what
switches
you know how I told you guys before that
a single event can cause a single action
well what if this event can make each
one of these actions happen well we know
we could do this used and used and used
and then if we hit that switch all of
these would play at the exact same time
but that is not the effect we're going
for so let me go ahead and disconnect
that what I want is the very first time
I hit this switch then I want this to
happen the next time I hit it I want
this to happen the next time I hit it I
want this to happen and that's exactly
what a switch action does so the first
thing we notice is that it only has one
input but it also only has one output so
one of these am I supposed to plug into
well first of all we need that give it
more outputs so if you go ahead and look
at the properties for switch you're
going to see something called a link
count under this sec act switch so now
let me go ahead and put this link count
to three this basically means how many
different options the one linked to so
the first time I hit the switch it's
going to go ahead and play this one if I
hit it a second time it's going to play
this one and if I hit it a third time
it's going to go ahead and play this one
so now that's it that all there is to it
so let me go ahead and X out of this hit
play from here and check it out I'm
going to run up to my control panel and
now i'm going to hit e and it's going to
say Bucky is awesome like a hoss if I
hit again it says but he's not as
awesome as Natalie prop men went to
spell portman right there now let me hit
it one last time and it says or is he oh
it's kind of like a ebook question right
at the end there so now actually for the
fun of it let me go ahead and hit this
one more time can you hear me clicking
my keyboard click click click click
click click yeah that's what's a my
keyboard makes weird huh so nothing's
happening it doesn't loop back or
anything so maybe that's the effect
we're going for maybe we just want the
user to read through those messages one
time and never again but if we do want
to loop it back let me show you guys
this property if we go ahead and hit the
switch we have looping right here
disabled nothing is in that check box
but if we go ahead and check it then
whenever we're done cycling through the
switch it goes up and it hits number one
again and it loops through forever and
ever so now let me go ahead and X out of
this hit play from here and check it out
e Bucky is awesome like a hoss but he's
not as awesome as Natalie prop man or is
he and hit it again again Bucky is
awesome but he's not or is he I can do
this all day if I wanted to so I'm not
going to waste your time with that so
basically that's why I explained that
what I want to explain that you guys ass
which is something that it's basically a
way that a single event can cause
multiple actions to happen one after
another basically if you just look at
this then you guys can see what's going
on a lot better than me explaining
however at the beginning the store oh my
guess is whenever you came across switch
then you guys might have been a little
confused by the wording because whenever
you think of switch you think on and off
and you don't think it through looping
through a list so hopefully you guys
understand what switches now and how to
use it so thank you guys for watching
don't forget subscribe and don't forget
to donate two million dollars to me on
my website so uh oh that last thing I
said oh don't worry about that so I'll
see you next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
