specifically the angle measures in a
regular polygon so first you need to
remember that a regular polygon has all
sides that are congruent and all angles
that are congruent that's what makes
them a regular polygon so to find the
measure of one angle in a relic regular
polygon you're going to find the sum of
the angles which you can do by drawing
in your diagonals and multiplying by 180
and then divide by the number of divided
by the number of angles so this leads us
to this little formula right here which
allows us to do this in one step so n is
the number of sides or angles because
this this is a hexagon so it has one two
three four five six sides but it also
has one two three four five six angles
so you take the number of sides or the
number of angles which is six u minus
two n times a by 180 this top part is
number one finding the sum of the angles
and this and when you divide by the
number of sides you're doing when you
divide by six you're doing number two
and we're just doing it one step so the
measure of angle 1 is equal to 720
divided by six which gives
as an answer 120 so the measure of angle
one right here is 120 and that means
since it's a regular polygon that every
one of these angle also measures 120
degrees so we know that this is a
regular quadrilateral which is also
known as a square and we know and since
its regular that means these are all
congruent and we know that the length of
one side is 4 so that means all the
sides measure 4 so if we want to find
the measure of this angle angle X right
here we're going to plug it into our
formula so we have four sides so that
means N equals 4 so 4 times 2 4 minus 2
times 180 divided by 4 gives us 2 times
180 divided by 4 360 divided by 4 means
that the measure of angle X is equal to
90 degrees so for the next one we know
that these sides all these angles are
congruent and these sides are congruent
because it's a regular triangle or an
equilateral triangle so we define the
measure of angle we're gonna call this Y
we take 3 minus 2 times 180
divided by three is equal to 180 divided
by three which equals 60
you also could have solved it using your
knowledge of the interior angles of a
triangle since the sum of a triangle is
180 degrees and there are three equal
angles you could have just divided by
that by three and gotten 60 degrees
either way you get the same answer so
we're going to do it now for a regular
deck decagon and if you remember a
decagon equals twelve sides so our n is
12 so the measure of we're just gonna
call it angle one is equal to 12 minus
two times 180 over 12 so you get ten
times 180 over 12 and if you put that
into a calculator you'll get the measure
of one angle 150 degrees so a regular
100 gone so that means there's a hundred
sides so the measure of one angle 100
minus 2 times 180 over a hundred and
we're just once again we're just gonna
plug that into the count and you'll get
one seventy six point four when the
numbers get this big and this big it's
okay to just go ahead and plug it into a
calculator so now that we know about
regular polygons in general make sure
you come back because in our next lesson
we're gonna talk about specific types of
polygons
starting with parallelograms</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
