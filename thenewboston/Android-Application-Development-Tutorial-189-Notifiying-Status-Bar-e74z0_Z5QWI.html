and eighty ninth Android tutorial for
the new Boston what we're gonna do in
this tutorial were basically gonna learn
about the status bar and how to update
it you know if you guys have a droid
phone when you get text message you get
a little image of a message and then
like a little text and pull this down
see your notifications click on it it
does something this is basically the
finished application pretty simple
looking we just hit a button and
displays like lightning bolt says what's
up gangsters we click on our
notification or actually we're going to
go out of our activity scroll down and
as you can see as a title it says what's
up and it says what's up gangsters click
on that it opens back up this activity
that we're just in and you know clears
our notification so that's pretty much
we're going to do is probably take two
tutorials maybe three but what I want
you guys to do is create a drawable
resource or a PNG that has 24 pixels by
24 pixels this is just gonna be your
icon supposed to be a lightning bolt but
you know I have no chance of being an
artist ever
so yeah just create something that's 24
pixels by 24 pixels save it in your
drawable folder and we're gonna get
going here so we're also gonna need is a
new class called status bar and a new
layout that's just going to be one
button called status bar as well so
there we go again it's just gonna
extends activity implements
onclicklistener
setup your button setup you're
onclicklistener and we're good to go the
first thing that we're gonna need is a
notification manager it's gonna kind of
will manage all of our notifications you
gotta clear specific notifications gonna
you know add that notification to our
title or status bar so that's we're
gonna set up here for whole class to use
we're gonna call this notification
manager never just call this n/m and
again add our imports and let's set this
up what this notification manager is
again gonna do just allow us to access
that status bar and you know clear the
notification and update it so we're
going to do is we're gonna say mmm
is equal to again notification manager
and we're just gonna say get system
service and we're gonna pass in
notification service
so there we go we basically set up our
notification manager and all that good
stuff and now what we're gonna do is
we're again gonna allow a pending intent
because once we you know add the
notification to our taskbar there's an
intent that's waiting to happen because
it's gonna launch our activity and it's
just chilling there it's like hey guys
uh no I'm I'm an intent and I'm just
hanging out so you know whenever you
guys you don't need me I'll just hit me
up and you know we'll do that so you
know that's basically the pending intent
that we worked with that with widgets as
well so what we're gonna do is we're
going to set up a pending intent I'm
just going to call this PR we're going
to set this equal to pending intent
class dot get activity for the context
we're gonna say this for the request
code we're gonna say zero for the intent
let's just set up a new intent up here
called intent so we don't have to change
anything again we're just gonna refer to
the class that it opens so we're gonna
just say this is equal to new intent and
then the package name we're gonna say
this and the class name so we're gonna
say status bar dot class and if you guys
want to change which class it opens you
can do that there so that's the intent
that we're having for the flags we're
just gonna set this equal to zero and
that's probably going to be the quick
introduction for this like I said it
might take one more tutorial or two more
not sure to pay on how elaborate I want
to get into this but uh I'll catch you
guys in the next tutorial
and again just hopefully you guys
understand kind of what the application
is gonna do so we don't get too lost
it's not going to be too lengthy or hard
or difficult or anything but I'll catch
you guys in the next tutorial and have a
good one see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
