tutorial and this tutorial I'm gonna be
going over a couple tools the first tool
I want to go over is something called
the slip tool and I don't know if you
notice or not but I got a whole bunch of
new clips that I'm gonna be working with
these are just clips just random clips
you can use any short movies or anything
let me just start out with this one just
my friend reading the ticket or
something and what the slip tool does is
take your clip right here which is this
whole little blue bar is my movie and it
allows you to adjust in and out points
and if you don't know what that means
I'm gonna show you what it means
say you edited your clip so it's in your
timeline and just how you like it now as
you can see whenever we edit our clip we
are after effect shows you even though
it's not showing the movie it shows you
the ends of the clips just so you can
see how long it is so what the slip tool
does is it allow you to keep your clip
in the same location but move the time
so say you edited this clip you already
put a bunch of keyframes in but you're
like alright instead of my friend
reading this ticket right now I wanted
to be talking right now so all you have
to do is instead of moving all this
around like this what you have to do is
go hover over the light part and
remember the dark parts are the parts
that are showing whenever it's in the
light part it's a blank hover over a
light part and slide it and as you can
see the in and out points are changing
and although your clip doesn't change
position you're allowed to change the
time and therefore the scene of the clip
so this is a very useful tool and ever
you've got everything laid out
and all your keyframes situated but then
you go back and you're like alright I
got everything just how it is but I just
want to change this a little bit so
there's a one useful way to use a slip
tool another thing that you can do let
me go ahead and fix this another thing
that you can do is split layers now this
is pretty much exactly like it sounds
say you got one layer but you want to
split it in two so see my friends
reading the ticket right now and now
he's talking move your current time
indicator right in between those places
and then you want to go up to edit and
then after you want to go to a split
wherever that is here it is edit split
layer and now as you can see you got two
different layers that you can work with
you got your layer where he's reading
the ticket that you can apply keyframes
to or animate however you want and then
you got a whole different another layer
where he's talking so this is how you
can animate the same scene split it up
so you're not messing with the other
part this is gonna come in use a lot
later in the last tool I wanna actually
the last two tools I want to go over you
guys with is the overlay and a ripple
tool and these pretty much kind of act
just like they sound say you got this
czz are actually we made these two dance
clips and say we wanted to add a clip
right in between them to do this we will
need a tool called the ripple tool so go
ahead and get a scene this is an
entirely new scene and down here on the
bottom right these are the overlay and
ripple tool the overlay is the little
arrow that's overlaying the gray thing
and the ripple tool is a little ripple
tool well that makes no sense but you
know what I mean what the ripple tool
does is pretty much take this scene in
squeeze it in between your two clips
wherever the current time indicator is
so as you can see if I press this now we
have this first dance clip the ripple
tool squeeze this movie in between and
then we have our last dance clip so
instead of what was touching here and
here we now have this new robot scene in
between and what overlay does is a lot
different than that it pretty much says
alright wherever your current time
indicator is that's where I'm gonna
start I don't care what's below me I'm
gonna lay my movie right on top of it so
as you can see this doesn't try to
squeeze in between or anything it just
pretty much lays on top and takes
justice over any scenes that work below
it so again the ripple tool squeezes it
in and doesn't mess with any of your
other Clips the overlay pretty much is
like a blanket and lays the new clip on
top of your old ones so that new scene
is the only one you're gonna get to see
so the best way that you can actually
learn these clip learning these tools I
mean is just work with them for like
five seconds each and once you do you'll
get the hang of it so if I sound like a
little confusing it is confusing trying
to explain the but work with them and
after you work with them for like three
seconds then you'll pretty much be an
expert on a mom so that's all the boring
stuff we had to learn for this circle in
next tutorial I promise it'll be more
exciting so thank you for watching make
sure to subscribe to my channel and I'll
see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
