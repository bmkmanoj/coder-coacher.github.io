Photoshop cs6 tutorial today we're going
to be working with the liquify mask
options so when you work with an image
that contains a selection or a mask you
can control how the liquify command
adjusts the image with that mask
information so pretty much you can get
more of a precise control over what
portions are modified so let's go ahead
and go ahead and open up an image or a
document or something like that and go
ahead let's make a selection and I'm
just gonna make a selection over this
fish right here and then let's go apply
the liquify so now you can see that the
liquify is only going to use this set of
masks or this our selection I mean so
we've got a couple mask option here make
sure you check the advanced mode button
and that'll bring up some of our mask
options so I'm gonna go over some of
these mask options and tell you what a
little bit about them so the first one
we've got is replaced selection so this
shows the selection transparency or
layer mask in the original image if I
select that that's what's going to
happen there
excuse me the next one is add to
selection that shows the mask in the
original original image so you can then
add to the selection using the freeze
tool the next one here is the subtract
from selection that's going to subtract
pixels in the selection and it's going
to subtract them from the current
protection with the freeze tool so if I
let me just draw in here with freeze
tool alright and that way I can use the
selection that way
and then I've got intersect with
selection and I uses only the pixels
that are selected and currently frozen
and then the next one is invert
selection that uses your selection to
invert the currently frozen area so
that's what I got there and then I'll go
ahead and apply like something like this
going on here hit OK
and then you can see that only that part
of the selection was affected and now
you know a little bit more about the
liquify mask options so that was a
little quick tutorial wanted to go with
you and now you know more about the mask
options and it's gonna be helpful to you
to know about those when you're working
with a layer so if you wanted to just
completely mask out the fish you could
take your time and then you can use the
liquify options on the fish so that's
pretty helpful so thanks a lot for
watching the tutorial and I look forward
to seeing you guys in the next tutorial
thanks a lot</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
