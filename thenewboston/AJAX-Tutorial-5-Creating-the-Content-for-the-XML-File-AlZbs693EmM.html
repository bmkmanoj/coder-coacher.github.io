here JavaScript is going to take that
whatever they typed in here let's say
bacon and it's going to send it to the
server it's going to send it to this
script right here now what this script
needs to do is it's going to take that
and store it in variable and I'm just
going to name that variable food now you
can send things to PHP in one of two
ways you can use git and you can use
poast in this tutorial I'm going to be
using git because it's a more simple
well I guess I'm phlegm in my throat
more simple in my opinion and if you
guys are like alright where is the code
to actually send this git well it's in
the JavaScript file and we didn't make
that yet
it will just be easier if I make this
entire PHP file first but basically what
this is good is going to do is it's
going to take whatever the user typed in
here which is bacon and set it equal to
this variable which is food now after
this what I want to do is I just want to
create a rate up pretty much a list of
foods so I'm just going to name this
food array and this is just so we have
something to go by um sometimes this
would be a database but since I don't
feel like setting up a database for this
very simple example I'm just going to
make an array so we'll just go ahead and
just pick any foods that you like um
let's say tuna a bacon what's another
food beef is always a good one arm oh
yeah I forgot we needed that loaf in
there let's go ahead and sell some ham
too so again usually what you would want
to do is you want would want to look at
your database and you know see what
foods or items you were offering the
customer but right now I'm just going to
go ahead and store in array just for a
demonstration and now what we can do is
we can test okay if this food they got
for example it was bacon what we want to
do is we want to see if it's in our
store if it's in our food or ate so in
order to do this just go ahead and make
an if statement and the function to do
this is actually a built-in function
called in array that's what I like about
PHP all of the functions are pretty much
self-explanatory just look at the name
anybody
that's what the function knows and it
takes two parameters of course what
variable do you want to check for and
what is the name of your array I'm just
going to go ahead and copy this because
I'm lazy and after this let's just go
ahead and actually we don't even need
that all right so if we do basically if
the food that they entered is in this
list what do we want to do what we're
just going to echo out um you know we do
have um I'll just say we do have
whatever food that they entered and
let's just go ahead and like add an
exclamation mark or something like that
and I want to say this before I continue
right now remember that this is going to
be displayed on the screen so we do have
some security issues for example
anything that gets displayed back to the
user you want to put it through HTML
entities but for right now I just want
to mention I'm just showing you guys a
very simple Ajax example this isn't
secure so don't copy this code and use
it on your website because it works but
it's easily hackable and I'll talk about
the security issues later on but for
right now just remember that anything
you output on the webpage you usually
want to put it through HTML entities so
another thing is all right so what
happens else if um we'll say the else if
they didn't enter anything so how do we
test if they didn't even enter anything
like this right now well we need to
check if that food variable which is
basically whatever was in their input
box was empty so if we say is food equal
to nothing if so we'll just go ahead and
echo um we want to say something mean
it's always good to say something mean
enter uh food you idiot
there we go that's nice and mean alright
so else if they if the food that they
entered was not in our store and if it's
something not equal to nothing so for
example I'm like
a like guava is that even food I don't
know but we aren't selling it so if they
enter something like guava then this is
what we want to echo just go ahead and
copy this one instead of saying we do
have we'll say sorry Punk we don't sell
no guava or whatever it is so now we can
go ahead and save this and let me go
ahead and talk to you guys through
because now basically our PHP file is
complete and remember this is the file
that's going to sit on our server and
communicate with you know communicate
back and forth with the JavaScript file
behind the scenes as the user is typing
this in their HTML file so basically we
needed all of this for housekeeping
purposes and also remember anytime you
send something using a PHP file to a
JavaScript file or anytime you generate
an XML file it needs to be in between
tags all of your data so this was the
beginning XML tag this was the ending
XML tag and all of our content is in
between here so the first thing we did
is we got whatever they typed in in the
input box and we also you know had a
list of you know you know all that we
checked if what they typed in was in our
array or in our store um we also checked
if what they typed in was empty and you
know basic basically is all
self-explanatory I explained before I
don't know why I'm explaining it again I
won't do that again I promise but thank
you guys for watching
in the next tutorial where we're going
to be doing is we're going to be
creating the JavaScript file which is
basically the heart of Ajax so thank you
guys for watching and I'll see you guys
in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
