and in this tutorial I want to talk to
you guys about the very basics of user
interaction how to handle a simple event
and of course we know that there's a lot
of different ways that the user can
indeed interact with your screen they
can like just tap they can swipe their
finger across if there's a button then
they can just hold down their finger
they can you know make a figure-eight
make some weird things whatever but for
this example we're just going to keep
things really simple I'm going to show
you guys how to create just a single
view and it's going to have a button on
it and whenever they tap that button
it's just going to change some text on
the screen so it'll teach you guys the
basics and then later on we'll learn
about some more advanced stuff like
multi-touch and some really cool stuff
like that but for now what I did is I
just created a blank project and it just
has a single view it's just going to
have one screen nothing fancy so pretty
much forget about what you did in the
last couple tutorials start brand new
and once you're here go to this file
right here viewcontroller.swift so
before we start building the interface I
want to talk you guys through exactly
what this file is so before when I was
just giving you guys a real quick
overview of Xcode I said that this is
pretty much the brains behind your view
your screen so this class right here
it's pretty much linked up to your main
view right now and what it's responsible
for like I said it's kind of the brains
of your program the brains behind your
app it's a class that can control the
view so what can we do in here well we
can do some pretty cool stuff like well
in this tutorial you probably could have
guests handle user interaction for
example whenever they tap a button we
can write a method in here and that
method can just make some code happen
and we're just going to write um change
some text on the screen but eventually
you know your guys and methods are going
to be a little more complex than that
so since we don't really need this
default code again make sure that you
keep your class but delete all of these
methods that they gave us by
you follow sense um really don't need
those for that tutorial and also get rid
of these comments it's just a pain and
but looking at those so right now we
just have an empty class empty view
controller and by the way this name of
the class right there view controller
it's a pretty appropriate name because
what's it do well it controls review
pretty sweet and that's another thing i
preffer should point out whenever you
just click one of these file names and
you just click it one time then it
changes it to the main area but if you
ever want to open up a new window then
you can actually double click it and you
can have a separate window as well so
again double clicking opens up in a new
window so there you go little bonus tip
alright so now what I want you guys to
do is click on this file right here main
storyboard and make sure that your
interface is the one you're looking at
and might as well get this out of the
way just uncheck this use size classes
and will disable size classes so we'll
keep things simple since you know
designing the interface isn't really the
topic of this tutorial we will just
cheat and use that really simple iPhone
so again like I said all this is going
to do is it's going to be a real simple
example war ground put a button on here
and also some text right there and
whenever you click the button it's going
to change the text so first let's add
that button so if you go in the bottom
right and you just type in but then we
can just drag a generic button and we
might as well stick it right in the dead
center pretty cool and actually let me
go ahead and double click this and I'll
change it to bacon and you know what I
think I'm going to drag this up a little
bit because I'll show you guys something
else alright so now we have a button on
there not doing anything yet it says
bacon pretty sweet so now what I would
do is this now there are a couple
different ways that you can split the
screen up but before we do that since
I'm limited on you know whenever I'm
making tutorials I'm going to click this
little button right here and that's
gonna
hide my file navigator for right now so
I'm going to hide that and the reason I
want to do that is because remember I
said that that file that we looked at at
the beginning of the tutorial was
responsible for controlling this view it
was the brains behind this screen right
here so if I go up here to view then
from here I can go to easy house
assistant editor and show assistant
editor now what this does is it actually
takes the brain that view controller and
it splits it up between your view so
this is pretty cool because you're like
alright this makes a lot more sense I'm
looking at my design and I'm also
looking at the brain behind it now
another quick kind of handy way to get
here is by clicking this Venn diagram
little button right there so again this
is the standard editor allows you to
look at one file at a time and this is
the assistant editor a cool little split
screen view so now that we got that out
of the way what I want you guys to do
now is this so essentially what we're
going to do is we're going to create a
method that whenever you click this
button it's going to call a little bit
of code now this method is a special
method called an action so remember in
action is a method that gets called
whenever the user interacts with
something on the screen and this example
clicks a button alright so how do we
create that action method you probably
got to go here and alright what's the
like to syntax for it's probably real
confusing and I have to remember this
well check this out
this is one of the things I love about
Xcode and iOS development if you select
this button when whenever you're in this
view and you hold down control on the
keyboard so I'm holding down control
right now so click and drag and you're
going to see a blue line now if you drag
it over to here right inside your view
controller and let go
and there we go so let go what it's
going to do is it's going to say okay so
you obviously you want to create some
kind of action some kind of link or
connection between this button and the
brains so what kind of connection are
you trying to make well I'll talk to you
guys about outlets in like two seconds
but for right now we're going to choose
action because remember I said inaction
is the method that gets called whenever
a user interacts with something on the
screen so whenever the user performs an
action just think of it like that we're
going to call some method simple enough
all right so what method do we want to
call well we didn't create one yet so we
have to give that a name I will just
name it I don't know like button pressed
so whenever they click that button it's
going to call button pressed now for the
type we're going to set this to UI bun
since it is a button now the event we
can leave as default touch up inside
believe it or not there are different
ways that the user can interact with a
button they can swipe across that they
can just tap it in the tap is touch up
inside I know it's kind of a weird name
but ooh
my oh my tastes a like a chili kind of
iPad not bad and another thing that they
can do is they can tap and hold down on
it like kind of holding something in so
anyways I just wanna if you guys are
like why would a button have different
events that's why so we'll just leave
that it touch up inside which just means
the default user clicking and tapping on
it and we're going to hit connect now
whenever we do this
it sets up that default action so now
whenever the user clicks this it's going
to call this method and if we run this
it's going to work fine we don't have
any errors or warnings or anything
however it's not going to do anything
because it just built a blank method for
us without any code inside so eventually
we're going to have to add some code
inside there obviously so before I do
that I want to show you guys one other
thing because I don't really want to
skip over it
if you go over to your items and you
drag another button on your interface
and let me just drag it a little below
double click this and I'm going to name
this one tuna so now we have this button
bacon and we already we already know
that this is linked up so whenever they
click it it calls this method button
pressed now if we want to link up this
button to action method well we can go
ahead and create a brand new one and
that will work but if we want to do
something like this select this item the
tuna button hold down control and drag
to button pressed what we can do is we
can connect this button to this action
as well so now we can call click bacon
or tuna and it calls this method so I
just want to show you guys that you can
indeed hook up multiple buttons or
actions to the same method so typically
of course you're going to want to you
know use different methods but for this
example it'll be fine</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
