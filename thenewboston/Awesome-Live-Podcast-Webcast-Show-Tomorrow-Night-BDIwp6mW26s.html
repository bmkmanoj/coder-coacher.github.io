just want to make a video real quick to
talk to you guys about a few things
first of all and most importantly I know
I haven't made a video on my other
youtube channel the new boston TV in a
while and that's what i want to talk to
you guys about so a lot of you guys know
this if you've been following me on
google+ but for those of you who don't i
want to say that starting tomorrow night
i'm going to be beginning a live podcast
webcast show and that's what all this
stuff is all the soundboard this
computer this office I've been setting
all this up for the last month and a
half getting ready for this show so if
you guys are like a show what the heck
are you talking about you're doing a
live show now well yes i am a lot of you
guys were liking the stories i was
telling on my other youtube channel
again it's like kind of my personal
channel nothing dealing with programming
computers just kind of me talking about
random things and you know whatever pops
in my head it's like a personal blog on
dove so basically it's going to be me in
a co-host and we're going to be live
every single night except for sunday
night from eight until nine eastern
standard time or North Carolina time as
I call it and what we're going to be
doing is we're going to be filming a
show and we're also going to be
streaming it live so if you want to
watch the show live you can buy going to
justin.tv / the new boston and it's
pretty cool because aside from the live
show i also have a set up i finally got
the setup where whoever's watching can
call in live during the show just like
you were listening on the radio and you
hear people calling in you can call in
live through skype and my skype name is
the new boston life and by the way the
link to the show and you know my skype
name and everything else i'm going to be
posting in links below so you know go
ahead and check out the description box
below if you didn't catch anything but
if you want to call in live during the
show through skype you can do that at me
is the new boston life and also if you
have a justin.tv account you can chat in
the chat room right next to the stream
so you know if you want to ask us
questions or you know I don't know tell
us something or give some feedback and
go ahead and do that now if you don't
have a skype and you don't have a what
is a justin.tv account and you want you
know
maybe you have a cool story you want us
to talk about or a question that you
want me to answer what you can do is you
can email me at the New Boston live @
gmail.com so those are three different
ways that you can contact me but I think
it'll be cool if you call in live during
the show through skype because I mean it
took me a while to set up that's why I
needed this bad boy right here so it's
going to be an awesome show i'm super
excited and i finally got to set up
exactly how i want it so uh aside from
that you guys are probably asking like
alright so what the heck is this show
about and to be honest I wish I could
answer that for you but I don't even
know myself I only have two rules first
no computer talk no programming or
anything like that kind of if you guys
have been following me on my other
channel it's kind of like my break from
computers and technology just me talking
about you know my everyday life just
cool stories just me having fun and I
guess that's kind of the second roll you
know I just want to tell stories have
fun nothing too serious nothing you know
intense in drama I just wanted you know
tell cool stories that are interesting
and exciting and kind of interact with
my viewers since I know I think we'll be
real cool so anyways that's the only
thing I wanted an ounce you know nothing
important for my channel so basically
I'm keeping this channel the New Boston
and I'm going to dedicate this to my
computer programming education for
education and my other channel is just
going to be my personal podcast webcast
show but a ton of videos coming soon so
again like I said every single night
except sundays from eight to nine
beginning tomorrow night I'm going to be
doing the live show so make sure to
watch it is going to be super fun I'm
super excited and if you can't catch the
show live then I'm also going to be
recording all of the video all of the
show and putting it on my other channel
the New Boston TV so if you want to
check those out make sure to subscribe
to youtube com / the New Boston TV so
you can catch those videos as well so uh
yeah that's all I have to say and a
bunch of new videos coming to that
channel soon so hopefully I'll see you
guys tomorrow night give me some ideas
for the show so I have something to talk
about and uh thank you guys for watching
and hopefully I'll see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
