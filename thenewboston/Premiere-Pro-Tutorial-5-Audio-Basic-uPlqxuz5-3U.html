in Adobe Premiere Pro and this story
we're gonna be going over a basic audio
changing the volume and also showing you
how to fade in and out of audio tracks
so before we get started I just wanted
to tell you guys make sure that you're
watching this video in hi-def if you
look over in a the more information on
the right hand of your screen I'll have
a link and you can watch this video on
hi-def it's about a hundred times more
clear and you'll appreciate it
so once you're in that then I can
continue with this video the first thing
that we're gonna want to do with the
audio is change the volume now to do
this go down to where your audio is and
make sure that it's expanded if it's
collapsed like this just click the
little right arrow until it expands now
this yellow bar right here is the volume
of your audio now make sure you have
your selection tool and if you click and
drag that you can either raise the level
up the low it's probably different but
my can go up to 6 or down and all the
way down is no audio at all so let's
just put that right in the middle for
now actually I'm gonna put my little
higher than in the middle and by moving
that yellow bar you can either raise or
lower the volume of your audio and this
is how if you have more than one tracks
you can raise 1 or lower the other and
you can do that varying depending on
your scene now another thing that you're
going to be wanting to do a lot is fade
in and out with your audio so to do this
we're gonna be working with this yellow
bars though go over here to your tool
painter panel and click this thing
called the pen tool you can also press P
but I like to click it so go ahead and
click that and you can now see that your
pen tool is highlighted and when you
move over your
a bar it's a little pen shape now to
fade the audio we're gonna have to make
keyframes just like we did with fading
the title but we do this by holding ctrl
on your keyboard or I think it's that
little curvy symbol if you're using a
Mac but uh hold down ctrl on your
keyboard and as you can see your little
pen tool now has a plus sign next to it
when you let go it has the two arrows
when you hold down ctrl it has a plus
sign what this means is you're ready to
add a keyframe
that's what control means so go ahead
and click the very beginning and as you
can see we now have added a keyframe
let's add a couple more on the line I'm
gonna add one right about there right
about there
and a right about there now let go of
control and your pen will now have
double arrows and this means that you
can move your keyframes around now once
you highlight a keyframe your pens gonna
have a little circle next to it and this
means that you're on the keyframe in
your it's ready to move around so let's
start out moving this keyframe down all
the way and this means our movies gonna
start out at no sound whatsoever then I
wanted to get real loud in about three
seconds
so it's gonna fade from nothing to
really loud and then I want to fade to
nothing again and then I want to fade to
real out again now usually you're just
gonna be fading in slightly but for the
purpose of this video I want to make
sure you hear it fade in and out so move
your current time indicator or CTI to
zero and let me see if you can hear this
and play it
I'm here for them
there you go I didn't know if you guys
could hear that but I'll walk you
through it one more time as I show you
what's going on down here let me play
this as you can see it builds up right
now
then the fades down - no sound
whatsoever and then it goes up to normal
again
and again if you want to delete one of
these keyframes just select it
right-click it and press Delete and you
can do that with each of them let's say
if you accidentally added an extra one
or you just want to get rid of one and
of course if you delete them all it
starts all the way over again so that's
how you edit the audio and also change
your volume and fade in and out with an
audio track so study this tutorials and
make sure you're watching these videos
in hi-def and I hope you learned
something and I'll see you next disorder</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
