tutorial believe it is and what we're
going to do in this tutorial is
basically get you know our result from
the activity that we started which again
is a voice recognition activity and you
know what the second parameter is is
basically a way that we can check that
works out again we've worked with the
request codes we want to make sure that
checks out as well but what we're going
to do is we're just going to set up a
variable that's going to be static final
I'm not going to change here it's going
to be an int we're going to call this
check we're just going to set this equal
to like 1 1 1 something like that and
now what we're going to do is again
we're going to pass in with internet
with our intent check alright so again
what we're doing all we're doing is
we're just passing in the request code
and all that good stuff and so our
request code we're passing is 1 1 1 and
then what we're going to do is we're
going to go within this on activity
result and give us some space to work
here and we're just going to create an
if statement like we have previously
we're just going to say as long as
request code is equal to basically our
check ask your request code sorry it's
equal to check or as if it's equal to 1
1 1 then we're good so we're just going
to say check and we also want make sure
the results okay so we're just going to
say and and we want to make sure our
request code or I'm sorry result code is
equal to results okay and that should be
familiar so there we go as long as those
things are cool they check out then
we're going to basically try and fill
our list array or fill our list view
here that we set up and what we're going
to do is we're going to collect the data
from our activity result and how we're
going to do that is through array list
and it's going to be of the type string
and what we're going to say is results
is equal to the data which again is the
intent that's being passed in we're just
going to say dot get and we have a lot
of options we can say like getstring or
something and say getstring extra but
since we're setting up a list array
we're just going to say get ray list
extra so we're going to set that up and
then we have to refer to basically the
extras of our recognizer intense so
again we're just going to say recognizer
intent dot and we're going to look for
the extras so we're going to say extras
or extra results basically so it's just
the results and there we go we basically
have a array array list set up going to
add our imports make it happy and then
all we're going to do is we're going to
set up our list view to this array list
so we're going to say our list view
which we called LV and we're just going
to say dot set adapter again we don't
have an adapter so we're going to say
new array adapter of the type string
because again we're working with a
string ArrayList
and then we're just going to say the
context of the class and then the type
of layout for ArrayList and we're just
going to refer to the default now it's
been a while since we worked with
ArrayList but Android r dot layout dot
simple underscore list item one and the
last parameter we're going to set to our
results which again is our ArrayList
that we set up right here
results sorry alright and then we just
have to import our rail array adapter
and we're pretty much done guys I
believe this will work so let's test it
out I'm not sure if they'll work on the
emulator or not might have to be on the
actual phone and again just the note
this isn't actually checking if the
device has voice recognition installed
on it if you guys actually want to build
a voice recognition software you might
want to look into how you check if the
device has that capability or not and I
believe the Android developer page
probably cover something like that as
well most likely this is pretty similar
to actual the Android sample that they
give you because I don't really remember
doing this but this is a kind of layout
of an activity I created when I was
first starting to learn
some of the Android SDK so it's probably
pretty similar to the what the actual
sample is so alright so let's see if
this actually works here put a voice
crap alright so it looks like the
emulator doesn't have the voice
recognition or something so I'm going to
test on my phone make sure it works and
I'll let you guys know you better work
yeah it looks like it works it pulls up
a list of things that it could be like
you better work you better word you
better works you better words you BET
Awards better word so yeah it will work
for your phone as is again we don't have
the proof checking so that's something
you might need to know otherwise it's
gonna crash like the emulator did but
you know guys thanks again for watching
and I'll catch you in the next tutorial
hope you have a good one see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
