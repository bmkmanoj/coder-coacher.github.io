found two but I couldn't catch them
found this bird's nest no eggs in the
dough what's the end of day nine and
probably looks in the sky it's looking
like it's gonna be a real bad night
tonight which sucks because I already
lost my flint which means that I can't
make fire which means that I can't cook
food which means that I can't boil water
on top of that I'm lost no idea where I
am if I did find this I tried to catch a
frog and I didn't but I found this is
that these little worms are actually
pretty easy to find under rocks this
will have been kneading for the last
couple days
you have to eat it in pieces and then
it's somewhat bearable
so
so it's not the best tasting thing in
the world but that fish
it made me freakin sick to my stomach I
thought I was gonna do it for a second
I'm feeling a little better now I don't
know what I'm gonna do for food I don't
know if I even if I do catch a frog if I
want to eat it or not since I can't cook
anything I need to go home soon I need
to find something someone anything let
me start packing up my things right now
so I don't lose anything in early
tomorrow morning I move out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
