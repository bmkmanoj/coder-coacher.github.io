door creating this PHP tutorial for the
New Boston now we've already looked at
an if-else statement which looks
something like this as this stands it
evaluates to true so we're echoing out
the text true now if I was to start a
completely new if statement let's say I
wanted to evaluate a few more things
down the line now let's create a number
number one and that's going to be equal
to ten now we can create a number two
and I'm going to create that also equal
to 10 now
we'll just keep number one so we'll just
keep number itself so I want to create
an if statement to gradually make a few
comparisons with this variable so if I
was to say if number equals equals 10 so
this is is equal to 10 echo
equal to10 so as it stands the number
the variable number is equal to ten
therefore this comparison is going to be
true so we're going to be occurring out
this text so let's just test that in our
browser quickly okay equal to ten now
what if I want to say but hold on a
minute otherwise I want to make another
check so you've seen in my previous
examples I've said else echo and we
could for example say not equal to ten
and if I was to change this value here
to eleven
you'll be displayed with the text not
equal to ten because the variable does
not equal ten
but let's scrap this idea of of just
going straight to else and I want to say
else if so I'm basically combining if
and else to make else if and then I just
do exactly the same structure and I do
another block underneath that so else if
and here what we can do is before just
jumping to else and saying no this
doesn't equal this is evaluated to false
we can make another comparison and we
can do another evaluation so else if
number equals equals 11 and we can now
say equal to 11
oh if I can spell it so equal to 11 then
what we can do is we can say else
not equal for example so now what we're
doing is we're saying is the number
equal to ten if it is you echo out this
text equal to ten otherwise is this text
equal to eleven and if so we echo out
the text equal to eleven now remember
before when I change this to 11 it said
not equal but now I've changed it to 11
this will be evaluated to true or this
here in particular will be evaluated to
true therefore this is going to be
executed so let's refresh the page equal
to 11 again we can change this up here
back to 10
so it's performing this check here and
we refresh equal to 10 but if we were to
go as high as 12 we haven't got a check
here to beat for it to be equal to 12
therefore not equal so this is basically
in a nutshell if-else statements and
they're useful for just making a few
more checks before you want to
completely say no nothing's equal else
and give at the last alternative block
to execute</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
