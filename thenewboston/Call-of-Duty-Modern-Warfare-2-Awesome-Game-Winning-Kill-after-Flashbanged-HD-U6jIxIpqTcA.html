another call duty game using the ump45
on us quarry and I am here Oh is just
let you know if I do like a random pause
like that
like I cracked my knuckles lot don't
know why just like an addiction
and it's basically it anyway um in this
game as you can see running around I've
got marathon stopping power and forget
what my other kill streak is I mean
probably ninja um I think I was trying
to get the silencer for this gun or I
think I think I do win this game
actually as in right now I am basically
in their zone and so what I'm doing here
I'm trying to run around can get my
hairy right at the moment trying to I
think I'm trying to find a place where I
can use my predator to lay down and go
with whatever shall be bound and one
thing actually one car real quick is the
predator missile in general the predator
missile is a very very useful thing I
think it's much more efficient than a
century gun and either way a century gun
it can be very good it cannot be it's
just it depends mostly on the map and I
get another predator missile here and
actually how that care package landed
was exactly into that dumpster which
actually find kind of funny okay right
here I didn't just go up and annihilate
that guy with my predator because i
think i was trying to get a head shot
which you can do and i have done with
our creditors on the way okay um here
I'm just running around cuz everybody's
just like spawning everywhere
my Harrier strike Harry is waiting for
you and I thing I'm trying to find a
safe place to go at the moment printing
credit Michelle rebound and I put it
exactly where one guy I'm shooting from
I had no idea where anybody was on the
other team I just assumed so pretty much
what you have to do with any air strike
in general from any game unless you've
got a UAV which is always nice see this
guy and try to if you look at my ammo
supply starting to run pretty low so all
right somewhat saved some bullets at the
moment you see I've got three extra
bullets left which is not good which
sometimes it is sometimes it's not
actually no never mind scratch that last
statement I think not having mo is never
a good thing and here I got our PV
RPGs actually I want to talk about that
real quick RPG is I think personally are
just as bad as I'm new to an RPG all you
it's the equivalent of the noob tube
with a bigger blast the only thing
that's bad about it is the fact that
with an RPG you have to aim down the
sights a noob too if you just show you
online which ah it's just I it's just
annoying it really is right there i get
actually pretty lucky as i think there
were two guys that were like right
behind me thankfully one of the guys on
my team just took them out here trying
to decide what I should do because
there's like everybody's around me right
now it's on you and get that guy trying
to find another guy that was on my radar
and hear your is coming around so
instead can't find them so I decided to
run out and get a guy and my team is
basically just occupied this entire area
right here and right now Isis I'd take
out the m4 which
and then i get i get killed by a
claymore which i'm not actually when you
get killed by a claymore it's not
actually that bad it's when you get
killed by a noob tube is when it's bad
claymore like I can understand you'd be
pissed if you like it like if you're on
like a high kill streak or something
like that but i think i was only like a
noob Hill speak right there so it's not
not bad at all I see this guy here I
didn't I skipped it because I got got
kind of pissed at that dude went to last
stand as I was shooting him and he shot
my rocket and he shot the rocket at me
and it killed me from like 100 feet away
I get that guy and yep I was right there
from earlier I did get the silencer for
the UMP which is basically a default
unless you don't have to silence a list
i don't have the silencer not you guys
me right there another bad spawn
situation i kill a god he spawned 10
feet away from me why infinity ward with
the billion dollars that you've got this
year why can't you make a good at least
a decent spawn system I just don't get
striking bad anyway I get that guy that
killed me that was over there
so and then I get killed by some dude
with the scar and after that I just I
start running around again I'm trying to
go back to where I was and then I just
like to try and flank them which the
game is getting close to ending but it I
don't think I really realized it uhm
jung hwa lee at this point i checked
grenade and it almost kills him but not
enough just barely nice guy epic fails
right there you got what he could have
gotten like a full round into my head
instead he I think League fails and he
doesn't kill me they're up over here I'm
trying to get a couple guys that are
over here um I saw my radar before my
UAV went away they were probably where I
think three guys here I one here I try
to just a well not really camp I
wouldn't say but like just try to stay
right there so uh so i can at least find
out where the Scrambler guys going and I
realized that he's getting closer and
then something I guys takes about okay
right here I'm waiting for a guy at
least one guy to get over here and watch
this this is actually pretty funny
best game winning kill ever by far best
game winning kill ever and all because
of a flash grenade which I didn't even
mean to have on anyway um I did really
good this game 21 and 5 on quarry and uh
basically just see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
