here and today I'm going to be teaching
you guys your very first tutorial in the
C programming language now C is a little
different than C++ it came out before
C++ but due to a hide band if people
wanted me to teach this language Here I
am teaching it so the first thing I need
you guys to do is open is open your
compiler I'm using my dev C++ compiler
and if you guys don't know how to get
this um I already made a tutorial on how
to download this compiler and test to
see if it's running and I will include
that tutorial on the right side of your
screen in the description box so if you
guys don't have a compiler yet just
click on that link and I'll teach you
how to download and test your C++
compiler the next thing you want to do
is get a new source file in you do that
by clicking file new source file and
once you have one open you're going to
want to put file save as and you can
name it whatever you want and you're
going to want to save it as a C source
file then click Save I already have one
open so I'm going to go ahead and close
this one and I have one open called work
C so once you have that open you're
ready to go ahead and start typing so
let's get started learning the C
programming language the first thing you
always do or usually you're going to
want to include something called a
preprocessor now what preprocessor does
is after you type this code you're going
to want to translate it into machine
code ones and zeros that the computer
can run but before you want to translate
it into ones and zeros you're going to
want to include something that a
computer how to use this information you
just got it so it's a lot easier after I
just show you guys so go ahead type the
pound sign or the number sign some you
might call it and type include
and then put a less than sign and put
stdio.h and then put the greater than
sign and what this is going to do right
here is it's going to include your
standard input and output header and
with this anytime you include something
it pretty much gives you a list of
functions that you can use to in your
program and since we're going to just be
printing basic text out on the screen
we're going to we're going to be using a
function called print F now if we didn't
include this then one euro print F on
the screen your compiler is going to go
art what the H does printf mean but
since we included this printf is a
function within this header so now we
can use a whole list of functions and
printf is included in one book the next
thing that you need to do when making a
C program after including the headers
that you need to include and this is the
only one I'm going to teach you guys in
this tutorial you're going to want to
write int let me move this main in in
parenthesis write the word void now what
this does is this every C program has a
function called main that your computer
knows all right I need to run this
function first and that's pretty much
why you have main in all of your
programs since umm C is going to look
for this program right here main and
it's going to run this one first and now
if you're asking all right what does int
and void me every function can return a
value now in this case um that's all you
really need to know for now that it
stands for integer and this function is
going to return an integer value but
we're going to be talking about that
later and void in your parentheses means
that it just takes an argument then void
means all right we're not taking any
arguments or it's not asking for any
info right now
so um again the only thing you really
need to know of off of all this is
pretty much that main is the first thing
that she looks for these are the
functions then we're going to have the
printf function and that's included in
this this is why we're able to use that
and this other stuff I'm going to be
teaching guys in other tutorials but I
just need to have it in this one but
I'll be going into depth of it in later
tutorial so make sure to check along
there all right and again as I said main
is the first function that C looks for
and if you say all right what's a
function a function is pretty much just
a set of instructions that you tell your
computer what to do in all of those
instructions go in curly braces right
here you have opening brace in the
closing curly brace and anything you
type inside it is pretty much the
instructions so this main is pretty much
like a recipe and what we're going to be
typing in here is like a step by step of
what to do so the first thing we want to
do is output just basic text on the
screen that says um hello world but you
just don't write hello world like that
you need to do a special function and
that's print F which is our print
function that we were able to use
because of this right here
and then in your parentheses you're you
have to add two double quotes and inside
here you're right hello world in the
double quotations right here this tells
see that it's a string of text so that's
why we were able to write hello world in
your printf function in after every
single statement you need a semicolon
so again write printf and this either
means like print file or print function
or something like that I don't know what
it is but it's printf in your
parentheses add quotation marks in then
I write hello world and you have to end
every single statement with a semicolon
and the semicolon means Ric this is the
end of the instruction you can move on
in next line and after this arm here I'm
going to show you guys what this does
right here if you execute compile and
run it's going to compile it and it
takes a little bits of compile and then
a box I don't know if you guys can see
it on YouTube but a box is just going to
flash up on your screen real quick it
just did and this is because in C your
computer automatically knows alright run
all this and when it's done I want you
just to exit the program but we're like
hey we want to see actually what we just
did so we're going to want to include
another function and that's get CH and
all the stands for is get character now
this is useful when you sometimes when
you like wanna input data in arm you're
going to want to save it like what if it
says enter your name you're going to
want to save it and stuff but for this
function right here we're just going to
say alright print hello world on the
screen and we just want you to get a
character not for any information
purposes but we just want you to wait
pause and wait for us to type any letter
on the screen just so we can see what we
actually did so let me execute this
compile and run and after it compiles as
you guys can see here's our program that
just compiled and ran instead of just
running all this and exiting see this
little blinking line right there that
means it's waiting for us to get a
character that's what that little
blinking line means so whenever I press
anything on my keyboard let me press H
that's when it goes on to the rest of
the code and it exits the program so um
this is your very first program right
here again to recap one last time we
included a header that allowed us to use
a couple built-in functions in again we
put all those functions in the main
program since this is the first thing
that it looks for when running a
program and all we did is print basic
text to the screen so in the next
tutorial I don't know what I'm going to
be teaching guys but it's most likely
going to be awesome
so again I'll be making a bunch of these
tutorial so if you want to learn see

thank you guys for watching and I'll see
you next time thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
