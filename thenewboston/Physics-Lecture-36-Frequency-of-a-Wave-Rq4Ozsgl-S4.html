physics tutorial what if I did that
every time would be super annoying but
you know maybe I'll start who knows but
you know what in this tutorial I'm going
to start talking to you guys about the
frequency of a wave so the frequency of
a wave is basically whenever you ask
yourself how often does a period occur
well that's basically what frequency is
so let's go ahead and assume that you
had a pendulum much like before and this
pendulum right here it's swung will say
every second so every second this
pendulum swung back and forth one second
to complete that so remember the
question a frequency is how often does a
period occur well in this case we could
say that frequency is equal to one cycle
per second or you could also write it on
60 cycles per minute it doesn't really
matter there's not um like a standard
frequency that we use although you know
with Sounders Hertz but we'll get into
that later it's basically the number of
cycles over a given amount of time
whether it's seconds minutes that's what
frequency is so furthermore say that we
had um we'll do a little bit different
example because more people have trouble
understanding a frequency that's less
than a second so say that a pendulum had
a frequency of 1 4 seconds so one cycle
over 4 seconds what would this mean then
obviously if we looked at this a little
bit more that wouldn't mean that if we
reduce this it would be 0.25 over 1
seconds so if the pendulum had a
frequency of 1 cycle every 4 seconds
then that would mean every single second
it completed 4 swings do you understand
easy enough so now let's go ahead and
take a look at an exam
bow that we may see in real life save
you had a table you make this drunk it I
never make my drunks good okay so we had
this table here two table legs right
here and okay guys you know what I'm
going to be proud of this one here's the
table right like that and in our table
or on our table rather we have a fish
tank and I might as well draw a little
fish in there hey I'm a fish look at me
all right so here's our fish tank right
here and we also have a pendulum setup
to the side now what color should I make
my pendulum oh I was about to draw it
green and then I noticed oh my freaking
background is green so probably getting
through that so we have our pendulum
right here here's our point and here's
our pendulum that's swinging and every
time it swings it hits the side of the
fish tank now again I'm going to ask you
to use your imagination and just assume
or imagine that every time the pendulum
hit the tank it didn't lose any Angier
energy maybe this is you know an ideal
we built the perfect pendulum but I know
usually it would lose energy whenever
hit just imagine that it doesn't so
every time it made a swing it would hit
the side of the tank and whenever it did
it would cause a wave to appear so let
me draw this a little bit better alright
so there there there so here's a wave
here's a wave in here's away so if the
pendulum had a period of three seconds
then that would mean it would make a new
wave every three seconds therefore the
frequency would be one wave every three
seconds
now of course you could go ahead and
reduce it to 0.33 repeating over 1
seconds but some people just think it's
easier to you know it all depends what
form you want to write it in so that's
what people have the most trouble with
whenever it's reduced to less than a
second but again the key concept of this
is basically what frequency is whenever
you talk about frequency it's how often
does a period occur now you can go ahead
and write it in the simple form like
maybe if you have a simple frequency
like one wave every one second that
would be easy to understand but with
more I want to say complex frequencies
where you have them occurring less than
a second it may be easier to to increase
the time so that way you don't have
portions of waves</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
