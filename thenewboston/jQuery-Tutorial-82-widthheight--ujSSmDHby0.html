heights now changed as well because
we've pulled it down with all this
content so you know these are sort of
like absolute values that we actually
take in rather than you know what we've
defined in style.css ourself because we
know that the content could overflow and
increase the height or the width of the
div so this is all well and good but now
let's go ahead and look at a practical
example that we can use within our
browser now many browsers when you
display an image inside them allow you
to click on them and resize to you know
a particular and give a particular you
know image it's actual subtle to fit
inside the browser so let's go ahead and
take a look at an example of this I'm
gonna go ahead and get rid of style or
CSS we don't need it anymore in fact
actually we do we do we'll need a bit a
bit later on and I'm gonna go ahead and
get rid of all of this as well so I'm
just gonna include an image file onto
the page which is extremely large in
size as Berlin dot jpg and let's go
ahead and look at this huh so Berlin jpg
okay so you can see that the image is
really large most browsers will give you
the option to allow you to actually you
know resize an image to the page width
particularly if you've just referenced
it like Berlin jpg like that I always
hide it for you in actual fact I'm wrong
this wouldn't let you resize an image
because we've included it as an element
on a page so even more to the point we
can now start to resize this image but
this time we're gonna get the window
width and the window height and set the
properties of this image to actually fit
inside the window so unsure where you
might use this but it's a lot more
practical example than just returning to
the user the height and the width of a
particular element oh and also with
regards to width and height this doesn't
have to just be divs or anything else it
can be things like text elements like
form elements and you know you name it
paragraphs anything
so I'm gonna go ahead and give this a
class and this class is going to be
called fit just so we know that you know
it fits this into the page so inside
style dot CSS I'm gonna set some body
properties and this is just going to be
margin naught pixel and this is just
gonna allow us to resize this into our
page in its entirety so now what we want
to do is we want to automatically resize
this class fit to the window hi Andy the
window height and the window width so
we'll get will call of our W height
which is the window height and this is
going to be equal to window instead of
actually referencing a particular
element or selecting a particular
element and that's gonna be window
docked height we'll create another
variable window width and we'll make
this equal to window dot width so now
we've got the width of the window itself
so this means the current the current
window as you can see R so now what we
can do is we can go ahead and set this
image stop the image style the styling
installed not installed or CSS but the
CSS you know that applies to this class
and fit it inside the page so let's go
ahead and select the dot fit class and
then we apply some CSS we're gonna need
to do this in a moment just here but for
now we want to set the width or the
height of the image to W height and then
we again use CSS this time we apply the
width as W width so now what's going to
happen is when we refresh this is going
to be automatically resized to the size
of the window as you can see so it
automatically resized this image to the
size of the window and if we were gonna
go ahead and sort of resize this window
we can do and it will follow
obviously the window width
well it won't at the moment but if we
were to refresh
it would keep the same width and it
would resize it accordingly
so let's resize that back out once again
so obviously every time we actually
resize the page when we refresh whatever
size the actual window is currently and
might the user might have been maximized
in their browser or they might have it
as a small document this means that what
we can actually do is accurately fit
content to a window and I don't just
mean images I mean things like divs we
can resize divs use percentages to scale
the div down for example the main body
of a document etc etc so there's there's
many uses for grabbing the height and
the width in order to display it to a
user
now one benefit of this would might be
for say mobile devices if you had a
mobile device with a large screen but
not the size of a phone for example a
tablet you might want to use the height
and width to scale down a particular
document in order for it to be viewable
and not overlap so you know you don't
have to do this but it's a more dynamic
way to create things but usually that
would be handled by style dot CSS but
you know why not use height and width to
do this as well it would probably make
it a lot more you know fun and better
and also easier and it does have a good
a good way of working so that's the
height and width manipulation properties
or styling properties by grabbing the
height and width of any element and
we've seen here how he can assign an
image size to the window width and
height</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
