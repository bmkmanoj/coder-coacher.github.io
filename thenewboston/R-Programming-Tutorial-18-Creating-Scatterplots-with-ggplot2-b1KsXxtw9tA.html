tutorial and in this video I want to
teach you guys about a package called
ggplot2 and actually if you want to
install this then you can go ahead and
do it the old-fashioned way and you can
also type install packages and is a
parameter type ggplot2
and if you run this it's going to
install it just like before I already
have this installed so no need to double
install it but basically what ggplot2 is
is it's a package that gives you an
alternative way of building charts and
graphs and the reason that I prefer this
is because first of all the other charts
that we've been using we're boring
they were just black and white plain and
simple this gives us more control over
the graphics the colors and pretty much
just more control over how we want the
graph to display so whenever we download
that there's actually a library ggplot2
and this library just has a bunch of
sample data in it and one of the pieces
of information that we could use is
called diamonds and this is just a table
of diamond information so say that you
are a diamond store actually don't even
know why half the stuff means but we can
just use it for this example
I know what Cara d-cup I guess they
grade the color of the diamond I know
what that is I don't know what the depth
of a diamond is I don't this thing is
the price don't know anyways oh shut up
I just want to show you guys that there
is indeed sample data included and we
can use if we want so might as well so
the first thing I wanted to do is I want
to show you guys how to create a
scatterplot with ggplot2 now it's a
little bit different than the way we
made a scatterplot before in the
function to make one is called Q plot
now a core scatter plot is going to take
three pieces of information of course it
needs two things so we can test the
correlation against each other so what
can we do actually let's just go ahead
and do diamond
and let's do the carrot in the price
because of course the bigger your
diamond the more you're probably going
to have to pay for it so diamonds carat
and copy and paste because I'm lazy and
care price so those are excuse me
diamond price so those are the two
variables or the columns that we want to
compare and for the third one what we
need to do is we actually just need to
give it the data that it's going to be
using so basically what we're telling is
compare this piece of information in
this piece of information
from this data frame now whenever you
run it we can see that we now have a
scatterplot with care on the bottom
price on the on the y-axis care on the
x-axis I should say and there is indeed
a correlation basically telling us the
bigger your diamond is the more you're
going to have to pay for it okay we knew
that but you know we're just doing this
for an example now the reason that I
love ggplot2 is you can also color your
scatterplot with built-in parameters so
let's say that not only did we want to
you know just make a basic scatterplot
compare and care against price or size
against price we also want to see the
color of the clarity so what we can do
is we could use parameter called color
and we can set it equal to another
column like clarity and now whenever you
run this I'll go ahead and talk to you
guys about what's it going to display
and makes the scatterplot like before
but instead or I shouldn't say instead
in addition to what it does is it takes
each level of clarity which is this
right here and each diamond of that
clarity it gives a different color so
all of the green diamonds are clarity
s11 or sl1 I don't I don't even know
what it is all the blue ones are vs1
again I don't even you know know what
these letters stand for but basically
what I'm
is if you ever want to have a
scatterplot and if you ever want to
graph a third parameter and color it as
well this is how you can do it and what
I'm going to do actually is I'm going to
figure out what the heck all of this
crap means like clarity I don't know X Y
Z of a diamond what the heck is the size
of that maybe this is I don't know I'm
going to go figure this out
because you know I'm not a diamond
expert but I do know my way around R so
in the next video I'm going to be
showing you guys how to make other cool
charts and graphs with r so anyways I'm
going to shut up now thank you guys for
watching don't forget to subscribe and
I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
