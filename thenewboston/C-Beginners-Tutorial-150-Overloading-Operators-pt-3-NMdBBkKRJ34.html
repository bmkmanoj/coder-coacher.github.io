fiftieth csharp tutorial and i'm making
for the new boston and in this tutorial
I'm going to continue showing you how to
overload operators so all you need for
this tutorial is a button and an item
class and inside of your item class just
make sure that you have a public entity
property my just called price and these
operators that we've overloaded in the
past you don't need to have these in
your class but these are this ones that
we overload in a previous tutorials so
in this tutorial we're going to keep
overloading the less than sign the
greater than sign and the less than or
equal to sign and a greater than or
equal to side and just like be equal and
not equal sign these two go together so
that if we overload one we must overload
the other the same with these if you're
over local less than or equal to we must
overload the greater than or equal to so
first we're just going to be overloading
the less than sign so just like always
grabs a public static and since we're
checking to see if an item is less than
another item or just going to be
returning a pool since there's only one
or two options it can either be less
than or it can't be we're just going to
say fool here and since we're
overloading an operator you're just
going to say operator and like I said
we're going to be overloading less than
sign first input less than sign and then
we're going to put in our parameters
right here and the first item see an
item stay item I'll just call item 1 and
this is the object that will be on the
left side of this less than sign and for
the other side it will be the item when
they've on the right side of our less
than sign so what is comparing two items
here's the item and i'll call it item
two alright and we must return something
here and we're going to be returning a
fool such as specified cool as a return
type and since we're working with pools
here we can achieve ternary operator so
turn and then we're going to say if item
one price is less than item choose price
and return true otherwise you can't
false so if item ones pricing items
choose price are the same or item ones
price is greater than item to spice
that's going to return false but if item
ones price is less than item to price
that I'll return true re and just like i
said before since we overloaded this
less than sign we're going to have to
overload this great event sign so if i
try to debug here i'm going to get an
area saying yep I must overload this
greater than sign as well so type public
static bull operator and all right so
we're going to have to overload the
greater than sign and just like before
going out to items and sharing two items
so I am one right on item alright and
then we can just use ternary operator
again to save turn if item ones price is
greater than item cheese price then
return true otherwise we're trying to
false alright so now it should be all
good here so now if we create two items
up here on an item ones price i will set
will 233 another item item to so you can
compare these two volumes and I'll set I
am choose price equal to 6 so right now
item 3 or item once price is last an
item keez price we're going to say if
item 1 is less than tied up to then
we're going to have a message
item one costs glass and item two
because this will only return true if
item once price is less than item cuse
price and considered you should get this
message box right here all right
technology vaga should just get item one
cost less than attitude yep and since we
overloaded the greater than property as
well this will work just the other way
so we can say item if item choose is
greater than item 1 then we can say item
to cost more damn item one alright so
now me debug here and click this button
should get a message box saying item to
cost more than item one because om tues
price is six and item ones price is only
three since six is greater than the
reuse we're going to get this message
box an item to cost more than item well
yep and it's basically the same thing
for the greater than or equal to or the
less than or equal to so if we were to
just replace this on lefthand or equal
to with just this left hand side with
the less than or equal to sign and
replace the greater than sign on the
Creator than or equal to sign then we'll
get the same result and since we have an
overload of this method it will not work
so I have to but the equal sign there
since I just changes so it overloaded
the greater than or equal to sign and
now sense item two is still great of an
item one we're going to get item to cost
more than I have worn but it could also
be the same price ok or item do the same
price as item one alright so now you
need to go up here you should get this
message box because um item coo its
prices in six and item once price is
three
and since six is great of our three
we're going to get this message box yep
but it could also be equal to so if item
choose price with the same as item one
so if item is choose price cuz it's a
three then you will still get the
message box because it's equal to this
time yep or item to the same prices
either one so perfectly alright so
that's pretty much it for this tutorial
so see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
