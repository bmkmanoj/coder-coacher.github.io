welcome to your ninth chemistry tutorial
and in this tutorial I'm going to be
talking to you guys about something
called the quantum mechanical model man
that just sounds fun already so anyways
what chemists did was once they started
looking at really complex atoms they
tried to take the model that Bohr came
up with and they tried to apply it to
these really complex atoms and they
found out that it didn't really fit it
didn't really make sense so instead they
said okay Bohr your model is good for
the molar simple atoms and elements but
for this complex stuff we need a complex
equation
hence the quantum mechanical model let's
go ahead and dive right into it so
basically what the quantum mechanical
model is is it's this formula I guess
you could say pretty much a way that
chemists can predict how electrons spin
around the nucleus they figured out that
it's instead of simple circular orbits
like Bohr said they'd actually spin
around the nucleus in this very complex
3d paths and you really need a bunch of
different numbers other than you know
orbit number one orbit number two you
really need a bunch of different
variables in order to figure out just
exactly and calculate the path that
those electrons take so those numbers
are n which stands for the orbitals
energy L which stands for the orbital
shape ml which is the orientation or how
its tilted m/s which pretty much means
is your electron spinning clockwise or
counter clockwise and with those four
numbers you can go ahead and calculate a
formula to figure out a really complex
3d path and this isn't like any random
this is actually one of the paths that
electrons take I just didn't make a
weird 3d model and plug it in here this
is actually one of the quantum
mechanical models so this is the path
that electrons take pretty weird huh a
lot more complex than a simple circle so
let me go ahead and break apart these
numbers and once I break everything
apart and put it back together you're
going to see how you can use these four
variables to calculate the exact
path that electrons take let's go ahead
and touch on the first one which is
orbitals energy or other words n is the
variable that they used now technically
this n is called the principal quantum
number I just say orbitals energy
because it just makes sense it basically
is the orbitals energy they just had to
put a scientific term on it so what this
means is it's pretty much the average
distance of the orbital from the nucleus
or in other words the average distance
that the electron is from the nucleus
and it can be any whole number one two
three four exactly like Bohr's orbitals
you know how Bohr's orbitals were
labeled one two three four and so on
it's the exact same thing with this n in
of course the larger the number the
bigger the orbital is going to be hence
further away from the nucleus so one
orbital is really close to the nucleus
and four is really far away from the
nucleus so now that we understand n
let's go ahead and talk about L the
orbitals shape so technically this one
is called angular momentum quantum
number but I'm just going to go ahead
and say l equals orbitals shape so
basically the value you can have for L
is n minus 1 so say for example that
your n value let me just pick one say
your n was 4
well according to this equation it can
be n minus 1 so 4 minus 1 is 3 so L can
be equal to 0 1 2 or 3 so that's what I
mean L equals n minus 1 whatever your n
is take one away from it and that's what
values L can be and you're saying okay
how can one number represent a shape
that doesn't make sense to me well
basically what they did was they paired
up a number with and they just made them
represent different shapes for example
whenever you have 0 it represents kind
of a sphere shape whenever you have one
there it kind of looks like 2 balloons
or pressed together and we'll look at
the shapes later on and this is a really
complex one let's see where is it right
there this is a
really complex one that isn't zero or
one it's one of the higher ones I can't
even remember just by looking at my need
to graph with me
anyways that's what you come up with if
you go deep enough like Inception so
anyways the different numbers just
represent different shapes so just
remember right now that N equals the
size of the orbital and L equals the
shape of the orbital two numbers we
learned so far
so already we came into kind of a
problem whenever you're writing these
numbers together and it's kind of
confusing because you try to write them
together in it doesn't really look easy
I mean you can say okay one equals n so
zero equals L so I'm going to write one
zero now that looks like a 10 and now
that these all kind of look like 10 so
how can I take two numbers be able to
write them together without getting it
confused with the number like 10 or 32
or you know 21 or something like that so
what scientists decided to do is instead
of keeping the number for L they decided
to give the L value a designated lever
letter for each number so whenever you
have 0 for L you write s instead
whenever you have 1 you write P so that
way instead of something like 1 0 which
may be confused with 10 you write 1s so
that solved the problem of having your
to write two numbers together and you
know if you write two numbers together
it just turns into a bigger number so
this right here solve that problem so
again this to sum up this entire
tutorial remember this there are four
numbers that you need to count to
calculate the path of an electron we
learned two of them already n which is
this first one is the size of the
orbital in the second one which is the L
is the shape of the orbital so this one
s right here means the orbital is pretty
small and the S is a sphere and we'll
look at the shapes later so this one s
is a small spherical shape so we still
got two more variables to cover
in the next tutorial we're going to be
covering those and once we have all the
variables we can begin putting this
quantum mechanical model together and I
just want to say this guys if you stuck
with me in your syllabus in this video
probably this tutorial in the next
tutorial are the two most complicated
tutorials for a while the quantum
mechanical model is kind of new and
chemistry relative to everything else so
it's kind of confusing subject but once
we get past this then everything is
going to start coming together and
you're going to understand chemistry so
much easier so anyways just stick with
me for this tutorial the next tutorial
and maybe the next one and then it's
going to be a breeze I promise you so
anyways thank you guys for watching and
don't forget to subscribe and I will see
you guys in the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
