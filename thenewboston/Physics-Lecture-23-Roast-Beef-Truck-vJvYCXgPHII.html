twenty-third tutorial and in this
tutorial you guys are going to be
excited because this is probably the one
you've been waiting for I'm finally
going to show you guys what happens when
a car crashes into a truck so what we
need to do is a cop called me last night
true story
not really but who cares cop called me
last night and he's like Bucky you're
probably the greatest physicist I know
and I have a problem someone was driving
drunk last night and they crashed into a
truck however we need to figure out how
fast they were going because we need to
give them a ticket I can't figure that
out because I'm not as smart as you so
that's why I called you and I was like
you know what okay just let me make a
youtube video about this because it's
going to be awesome so the first thing
that I'm going to do is I always write
down my formula momentum equals mass
times velocity by the way the symbol for
momentum is P in physics if I didn't
mention that earlier so what I'd like to
do now is I like to draw a diagram first
what happened before the crash and what
happened yeah if you guys couldn't guess
it after the crash so this is the
information they gave us before their
crash there was a car now this car had a
drunk driver in it his name was Al but
that's not important
and he also says that this car was
traveling at some velocity that we need
to figure out so for now I'm just going
to write question mark miles per hour
because that's what we need to figure
out for him however he did tell us that
the car had a mass of 3,000 kilograms
which is useful information so I said
thank you for that now he also told us
that it crashed into a truck now this
truck just happened to be filled with
roast beef so I'll just write beef truck
on here and I'll color the wheels white
because I'm bored
there we go now this truck he said was
parked so that means it has a velocity
of zero miles per hour and this also had
mass well not also it had
of 6,000 kilograms so I said okay thank
you for that crucial information however
I also need to know what happened after
the collision so after the collision he
says it was pretty ugly this car was
going really fast and it got really
banged up at the end so it kind of looks
something like you know elephant that
has like I don't know like anorexic
elephant or something and it crashed
into this truck banged it up as well
however it still had its nice white
wheels just finished her on this and
might as well finish my diagram I me and
I drew of this far so beef truck and a
car so he says these two vehicles were
crashed into each other so hard that
they actually welded together into one
big solid object now after the crash
lucky someone was there to calculate the
speed and they figured out that this big
hunk of metal was traveling ten miles
per hour and I said okay well you don't
even need to tell me how much the mass
is because we know that before the
collision the beef truck had a mass of
6,000 kilograms and the car had a mass
of 3,000 kilograms therefore the total
mass of this big muna excuse me big hunk
of metal is 9,000 kilograms so now he's
like you know what can you find how fast
the car was going with just this
information and I said you know what
lucky for you I just happen to be
teaching the law of conservation of
momentum so let me show you guys how to
do that the first thing we need to do is
we need to calculate the total momentum
after the crash so of course momentum
equals mass times velocity so if we take
the mass of this which is 9,000 and we
multiply it by 10 miles per hour we get
total momentum equal to 90,000 and the
unit's you write is just kilograms times
miles per hour so after the collision
this object had a total momentum of
ninety thousand kilograms times miles
per hour why is that important well
because once we have the total momentum
after the collision
we had the total momentum before the
collision so we know before the
collision this entire system right here
must have had a momentum of ninety
thousand kilograms times miles per hour
we also know that this beef truck had
zero momentum why do we know that
because it has zero velocity and
whenever something has zero velocity it
automatically has zero momentum so that
means through reasoning that this car
must have had all the momentum in the
system this car had a momentum of ninety
thousand before it hit this truck so now
we can use this information to solve the
rest of this from so car before we know
that it had a momentum of ninety
thousand kilograms times miles per hour
for reasons that I just explained now in
order to figure out the initial velocity
what we need to do is we need to use
that formula of P or momentum equals
mass times velocity now in order to get
velocity alone what we do is we you guys
should already know this I probably
shouldn't even have explained this but
we do oh okay calm down Bucky we divide
both sides by the mass so in this case
the total momentum of the car is ninety
thousand kilograms times miles per hour
and if you guys forgot the total mass of
the car alone not the entire system but
then only the car was three thousand
kilograms so in order to calculate
velocity which is basically momentum
over mass what we do is we can first
cancel out these units kilograms
kilograms that's the easy part and then
we take a ninety thousand and put it
over three thousand and we end up with a
velocity
equal to can you guys guess 30 miles per
hour and you guys can actually see that
because that's the only unit we have
left so there you go that is how you
figure out in this example like if you
have a cop or this is pretty much what a
lot of you guys are going to be doing
whenever you work with law enforcement
in your physicists basically they're
going to have some information and they
want you to put the rest of the puzzle
together so guys little tidbit of
information if you're ever driving a car
car that's 3,000 kilograms in you crash
into a beef truck that is 6,000
kilograms and you end up going 10 miles
per hour due to the result of the crash
then that must mean that you were going
30 miles per hour to begin with so again
that guy wasn't driving that drunk but
we might letter the cops because we
don't like drunk drivers and say that he
was going 80 hey there they'll believe
us but anyways thank you guys for
watching and hopefully you like that
example and a plenty more to come so I'm
gonna go grab a roast beef sandwich and
yeah I'll see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
