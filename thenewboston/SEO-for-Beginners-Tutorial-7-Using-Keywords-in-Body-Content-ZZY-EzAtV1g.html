video I want to talk to you guys about
your body content so so far we talked
about navigation a little bit the logo
all of the headings and stuff like that
you know the title your body content is
pretty much everything else so if you're
writing an article then it's the main
text if you're you know making like a
post on some social network it's all the
text that you wrote it's pretty much the
majority of your website is going to be
made up of the actual main content now
the reason I say this is because
whenever a search engine is looking that
if your site is relevant to whatever the
user is trying to look for we already
know that it looks at certain locations
the title of the heading in these
specific areas now it also looks at the
content but what it does whenever it
looks at the content is not only does it
look for if the keyword exists in your
content like bacon it also looks how
frequent that keyword occurs now I say
this because if the keyword bacon let's
say you some user typed in bacon
for whatever reason they were just
looking for web pages about bacon if it
looks at my website and I have one word
about bacon then Google is going to
think you know what this website is
probably about something else
maybe Bucky was just telling a story
about bacon but this entire website
probably isn't about bacon if it only
occurred once now in contrast that look
at Wikipedia page about bacon you see
the bacon word 1 2 3 I mean it's like
every other word basically so again it's
not only where your keywords appear the
heading the title etc but it's how often
or frequent they appear so I know what
you're thinking already all right I want
to have the number one ranked bacon site
so I'm just going to write something
like this ah do you like bacon I like
bacon it is very bacon II and bacon is
crispy and bacon
bacon bacon you're just going to throw
the keyword in like 7,000 times
look man I'm a really good accurate
typer but guys I am warning you do not
do this whenever you do this and just
overuse the word in order to you know
try to kind of trick the search engine
this is actually called keyword abuse or
people often call it keyword stuffing
and a not only is it unreadable to
humans when you just have bacon every
other word in the sentence but it's
actually going to hurt your search
results because Google knows that you're
you pretty much are doing something
shady so do not do keyword stuffing
whenever you're writing an article or
webpage about bacon just write about
bacon let those words occur naturally
and those are going to give to you the
biggest boost in your search results now
one of the last things I want to talk
about is content a length so let's say
that you're making some website about
bacon let's stick with that and you had
a bunch of content maybe like five pages
worth of information so now you have to
decide should I stick these on five
different pages or should I just have
one long article about bacon and the
answer is dunt-da-daaaaa one long
article content length is key so it's
better whenever you have a bunch of
related content to have them all on the
same page and that's why you know all
those stupid websites now this is one of
my biggest pet peeves where it's like 10
recipes for bacon and they break it up
into ten different slides by click next
and then you know a thousand ads pop up
on every page do not do this it's like
shooting yourself in the foot for search
results and I don't know I just can't
stand it and also it sucks for the
actual users of your site when they have
to click something ten times to read
like one little sentence so I'm going to
quit venting now but alright there you
go so we're going to be taking a look a
little more about keywords later on but
for right now we got a pretty good
overview of how it works again as
general guidelines remember whenever
you're trying to target a keyword or
you're trying to appear high in the
search
it's for a certain term take that term
and put it in your title once no more
put it in your Meta Description once no
more
put it in your h1 or h2 headings once no
more and then in your main content this
just let that keyword appear naturally
so do not stuff your keywords do not
just you know throw in a bunch of
nonsensical terms everywhere you can
those are the best guidelines that you
could use to get the biggest boost in
your search results so there you go I'll
see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
