another app review in this app is FML
which stands for F in my life and it's
based off the website if you ever went
to that and what it is is pretty much a
bunch of they're not in short stories or
even just a couple sentences of just
like embarrassing things that happen
people so this is the coolest thing
about this is that it's free and this
will they update this every single day
and there's always new stories on it so
you can pretty much never run out of
stories to read and embarrassing stories
about these people just make you feel a
whole lot better about your life so what
I usually do is I go to the best of and
this is like the best of day the month
the week or the best of all time and i
think i'm on the best of the week right
here so let me just read a couple to you
guys um today while on a date with my
boyfriend he broke up with me the reason
why because i took a dump in his
bathroom and that's inappropriate for
girls and then people can read it right
here and if you have an account on here
you can rate it too so here's another
one today i received a letter in the
mail the letter was from a woman who
explained to me every single detail of a
three-month fair she had with my husband
she included pictures FML and what that
means is at my life and that's uh they
have it at the end of every one so or
you can also go to random or if you want
to store your favorites you can also do
that but i like this a whole lot in the
only thing that i would recommend to the
company is that that is little ad down
here but I mean it's a small price to
pay for having all this content so I
pretty much read these every night
before I go to bed because you know I'm
nothing else to do i probe should we do
my homework or something but this is a
much more entertaining so again the fact
that it's free always updating in one of
the best funniest apps definitely is the
reason i'm going to rate this one a nine
out of 10 so again like I said free now
now 10
I would definitely recommend getting it
it will keep you busy day after day and
this is probably the only one out of
probably three apps that I get on day
after day after that this imobsters and
my life is average so lastly would
definitely recommend getting it I mean
you really have no reason not to so
that's that for this thank you guys for
watching don't forget subscribe and if
you have any other apps you want me to
review and just shoot me a message or
leave me a comment and I'll do that for
you so don't forget subscribe and I'll
see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
