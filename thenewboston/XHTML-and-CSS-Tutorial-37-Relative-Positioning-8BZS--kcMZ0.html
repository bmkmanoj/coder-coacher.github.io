welcome back to your 37th XHTML and CSS
tutorial and in this tutorial as
promised I'm going to be talking to you
guys about a different kind of
positioning and that's called relative
positioning now relative positioning is
kind of similar to absolute positioning
but it's also very different
so you're saying how can it be similar
and extremely different but it is so let
me go ahead and show that to you guys
let's go ahead and first make a couple
paragraphs on the screen so P P and just
go ahead and like right first let me
just go ahead and copy this make like
four paragraphs or something that will
be fine
first second third and fourth but give
this third one an ID oops
I'm a computer program in computer
program and you put equal sign twice and
that's what I thought I was doing so
anyways ID equals third by the way you
guys should check out my computer
program it's toriel's so pretty cool
that's just a side note anyways now for
our third paragraph let's first of all
give it absolute positioning because
that's what we know already so in order
to do that go ahead and make your ID
third and go ahead and give it a border
of like whoa definitely spell that wrong
border one pixel solid green that'll
make it easy to see and what else can we
do
position:absolute
and now let's go ahead and move it top
sixty pixels and also left arm 30 pixels
I don't like my talking left to be the
same same ways if we go ahead and save
this what we're going to see is this
we're going to see through I mean four
paragraphs on the screen and then we're
going to see that third paragraph move
sixty pixels down from this top point
right here and 30 pixels right so
somewhere right in there so check it out
we have the first second third and this
third box right here from the top left
corner of your screen is moved down
sixty pixels and right 30 pixels because
that's what absolute positioning does it
takes this coordinate right here and it
moves your box in relation to there so
let's go ahead and now instead of
absolute type in relative and save this
and look how it changes the box is now
down more and over to the right the same
it's re saying alright what exactly is
going on because this is kind of
confusing so instead of 60 pixels from
the top it's now a lot more so why did
this happen well relative positioning is
different than absolute positioning in
the idea that instead of moving it
absolutely from the top left point right
here it moves it in relation to where it
would normally be so instead of having
the origin right here in moving 60 down
30 across the origin is wherever it
would be normally which is somewhere
right in here and from that point it
moves it 60 down and 30 across so that's
why it's actually more than 60 pixels
down from the very top of your screen
again if I was to move this absolutely
it would be 60 pixels down from the top
and 30 pixels over but since I'm moving
it relatively it says alright you start
it out well let's go ahead and
get rid of this cut this so you start it
out right here by default so here is
your starting point right here and now
you have the CSS rule that says I want
to move this 60 pixels down from where I
was relative and also 30 pixels over so
it's going to take it from right here
move it 60 down and 30 over so that's
why it ends up right here so anyways
that's difference between absolute and
relative absolute moves it from the top
left point on your screen and relatives
move it from where it was in relation to
the rest so now you can see that we come
across another problem that it doesn't
really help - you might be saying art
right I'm just going to make everything
relative then instead of absolute
because relative is better well we come
across this from you see instead of just
taking this piece out right here in
continuing the flow we're first second
fourth and said to just moving this
fourth up and fill in the gap we now
have a space or a gap of where that box
used to be right here so with absolute
we came across the problem of things
overlapping and now relative we come
across the problem of whenever we take
something out from the natural flow we
have a huge gap of where it used to be
and it doesn't look like anything really
fits in there so anyways keep those in
mind whenever you're using these two
different types of positioning and by
the way let me say this people usually
don't layout a webpage all absolute or
all relative this isn't like a choice
where you choose one or the other
yes you can make an entire webpage all
absolute or all relative
but you usually use them use them in
conjunction with one another for example
you might have your outside box relative
in every inside box inside that would be
absolute that is a common technique that
people use but anyways I just want to
you know get that in your head because
in case you thought I was teaching guys
the different ways of laying out a
website don't think like that think how
can I use these techniques together in
order to get my webpage the look that I
need to achieve so anyways there is one
way
type of positioning that I'm going to be
teaching you guys about and then after
that I'm going to show you guys how to
tie everything together and give your
website the exact look and feel that you
guys want and it's going to be awesome
you guys are going to be making
beautiful websites in no time so for now
thank you guys for watching don't forget
to subscribe and I'll see you in the
upcoming videos</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
