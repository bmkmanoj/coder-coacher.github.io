video all we're going to do is we're
going to take the MAC address and format
it into a human readable format kind of
the standard convention because right
now we unpacked it but it's all broken
up into chunks and the standard
convention for a MAC address is to have
two decimal places in there each
separated by a colon
so like a a : BB yada yada yada tomato
tomato tomahto
so we already made this function and get
MAC address so that's what we're going
to do let me add a comment I'll say a
return hopefully formatted MAC address
all right
so define get MAC address and what we're
going to do is we're just going to test
it in the bytes address so actually let
me give myself some more lines I like to
be able to scroll around oh yeah there
we go May there we are
alright so this is pretty much um the
address that's broken up into chunks
it's an iterable and from here what I
want to do first is just convert it to a
proper string format each chunk so I'm
going to take bytes string I'm going to
set this equal to map and if you guys
don't know what the map function is
again look at my Python 3 tutorials it's
basically a way that you can pass a
function in here and in iterable and it
runs each item in there through your
function so what do we want to do with
each chunk of the mac address like this
chunk in this chunk of this chunk well
all we want to do is we want to format
it to two decimal places so have single
quotes curly brackets and if you're
right colon 0 to X that's what that is
going to do dot format holy alright dot
format we're never using map you don't
use those curly braces and what do you
want to loop through or just this right
here so basically what this is doing is
taking all those chunks and
formatting them correctly pretty much
stripping out everything and making sure
that we only have two decimal places for
each one but now what we need to do is
we need to take each of those chunks and
make sure that they're all uppercase and
also join them together with colons so
how do we do that well let's just say
MAC address that's what's going to be
the ending return value and just set
this equal to colon in between single
quotes and what do you want to join
together well let's just go ahead and
join together these chunks and we also
want to make sure everything is
uppercase so this made the proper chunks
and this just joins them together with a
colon in between all of them and
actually instead of even doing this
return MAC address what we can actually
do is just return this and it'll save us
a little bit of you know clutter looking
good so there you go and let me go ahead
and write bit uh I'm not like a quick
little demo of what it is so be like a a
BB CC DD e FF and these are of course
colons not semi colons and that'll just
help anyone reading later on I'm going
to be putting this on get help later on
so if you guys want to make sure to
follow me on github and you'll be
updated on everything but that is the
format that we are going to be returning
so now we have a nice beautiful properly
formatted Mac address that we can
display to the user we're now ready to
move on to the next step</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
