Robertson welcome to your very first
tutorial in Java game development now in
this video series what I'm going to be
doing is I'm going to be teaching you
guys how to make awesome computer games
using Java and also a library known as
slick now I'm assuming that you guys
already know the basics of Java
programming and I don't mean like
networking in multi-threaded programs I
just mean the basics like how to make a
class how to make a simple method
variables if statements so on and so
forth but if this is your guys first
introduction to programming or Java in
general then what you can do is you can
go to my website the new Boston org
click on tutorials and click on Java
beginner now go ahead and watch all
these videos I think there are 87 of
them and once you do you're going to be
ready to move on to game development so
now that I say that I want to go ahead
and mention this what we're going to be
doing is we're going to be using the
Eclipse program so make sure that you
have Eclipse installed in Eclipse is
basically an IDE pretty much an
environment where that's where we're
going to write our Java code so now let
me go ahead and give you guys an
introduction before I start typing any
code on the screen
what we're going to be doing for this
tutorial is like I said we're going to
be using Java but we're also going to be
using something called slick now you can
go there if you go to this website it
tells you all about it slick is a game
library based on the lightweight Java
game library now the lightweight Java
game library and this website is this
one right here is a library that's used
to make games like Minecraft maybe
you've heard of that before and tons of
other sweet Java games and if you guys
are like okay slick lightweight Java
game what the heck is even what's a
library I don't know what a library is
well to put things really really simple
and and if you're computer science
teacher heard me give this definition
they probably drop kicked me in the face
but the most simple way I can put it is
libraries are pretty much pre-built code
that you can use in combination with
your code to make things a whole lot
easier like I said that's not the
technical
equal definition but it's pretty much a
bunch of methods that other people
created and they're like here you go
these are the confusing methods the
boring stuff like rendering graphics and
working with memory this is all the
boring crap we put them in the library
for you so all you need to do is worry
about concentrating on the fun stuff the
game itself the movement things crashing
into each other sounds graphics all that
good stuff so that's the introduction to
you know what a library is and why we
need to use them so now let me go ahead
and show you guys how to set up your
game file so go ahead and open eclipse
and it's probably going to say you know
default workspace okay whatever you have
is good now once you have this open and
I think I just downloaded this one your
guys might be a little bit different but
uh what you need to do is you need to
make a new Java project so go ahead and
hit file new project or if you guys just
have the option of Java project
some of my versions of Eclipse have it
but if you don't just go ahead and go to
project and then you can select Java
project and just go ahead and click Next
and now we want to give this project a
name so what would be a good name for
our game
how about ham blaster if you guys can't
tell already I'm pretty much going to
wing it programming this so hand blaster
will say we'll make a game about a bunch
of hams going around and blasting things
sounds pretty cool now go ahead and
click Next
and okay everything looks good go you
could have clicked finished back there
if you want to but go ahead and click
finish
and it says okay yadda yadda yadda
actually I probably should read this
word oh yeah just go ahead and click yes
whoever reads those terms of service
agreements anyways not me all right so
now we made a new project and it's named
hand blaster guys if you don't name it
hand blaster it's not going to work so
now go ahead and expand hand blaster let
me go ahead and tighten this up a little
bit I don't like that so big
ok expand this so nice esource and JRE
system library and once you had that
expanded go
and right-click this source now once you
go ahead and right-click the source
select new package because we want to
create a new package now what can we
name this package let's just name it
don't name a hand blaster that'll be too
confusing Java game alright go ahead and
click finish it guys another really easy
definition if you don't know what a
package is a package pretty much just
organizes all your classes pretty much
organizes your files I'll just say it
like that so yeah I hope you know
someone's going to be like oh
technically it's accessor resource now
you know what forget it it just
organizes crap okay
all right so now that we have a package
called Java game what we need to do now
is we need to make some folders for our
game and I know I say folders around a
lot of people tell me that I think it's
because I live near Canada and they're
like oh he's a boot folder duels and you
know anyways so go ahead and right-click
hand blaster again and select a new
folder now go ahead and name this one Li
B finish we now have a Lib folder now go
ahead and do the same thing right click
Han bass blaster new folder and instead
of Li be named this one our e-s finish
so now we have two folders check it out
Li be in our e s so now what we need to
do is we need to make two more folders
however we don't make them just like we
did before by right-clicking hand
blaster we actually need to make these
inside the Lib folder so how do you do
this well you need to go ahead and
right-click Lib new folder and this
first one is name jars because we're
going to be putting jars of things in
here like mayonnaise and you know um
jelly and you know stuff like that so
this is where we can put all our jars of
stuff now we also need another folder
called natives so right-click Lib new
folder
a TI ves and finish because that's where
we're going to be putting all our
natives like native people to the you
know Hawaiian island and Native
Americans and stuff so now that we got
all of our project crap set up then you
know what the next thing we have to do
is actually install slick but this video
is getting awfully long in if someone
sees like a 10 minute video of the back
of my attention span isn't that long I'm
not watching that crap but you know I
guess for them we'll just save that till
next video so anyways thank you guys for
watching this video don't forget to
subscribe so you can see all the latest
and greatest videos concerning the
development of this game it's going to
be awesome I'm excited and oh yeah
follow me on Twitter and Google+ and
I'll see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
