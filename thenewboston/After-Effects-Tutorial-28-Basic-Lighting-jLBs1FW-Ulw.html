28th I think After Effects tutorial and
in this story we're gonna begin talking
about my favorite subject in After
Effects and that's lights now lights is
the thing that separates like amateur
clips from professional video clips and
After Effects this is what makes
difference from making your video look
ok or making it look awesome
so let's go ahead and enough the small
talk can't wait to get into this let's
get started I dragged a clip of me in
here because let's get a good pic uh
there we go not bad not bad we'll go
with that one right there
and in order to work with lights we
first need to work with the 3d image so
light can't affect 2d image so if you
want to convert this 2d clip the 3d go
ahead and click this check box and now
we can use the lights so go ahead and
click layer new camera and just or
excuse me
that's our tutorial layer new light and
just like the camera as I was gonna say
this gives you a whole new layer with
it's all new properties and for this
type of light let's double click it you
have a bunch of different options we're
going to be working with spotlight since
this is the easiest to learn with and
the spotlight is exactly what you would
think it's just like if you were holding
a spotlight it has one source that's
usually a cone shape that you can move
anywhere around you want closer further
away and it's represented by this cone
in After Effects so you can see all the
properties right here such as position
point of interest again the point of
interest is where you're aiming it just
like this the position is where the
where you would be holding it I guess
and that's pretty much all there is to
this again the rotation probably rerun
and be working with only Y rotation for
now and but that's not what we're here
to talk about you learn all about those
a camera well weird
about is the light options that are
specific to only lights now again I told
you Spa is the one we're gonna be
working with in this story oh in the
next couple Torrio's I'll tell you guys
what this means but Spa is pretty much
just a spotlight and what you would
think of a light in intensity let's go
ahead and get that light out so you can
see it intensity is how bright your
light is so 100% is pretty bright you
can go beyond a hundred to get like
super mega brick like tanning light
lights or you can go under a hundred to
get like oh my god my light bulbs almost
died I can barely see light buff right
now let's leave this somewhere around
hundred there we go the color of the
light is exactly like you think of it
right now we're having a nice dark green
color but let's go ahead and change this
to something like a nice orange color
and this should give us a nice warm or
just feeling again let's go ahead and
increase the light and this just brings
up the mood but let's go ahead and
change that it's a bit more yellow and
bam look at that so again the color is
color pretty pretty simple now the cone
angle I'm gonna change the Sun I want
you to take a look at the right here
what this does is affects the shape or
direction again if you have like
something like 4 degrees it's gonna turn
in a laser pointer if you have something
like above 100 it's going to turn it in
just a huge light that goes in every
direction so this is how you can well it
pretty much cone angle can't say better
than that now the cone feather is a
little bit different you see this where
it kind of fades in fades out on the
side what the cone feather does and
again is default is 50 is it makes it
fade in or have it be more precise and
let me show you if you have it at 0 this
is gonna give you a nice crisp edge and
again this doesn't really look like a
light at all but sometimes you want to
achieve this effect when you're working
with a
for FX but a more natural would be
something like close to 100 actually
where light kind of fades in around the
edges but the default 50 so that's where
we're gonna be talking with in tutorials
to come probably but again I just wanted
to go over in this tutorial
these are defaults for the light options
under here and if you don't know how to
get to them just go ahead and click that
little light triangle again make sure
you're working with your layer in 3d
watch what happens when to click this
off 3d it just turns back to normal
because light can't work with anything
but 3d so if you're saying alright wTF
is wrong with this that means your 3ds
not clicked so again these are your
basic light options if you want to move
your light around physically you use
this rotation or just go ahead and grab
the point of interest it's probably the
easiest way or just go ahead and grab
the light itself and move it around but
for now that's it for this tutorial
let me change its color I just feel like
give it a nice oh yeah this is gonna be
good oh yeah that's what I was going for
but anyways that's it for this tutorial
those are your basics of light in the
next tutorial I'm probably going to be
showing you how to get like high quality
lighting that they do in professional
videos but for now just play around with
light it's the easiest way in best way
you can learn on it so thank you guys
