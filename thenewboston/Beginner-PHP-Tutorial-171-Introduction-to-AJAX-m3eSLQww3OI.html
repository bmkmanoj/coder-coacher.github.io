and this is a video tutorial for the new
Boston now in this video tutorial series
we're going to be looking at Ajax now
Ajax isn't specifically relative to PHP
however many PHP applications or
websites you may create with PHP can be
massively enhanced with Ajax because
what we can do is we can create
applications that allow us to say click
a button or type add some kind of data
in and we can grab data from a database
or a text file or just simply include a
pet include a PHP file onto our page
that gives us dynamic information so
updated information and Ajax has been
used for a long time now and recently
started to be create more popular we're
in 2011 when this video is being
recorded so it's extremely popular on
the web so why is Ajax special what
makes it special I'm just going to talk
to you a bit about the features of Ajax
that create that create a more dynamic
web experience if you like now Ajax
first of all stands for a sync RIA a
synchronous JavaScript and XML and what
this means is that we can process data
through well behind the scenes of our
website just using a JavaScript and
XHTML as well or HTML so it
synchronously sends a value and retrieve
something without having to reload the
entire page so if you think about a web
page in general you have let's say we're
on index dot PHP at the moment you have
some data on a page and you click a form
for example to maybe submit a
registration or you might just click a
button to retrieve a list of values that
you've typed in a search box for example
so you may have a search box on your web
page and this may return a value now
usually you would use a form submit so
you would say let's just break out our
PHP tags we would say form action equals
something
method equals something come down here
we would enter we would create a submit
button and what would happen is when we
press this submit button we're taken to
the forum action then what we can do is
we can specify buttons just on their own
and what these do is they will send a
they will call a function inside of our
header so if we were to set up a
standard page like this sorry start the
head tag and then end the head tag start
the body and the body so very badly
written out an HTML document here we've
got head we can include some JavaScript
so you can say script type equals text
forward slash JavaScript and then end
that there so this is a general setup
for a website with one input button here
what we can do is we could say unclick
equals and then we call a function
within JavaScript so we could say update
page for example now up here we may have
a function in JavaScript called update
page which is going to call and work
with Ajax we're not going to give any
examples in this introduction video but
it would call this function and it would
process some kind of Ajax code if you
like or the methodology or the methods
used with Ajax to actually update a
certain area on the page so for example
below here we can have a div ID equals
page for example okay so this might grab
an a PHP document and it might update
this div with the contents of the PHP
document so this is obviously a very
basic example we're just updating
perhaps some data from a PHP file and
popping it onto a page but using this
method we won't actually refresh the
page now I've just given you sort of
like an example of how it may work this
this code obviously is not might not be
how we actually do it but erm is
very similar and this is just the
general method that we will use in order
to update values without having to
refresh a page so why can this be useful
in everyday applications well for
example when we go to over to Google
you'll notice that we have a feature in
Google called autosuggest
and what happens is is when we I'll just
briefly explain when we when we look at
Google we type in a value into a text
box which is placed in the center of the
screen so we start typing let's say PHP
now what what Ajax and for the other
part that Ajax plays in this is what
I'll do it will automatically get the
updated value of this text box so let's
say we just start typing we'll create an
input type so we can search box sorry
the type equals text and name equals
search box okay so what's going to
happen is is we're going to start typing
something for example into here so we
might start typing PHP now as we type P
it's going to get the value of this text
box which is equal to P at the moment
and it's going to search a database for
the most popular searches relating or
that start with P then we're going to
save pH so it's going to foot and then
it's going to then re update itself
without obviously having to refresh the
page because if you were to refresh the
page every time you type something you'd
have absolute pandemonium pandemonium
pandemonium and it would not work so
we've got pH and then we type P and it's
going to find the most search for
results with PHP so that's just
generally oh that's just generally how
it works so um this uses Ajax Google or
Google Suggest uses Ajax and a variety
of other websites too as well Facebook
uses Ajax and this is a this uses it in
a really interesting way when you're
looking at a Facebook say news feed
you'll be looking at the news feed
straight up and down and you'll have
your Mouse still now you look at your
you'll look at your page
thing will update then what you'll do is
you'll move your mouse very slightly it
only has to literally be one pixel that
you move your mouse and your page will
actually update now what happens here is
we have an unmask move or on Mouse event
trigger so when you move your mouse bits
of the page updated using Ajax so it
will be automatically updated from the
database using Ajax
the same with Twitter as well when you
create a new tweet you might tweet in a
box like this and click Submit or hit
enter and it will automatically show
your most recent tweet it won't actually
refresh the page the same with probably
the feeds in Twitter you'll
automatically see new feed open so this
is why we use Ajax and why it's so
important on the web today when we don't
want boring static web sites we want
everything to be easy to use and dynamic
and that's another reason we use ajax is
because it's really easy to use a
website that's been M enhanced with Ajax
particularly with PHP where we're
gaining values from a database we can do
other things with Ajax but for now we're
going to be looking at ajax closely
related to PHP because Ajax is so
closely related to PHP where we grab
things from the database obviously it
can be used with other web programming
languages but obviously because this is
PHP tutorials we're going to be looking
at Ajax and PHP so that's a bit about
Ajax how it works what it is why we
should use it now in the next in the
next tutorials coming coming up we're
going to be looking at how to first of
all the basics of that and I'm going to
be creating some sample programs to grab
some data from databases depending on
what we do on the page</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
