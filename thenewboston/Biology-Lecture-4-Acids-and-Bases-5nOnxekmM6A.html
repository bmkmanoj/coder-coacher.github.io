to your fourth biology video and in this
video I want to start off by talking to
you guys about chemistry why do I want
to talk to you guys about chemistry if
this is a biology video well if you
think about it
biology kind of is chemistry hmm what
the heck do I mean by that well think
about it take you for example since you
are a living thing
and that is the you know definition of
biology well you as a human being are
made up of organs now your organs like
your heart your brain your skin they're
made up of tissues which is made up of
cells now I know we didn't talk about
what a cell is but a cell is basically
made up of different pieces called
organelles now these pieces called
organelles if you break them up into
small enough pieces then you end up with
chemicals just chemicals so basically if
you take any living thing and break it
up into small enough pieces then you end
up with chemicals so that's why in order
to really understand biology you first
need a very basic understanding of
chemistry now you don't need to be an
expert chemist in order to understand
biology but you do need to understand
some stuff like I don't know matter and
mass and atoms and I don't know elements
maybe isotopes protons neutrons
electrons um different kind of bonds
like ionic and covalent bonds so if you
know these very basic things you're
ready to move on with these biology
tutorials but if you don't understand
what those things are then you're better
off watching my chemistry tutorials on
my website the new boss endo org first
because even in this video I'm going to
be talking about some things and you may
not be able to grasp the concepts full
like fully so go ahead if you don't
understand the very basic concepts of
chemistry watch those videos then come
back to here but if you do if you ever
took a chemistry class or something or
read a chemistry book you're ready to
move on so let's go ahead and talk about
what I wanted to talk about in this
tutorial which is acids and bases now
before I discuss that I want to go over
molecules verse Wow that's a
nice-looking that's their Bucky
molecules first compounds now even if
you studied chemistry before people
often get molecules and compounds
confused
so a molecule is basically two or more
atoms and you guys should already know
what an atom is and a compound is
similar but it's a little bit different
a compound is a molecule that contains
two or more different elements such as
let me draw I'm dry so it doesn't look
like a pair of boobs
something like this maybe a compound so
again that's what molecule is two or
more atoms in a compound is a molecule
that contains two or more different
elements now the reason that I wanted to
explain all that is because whenever I
talk about acids and bases I'm going to
be using you know that terminology and I
don't want to get you guys confused so
let's go ahead and do that right now
so first of all what is or what are
acids well it's not the street drug or
actually you know LSD is kind of you
know it is an acid but we want to talk
about how to make drugs right now an
acid and you know the biological
definition is a molecule that can split
apart in water and whenever you add it
to water it releases hydrogen ions H+ a
positively charged hydrogen ion so the
most famous example of this is actually
a hydrochloric acid which is one
hydrogen and one chlorine and whenever
you add this to water it breaks apart
and it releases or it splits into a
hydrogen ion right there and a chlorine
ion but the reason that this is acid is
because it releases a positively charged
hydrogen ion right there and that is the
requirements for an acid now the
opposite of an acid is called a base so
let's go ahead and talk about basis B
ases in case you know maybe you can't
read my handwriting but a base is a
molecule that split
apart in a releases hydroxide now
hydroxide is o h- and remember anytime
you see a negative that means it's an
ion or a negatively charged and what
this pretty much mean whenever something
is negatively charged is it has an extra
or more electrons than protons now the
most I want to say famous example or
famous space the example that biologists
always give whenever they teach a class
is something is sodium hydroxide
now that's na for sodium in hydroxide Oh
H hydroxide will you see what's going on
and whenever you add this to water this
is going to split apart into a
positively charged sodium and a
negatively charged I was going to write
an like that but it's probably not a
good idea with a positive charge right
there and an hydroxide anion so
basically why is this a base well the
requirement for a base is whenever you
add it to water it releases a hydroxide
and hydroxide is o h- that's the
chemical formula now you know that's
nice and all but this kind of looks like
chemistry and we were talking about
biology so why the heck is any of this
important and why do I even need to know
it well
the reason that it's important is
because these charged particles such as
this hydroxide right here and also the
positively charged hydrogen ion before
whenever well you know what actually I'm
going to talk about why they're
important in the next tutorial but
sometimes if you have too much of them
in your body it can cause some real
trouble but I'm going to save that for
the next video since I'm getting kind of
long in this one so that's what acid is
that's what a base is once you
understand you're ready to move on to
the next video thank you for watching
and I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
