sixty third c-sharp tutorial but I'm
making for the new Boston and in this
tutorial we're gonna continue working on
our hangman project and or were you
really get into the tutorial there's
just a couple things here we're gonna
have to do we're just gonna want to add
another label and this label will
basically just hold all the letters that
you've missed and I just forgot to tell
you to do this on the first tutorial
when we started this but whatever it's
not that big of a deal and it's changed
the text of this to mist because this
will hold the mist characters or the
mist letters and the next thing that we
have to do right here is instead of just
setting this character letter equal the
textbox one's text to a character array
we're actually gonna want to convert
that to lower first so you just gonna
want to do table to lower and then to
character right and to lower well
basically just convert on every letter
in there to lowercase so it won't matter
if you put an uppercase a or a lowercase
a it'll always end up being lowercase
and all the letters in the words are
lowercase so it doesn't matter what case
you submit the letter in alright so
basically what we're going to be doing
in this tutorial is accounting for when
a user misses a letter so this if
statement right here basically just
checks the seat if the letter that you
submitted is in the word and we're just
going to want to put a tell Steven here
so if it's not in the word you can do
something and the first thing that we're
gonna have it do is have a message box
be displayed to the user to let them
know that the letter that they submitted
isn't in the word so we're going to say
the letter that isn't in never just a
foot sorry as on title of the message
box and the next thing that we're gonna
want to do is just add the letter that
they missed to this label right here so
that they will know which letters that
they missed so we're just going to say
label two which is that missed label up
there we're gonna say the text and then
we're gonna use the plus equals operator
to add to the label so that we're not
resetting at each time and
just add a space to it so that each
letter isn't like all congested and you
can actually read it and then we're
gonna add the letter that you missed so
we're just going to use this letter
character up here so letter and since
it's a character we're gonna have to
convert it into a string so just to
string floss and then we're just gonna
have a comma separating each character
as well so again it's just easier to
read and finally we're gonna want to
draw the next body part so the first
thing that we're going to want to do is
create an integer that will hold the
amount of letters that you miss so we're
just going to call this into amount
instead of equal to zero up here and
then we're just going to have that
integer increase by one each time you
miss a letter so doesn't have a mountain
plus box down here to increment it by 1
and then we're gonna draw the body part
so we're gonna say draw a body part and
what we could do here is have a whole
bunch of if statement saying like if
amount of 0 then draw the head if
ammount is 1 draw the left eye and stuff
like that or we could just cast for that
amount as a body part so we can just say
body parts and then that amount and
basically it will just turn this integer
into a body part so how do we know which
number goes with which body part well it
starts at 0 and just goes up by 1 from
there so this is 0 this is 1 this is 2
and so on alright and that just makes it
way easier and now we don't have to have
if statements or anything like that
alright so let's just go ahead and check
to see if this works so let's just go
and submit a letter right here I'll
submit a nope the letter you guessed
isn't in the word
let's try B nope what are your guest
isn't in the word about nope I don't
know maybe ask nobody alright so at
least we know that this works so the
final thing that we're going to do is
find out when you lose so after this
increments down here we're going to see
if you lost and the maximum amount of
body parts that it will draw is 8
to say if amount equals 8 then we're
just going to have a message box show
saying you lost so stay here sorry but
you lost and in the next tutorial we're
going to get into what's going to happen
when you lose and how to reset the game
but that's it for this tutorial so see
you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
