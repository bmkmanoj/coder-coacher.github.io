background crap done with handling our
notification let's go ahead and actually
start building it in other words giving
it an icon a title some text all that
good stuff so again what I'm going to do
is I'm going to call public void
Lucky's button clicked and remember this
is the method that gets called whenever
we click this button on the screen we
want to create a notification and send
it out to the system so the first thing
let me comment this build the
notification and remember a notification
I don't even know I close out my screen
but the first part is an icon the second
part is the text and the third part is
it's either the time a lot of these
things are optional but let's go ahead
and learn how to do it right now
so anytime you want to add one of these
attributes you just call notification
which is your notification object and
we'll set small icon first now usually
you want this to be like a picture or
the logo of your app but I was too lazy
to drag any images in here
so I'm just going to use this one right
here this is just the default one that
comes with every project that you make
it's just a little Android icon and it's
icy underscore launcher again you would
typically make this like the logo of
your app like I said but whatever so I'm
just going to set this to R that's ID IC
underscore launcher and it's giving the
error because it is not drop all right
so another thing that I want to do is
I'm going to set the ticker text and the
ticker text remember whenever you get a
notification minimize that and let's say
that you're just out of the app and
you're just I don't know scrolling
through maybe you're checking the App
Store maybe you're in another app
whatever the first thing that's going to
happen is you're going to hear a little
sound effect and then it's going to give
you this little icon right here and the
little text that says you have
new notification or Bucky like your post
whatever that little bit of text to
right on the status bar that's called
the ticker so that's what I'm going to
build now it's real easy notification
dot set ticker and in here you just put
some text like I don't know this is the
ticker I'll just write that so when we
see it in the example you guys will know
what it is now another thing that you
can do is you can set that time so
notification set when because remember
your notification on that right side you
have the optional time in that way when
people are looking at the notifications
they can see when you like sentiment
vacation or when you commented on their
post was an hour ago was a two seconds
go
whatever so what we can actually just do
here is take system current time Millis
and that's just going to get the current
time and pass in to your notification
it's like the easiest way now the other
part is this I'm going to add two more
things the notification set content
title now remember that text that
appeared on the notification it kind of
was like the text and email I had two
parts the title which was the main
header and the text which was a little
blurb of text under it so just so you
guys can see what's going on I'll just
write here is the title and notification
set content text this is the main body
of it now just right like I am the body
text of your notification and make sure
you spelled that wrong actually it's
bothering me alright so I am the
whatever whatever blah blah no period F
the period all right so now we have our
notification bill in other words it
looks like something it's the little
alien icon and then it says here's the
title I am the body text of your
notification and it gives it time in the
upper right corner so that's what it
looks like but
now we have to say okay whenever the
user clicks on this notification what do
we want to happen well what we want to
do and this is just going to be real
easy is we're just going to send them
back to our apps home screen now if you
have like a special notification section
of your app or it was some action that
you wanted them to perform then you can
send it to that but we only have one
screen here so it looks like they are
going to that so the first thing we need
to do is we need to make an intent I'm
just going to call it intent for right
now and set it equal to new intent now
in this you pass this for context and
then the name of the class where you
want to send them in it's just this one
right here so main activity dot class
just like before now we can't just send
them to the intent with one more line of
code because remember this intent in the
way we learn how to do before it was
great whenever you just have a couple
intents and they're already in your app
but remember they can be an entirely
different part of your phone they can be
in another app they can just be on the
home screen looking at the time they can
be in the App Store so what we need to
do is we need to give your device access
to perform this intent we need to give
the phone the ability to access our app
so what we do is we call a pending
intent notice the impending intent
whatever you can name it I don't know
whatever you want and set it equal to
pending intent get activity sealer and
let me all right so the first parameter
this takes is this zero and then the
third parameter is intent which is
essentially what we've been learning
before and the last one is pending
intent thought flag update current and I
want to cover pending intents in detail
later on but for right now just think of
it that this line of code right here it
gives your phone or your device access
to the intense in our app and of course
all this does is it puts them on the
home screen simple enough
so now in order to pretty much set this
intent what we just do is notification
set content intent right there and in
here we just write pending intent all
right pretty cool now there's two more
lines of code that we need so this of
course takes care of whenever they click
it they're going to go to this home
screen right here and Oh funny thing I
just got a notification on my phone
right now
wow that is ironic the universe man it's
a funny world sometimes all right so now
all we have to do is we need to
essentially send out the notification so
I'll just make a little comment like
bills notification arm and issues it by
the way issuing a notification means
sending it out to your device so in
order to do that you actually use a
notification manager I'll just name it
like I like NMM better nice try
all right then Ted typecast this to
notification manager and you call the
method get' system service what service
are we worried about the notification
service so now we have a notification
manager pretty much some dude that can
build and send out notifications just
think of it like that so how do we send
it out well we take that manager dude
and he calls a method called notify and
it takes two parameters the first one is
the ID of your notification because
remember he needs the manager model he
needs to keep track of a mom the other
one is the notification itself so that's
our notification in other words it's
this icon that ticker that time title
text all that good stuff and in order to
put it all together you just write build
and that's it so again this is just the
object that can send out notifications
we're building it and sending it out to
the system right
here this is where we say whenever they
actually click it take them to this
screen and right here of course we're
just customizing it to our liking and
well that's pretty much it so now let me
go ahead and run this all right so let's
click for notification Boop there it is
and you can also add a sound to it if
you want um I'll show you guys how to
add sounds later on this is just a real
quick tutorial and of course we drag it
down you can just click with your mouse
and drag and it'll simulate your
dragging your finger but this of course
is that icon this is the title this is
the body text and this is the time
12:16 and of course whenever we go to it
we can just click it no matter where we
are it takes us to whatever activity we
specified in our intent and take note
that that icon or notification
disappears and it disappears because of
this right here if you didn't have this
then whenever you went back for example
whenever you clicked on that
notification it would just stick up
there and it would be really annoying
for the user so there you have it ladies
and gentlemen that is how you use
notifications with Android</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
