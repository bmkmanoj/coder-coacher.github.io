this video I want to talk to you about
routing tables now I want to explain
this because if you think about it
whenever you connect to some website on
the internet you just aren't directly
connected to that website in order for
your dad to get there it has to pass
through a bunch of routers so how do
these routers know which path to take I
mean if you ever looked at the router in
your house it has a bunch of Ethernet
cables plugged into it and it has a
bunch of different options so how does
it choose what road to send your data
down let's say whenever you're
connecting to YouTube well it uses
something called a routing table and if
you're on linux and you type the word
route then these are all the routes that
you can take and this is just the one
for my own computer but the concept is
the same whether it's on your router I
mean they all work the same so I'll just
explain real quick what these columns
mean before I go over any examples in
details this destination just remember
that it's going to look at the final
destination the end path or the end IP
address of whatever server you're trying
to connect to this gateway is you see IP
address of your gateway or your router
and if you don't understand why people
refer to routers as Gateway sometimes is
because your router is a gateway to
another network that's all routers are
they just connect one network to another
now all of these computers aren't
directly connected to one another they
have to pass through this door to
another network so for example all the
devices in my house my tablet my phone
you know my computer right now they all
have to pass through the router in order
to get to the Internet so it's just a
door to another network in my case the
Internet
now this mask is of course a subnet mask
we know all about that there's a bunch
of different flags
whenever you see a you probably the two
most common flags are U and G u means
that this route is up so you can use
this route it's up and running that's
fine
means gateway so this route right here
uses a gateway and that means that
whenever we send data down this route is
going out the door to another network
now the other really important one is
this eye face which is interface and
this is just if you have a bunch of
different NICs on your computer I have
this one which is my Ethernet one and
this one is my wireless one so I'm sure
you guys know all about that already so
now that we kind of got the terminology
taken care of let's look at an example
of when we would actually use this so
right now let's say that I want to
connect to the New Boston comm and the
IP address is like 54.1 23.2 - whatever
so I'm going to form a packet and I'm
going to put this as the destination
that's where I'm going to try to send it
so now it's going to say ok let me check
it out my routing table and let me
decide what path I'm supposed to go down
so the first row that always reads is as
default one and this just means I'm
going to look for every other rule to
see if this destination matches and if
it doesn't then I'm just going to use
the default rule so every routing table
it always has at least a default rule
what do you want to do by default when
no other rules match so then it's going
to keep going and just going to say ok
so is this IP address in this network
well no this is just my home network so
anything starting with this is going to
fall under that category which clearly
isn't this well what about this one well
no it's kind of the same set of rules
all right so I guess I'm just going to
follow this default route right here so
whenever I'm trying to connect to this
IP address which is in my website then I
have to pass through this gateway this
door and again this is my router so once
it gets to my router it's going to
follow its own set of rules and it's
officially you're going to go out to the
Internet and every single router is
going to do this 2 digit of you and then
it's going to come back do did you do
and get to me but what if I just want to
you know print something on a printer
that's right next to me
well the IP address of the printer is
going to be something like 192.168 0.15
whatever well then it's going to say
okay you want to connect to your printer
let me look at my routing table to
figure out how to get there
all right so this is the default rule so
if I don't hit anything I'm just going
to use this one all right so what about
this rule oh you have actually these two
rules these ones actually match so let
me see where I'm supposed to get it well
I don't need to use any gateway and this
kind of makes sense because we're not
going out any doors to any other network
so this is why this is actually start
out and whenever you hit rule and this
is start out then it pretty much always
means that it's on the same network as
you so whenever there's no Gateway it
must mean that this device is on the
same network as my own computer so we
can verify that because yep according to
the subnet mask any device that falls in
this network I mean it's on the same one
and what interfaces am I supposed to
send it out well just eat zero in wlan0
which are my two Nick's in another way
that we can see that okay this doesn't
need to pass through a gateway it's
pretty much on the same network is that
there is no G flag for this so the route
is up I can connect you know no problem
but I don't need to use a gateway to get
there now the last thing I want to
explain before I let you guys go is what
happens whenever your final IP address
such it is like 192.168.0.1 or whatever
what if it matches more than one rule
what one does it follow because if you
think about it
I mean all of these rules so if I'm
trying to connect to this device then it
matches this rule but it matches these
ones too so I mean how does it know what
path to take well whenever it matches
multiple rules then it chooses the one
with the longest subnet mask in other
words this subnet mask insider notation
this would be slash
zero now this subnet mask right here
remember slider notation this would be
slash twenty four so it looks at the one
with a longer subnet mask and since
these both have slash 24 then it's going
to use these set of rules right there so
I know it's kind of overwhelming at
first but that is how each router in
each device can look at a packet look at
where it's going and decide which path
to send that data down and that's how
all of these routers can communicate
efficiently quickly and there you go so
in the upcoming tutorials
we're ventually going to get into how to
set these paths manually and we're going
to be showing you guys something really
cool and that is how to turn your own
personal computer into a router and who
are going to look at it why this is um
this is actually what hackers do
sometimes and well I'm kind of getting
ahead of myself but it's going to be
awesome so I'll see you guys then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
