Photoshop cs6 tutorial
I'm your host buddy Blackford and today
we're going to be talking about how to
use notes and notes are good for when
you are working on your project and you
need to like leave you can create a note
to let you know where you left off or
remind you about important parts of your
project or if you're like handing off
the project to someone else you can
include notes in there to give them
ideas of how and why your project works
in such a way that it does so they're
pretty handy they don't get like printed
up on your when you like try to print it
or save the image you won't see it on
the image it'll just be saved with the
project file so you don't have to worry
about that now the notes tool is
underneath the eyedropper tool so if you
click and hold on the eyedropper tool
there is the note tool click on that and
we can click anywhere in the scene it
could be on the gray area or within your
picture and then you can compile your
note here so um compile your note there
and then you can click off it and it'll
whoop my bed don't click off it because
that doesn't work you can click onto a
new tool and your note will be saved
there now if you click back onto the
note or the note tool here you can
change the color of the notes so maybe I
want to make it a pink no or something
like that so there's that the X actually
purple I thought I was paying for some
reason now there's a clear all button
for your notes you can type in the
author like who actually wrote the note
so multiple people are working on this
and each person can write their own type
of thing clear all will get rid of all
your notes that you have and
this shows or hides the note panel which
is this right here so if I click on that
it's going to show or hide the note
panel now you can right-click on the
notepad here to either close delete or
delete all the notes and then if you
want to just hide your notes you come up
here to view and see if I can find it so
it's in view and then under extras and
now that's gone so the note you can't
see it on here anymore
I go to view extras it'll pop back up as
you can see that so that's a work how to
hide notes so to deselect a note you
click on the selected note to deselect
it so if I click on the note the note is
now selected now if I click on it again
oh it was deselected its deselected now
if I click on the note now then it's
selected again so that's how your reopen
the note and to delete the note you can
just press Delete or you can right-click
on it and click on delete no so yes so
that's how a notes worked so that was a
quick tutorial on how to use notes not
much more to go through about it use
them to keep your project organized and
help other people out them may work on
your project with you so thanks for
watching this a quick tip and I'll see
you guys later in another tutorial
