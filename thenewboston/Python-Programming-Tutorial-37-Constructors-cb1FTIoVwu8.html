Python tutorial and this one is on
constructors now before we begin let me
tell you guys what a constructor is
whenever you first create an object you
usually need to call the methods in
order to use them but a constructor is
whenever you first create an object
those methods are automatically called
so whatever is the instruction inside
the method automatically gets done so
let me go ahead and show you guys create
a regular method real quick i mimic
swine in favor of the swine flu epidemic
and let's make a method call it apples
and of course we need self in the first
parameter and this one will print out
just word beep I can have print out
whatever you want and it usually when
you create an object and set it equal to
the class like swine if you want to use
any of these methods in here after you
create your object you have to put the
object name and then the method name and
then it will perform any action in the
method but a constructor is a little
different this is just a basic method
and object right here what we want to do
is not have to do this call the method
we want it to automatically go through
the instructions as soon as we create
the object and this is useful in a lot
of things that I'll probably be teaching
in next tutorial but let's go ahead and
let me show you guys how to do that go
ahead and make a new class and in this
class we want to make a method but we
want this method to initialize or pretty
much do it stuff whatever it needs to do
as soon as you create it so this has a
special name and you can't change this
name this is built into Python do
underscore underscore I and I T in this
stands for initial ation initialization
there you go
and of course underscore underscore
itself and again these are not these are
two underscores I know it looks like one
because they don't have spaces in
between them
those are actually two so now we have a
class in the name of this or excuse me
we have a method in the name of this
method is underscore underscore ini t
underscore underscore and whatever we
put in here is going to do or is going
to happen as soon as we create the
object so let's print out something like
this is a constructor and let's go ahead
and print out something else to show you
guys that it's more than one thing this
also prints out so now when we create
that as you can see in the last one in
our regular one when we created a object
nothing happened but this time let's
create new object and set it equal to
the name of this class as new as you can
see as soon as I create this object it
prints out everything in this
initialization method and this is
because the first thing it does is look
to see if this is a method in the class
and if it is it does all this before you
even have to call it and this is going
to be useful and a couple thing is that
um you would understand it but I will be
teaching the next couple tutorials so
just a recap one more time a constructor
is pretty much a special method in the
class and what you don't have to call
and as soon as you create your object it
automatically executes every action in
here and those include setting variables
equal to one another and stuff like that
so if you want to create one of these
instead of naming it whatever name you
want you have to name it underscore
underscore ini t underscore underscore
and this tells Python alright whenever
we create an object from this class do
this first without me even having to
tell you and again these are called
constructors
so that's your quick tutorial on
constructors and how to use them and
I'll show you why they're useful in the
next tutorial I hope so thank you guys
for watching make sure to subscribe and
I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
