video and if you ever want to make a
program like Instagram or just want to
make some cool photo filters and this is
probably going to be one of the most
important tutorials because I'm going to
show you guys how to take pillow and use
it to pretty much break up your image
into separate channels
so again programs like Instagram and any
like photo editing program uses all the
time so let me go ahead and explain
exactly what's going on for those of you
who may not understand now whenever
computers display images they don't
display things like we just look at them
in real life in real life you can like
hold your hand two inches away from your
face and you're not going to see any
pixels or anything like that however
whenever your computer displays images
let me just zoom in right here you can
see that every single image is actually
made up of these tiny things called
pixels now it's pretty much a bunch of
individual boxes but when you zoom out
it looks like a whole picture simple
enough you guys probably already know
what a pixel was now the thing I want to
explain is this each one of those pixels
pixels is actually made up of three
colors see right now this looks like I
don't know like 100 different colors but
each of these boxes are just a
combination of three colors mixed
together with various amounts red green
and blue now actually in Photoshop if
you click on channels you can see that
that's all this image is this is the red
this is the green and this is the blue
now you guys are like yeah right that's
just black and white for all of them I'm
not yet well the black whenever we click
on one of these channels it symbolizes
how much red is in this channel how much
green is in this and how much blue now
whenever we combine this much blue with
this much green in this much red that's
when we get this picture right here so
again that's kind of key to remember
every single image is made up of three
different colors
and it's pretty much saying this is how
much of each color you add to get your
whole image actually i'ma show you guys
this if you took this image and took out
the red then of course you would only
have green and blue if you took out the
green so I have like this purple because
it's only red and blue so on and so
forth
all right so I guess that did take a
little more than 60 seconds I lied but
now that we understand that let's go
ahead and learn how to use pillow to
take that image and break it up into
these individual channels because right
now just show you guys how to do it and
have this plan but later on I'm going to
show you guys how you can take these
channels and tweak them to either edit
the contrast or make some cool
old-school effects stuff like that so
the first thing we need is actually let
me show you I probably should explain
this now 99% of the images on your
computer or I'll say like 95 percent of
them are going to be made up of three
channels red green and blue however
sometimes people have images that are
CMYK and those are made up of four
colors because those are better from
like printing things in real life but in
order to determine first that you
actually are working with image made up
of three colors red green and blue what
you can do is you can just print out the
mode of your image you can see whenever
I run this it prints out the mode so
this JPEG right here is RGB it means it
is indeed made up of three and most of
the time it is so you don't really have
to worry about that but I felt like if I
didn't tell you guys then you know
people would complain so so now that we
verified that this image is indeed made
up of three channels let's go ahead and
split them apart so the function is
split them apart is of course call your
image and call the function split now
what this function does is it actually
returns a tupple so it's going to return
three values and we're going to store
those values in the variables r g b so
again it's going to
turn three values the first value we're
going to store in the variable R the
second one G and the third one be simple
enough so what these are are actually
these channels so it's going to return
this for R this for G and this for B so
if you don't believe me check this out
if you go down and you just hit our show
and run this I'm just going to show you
that red channel and you can actually do
this for green and blue too so now I'm
going to show my green one and now I'm
going to show my blue one and actually I
kind of like doing this like to close
out all of these and run these all at
the same time because it just looks cool
in Photoshop our G B I don't know I
think that's so cool it's actually
probably kind of stupid but I think it's
kind of cool so again now we have pretty
much three separate images created or
three image objects one is the red
Channel ones the green Channel and ones
the blue Channel
so now we can do cool things like arm
well actually I'll show you guys
something really cool in the next story
because I'm kind of running out of time
don't want my file to get too big so
well the next tutorial is going to be
awesome
I'll see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
