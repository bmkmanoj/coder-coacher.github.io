to another PI game with OpenGL and
python tutorial in this video or a
minute our name out is actually bringing
our cube into view so what this does
here in the background is it kind of
draws to OpenGL based are using OpenGL
it draws a cube in the background but
the reason why this is a 3d game engine
is because we have not only the object
that we draw but we also have our
perspective of that object so where are
we in in that in that view so to speak
so we also have to define those things
as well
and for that and for viewing our a cube
and all of that that is where we use
pugging that's what we're using pi game
for and so to do that we're gonna go
ahead and define main and that's just
gonna be our main function and this is
what's going to basically run the game
or not really the game but show us our r
cubed so to begin as always with any PI
game we must run PI game dot init which
initializes PI game and gets us ready to
do PI game stuff so this starts off
pretty simple and then we're gonna go
ahead as usual and we're going to
display the PI game display but first
we're gonna predefined that is 800 and
600 so it'll be 800 pixels wide 600 ohm
and then we do the typical PI game diet
display dot set underscore mode and then
we'll pass through display that's you
that's pretty typical we've seen that
many times before but now we add in one
more thing and we're gonna add in double
buffs all caps then a pipe and then open
GL so this all started off really nice
simple easy we knew everything that was
happening and then BAM we threw this at
you in the bar what that so our pipe
rather so first of all what is double
buff double buff is not a pokemon name
that is actually four double buff
and the idea of double buffer is that
you have like the buffer that you're
seeing so like the image you're seeing
and then in the background there's
another image just in case and this is
the handle like monitor refresh rates
it's just a better way of doing things
basically and then we have the pipe and
then just OpenGL and these are just
parameters that we're passing through
the set mode for pi in so this is this
is how pi game works with OpenGL or PI
OpenGL basically it just leaves the
optionality for throwing some opengl
stuff at it because you have to you have
to tell pi games display like hey we're
about to throw some Gaea
opengl at you it's no different than
really with matplotlib for example if
you want to do a 3d graph you have to
notify it in advance like oh by the way
this is going to be 3d because there's a
lot of different things that have to
happen for that so the next thing that
we do once we do that we set up our
basically like our perspective and
that's exactly what it's called so it is
Glu perspective and Glu perspective
takes a few parameters but generally I
think the best way to kind of visualize
this is to literally visualize it to
understand how this stuff works
but basically first you have field of
view so how many degrees is your field
of view so we're just gonna say we have
45 point 0 degrees field of view then
you have your aspects so this is like
your aspect ratio so in our case it
would be 800/600 it's just it's just
basically your display so it's your
width divided by your height so for us
our aspect ratio will always be display
zero divided by display one then then
you have these like clipping distances
and these are like your closest clipping
plane and your furthest clipping plane
so that's the distance from the original
camera basically or the view
are these two planes you it must be a
positive but what a lot of people will
do is like 0.1 or something like that so
it's like really really close but you
can also just do one and then the
further this one will say fifty point
zero and that's like the farthest away
again just like kind of the field of
view and all this aspect ratio we're not
gonna mess with that but these this
number and then these numbers here it
really becomes more apparent what they
do exactly once we're like we can view
everything and we can see what we mean
so like if you're not familiar with
OpenGL which I assume many many might
not be here you have no idea what the
heck is a clipping plane so so we'll be
talking about that but it's exactly what
it sounds it's a plane and it clips
stuff so anyway that's that so so this
is our like perspective of the cube
basically that sets that up but then
we've got some other things we have to
throw in here so that's what we'll be
doing in the next video so anyway
hopefully you guys are enjoying stay
tuned to the next video and thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
