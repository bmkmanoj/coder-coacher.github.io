Effects cs6 tutorial my name is buddy
blackfur and i'm going to be teaching
you about an effect called key light
that we can use to key out our green
screen footage or blue screen footage or
whatever you have and this is probably
the best native plug-in that After
Effects has for dealing with keying and
so I feel like almost all the time you
should go with this first I like to show
I have showed you all the other ones
before well most of them the ones that I
thought were important and I think this
one I saved the best for last obviously
so let's uh I'll show you like right now
you can see how nice the key turned out
to be and literally this took me about
one minute so I'm gonna show you how to
do it real quick and it's gonna be
awesome so I'm gonna delete this out now
make sure you have a garbage matte
around your your object here and you use
a garbage matte to make it so you don't
have to worry about all the other crap
that's around your object in the key so
we don't have to worry about keying out
all this other stuff that I use the
garbage matte on when you create your
garbage matte you want to make sure that
it encompasses everything and your
object that you want to use never goes
out out from it so let's start right now
by putting on our effect so effect king
key light and this one is called key
light 1.2 and this is the one that comes
with cs6 so you've got your view here
I'm not gonna go over everything but I
am going to just basically show you how
to use basic keying because there's a
lot of extra stuff in here that we could
go over all the details and it would
take me forever so I'll just stick with
a basic tutorial first and then a
point in time when we go over some more
advanced stuff I'll go there so the
first thing we want to do is use this
screen color here and you can see that
the color has au in it
and so this must be made in Europe
somewhere so or maybe another country
that uses the U in their words but just
I don't know why I said that doesn't
matter really but I just thought it's
cool let's use the eyedropper here and
let's pick a spot that's like right next
right near the actual gun or the hand or
whatever I'll just pick that and right
now we can see that we already didn't
have a pretty decent key already pulled
it's almost done if you look closely you
can still see folds and I like a little
bit of blue or something like that and
down here in the bottom and we've got a
little outer outside edge here so what
we need to do is we can increase try
increasing this green gain to get rid of
some of that stuff when I increase the
screen gain if I check out the Alpha I
don't that's not what I want we want to
check out our alpha down here that's not
what we want either
we're on source we want final result
that's what I want now I want to check
out the Alpha so we can check out the
Alpha and see it's a little messed up
and we can see that there's still some
crap here that we need to get it rid of
so the screen gain didn't get everything
but it gets us closer to what we want to
get to the next thing we want to come
down to is the screen mat and bring that
down we're going to mess with the clip
black and clip white and I like to be in
the alpha beyou when I'm looking at this
as long as I have a pretty good key
already made so let's go into alpha and
we're gonna mess with this clip black to
get rid of all this bullcrap down here
that's pretty good what's going to our
RGB and see what it looks like and I
don't see any of that other stuff around
so now we're gonna go into our RGB or
alpha again and we can see that all this
stuff is in the way our alpha isn't nice
and white it's gray and will be
semi-transparent so if I put on my
transparency here oh that's too close
you can see like the edges are
transparent and things like that we
don't want that at the hand you can see
it's transparent we don't want that we
want it to be solid so let's go back to
our alpha now let's mess with this clip
white and bring that down this will make
our alpha a lot more solid there we go
that looks nice let's check our RGB and
we've got that nice looking we got a
nice looking key it's probably the best
key that we have used I want to show you
this unpromoted result I'm gonna uncheck
that and you can see how that affects if
you look like I see it mostly affecting
right here in this area so let's check
the now unpretty multiply if you uncheck
it then it gives you like more of like
kind of like an edge like color like at
the edges so that's what that does there
so that's the quick way to use key light
it's so easy to get a nice key out of
and it's pretty cool so thanks for
watching this one hopefully you guys use
this one first
so see you guys later have a good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
