Blackford here with another amazing
Photoshop cs6 tutorial and right now is
the time that the steam summer sale is
going on which is basically a big
computer game sale that happens every
like once a season pretty much and they
have like video games off like 80% and
stuff like that it's really awesome so I
picked up a couple video games I picked
up papers please
terraria payday 2 paid high stood to get
the South Park video game but and the
discount wasn't like enough for me it
was only 33% and I'm just going to wait
until it loads lowers in price because I
have so many other games to play I have
a hundred and forty five games installed
Oh
147 I mean so Jesus it's getting a
little ridiculous but whatever it's
funny anyways we're going to go over
working on with the this info panel here
and a couple different things that we
can do within this info panel so the way
you can open up the info panel is by
clicking on this I button right here
where it says info and just clicking on
the info tab we've got RGB color
information CMYK color information we've
got X&amp;amp;Y coordinates we got width and
height and then we've got a color marker
data and I'll go over what those are
later so let's uh go over here to the
left and click and hold on this and come
down to like a custom shape tool or
something like that you can already do a
rectangle or anything I'm going to go to
a custom shape tool and I came up here
to where it says shape click on there
and then you can pick whatever shape
that you want and then let's click on
our canvas here or our picture and drag
and notice to the right there is a width
in a height box that shows up that's a
that's new which new in cs6
so that
pretty neat but over in your info panel
if you look you can
it shows the width in the height of what
you're making it's also got the X&amp;amp;Y
coordinates where your cursor is at and
that's pretty much it for this if you
hold shift it will constrain the
proportions of your custom shape that
you're creating so this way you can have
the proper width and height of whatever
you want to make so I'm going to release
it and then I get that so I just wanted
to show you about the width and height
and everything like that
first now I'm going to come down to my
eyedropper tool which is right here
click on it make sure your eyedropper
tool and not the color sampler tool
click on eyedropper tool and now when
I'm going across some of this color some
of the colors on here you can see in the
info panel that is changing so at this
particular section right here on this
basket the it has an RGB of 157 73 and 1
and then set 2777 121 on the cmk Y and
sometimes they have exclamation points
and sometimes I have percentages on the
CMYK colors it also shows the X&amp;amp;Y
XS and the width and height doesn't
change because because we aren't
dragging anything out so if I hold shift
down it comes to the color sampler here
and you can see that this text down here
changes to click image to place new
color sampler and I already have one
down here out that's red I'll place
another one on this like silver now I'll
place it right here on this heart I
guess now that I'll put it on the silver
belt so right there you can see the
silver belt and what this does now is it
always is going to sample the color from
that point
here on a number 260 315 and 3 so you'll
always know that this point is 63 15 and
3 even if you apply color correction
effects to it this is a good because
knowing the different RGB values when
you're color correcting is pretty
essential so I'm going to show you real
quick what happens when you try to color
correct and you guys can come up to
image adjustments and we're just gonna
let me click on my image down here and
image adjustments and hue/saturation and
all I'm going to do is lower the
saturation down now then I brought up
the hue saturation we can see that the
the color markers here have a little
slash next to them so the left is going
to be what it was originally and then
when I lower the saturation down on this
a little the right is going to be what
it is now so that's what the color
samplers do so that's very helpful when
you're trying to color correct and
things like that so that's good for that
so we can see how that the info panel
helps you create a specifically sized
object using the width and height or you
can check out the different color
information within the photo now the
info panel has a options menu here and
if I click on panel options we get a
couple different pretty much a couple
different options I guess as what I
guess I should call them so here's where
we can change the different color modes
that we're seeing
so our first readout is actual color
which is going to be RGB and then our
second readout we can change that maybe
to grayscale if we wanted to and that
goes by Kay
and then if I start going over top here
this is the percent of the grayscale
that we got so it's good to know what
you want to have in your info panel and
I'm going to change this back to CMYK
it's for anything I'm not I only really
need RGB if I'm working in just like web
or TV and then I'll use the CMYK if I'm
actually going to like print this
picture out professionally you can
change your coordinates here to pixels
inches whatever you feel like using and
then you've got some extra information
that you can add to the info panel like
current tool and all that stuff so we'll
do that we'll hit OK and now it tells me
that my current tool is the eyedropper
if I go here it'll be text or the type
tool so that's the different stuff that
you can do with the info panel use that
to your advantage while you're using
Photoshop to I don't know get like a
pretty good head on what you're doing
and knowing really what you're working
with
so that's what the info panel is good
for pretty much a lot of mostly about
colors and stuff like that so thanks for
watching this video and I'll see you
guys in the next tutorial it's going to
be awesome
see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
