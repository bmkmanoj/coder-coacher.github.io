going to cancel this cuz I've already
got it installed so once it is
downloaded what you want to do is you
want to run through the installation
process hopefully you won't get any
errors if you do get any errors go onto
xampp and see if you can find any
support follow the instructions for
installation and once you've installed
we're going to get to the point that I'm
going to talk to you now in the video so
we're if you'd like to pause the video
or or close whatever
install xampp and we're going to go
ahead and test everything okay so
hopefully now you have xampp installed I
haven't talked to you about what we're
going to do next but what we're actually
going to do is we're going to open up
something called the xampp control panel
application now what all the xampp
control panel now what this is is it's a
control panel for your services that are
included with xampp I'm not sure what
version of xampp I'm running at the
moment there is a slightly older version
so depending on when you've completed
the installation this video was recorded
2011 so depending on when you're viewing
this video your control panel may look a
bit different but nevertheless control
panel is available from your programs
menu within windows so open this up and
what you want to do is you want to make
sure Apache and MySQL are running for
most cases you're going to be using what
all cases you're going to be using
Apache but for some tutorials and for
database usage you're going to be using
MySQL so make sure these two running if
they're not running they'll look
something like this
yeah okay oops I think I look like
something like that and to start them
you're just kind of simply click start
and vice versa if you need to stop them
for any reason just click stop so now
that they're both running we see here
Apache started port 80 and MySQL started
port 3306 now to access Apache and the
files that you're going to be creating
in PHP this is pretty simple with MySQL
you're going to be using a web
application called phpMyAdmin admin and
this is bundled with xampp now PHP while
MySQL for a starter is a database system
you may have heard of it if you haven't
already heard of it go to google read up
about it see what it's about you don't
need to download it because obviously
what we can see here is bundled with
xampp already so the first thing we want
to do is we want to test if our web
server is active now you're not going to
be typing any domains in here or
anything else what we're going to be
doing is we're going to be typing a
localhost okay so it's just it's just
simply localhost a free press Enter
hopefully you'll get this screen up so
if you have got this screen up then it's
got a little congratulations message
you've successfully installed xampp on
this server on this system so this will
mean that xampp is installed now you can
also access it using one to seven or not
dot one it's entirely up to you but I
prefer local host personally and that's
what I'm going to be using throughout my
tutorials now you see at the side here
you've got things like status security
the documentation PHP dot PHP info
function which is going to give you
information about your PHP installation
I do have a tutorial separate on this so
go ahead and watch that if you want to
learn more you've also got some demos
here which we're not going to really be
discussing so now we've got X I'm
successfully installed we want to start
running our own file so we want to start
running creating a PHP file and and
running this file so we're going to deal
with that in the next part of the
tutorial this one's just about
installing xampp now we all we need to
now have a look at PHP myadmin and what
PHP myadmin is
is the administration of your database
there are tutorials that will take you
through this so you just need to know
that you can access it via this link
down here and you can see that the
address is one to seven or not or not
one forward slash PHP myadmin or as we
looked at before localhost forward slash
PHP myadmin
okay so that works as well so hopefully
now you've got xampp up and running the
next tutorial on the series is going to
talk you through how to create your file
and where we're going to find the place
to put our file to make it accessible
through our now local web server so
we're going to be looking at creating a
file in the next tutorial and displaying
it with the localhost address</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
