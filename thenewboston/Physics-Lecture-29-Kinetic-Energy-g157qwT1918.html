29th video in this video I want to talk
to you guys about a different more
interesting type of energy that is
kinetic energy but first let's go ahead
and recap in the last video we're in the
last couple probably I said that
potential energy was basically stored
energy that energy stored in objects
when they aren't moving such as in case
when the Apple was hanging from the tree
that was just sitting there doing
nothing but it had the potential to make
some energy so again potential energy is
stored in objects not moving so what
would we call the energy in objects that
are indeed moving well scientists
thought it was a good idea to call this
kinetic energy so why did I say earlier
that that kinetic energy is more
interesting well I just think moving
things are more interesting than things
that are standing still you know nothing
wrong with that so kinetic energy is
dependent on two things
unlike potential energy where we need to
calculate the weight in the height
kinetic energy depends on the mass of an
object and also the velocity of an
object so more massive objects traveling
at a higher velocity or a higher rate of
speed are going to have a greater
kinetic energy so let me give you guys
the easy example if something had a mass
of like a car that's very massive and if
a car was traveling down the highway
very fast that would cause it to have
high kinetic energy however something
with a very low mass such as a feather
if it was fluttering to the ground very
slow
softly a moving feather would have very
low kinetic energy so huge massive
things going fast have high kinetic
energy simple enough
now what scientists did and physicists
is they said you know what
since kinetic energy has is pretty much
dependent on different things than
potential energy we probably need to use
a new formula so the formula that they
can make up with for Canet
energy is this 1/2 times the mass of the
object times its velocity how fast is it
going squared so let's go ahead and take
a look at an example say that I don't
know what can my example be a due to
running across the street or something
so the first thing we do is we take 1/2
because that's the constant we always
need that after that you multiply it by
the mass of an object now the mass of me
is per is probably 60 kilograms or
somewhere around that now say that I was
traveling at a rate of 23 meters per
second well in order to calculate my
kinetic energy first
make sure you square the last number and
I'm just going to go ahead and throw out
my units because units are kind of messy
to work with 1/2 times 60 times 23
squared now I'm not going to treat you
guys like idiots I know that you know
how to square this number and multiply
already so I'm just going to jump to the
answer if you want to you know figure
this out all out on a calculator or in
your brain you can but the answer to
this is 15,000 870 if I can write it
joules
now again like I said just like
potential energy kinetic energy is also
measured in joules however a cool thing
since we're working with big numbers and
in science you can also write it like
this fifteen point eight seven
kilojoules that's supposed to be a lower
lower case k kilojoules whatever your
way you want is just two different
variations of writing the same number so
that's basically the heart of this
tutorial kinetic energy equals moving
energy potential energy equals energy
stored in objects when they aren't
moving at all so in the next story we're
going to talk about the law of
conservation of energy which is one of
the coolest and most interesting topics
I say that a lot but this one really is
so thank you guys for watching and we
going to subscribe and I'll see you guys
in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
