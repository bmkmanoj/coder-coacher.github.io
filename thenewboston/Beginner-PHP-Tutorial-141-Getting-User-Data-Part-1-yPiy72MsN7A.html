and this is a video tutorial for the new
boston now we've already established how
to log a user in depending on database
values such as Alex or Billy both here
now when we do login let's go ahead and
log me in you'll see that we have you're
logged in log out that's absolutely fine
now the one thing that we're missing -
you know round off our website once
users logged in is we're not displaying
specific information about the user that
is logged in you already know that the
users ID which is unique to each user is
stored in a session here so at the
moment this value here this session will
be equal to one because I've logged in
as Alex so the idea has been set to one
now inside corridor Inc dot PHP which
remember we set up to be included in
every file we want to create a function
to be able to grab any field from our
database here depending on the ID so
this is going to shorten the amount of
code we do inside our our our actual
fight our files ourself so inside this
cording dot PHP we're going to create a
function which we can use however many
times we want and also it will save a
lot of resources as well so it won't
slow down your server as much and won't
perform as many queries so where do we
start we need to outline the skeleton
skeleton of our function so I'm going to
call this get field okay so what
arguments is this function going to take
so get field the first important bit of
information we need is the ID the user's
ID the second we need is the field name
so I'm just going to call this field
okay so we need the user ID the supplied
user ID and we need the field in fact
looking at this we don't actually need
the user ID
already stored isn't it okay so we don't
need the user ID we just need the field
name this is going to grab the
corresponding data from the field
specified from this users table so the
first thing we need to do is make is
create a variable up here which is going
to hold the value
fadna we don't need to do that I'm just
making it longer for myself
so I'm going to write global dollar
underscore session user ID now the
reason I've done this is and I have a
tutorial on why you need to do this and
in fact maybe I don't think we even need
to do that do it okay so let's echo this
out and we'll see if this works so echo
out basically the session the users ID
so we'll come to index dot PHP you're
logged in so let's create a line break
there and down here we'll let's run the
function get field okay so let's go back
to our page and we'll see what we come
up with okay yeah so we echo one now
this get field we're aiming by the end
of this tutorial
to display the users name okay from in
after this logged in so we're going to
say you're logged in Alex Garret
obviously not everyone is called an X
camera tweet so we need to use this get
field and function to make this work
well so the first thing we need to do is
we need to perform a query so the query
equals and select now we need to specify
the field
so that's field and that's encased in
apostrophes from users
we're and this is the important part ID
equals so let's just a pasta please buy
all this we're ID is equal to dollar and
the score session and that is user ID
let's just them concatenate this on so
it looks a bit tidier
okay so select the field that we specify
in here from users where the ID is equal
to something okay so this is get a guest
get user field we can call this because
it's only selecting from the table users
so get user field and we specify a field
in here then what we need to do is we
need to execute the query so query run
is equal to MySQL query query and we
need to encase this in an if statement
to ensure that we only execute this
block here if this query is successful
so if the we're basically saying in
plain English if this query is
successful then what we need to do is we
need to grab this data so we're going to
return and what we're going to return is
my SQL result and the result is from the
query run the row 0 because we remember
we're only returning one row and because
there's only ever going to be one ID and
the field we can pop again in here so
field let's just get rid of them single
quotation mark so field</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
