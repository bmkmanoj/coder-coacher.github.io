tutorial that I'm making before the new
Boston and in this tutorial I may be
showing you I'm use the binary writer
class so all your need for this tutorial
is two buttons an open button and a
right button once your goes on your form
just double click on the right button
all right so we're under the open button
we're just going on I have this code
right here and I've already showed you
this before and taught you what it is so
just go back and watch my previous
tutorial if you don't know what this is
and you're also going to need to be
using the system dot IO namespace
because the binary writer class is in
the system dot IO namespace so now we
can create a new instance of a binary
writer so I just want to do a binary
writer and then give a name to your
binary writer I'm just going to call it
DW and we can now set it equal to a new
binary right and this just like all the
other things that deal with reading and
writing call for a stream so it's going
to file the open right because we're
going to be writing in this file and
we're just going to use this string path
that we've already created all right so
now we have our binary writer for leave
it and we can begin writing so in order
to write you just kinda want to do
binary writer dot right to use the write
method and this is overloaded many times
so there are many different things there
are many different value types that you
can write into or write we're just
looking at writing a character first so
we're just going to do C write C
character and it will default you right
at 0 because we haven't specified a
position yet and we're just gonna want
to make sure we dispose of this binary
reader or binary writer because we don't
want to get any errors saying like this
file is already being used by the
process so now when we debug and click
write
now the first character in the Spile arm
should be see so if we just go back into
hxd here yep we see we have see right
there and if we were to change this is
something else like open our file right
you should now see H as the first
character yep it's now changed H so
there are many different things you can
write in here for example if you wanted
to write an int we could do that or a
short we could do that so we're going to
look at writing a short so just like
before just like when it reads it it
will write it in the wrong direction
so we were to put just put one here just
write the value one well instead of just
putting instead of putting a zero one
right there it's going to put on zero
one and then I'm going to put 0 1 and
then 0 0 because it writes just like it
reads from the right to left so in order
to do that we're going to have to
reverse it so in order to do that we're
just going to first have to create a new
fight array call it buffer and set it
equal to 1 well we're going to have to
use the fist converter to convert this
one right here into a byte array so
we're going to do get bytes and first
let's create a short and let's call it
my short and we'll study equal to 1 that
is the value that you want to write and
then we're just going to get the bytes
from our short so now this buffer right
here will contain just 0 and then 1 well
we're gonna have to flip it so that it
will write it in a correct direction so
we're just going to do
a verse now we're going to reverse the
buffer array right here and then we're
going to go ahead and write this buffer
so now what it does is it basically has
a byte array right here it uses this bit
converter and it gets the bytes or
converts this short right here into a
byte array and then since the contents
of this byte array will be 0 0 and then
0 1 at a different element and then what
if this reverse method will do is it
will reverse the array so the first
element is now 0 1 and then the next
element is 0 0 so sense it writes from
the right to the left or right 0 1 and
then 0 0 which is exactly what we want
it to do so now I'm going to bug here
look open open our text file and click
write you should get the correct value
yep we see 0 0 0 1 which is exactly what
we wanted to do and just like reading it
you can have it right and integer if we
wanted to want to write some crazy value
like I don't know that then we'll have
to do that and this just means it's
hexadecimal so now you should see those
values right there should see 2 3 and
then 4 5 as two separate bytes the up Q
3 and 4 5 and it's this long or it's 4
bytes long because that it is it is an
integer and integers are 32 bits long or
4 bytes long however you want to look at
it so that's pretty much it for this
tutorial on the binary writer so see you
