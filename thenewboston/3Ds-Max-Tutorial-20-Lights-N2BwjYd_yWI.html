3ds max tutorial so this tutorial is
going to be on lights and what lights
are are pretty much just like you would
think they are and they actually work a
lot of uh they're pretty similar to
cameras so if you know how to work with
the camera you know how to work with the
light for the most part but I'm going to
go over the different types of lights
the basics it's just going to be real
quick overview we're not going to get
into anything
- deeper complicated for now so the
first thing we're going to want to do is
create a plane because we need something
for our light to shine on so go ahead
and click plane and drag in your front
view right there and then you get a nice
little wall for your light shine on so
in order to create a light what you need
to do is in your create panel go over
here to this tab and this is lights and
the first thing that you're going to see
is you have a couple of different
options first from this drop-down list
you have photometric and standard what
you want to do is go to standard
standard is pretty much just like the
basic lights photometric we're not going
to be messing with them this tutorial
but whenever you create a photometric
light it's going to give you a bunch of
parameters based on real um measurements
that you would like actually base a real
light bulb on so if you're just going to
be working with computerized lights
we're going to be working with standard
now aside from that photometric and
standard we also have all these options
Target spot Target direct Omni skylight
the only two I'm going to tell you about
for now or our Omni and spotlights those
are two easiest in by far the two most
common Omni lights right here these are
like light bulbs so if you put an omni
light in your scene or animation it's
going to light up everything like a
light bulb in every single direction if
you make a spot light what we're going
to be doing in this tutorial it only
lights a certain part of your image or
animation object whatever you want to
call it so if we want to only shine
on a certain object we need a spotlight
so again Omni is like a light bulb Spa
is just like a spotlight like you would
see I don't know when the spotlights
anymore talent shows high school talent
shows maybe I don't know but we're about
to find out so go ahead and click on
target spot and in order to create one
go to your top view and your plane is
right here just click and drag somewhere
right here now as you can see already
that we have a little light on our
screen right here and this pretty much
resembles a camera like we did before we
have our main light source right here
which is a spotlight and our target is a
square box and we can move either these
around using the basic selection tools
so we can move this main camera around
we can also move this target around so
put your target somewhere close to the
screen it doesn't really matter where
and now go in your perspective view so
we can view all these parameters so zoom
out a little bit actually why not zoom
in zoom out zoom in a zoom somehow so in
order to change the light parameters
what you need to do actually let's go
ahead and render this just because you
guys wanted to see it real quick so that
is our spotlight on the screen right
here so we took a light shined on the
screen it created a circle for now so
now anytime we want to mess with these
parameters what we need to do is select
our light and then go in our modify tab
and we can see that all of these lights
have parameters right here so the most
basic parameters are in the general
parameters right here from here you can
turn your light on off you can also
change it real quick to a spotlight or
omni light and look at this purpose you
click that and Omni light pretty much
the lights up everything so that is your
real quick tutorial domine light thud
but let's change that back the spot
because we're going to be going over
spot in this tutorial the targeted if
you check this on and off it takes away
your target or puts it back and this
little number next to target let's go
ahead and leave that target on this
little number next to target is
I lost my light it is the distance that
the camera is away from the target so if
you decrease that then your target right
here is going to move closer to your
camera right here so let's do that and
we'll decrease it so our target now
moves closer to our camera so we want it
right about there and now we can click
it back on so we can see our target so
aside from that we see this one button
exclude any time we want to use this
exclude button go ahead and click that
and this brings up a little dialog and
what this allows you to do if you want
to exclude or include only a certain
amount or certain objects in your
animation this is how you can do it so
we only have one object right here and
we want to include it so we're not going
to mess with it but if we want to
exclude it
what we'd have to do is put it over here
and anything in this box would not be
illuminated or not be lit up but don't
mess with that most of the time so those
are the general parameters now let's
move on to something a little more
interesting this intensity and color
attenuation this multiplier right here
is multiplies the lights intensity so
for example if we put it to 2 or
somewhere around 2 then when we rendered
it out the light would be 2 times as
bright as before so that's what the
multiplier does so aside from that you
also have let's bring that multiplier
down a little bit good enough you also
have this little white box right here
this is actually a color swatch what
this does is change the lights color so
if we double click that and we change
the light to red or something dark red
let's line that up a little bit it's a
bit a to red for my taste and now we go
ahead and render this out now our light
has changed from I don't even remember
what it was before yellow or something
now it's red so now we got a red light
now we got a red light now we got a red
light and anyways moving on aside for my
song well attenuation I'm not going to
mess with it from this story because I
hate messing with it but I'm going to
tell you what it is attenuation is how
light fades over a distance so if you
want to make your light fade over a
distance
messer the attenuation but you know what
I don't want it so I'm not going to mess
with it and aside from these I'm going
to go over one more of the main ones and
that's spotlight parameters the only two
things you need to know here are really
hot spot which is if you see let me
scroll right here you see that there are
actually two circles right here the hot
spot is pretty much the brightest spot
in the middle and the fall-off is how it
fades on its edges so let me click this
and a render it and you can see well you
can't really see the hot spot because
it's so bright in the middle but maybe
if I do this maybe if I brought my
fall-off way out and then from my hot
spot in a little bit and select the
right scene and still can't see it that
good but my light must be too intense or
something but the hot spot is where it's
the brightest and the fall-off is pretty
much the fading part or the gradient
part so once you mess with it a little
bit you'll figure it out but for now
those are real quick basics on how to do
that so if you wanna like expand your
layover distance or concentrate it on a
certain point then you're going to mess
with hot spots and fall-off and all that
good stuff but for now that is that for
the light tutorial again we don't really
need to go over all these is pretty some
advanced stuff that we don't use all
that often and I really want to get into
animation which I'm going to be going
over next tutorial so you know what I
don't have time for lights so thank you
guys for watching make sure to check out
my next tutorial and don't forget to
subscribe so thank you and I'll see you
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
