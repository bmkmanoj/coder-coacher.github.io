Android tutorial for the new Boston my
name is Travis and before we get started
well actually what we're going to do in
this tutorial is set up the Java JDK the
Java developer kit basically is what
that stands for and before we get into
that I just want to give you guys kind
of a little background of who I am how
Bucky contacted me and all that stuff my
name is Travis like I said I had a
youtube channel called corn boys Android
and then it caught on pretty quickly
there's got a few subscribers and all
that great stuff so I started a new
youtube series under my new new username
my bring back and basically made those
tutorials the same but better quality
and better audio and all that good stuff
so anyways one day I'm chilling on my
computer and I get this email from Bucky
and he's like hey man I really want to
you know teach Android but I just have
too much time I don't have enough time
basically and as warned if you could set
up a series for me for my channel the
new Boston I'm like yeah I could
probably do that I'm pretty busy he's
like if you don't I'm gonna kill your
family and I'm like whoa Bucky you'll
have to be so mean geez man no just
kidding Bucky's awesome and I love what
he's doing given free education online
and I basically do the same thing with
my channel not as well don't have as
many tutorials as Bucky so basically
that's how I got contacted um just
contacted me through YouTube so let's
get into it let's set up the Java JDK so
I want you guys going to google and type
Java JDK hit enter it'll be the first
link from Oracle comm website hit this
Java SE downloads and then then it will
open up a page like this where you have
three options either the standard Java
JDK the Java JDK + NetBeans and the Java
JDK + Java EE now we aren't going to
really worry about the Java EE or
NetBeans because we're going to be using
Eclipse so we don't really need a
platform to develop within because we're
gonna set that up in the next tutorial
so we're just going to use this standard
Java JDK
you want to click that and accept the
License Agreement again you guys if you
if you want to read this License
Agreement go ahead it's a good read it's
kind of like the Twilight series you
know there's there's happy moments or
sad moments and you just get hooked to
this Agreement license so if you guys
have some free time check that out and
then all you're going to do is basically
decide which JDK you want and if you're
running on Linux you're going to choose
one of these Solaris and Windows so
basically just click your Windows one
most likely that's what you guys are
developing for and if you guys are on
Mac like I am you won't actually have to
download the Java JDK because the
basically Apple updates that for you
automatically and you won't have to
worry about it but so you can basically
skip this tutorial if you guys are
running on Mac now just like any other
time you download something you put it
in your downloads folder or wherever you
guys want to save it and hit OK
and it will download for you but the
problem comes or the difficult part of
the JDK is setting it up now I know
Bucky has a video and his Android
development or his Android series that
he's going to start himself and that'll
kind of walk you guys through how to do
it if you guys are on Windows but if not
I want to show you guys another place
you can go to get that set up properly
it's just my website my bring back comm
and then go into the tutorial series
right here and under the Java
programming I know we're doing Android
but it's under the Java programming the
basics just click that and it'll be the
first tutorial or the first little link
up here calling are called setting up
the JDK on your computer it kind of
gives you just a walkthrough of how to
do that I know this tutorial is pretty
lame because I can't actually walk you
guys through it because again I'm on a
Mac so I won't be able to install the
software and follow these instructions
but hopefully you guys can understand
everything I kind of broke it down into
bulletin points that are pretty simple
for the most part if you guys still need
some help just leave a comment on this
Paige and I'll check it out and I'll get
back to you but otherwise just follow
along and it'll get set up for you so
thanks again for watching guys I know
this is the boring stuff installing the
software we're going to need to develop
for Android but soon enough we'll get
into the fun stuff making applications
and all that great stuff so I'll see you
guys in the next tutorial again thanks
for watching have a good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
