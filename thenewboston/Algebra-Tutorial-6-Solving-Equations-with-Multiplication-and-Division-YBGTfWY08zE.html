solving equations using multiplication
and division so just like with addition
and subtraction in order to undo what's
been done to your variable you have to
do the opposite so here we have 2x
equals 12 so since 2 is being multiplied
by X the only way to undo it and get X
by itself is to write 2 divide both
sides by 2 because this will cancel and
you get X is equal to 6 now when you're
being multiplied by a fraction
you're gonna multiply by the reciprocal
of the fraction so when we multiply by
the reciprocal which is just the
fraction flipped we're gonna get 4 to
cancel out with 4 3 to cancel out with 3
this is negative to become positive and
all we're gonna be left with is y equals
and we have to multiply by the
reciprocal on this side too and look you
can reduce by threes 5 times negative 4
negative 20 so now we're gonna do some
examples okay so here we're taking
negative 7 and multiplying it by y so in
order to undo it we're gonna divide by 7
excuse me negative 7 divided by negative
7 and we get Y this because remember a
negative divided by a negative gives us
a positive a positive divided by a
negative is gonna give us a negative
that's gonna be negative 4 so over here
you might think that we've already
solved this equation but whenever you
have a negative out front you want to
pretend that it's that it's actually
written like this
negative 1x equals 17 so you still have
to divide by that negative 1 to get X is
equal to negative 17 so down here we
have two fractions and I'm I think the
easiest way to solve this is to cross
multiply but I'm going to show that show
you the other way you could solve this
as well so we're gonna cross multiply
and we're gonna get 3y is equal to
negative 12 and we're gonna divide both
sides by 3 and get y is equal to
negative 4 so the other way we could
have done it is taking the reciprocal of
6 or 1/6 which is 6 multiplied it by
both sides and we would have gotten Y is
equal to this and we could divide we
could reduce by threes and negative 2
times 2 is negative 4 so either way you
can do it but i'm i think cross
multiplying is easier just because you
already know how to do that so we have 8
over 5 is equal to negative 6 in order
to undo this divided by 5 we're gonna
multiply by 5 over 1 this cancels we get
left with ay is equal to negative 6
times 5 over 1 which is negative 30 so
that's all we're gonna do with
multiplication and division today but
make sure you come back we're we're
gonna take what we learned today and
then the lesson before and use it to
solve combined equations which just
means that they have multiplication
addition and subtraction and division
all in one equation so make sure you
come back and watch that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
