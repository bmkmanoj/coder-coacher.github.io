see 25th tutorial in PHP and in the last
tutorial we open the connection to the
server but now we're connected and we
got nothing to do so what do we want to
do we want to select a database so let's
go ahead and add a comment called oops
select database so it will just be
easier to tell we know that this is our
code to connect to the server and now we
want to select what database we want to
use once we're connected so let's make a
variable I'm going to call this database
database selected for the just for ease
of use set it equal to and remember
you can name your variable anything you
want just just a stick with that though
it will be a lot easier but this next
thing I'm going to type you need to
write it exactly as I do since it's
built in PHP code it's called my SQL
underscore select underscore DB you know
what this does is the built in PHP code
to have MySQL select a database and
you're going to have two parameters in
here the first parameter that you want
is the database itself so my database
was called the new bow for the new
Boston underscore game and quotation
marks
what the
all right for some reason my keyboard
isn't letting me oh there we go my mouse
was in the way that's embarrassing
alright so and the quotation marks and
the next parameter we want to have in
here is our variable to connect to the
MySQL server so how easy is this just
add DBC and remember this is built in
PHP code just to connect your database
and it only takes two parameters the
first one is what database you want to
connect to and now that you told it to
it's going to say all right give me the
information give me your password if you
want to connect to it and that we
already stored right in here so how easy
is that this is all we need to connect
to our database so let's go ahead and on
the next line let's just make a simple
statement about a very useful statement
to say our a if for some reason this
variable can't connect and remember the
little explanation point means not or
opposite all right so it's saying all
right if you can't connect then what do
we want you to do we want you to send us
error
so let's go ahead and write first of all
we want you to die which means end the
code I know it sounds harsh but you know
that's how they made it first of all we
want you to die and we also want you to
send us the message can't connect
and then after that we want add a period
and that means a it's like a plus sign
in JavaScript just add my SQL error and
this MySQL error you need to type it
this is another built-in code that comes
right with a PHP that if there are any
MySQL errors then it's going to output
it on the screen for you so actually
this if statement and this if statement
right here these two hopefully we have
to never use them at all so hopefully we
don't get any errors what these do only
if these variables aren't working for
some reason they're going to tell us
what the error is so if you want to
leave these out for now that's fine but
if something goes around you're never
going to know it so I highly suggest
putting them in so now to overview real
quick let's save this we made a variable
that connects us to the database pretty
much this is just all of our information
and we're going to say all right if you
can't do this then end the code because
there's no sense of running it and tell
us what the problem is and this down
here this is our money maker right here
we say all right connect to the database
this one right here and then it says all
right I'm not going to let you in until
you tell me the password in your
username and we says oh we already got
it right there but if you can't do that
for some reason then die and the code
and tell us what the error is so here's
all the code one more time make sure you
have this type exactly as I do but use
you're saying use your username and
password and in the next tutorial we're
going to be making a registration script
where users are able to put information
into our database just from typing in
the website so study this I hope you
learned something and I will see you
next tutorial Thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
