with video tutorial for the new Boston
in this video we're going to be taking a
look at the has traversing function in
jQuery and we're going to be searching a
particular element for sub elements or
children of that element and we're going
to be using the unordered list as an
example now I'm going to create an
example that's more perhaps more
relevant and we're going to use this in
an if statement to check if a ul has any
Li elements within it and we're almost
going to be creating it in the theme of
a menu builder so for example we're
going to create a menu one and let's go
ahead to our browser you can see that
we've just got menu one there so we're
going to be creating a menu one and the
menu is going to be made up of UL and li
elements so for example we can have menu
item 1 in here and that would produce
something like this now let's go ahead
and just go ahead let's just go ahead
and style this quickly first of all so
the UL is going to have padding of 0 and
margin of 0 we'll just leave in the well
no it automatically gets rid of the the
circle graphics but there we go so we'll
have a menu like this where we can go
ahead and add more items so for example
menu item 2 but what we want to happen
is we want a default message to appear
if no allies exist within an idle
unordered list so at the moment you just
see nothing but I want a little message
to an appear under here that says there
are no lis and we searched this ul
element for children elements of Li type
so inside the ext double J s let's go
ahead and just set up our document once
it's ready so document dot ready inside
the function to be run when the document
is ready now what we want to do is we
want to use each to loop through each UL
on the page because we might have say
more than one menu so let's go ahead and
use a selector and select UL
then we want to say dot each so inside
here we create we run a function for
each Li or ul element on the page so for
example we could say this dot append a
just as an example you can see that oh
no a hasn't been appended so sorry
that's this like this so you can see
that I has been appended there if we go
ahead and we create another menu so menu
2 you can see that a is again appended
after here so let's just get rid of that
for now we'll you know be showing an
example of it later so let's forget this
line here what we want to do is for each
ul element we want to first of all I'm
going to create a variable called this
selector which is equal to this this
just means that we don't have to keep
using dollar sign and this and then what
I want to do is create my if statement
and my if statement is going to be or
the condition is going to be if an Li
element exists within or if an Li
element doesn't exist within some us ul
parent I want to go ahead and you know
create the message empty menu so I say
this selector dot has and this is where
we're using has now and we can specify a
particular element in here like Li we
can use also use a variety of other
selectors so if you're using if you want
to check has and wants to check
something like contains for example you
can do just any selectors that are
relevant to what you're doing will
should work so we want to say a dot
length which will return a length and if
that is equal to 0 that means that an Li
element doesn't exist within the current
ul but we're on that we're looping
through so we're checking for lis and if
that equals 0 we know that they don't so
we can go ahead and say this cell after
empty menu so now what's going to happen
is because we don't have any elements in
here once we loop through this ul we are
checking if it has any Li we're
returning the length which essentially
will return you know the length of how
many it does have so for example if we
had to it would return length of two in
this case we wouldn't run this line but
if it did equal nothing which it does at
the moment that is equal to nothing and
therefore we return this line so when we
refresh now you see that we've got empty
menu now if we go ahead and actually
create some li elements in here so menu
item one you can see that that will
disappear and we'll have menu item one
instead now I understand that this isn't
really a you know relevant example in
terms of actually a website you might
have because you'd be in control of the
code however if you were creating some
kind of plugin that required li elements
to be within a UL parent you might
actually want to include has to make
sure that you know your plug-in is being
structured properly on the front end so
it's extremely useful in that sense I'll
just go ahead and add another one to
this and create another menu just so you
can see so I'm going to create some
empty ul tags there when i refresh we've
got menu item one which has got menu one
which has got menu item one and menu
item two and menu to which is empty menu
as soon as we then go ahead and add some
more elements to this so Li Li menu item
one you can see that that message again
disappears so it's quite easy or useful
for validation within like I said
plug-in building if you're making
someone you know follow a specific
structure on the front end with regards
to the HTML you might want to use has to
double check this and maybe feed back
some information to the user based on
what the front-end contains so that's
quite a useful way of using it but for
now that's the has function in jQuery</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
