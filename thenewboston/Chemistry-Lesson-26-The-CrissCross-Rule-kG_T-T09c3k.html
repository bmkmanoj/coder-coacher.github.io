amazing chemistry tutorial and in this
tutorial it's kind of a continuation
we're still going to be talking about
ionic bonds but lots of new information
I promise it's going to be super fun so
I'm going to be talking about ionic
compounds in some rules that we have to
remember the first rule is this whenever
we have an ionic bond even though some
of the elements may lose electrons and
other elements may gain electrons the
overall compound has to remain neutral
the entire compound has to have an even
number of protons and electrons still so
say in the last example where we had
sodium now that sodium pretty much lost
an electron so we give it a positive
charge plus one will say now we pretty
much took that electron and we gave it
to chlorine so that chlorine had overall
negative one charge well even though the
sodium lost an electron and this
chlorine lost an electron if we take a
look at the entire compound over Oh
sodium chloride it would not have an
uneven number of protons and electrons
so basically the entire compound still
has an equal number of protons and
electrons so it has overall zero charge
so plus 1 plus minus 1 equals zero
we're good to go so let's go ahead and
take a look at another example of this
in let me go ahead and think of an
element that let's say we have magnesium
now I'll write this down here magnesium
has two valence electrons it has two
electrons that it can give away and be
happy
now bromine which is the chemical symbol
BR it has seven valence electrons so
basically we know that it's looking for
eight bromine is always looking for one
electron so bromine is like okay
magnesium do you got an electron I can
have and magnesium's like yeah I
actually have two of them and he's like
no no no I only want wonderful so what
would happen if you combine a magnesium
in bromine well since the compound must
remain neutral
you just can't write magnet
Museum bromine because then you're gonna
have one extra electron in the magnesium
is not going to be happy so what you
would do is like I said since the
compound must be neutral bromine is
basically gonna take one of these
electrons and then it's going to need an
additional bromine to take the other one
and then with two bro means the
magnesium can give them both way in each
of those bromine atoms is going to be
able to accept one of those electrons
happily so the formula for this compound
would have to be mg br-2 and that's how
you write chemical formulas you're right
how many of each element is basically in
the formula so this would mean you have
to bro means and even though I didn't
write mg 1 whenever you don't write the
1 it's implied so just write mg which
means 1 magnesium in B R 2 which means
to borough means simple enough so let me
go ahead and show you an easier way to
figure this out without me having to
talk you guys through it every time so
this thing is called the criss-cross
rule and it's an easy easy simple way to
figure out the formula of ionic
compounds so say we have the ion
magnesium now remember I told you guys
that magnesium has 2 electrons to give
away so if you write the ion it would be
plus 2 because whenever it gave away
those two electrons it would have 2 more
protons than electrons so it has but
overall plus 2 charge now technically
this is called a cation but we won't get
into that for now I'm probably just
gonna call them ions now bromine on the
other hand it only needs one electron so
whenever it receives that electron it's
gonna have one more electron than
protons so it's gonna have a negative 1
charge or in other words an anion simple
enough follow along so far so here is
how you do the simple crisscross rule
first you write the formula of the ions
which is mg plus 2 BR minus 1
step number two you drop the charges
completely so it doesn't matter if this
is positive or negative or this is
negative or positive you drop them
completely so they're just superscripts
they're just numbers next you go ahead
and you bring the elements down em g/b r
and now you're saying okay so how do I
know which number to write mg8 BR 73 no
no here is where the criss-cross rule
comes into play you take the first
number and bring it down for the second
element subscript so BR 2 now you take
the second superscript and bring it down
to the first elements subscript so mg 1
and remember whenever we have a 1 we
don't write anything because a 1 is just
implied so we have mg be R 2 that is
what you get whenever you combine
magnesium and bromine simple enough so
just remember that whenever you have a 1
you don't write that one at all you just
leave a blank and that's chemists know
whenever you leave something blank that
a 1 is implied so let me go ahead and
without all this crap on my screen I'll
show you guys one more example so let's
say let me think of something good
all right I just thought a bit and
that's embarrassing so say we have some
aluminum now aluminum combined can
combine with chlorine and whenever this
happens the aluminum is going to lose
three electrons so that's why you're
right aluminum plus three it has three
electrons to give away now the chlorine
if you remember from the sodium chloride
tutorial on the last one chlorine only
needs one electron because it has seven
valence electrons already it only needs
one electron to fill its energy level so
whenever it gains an electron we're
gonna go ahead and write minus one
because it has one additional electron
simple enough so now let's go ahead and
do the crisscross rule we go ahead and
bring down element which is Al and also
CL for aluminum and chlorine and now we
criss cross
it so we bring this one down here and we
don't write it well we can go ahead and
write it for right now and we'll go
ahead and bring the 3 down crisscross
them you see that little crisscross
maneuver right there pretty good
am i add CL 3 so we have a l 1c L 3 and
that's the formula for this compound
however if we remember we don't write
the 1 so it's alcl3 and that is the
final formula and basically the basics
behind the criss-cross rule so again to
recap one last time since each chlorine
only needs one electron to complete its
valence energy level well aluminum has
three electrons that it can give away so
you can't just combine a L with CL or
else you're gonna have some more
electrons left over and we don't want
that so basically every time you
combined aluminum and chlorine you need
3 chlorine atoms in one aluminum atom
and that makes everything happy balanced
and neutral so those are the basics
behind ionic bonding ionic compounds in
the criss-cross rule so hopefully with
all my mumbo-jumbo I didn't lose you and
you understand why you need more of an
element sometimes to balance it out and
here's a simple way that you can figure
that out
without doing a lot of brainpower
thinking so anyways thank you guys for
watching don't forget to subscribe don't
forget to add me on Google+ and I will
see you guys in the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
