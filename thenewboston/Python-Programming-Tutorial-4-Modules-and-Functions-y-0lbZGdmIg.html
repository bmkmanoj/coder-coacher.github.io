fourth place on tutorial and in this
tutorial I'm going to talking to you
guys about functions now in the last
tutorial I was throwing around the world
the world what I meant the word function
is quite a bit but in this story I'm
going to actually be telling you what
function is and how to use it a little
better what function is it's pretty much
like a little built-in program that's
built into Python and that allows you to
do kind of complex things without having
to tell the computer every single
instruction of what you're doing so
pretty much like in the last couple
tutorials I told you guys how to use
exponents like 5 star star 4 and this
did 5 to the 4th power gives you 625 but
there is also a function that can do
this for you and it's a little bit
easier so how you use a function is you
first have to write the function name
and then after that you have to write
any parameters that the function needs
and what a parameter is is pretty much
any information that a function would
need to be able to solve a problem so
the function for power is pal and in
your parameters power needs two numbers
the base and the exponent so this would
be 5 comma 4 so once you press ENTER it
gives you the number and this is a
pretty simple one but there are a lot
different or more functions that are
useful and I'm rambling on so let me
give you guys another example just show
you guys something like absolute value
would be really difficult to program if
you didn't have a function and what
absolute value is is it pretty much
takes how many it pretty much takes any
number how much it is away from zero and
I know it's kind of hard to explain but
like negative 18 would be 18 and also
what the heck is at abd
and also something like five that would
be five and I don't mind that I just did
that for fun
but aside from functions there's also
something called modules in a module is
pretty much um extra crap that's built
into Python now this is pretty much
allows you to get a whole list of extra
functions um what they did is this
Python interface and only has so many
functions you can use this is just like
save memory on your computer and stuff
like that but if you want to go ahead
and grab more functions you can import
them for example there's a function
called floor and what this does is take
any number like eighteen point seven and
round it down to eighteen but look at
that whenever I try to use it it gives
me an old error message and we don't
want this this is because we didn't
import the module that allows us to use
the function floor so right now python
is just looking at it in beck for what
the heck you talking about what's that
mean well you don't know what this
function is yet even though it's built
in somewhere we just have to go find it
that's where we use modules so in order
to get a module what you have to do is
import it so go ahead and type import in
the floor function is in the math module
so go ahead and put import math and
press ENTER and once you do it's going
to import the math module and this math
module is going to give you a whole list
of functions that you can use um
relating to math and now you can use the
floor function but you just can't use it
like this floor with your parameters you
have to use a special way and how you do
it is this you have to type the name of
the module first such as math put a
period and then type the function so put
math.floor 18.7 and bam look at that we
now can use the floor function this way
and another function that's in math is
square root so just show you guys that
this is kind of more useful aside from
being for the name for square root is sq
RT get out of here box and let's take
the square root of like 81 or something
now whenever we press Enter BAM we now
have two brand-new functions just
because we imported all of them using
this simple command so what import does
is pretty much expand your options for
functions and that's going to come into
use a lot later on so again if you're
getting error messages when you try to
use a function it's probably because you
didn't import those functions yet and
that's how you do that so again how you
use functions a import type the module
name and then the function name and
that's going to allow you to use them
another very useful thing is you can
also assign those two variables so go
ahead and make a variable name I'm going
to make mine called Bucky and now you
can do something like math dot sq RT
square root press Enter
now instead of typing math dot sq artsy
with your number in here every time all
you have to do is type whatever you put
for the variable and put a number in
there and go ahead and press Enter and
instead of typing math dot square root
you can just type the name of your
variable and then whatever your
parameter and that's that will save you
a bunch of time
so instead again just to reiterate one
more time instead of typing your entire
function all you have to do is put a
variable name assign it to a module then
a function name and then go ahead and
type something like that and this will
be like a built-in function so you don't
have to remember the module name and
function name every time so that is how
you use a variable to assign it to a
function and that's a really useful
method so just I'll play around with
that a little bit and it'll save you a
bunch of time in the long run so that's
your quick tutorial on functions and
modules that's all you need to know for
now so practice this and once you learn
this you're ready to move on the next
tutorial so I'm going to go ahead and
post this and hopefully someone will
write first on the first comment and
hopefully everyone else will yell at
them and give it a thumbs down like
usual so you guys have fun with that and
I'll work on the next tutorial so thanks
for watching and I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
