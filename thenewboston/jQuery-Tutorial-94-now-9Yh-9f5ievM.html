with a video tutorial for the new Boston
in this video we're going to be looking
at the jQuery now utility which is going
to provide us with a timestamp in
milliseconds that represents a time now
we're first of all going to demonstrate
how to do this and then then I'm going
to talk very shortly about why you might
want to do this and also the other
functionality that the time in jQuery
provides such as time between animations
etc so the first thing I want to go
ahead and do is just create a div on my
page that's going to hold this value and
then first of all going to look about
look at returning the static value so
the current value and then I'm going to
set an interval and see this value rise
extremely quickly obviously with the
milliseconds and then you'll see it
progress with the second part of it so
we're just going to call this div time
inside you tilde s which we've included
on our page just here obviously as well
as jQuery we're going to go ahead and
place the time inside of this div so
this is what our browser looks like at
the moment that's just refresh you can
see that there's nothing on the page
obviously we're going to go ahead and
wait for the document to be ready so
when the DOM is fully loaded and inside
of here we want to go ahead and create a
variable with the the current time so
I'm going to create a variable called
time stamp and that's going to be equal
to and this is where the function
functionality of this utility comes in
its jQuery dot No
so it's you would do jQuery dot no and
this will return the timestamp with the
exact milliseconds as well so it's quite
useful guess in a way because we're
looking at a very precise precise
language or precise action based on
different you know things that jQuery
provides like animation these animations
can you know speed up very quickly so
instead of returning a timestamp with
you know as you would normally see in
languages like PHP with just the
chickens at the start we also have
milliseconds because we can use this
with animation so now what I want to go
ahead and do is actually place this into
the time div so I'm going to say time
dot text and then just replace that with
the time stamp so now when we refresh
our page you see we get a time stamp
which slightly longer looking than other
time stamps and you see when we refresh
this the value goes up quite quickly and
I'm going to go ahead and set an
interval on this so you can see this
rise quite quickly well you know more
dynamically so I'm just going to go
ahead and set an interval let's just
bring this down a bit and inside here
obviously we run our callback function
and we'll just go ahead and cut that and
paste it inside this set interval
functionality now the second parameter
is the you know every time you want this
interval to be or the block to be
executed and that's every one
millisecond so now when we refresh you
can see the value should rise notice not
so let's see what we've done wrong oh
yeah there we go because we've we're
just placing the timestamp in there so
let's just go ahead and place that
declaration of that variable inside the
interval and then this will refresh
every one millisecond so when we refresh
you can see that the value rises now you
can see here that this value that my
cursor is over just now is the amount of
seconds whereas these are the
milliseconds the three digits that then
count up to each second because
obviously there are a thousand
milliseconds in a second so you can see
now that we have a representation of
milliseconds and then we've got the
seconds here and then so on so the
reason that we have this jQuery dot now
which we can apply to lots of different
things and lots of different areas this
obviously just returns the timestamp
however you can do things like check how
long it takes for an animation to
complete or you know check the time that
certain process is carried out and this
is important for obviously accuracy so
while we've just been looking at jQuery
now which returns a tie
stamp you can you know use this with
different elements and loading times as
well just to check payer you know times
that things happen like animations or
when elements are loaded into the Dom so
the other use for this would be to pass
this to a another script for example so
let's say you have retrieved the time
that a specific animation or a specific
load time takes place you could then go
ahead and store this inside of a
database table for example let's just
take the scenario that you're loading an
iframe with a page inside so a web page
inside the iframe you could count how
long this takes for that particular page
to load and then store that maybe you
want to tell your users how long the
last page load time of of that of this
page that they're viewing is loaded so
there's a variety of ways we can use
time stamps but for now that's just how
to display a time stamp to the screen
and we've also created an interval so
we've made the representation a bit a
bit more dynamic</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
