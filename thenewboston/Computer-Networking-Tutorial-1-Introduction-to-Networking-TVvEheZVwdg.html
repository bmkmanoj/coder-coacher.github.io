welcome to your first computer
networking tutorial now a bunch of them
you guys asked me to teach you about
computer networking and pretty much the
basics of that so here I am about to
teach you guys so first in case you guys
don't even know what a computer network
is a computer network is pretty much a
network of interconnected computers that
are all connected to each other and they
have the main purpose of building a
network is pretty much to share
information between one computer to the
next so that this computer can share
information for this computer for four
or from this computer and it's just a
lot easier way and that's why networks
were built now there are three different
kind of types of networks these are the
three main classifications there's a LAN
which stands for local area network a
man that stands for a metropolitan area
network and al and that stands for wide
area network and these are classified
according to their size of their network
and the reach of their network the first
is the land and this answer a local area
network and this is usually just a
network that's an inside like one house
or building or something like that it
doesn't reach outside one building the
metropolitan area network is a network
that is less than 30 miles in size and
it's connected between usually a couple
buildings like this nice cables we got
going there and like I said it's usually
less than 30 miles and the last is the
way in now a wayne is a wide area
network and this is the biggest one
that's what she said and the Internet is
the biggest way and we have out there it
stands for a wide area network and this
is any network that's over 30 miles now
for some fun terminology a node you're
going to be hearing a lot when people
are
talking about networking is pretty much
anything that's physically connected in
the network for example on a personal
computer can be part of the network a
server or a printer these are all
interconnected into the network and
again each of them are called nodes and
all nodes are connected through another
term and that's communications media and
again as you can see how nodes are
linked and two of the most common
communication media is of course cable
that you use probably in your house if
you have especially if you have
broadband and also the new fiber optic
cables right here which I usually like
the new fiber optic networks so those
are two types of communications media
other kinds of like radio waves and
different kinds of waves and stuff like
that but these are two most popular when
dealing with computer networks so again
that's about it for your first tutorial
in the next tutorial we'll probably be
going over some more terminology but if
you guys have any questions that you
want answered right now can't wait the
next tutorials make sure to visit my
site on the new boston comm and i will
answer any of your questions there again
don't send me a message or anything like
that because i never check my youtube
inbox so I hope you guys enjoyed your
first networking tutorial and I will see
you next time thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
