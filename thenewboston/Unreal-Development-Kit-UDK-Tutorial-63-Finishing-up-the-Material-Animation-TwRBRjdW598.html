tutorial and in this story we're gonna
be basically continuing the last
tutorial and I'm gonna be teaching you
guys how to change or animate materials
so basically what we did was we made a
material instance constant and we
applied it to the static mesh right here
so now we basically need a way to
reference this material instant constant
in kismet and manet so then we can tweak
the settings of it however there is no
way that we can just open kismet and you
know hit new object using material
instant constant hmm maybe if we you
know if we select this and then no it's
not working so what we need to do is we
need to add something called a material
instance actor and this actor is going
to link your material instance constant
to it and then we can reference that
actor in matinee and it's basically the
exact same thing is referencing your
material so in order to do this go ahead
and make sure you have your material
instance constant selected and in your
actor classes
select material instance actor now go
ahead and right click and now you can
see it says add material instance actor
here now this is basically an object
that you can link to a material instance
so you can reference it in matinee so
basically this actor and your material
instance are going to be the exact same
thing so you're probably asking all
right how does this actor know which
material it's supposed to reference is
supposed to reference this material this
material this material well we need to
tell in the property so go ahead and
have Fork
open up the properties and make sure you
have your material instance constant
selected and we're just going to hit use
from content browser and now this
material actor right here is associated
with this material instant constant so
this constant and this actor are
basically the same thing so now we can
go ahead and exit uh our content browser
finally and let me think there's
anything I'm for you in I think I should
be good so now that this is associated
with this material go ahead
and open kismet and what I'm gonna be
doing is creating a new matinee so go
ahead and right-click and hit new
matinee and now let me just bring that
up a little bit and I guess I can go
ahead and open matinee right now and
make sure everything is looking pretty
good already so go ahead and right click
and of course we need to add a new empty
group and we'll just name this door
material looks pretty good so now what
we need to do is we need to add a new
track inside this group and the track is
going to edit the material so go ahead
and right-click and under new vector
material parameter track this is the
track we add if we want to edit material
parameters so of course we're going to
grab that one and in order to do this we
need to look at it in the curve editor
so go ahead and hit curve editor and I'm
just going to go ahead and get myself a
better view and get rid of that loop and
now I'm gonna add a couple keyframes in
our animation so I guess we'll just keep
this 5 seconds long might as well so go
ahead and hit enter to add a keyframe at
0 seconds and go ahead and scroll to
five seconds and hit enter again so our
entire animation is 5 seconds long so
now what we need to do is we need to
change the colors in the curve editor so
with this curve editor actually I kind
of forgot to important step
this material parameter track associates
it basically does this edits the
parameter of a material so it already
knows what material we were using go
ahead and drag that over there it
already knows what material instance
we're using so what we need to do now is
we need to say what parameter in that
material we want to edit because if you
remember from this whenever you're
making a material this material that we
just made has one parameter but
typically materials have dozens and
dozens of parameter so in order to tell
matinee what parameter of that material
we
edit we need to specify that right here
in prim name now if you remember my pram
name is called doors main color now let
me go ahead and make sure that all right
so turn black which means it found that
color and now we're working in the door
main color parameter so basically that's
the parameter the main color of the door
that we're about to edit so go ahead and
select your very first keyframe and if
we go ahead and just edit the red color
for now again if you don't know what I'm
doing make sure you watch my curve
editor tutorial and I'm gonna go ahead
and right-click this and set the initial
value to 1 and go ahead and click OK
so at 0 seconds my door has a red value
of 1 a green value of 0 and a blue value
of 0 and what we're going to want to be
doing is over time over 5 seconds we're
going to be 1 of changing this door from
red to green so let me go ahead and
select the red and green so we can see
both of them and at 0 seconds as you can
see my door starts out at red all red no
green so if I go over to 5 seconds and
select that keyframe now what I want to
do is I'm gonna go ahead and see my red
is good right now because red is fading
out but I want green to fade in so now
let me go ahead and click green and set
the value to 1 and go ahead and click OK
so now if I uncheck all of these so we
can see all my curves what we're getting
is and you can see this in the
perspective view as well what worked
well yeah I guess the only view is our
perspective view but oh well so what's
happening is it's starting out all red
and the red is fading out in the green
is coming in so that is our animation
right there so that's basically well all
I have to talk about so if we just go
ahead and X out of this and now we say
all right I already kept that trigger
from the last Cyril so whenever we hit
that trigger go ahead and play this
MANET and change the materials color so
now let me go ahead and X out of this
and I guess I can go ahead and test it
out right now so it starts out is red by
default and whenever I hit that trigger
that slowly faced the green over five
seconds so that is how you can edit
movement and materials in the UDK so
hopefully you guys understand how to
edit materials now and again it's not
the material you're editing it's the
material instance which is basically a
different version of that material
that's editable so if you have any
questions just make sure to ask me how
when I form the new boston.com slash
forum and I will be glad to answer them
for you but for now thank you guys for
watching don't forget subscribe and I'll
see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
