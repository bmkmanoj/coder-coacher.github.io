18th Ajax tutorial and in this little
you know mini video series that I'm
going to be teaching what we're going to
learn is how to use CSS in Ajax and I
don't just mean how to stick them
together in one file that simple I'm
talking about how to alter CSS
dynamically with Ajax and this is one of
the coolest things because this is what
makes a webpage kind of look like a
desktop application where things are
changing and everything just isn't one
static you know piece of crap content
now before I get started I want to say
that technically you don't even need CSS
with Ajax for Ajax you just need you
know some HTML Javascript and XML but
it's actually one of the coolest parts
of Ajax it's what makes people
it won't it's what makes people happy
now I'm just kidding but basically it's
one of the coolest parts of Ajax CSS and
you know with that being said you don't
really need CSS for web development so
you know unless you want to be a web
designer for Craigslist or something you
better learn CSS so I already went ahead
and I built the shell of this program
and what I'm going to do is I'm going to
have a table and then I'm going to have
two buttons now one button changes the
style in one way and another button
changes style in another way so let me
go ahead and start off by including some
files now the first thing we need is
just our JavaScript file you know just
go ahead and name my JavaScript file in
my CSS file Bucky so Bucky JavaScript
and also the CSS file
baki CSS and it's a CSS file and style
all right so now all of our files are
included and of course we didn't create
this javascript file or the CSS file yet
but we're going to be doing that and I
you know first of all I didn't even
stick this in the head embarrassing but
we're going to be creating those files
in the future so now what I want to do
is remember that I said basically what
I'm going to do is I'm going to make a
table and then I'm going to have buttons
underneath it to style it dynamically
now at first the table is not going to
have any styling so let's just go ahead
and build a very boring looking basic
table so I'll just go ahead and put
table table and we'll give it a let's
just give it like three rows or
something so the first one will be a
table head and what am I going to put in
this table let's just go ahead and put
like things in my pocket so this table
will have a header of things in my
pocket and then we'll just go ahead and
put two rows of things in my pocket it
will be a very simple design just for
demonstration and we need to give this
an ID table head now later on we're
going to do is we're going to access
this ID and say okay I want you to
change to do this or this or look this
way or this way before eating now it's
not going to do anything so now that we
have the head let's just go ahead and
add should I forget to add my rows table
row and table row and I just want to go
ahead and indent that so now what I want
to do is I want to make another row a
table row table row and give me a little
bit more space to work with here looks
pretty good so in this row I'll just go
ahead and write the name of something in
my pocket like
now what can be in my pocket what do I
have in my pocket right now I have a
chapstick in there all right so this ID
is item one and we'll just go ahead and
copy this row and make item two in in
item two what else do I got I got a cell
phone so basically this is all we're
going to create aside from the buttons
this is basically the shell or basically
the layout over a table it's simple zet
so we've created three rows in our table
the first one is just going to be the
head and we can actually look at this
right now the first one is the head
things in my pocket
the first item is chapstick the second
one cell phone so as we can see already
this table is looking horrible
horrendous so we need to hurry up and
style this biatch right now but in order
to style it dynamically according to
whenever the user wants to we need to
give the user some way to change this in
the most common way is just through
buttons so how do we create buttons well
let's just go ahead and add a break so
it's not you know on the same line looks
a little bit nicer and we just go ahead
and add they're kind of like submit
buttons but they're going to have a
different value so I'll add two of these
input type equals button and I'll just
put value equals alright so this is what
we can do we can style we're going to
have two different styles one style is
going to be if you're dude and one style
is going to be a chick so the dude style
is going to be like blue and green and
stuff very stereotypical but for this
example it'll be easy to get the point
across and the chick of course is going
to be like pink and yellow and stuff so
again you know that might be a little
sexist and you know stereotyping but
it's easy to explain so the values just
I'm a dude and on click
what's going to happen on clique and of
course means if you've never seen this
attribute before what happens when the
user clicks this button but what we want
to do is we want to call a function
called dude so that's that and now we
can just go ahead and copy this and add
button this one is I'm a chick
and this is chick so basically let's go
ahead and take a look at our layout
right now we have a table that has no
styling at all and eventually what's
going to happen if the user clicks I'm a
dude this is going to turn blue give you
all kind of manly font and if the user
clicks I'm a chick then what it's going
to do is it's going to turn pink and
they actually can click it back and
forth back and forth without ever having
to reload the webpage so it's not like
you click it once and that's the way
it's going to be if you you know are
dude you can click and then if your
sister walks in like ah this table is
too manly because you know she's from
Britain or whatever she clicks that it's
going to change
bada-bing bada-boom so basically let's
go ahead and alright let me go ahead and
pause this video because this is getting
pretty long seven minutes I don't have
that attention span that great yet so in
a pretty much we're going to continue
with the javascript file in the CSS file
in the next tutorial so thanks for
watching and I'll see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
