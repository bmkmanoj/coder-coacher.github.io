Effects cs6 tutorial my name is buddy
Blackford and I'll be your host for this
tutorial and this time we're going to be
talking about navigating the presets
through Adobe bridge and adding them to
your video footage or your text or
whatever layer you want to add them to
and this last time I made an Adobe
bridge bridge tutorial I only showed you
the text presets but there's a whole
bunch more
there's effects for different like these
effects that are up here that there's a
whole bunch of those kind of stuff so I
took this video the other day me and
Bucky and Tim we went fishing and we
pulled we all caught like a bunch of
bass but it's not bass season so we we
let them all go but we would let them
all go anyways because I don't know it's
more sports mini to me but it was pretty
fun we and Bucky caught a huge bass
using a frog so I'll just show you the
video real quick because you guys like
that kind of stuff so let's play this
video it's got some sound and it's got
me being really really excited in it but
here we go
oh yeah
take a picture video me
he's an aftereffect yo look at that with
it
that's it
wait I want to eat it so yep that's the
video and that was probably that was the
biggest fish anybody caught that whole
time I caught the most fish though he
caught the biggest one but he was who is
using like a bigger bait to catch like
the bigger fish and the season doesn't
start until like I think it's like the
third Saturday of June
so the 27th no the 20th that's when
it'll start
that's not Saturday the 21st geez but
anyway let's get on to using our Adobe
bridge to use a put it effects out here
so the way we're gonna do this is select
our layer then come up to animation and
we're gonna go to browse presets and
pretty much always opens already and
it'll open up bridge for you and it'll
come to this page right here and it
opens usually up to this FFX cs6 support
files presets section now we've got a
bunch of color correction presets here
and these are the presets that I have
added myself and put into this folder so
you won't have this one right here but
you'll have these other ones such as
backgrounds behaviors image special
effects so let's go into image special
effects and see what's in there
we've got bad TV bad TV - so let's just
throw one of these on here let's go -
lets just try bad TV - because it's
green colored double-click on the effect
and yeah it'll apply it it's a frozen
right now so I'll pause it real quick
until unfreezes alright now we've got
the bed TV effect down there didn't
really freeze it just like I guess it
froze for just like a couple seconds but
this is what the bad TV effect does
and it's pretty easy that you can just
add this on there so let's check out our
effects controls panel and see what we
got on there wave warp box blur color
balance noise venetian blinds so it
added all those presets on there now if
I type in uu we can see all the
everything that's been changed in our
layer so just type in you you real quick
on the layer and it brings up all these
these are all the parameters that
haven't changed and the position scale
and rotation are things that I changed
and that the preset didn't change those
so we've got our effects here that have
been added so let's go ahead and just
throw something else on to see what else
we can do and we can play around with
this and mess with it so you can see
that the different things we got going
on here and in the in the special
effects let's go to creative and see
what they got here some colorize insert
video framed grayscale vignette lighting
let's put that on
let's put mood lighting streaks barely
see it on there because the video is so
bright what a great one for me to pick
geez fit you and you can see in this one
they have at you you you can see in this
one they've used expressions within
their effects and they're linked to the
different effects that they already have
in there so that's pretty cool so you
can even get expressions within your
effects animation presets and effects
presets that they made for you so that's
that's pretty much it about this
tutorial there's you can browse through
all the different things on here and and
check out their different previews of
what they've got going on and
just like check them out in bridge so
thanks for watching this one now you
know how to use these presets be careful
when you're using these all the time
though because since they do come with
Adobe and they have been in there since
like cs4 at least or maybe cs5 people
recognize some of these presets and they
might be like oh you didn't make this on
your own or whatever some people care
about it some people don't just keep
that in mind so thanks for watching this
one I'll see you guys later have a good
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
