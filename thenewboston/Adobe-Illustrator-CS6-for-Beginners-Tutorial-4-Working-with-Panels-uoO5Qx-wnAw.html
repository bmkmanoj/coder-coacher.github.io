another Illustrator cs6 tutorial and
today we're going to learn about panels
and we're going to learn how to show
panels and hide panels to resize them
and other things so just keep on
watching the tutorial and I'm sure
you'll learn some new things about
panels so pretty much what a panel does
is it gives you easy access to task
specific operations from color control
to may be like vector path information
or brush information and there over here
on the right and this is the panels
panel which is kind of funny to say but
there it is and you can find it and see
all the different types of panels that
might not be over here over here in the
windows on the menu bar so if we come
down here we can see all these different
kinds of panels here and the ones that
are open are the ones that are checked
marked here so if I click on something
like brushes we can see that the brushes
panel is now open and when I go to
window you can see now brushes is open
so tools right here is check marked
that's on the left and control is going
to be here right above where it says
path there and it has the X Y W and H
over here and we've got all these other
ones that you can open up now you can
easily close these by clicking on this
double arrow it's going to close it and
you can click on the icon if you
remember what the icon means to open it
up now if you hover over the icons if
you're on the default preferences then
you can see the description of what the
panel actually is so we know how to open
a panel we know how to collapse panel
but how do you resize the panel well
some of the panels have this handy
resize bar on it where you can go like
that or out here like this
not all panels have a resize bar on them
let me see if I can find one that
doesn't
like this one right here you can tell
there's a resize bar because I has this
like extra little bar here down at the
bottom that has a bunch of little
indentation looking things here and that
means you can resize it but when you
can't it doesn't have that but you can
see the gradient one does but stroke
doesn't because there's really no need
to make this any bigger the letters
aren't going to get bigger
the fines are going to get bigger so
there's no reason really to do it so say
you're working on a panel like this like
you have stroke gradient and
transparency and you don't want to keep
on clicking to switch back in between
you just want both of them to be open at
the same time we need to do is click and
hold on
the name here right on the tab and you
can drag it and it undocks the panel now
you can have these two open at the same
time and you can move this to wherever
you want to now say you want to redock
this panel
well you just click on it and drag and
you can see though that there is a blue
rectangle around it so once you do that
you can let go and it rocks the panel
back in there you can also move it
around in the within the tabs and you
can see over here on the right in the
panels that's moving in the order that
you have these docked you can also move
the button here to a different section
and that way you can have it in its own
little thing here its own little section
or you can move back to where it was so
there it is so say you're working on
your project and all this stuff is
getting in your way and you don't really
want it around and you don't need to
access the tools panel or the control
panel or any of these other panels what
you're going to do is you're going to
press tab and now you can see that all
the panels are gone now I like using
this if I'm going to try to show some of
the artwork too
client that way they don't have to see
it is nonsense and they aren't looking
around trying to figure out things you
can add to it and stuff like that
they're just going to see what you're
showing them you hit tab again you're
going to have this open now are you
going to have all the stuff come back up
now if you hold down shift and press tab
you're only going to hide the panels
panel that way you can keep your control
panel and you can contribute you can
keep your tools panel the last thing I
want to show you about panels in this
tutorial is the panel options menu and
each of these is going to have a panels
options menu so we've got stroke here
selected you click on this little icon
here and we've got our panel options
here I've got more options that we can
see if I go to the colors here I've got
more options going on here without
having it show options if I hit show
options I've got more options let's go
to color guide and you can see all these
different options that each of these
panels have they're all different and
each panel has its own set of options
which is really nice
and you when you're working with a panel
and you can't figure out what's going on
or you can't figure out why something's
not there or anything like that then
what you're going to want to do is go
into the panel options and check and see
if it's at there if you need to you can
also and a lot of the panels you can
also change the view so we've got
different kinds of views here and we've
got different kind of sorting as well so
check in your options panel options menu
for different kind of things that you
would expect the panel to have but don't
see that's all we've got for this
tutorial so keep on watching and check
out some more tutorials as we keep on
going through Illustrator cs6 have a
good one everyone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
