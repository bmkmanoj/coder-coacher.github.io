tenth C++ tutorial and this tutorial i
will be teaching guys how to make arrays
now what an array is is pretty much a
variable that can hold a bunch of
different values in it now it's a little
different than a variable in how you
write it and how you store the
information but it's actually quite
simple to make and very very useful so
let's go ahead and as you can see we
just have all our basics r2 includes in
our main function right here and the
first thing we want to do is create the
array and we need three things to create
the array the first thing we need to
write is what kind of type it is and I'm
going to make just a basic array using
number so I'm going to use the int type
and the second one is you have to name
your rate just like you do a variable
and I'm going to name mine ages because
we're going to be talking about ages
right now now I know this looks a lot
like a basic variable right now but the
third thing that we have to do is in
square brackets not your curly ones your
square root once you have to write how
many elements are going to be in your
array and I'm going to have three
elements so write the number three right
after the name of your array
right after this we begin making the
elements of our array now make sure that
you have three and three only and I'm
going to start making the first one and
it's really simple to do all you have to
do is write the name of your array which
is ages and as you can see my first
element does not begin with a 1 it
begins with a zero because in C++ when
you're counting everything starts with
zero zero one two three four so we're
actually going to go zero one two and
those are going to be the three elements
I know it's real confusing but that's
all a C++ made it so so I'm going to put
the age of the first person is 21
because I'm 21 and then and your
semicolon and now put ages and the
second one has the one in the square
brackets and I'm going to put um 19
because I know a guy is 19 and in my
third one which is actually going to be
2 I'm going to put 9 because my sister
is 9 so now these would work just like
any old variables in the sense that you
can perform math functions to them or
anything else but how do you actually
write the variable and that's even
simpler than making it all you have to
do is write it like it's a basic
variable but instead of just writing the
name you write which element of the
array it is so such as 1
in this variable right now right here
ages one is going to have the value 19
so if you do ages 1 plus ages 0 and we
save this it's going to put 19 plus 21
so let's save this compile and run
hopefully I don't have any airs anywhere
forgotten semicolons or anything good I
don't now as you see it goes forward II
and that's exactly what we wanted and as
you can see nineteen which has this
value and zero adds up to forty and
that's how you can store multiple values
in the same variable if you will which
is actually called an array and this is
a very useful when you're trying to
build a database or something like that
when you have a bunch of like variables
but you just want to change one little
thing about them like you have a bunch
ages or a bunch of names or anything
like that and this is going to come into
use a lot later so study this it's a one
of the most useful and basic things that
you'll be seeing a lot of later and I
hope you enjoyed in my tutorial and make
