slash on live gamer for the New Boston
in this tutorial we're going to continue
working on our FTP downloader so if you
remember from the previous tutorial we
added this notify new file icon which is
a notify icon now what we need to do is
set an icon for this so that it'll show
up in our system tray so let's just use
this star right here now this star is
going to be used in the next series of
tutorials where we create a favorites
viewer but we can also use it for this
too so we're going to have a star for
our icon so we'll come back here and
we'll go to form one dot VB and hold on
here
okay so what we need to do sorry about
that I had to look at my previous
project that I that I had created so
what we need to do is show the user that
a new file has been found so we'll type
notify new file dot show balloon tip now
a balloon tip is one of those things if
you're on the windows right now
a balloon tip is when you see a little
balloon looking thing pop out from one
of your icons in your system tray and it
tells you something now you may have
seen this with a Windows Update err or
something like that and it has a little
it has a little X button on it so this
is gonna take some arguments we're gonna
need the time out so let's set the time
out to ten seconds now this is in
milliseconds so what we need to do is
put 10,000 milliseconds which is going
to be equal to ten seconds now the next
thing we need to do is set the title of
the tip now to show two balloon tips you
have to use a notify icon because there
has to be an icon in the tray for you to
show a balloon tip you can't do it from
an icon in the taskbar so let's set the
title to new file and we'll just set the
text to
the new file found is and then we'll
just go ahead and add let see file dot
file name dot to string or file name is
already a string so we can just leave it
like that and then the tip icon is going
to be tooltip icon dot info so this will
set the icon of our tooltip now let's go
ahead and run this
and you can see here that we've got
start checking for new files so if I
click this it's going to say it's going
to check for new files now that just
showed up a whole bunch of balloon tips
because it did that for each one of
these because it did not contain it so
we're going to home home directory and
let's see here we need to change this to
so it looks like it's not changing our
text for this so let's go ahead and
we'll copy this go ahead and paste that
right there and then paste that right
there so we'll get rid of this and we'll
set checking to true to begin with okay
so now let's run this again
and if we start checking for new files
there we go that was the problem it
changed the text of this instead of this
because I didn't use very good names so
let's just undo this stuff we did here
and that's not what I wanted to do okay
so instead of button check for new files
we want button
let's see start check timer so we'll
just copy this
and we will paste it right here ah
that's not what we want to paste it we
want to paste it right here
okay so now if we go ahead and run this
if we click start checking for new files
you can see it changes to stop and it
shows us a balloon tip down here now let
me pause right here and I will try to
show the balloon tip okay so I've moved
the recording down to here and let's
just go ahead we'll clear the list and
then you can see that because it's
checking for new files it gives us a
balloon tip that says new file found is
YouTube txt now it actually did that for
each one of these but it scrolled
through so fast that you couldn't see it
so we can stop checking for new files
and then we can clear and then every
tenth of a second it's gonna check to
see if there's a new file so it's gonna
say new files found so if we upload a
file so let's say we upload the dragon
we can go ahead and we'll see that it's
going to check and find the dragon now
let's see here
actually that will not trigger this to
tell us there's a new file because only
upload its going to refresh the list by
itself and so I was gonna see that that
file is already in there
so I'm go ahead and close out it so go
ahead put this code in if you haven't
already and you should get the complete
program to where you can do a whole
bunch of stuff with FTP and you can have
a check for new files and notify you
when that happens
so thanks for watching guys and stay
tuned for the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
