video and now that you guys know how to
handle simple touch events like a tap
what I want to do is I want to show you
guys how to handle gestures now a
gesture is a special type of touch event
now there are a bunch of different types
but the ones I'm going to be showing you
guys how to handle in this tutorial are
something like scrolling so for example
when the user has their finger on the
screen and they tap down and then they
drag it up and let go so that's a scroll
maybe you're reading I don't know some
article online
another thing is a fling and a fling is
kind of like a scroll but you put your
finger down and you just fling it up and
then you release your finger at the same
time and this is actually a common
gesture whenever you have like a reading
app and you have a bunch of pages so
flinging can be like turning a page and
there's some other ones as well and one
of the special ones actually is a double
tap and that needs its new interface for
an entirely different interface but I'm
going to be showing you guys all of them
it's going to be real simple so the
first thing I did is I created a brand
new project I named it Swiper diaper
because I wanted to include the word
Swiper in it so I'm going to be showing
you guys the swipe and I don't know the
diaper just kind of popped into my head
so here we are looking at a blank
project with one activity
Swiper diaper so go ahead and delete
this textview boom roasted and drag out
a large text right here and I'm just
going to give this a new ID of what can
i name you ID so many options
how about Bucky's massage Lucky's
message there we go alright so now we
have this text right here that has the
idea of Bucky's message in just because
it's annoying me
I'm just going to name this like bookies
text
alright so essentially what we're going
to do is we're going to be calling a
bunch of different gestures and I'm
going to be showing you guys how to
implement them and for example whenever
we scroll then I'll just hang change
this text to scroll and whenever we
fling I'll just change this text to
fling so again this is the only
interface we need in the text is going
to change depending on what gesture we
do pretty boring app but it's really
useful for just demonstrating this
example so that's actually the only
thing that we need to do for this pretty
boring design so now let's hop over to
the Java class I made myself all
situated and the first thing I want to
do is this we need to import a bunch of
stuff and after import I'll explain why
we are importing everything so the first
thing is in poor and well since we need
a reference that textview we can just go
ahead and import that now and that's
Android widget dot textview and I have a
burp coming in like 10 seconds just get
out just get out per all right stand out
and there okay now in next we need to
doing for Android view and motion event
now two other things import Android dot
view dot gesture detector that is a
pretty cool name all right now improv
Android dot support dot v4 haha that I
was going to film the entire thing for
me
v4 dot view oh it mine o mg that was
pretty sweet Wow
I wish there was a program where you
could just type tab tab tab next thing
you know you had like a social network
you know but uh actually that we're
pretty dumb so I don't know I'm just
entertaining myself over here alright so
he imported all the crap we need so why
did we import all that well this is how
you detect gestures what you're going to
need to do is you're going to need to
implement a couple interfaces now these
interfaces have methods inside them that
are pretty much responsible for
detecting gestures now you can implement
them in a bunch of different ways but
we're just going to use the same class
right here so what we're going to do is
implements and the first one is Josh
come on gesture detector dot on gesture
listener and I'm running out of space so
I'm just going to add a comma and other
one we want is gesture detector on
DoubleTap listener so again these are
two different interfaces that we're
going to implement and again this one
right here this on gesture listener this
is for your common gesture it's like
flinging and scrolling and a couple
other ones as well this on DoubleTap
listener of course you guys probably
could have guessed this is for um
listening for double tabs so that's what
we're going to be doing right there now
the first thing that I actually want to
do is before we start using these
methods that we just implemented I'm
actually going to go above right here
and I'm going to get a reference to this
while I remember it so since we're going
to be using it in a bunch of different
methods that's why I just don't want to
stick this variable in one of them since
I want to use it
um threw out a bunch phone so private
text view and I'll just call this
Bucky's message this is what I called it
isn't it yep
all right now another thing that I
probably should do right here is private
gesture detector Oh bats right there and
G gesture detector pretty good name and
again you guys know that this variable
is just going to be a reference for here
obviously and this little gesture
detector again that's the object from
the class that pretty much is going to
detect gestures and I'll show you guys
later on how to use that but for now
since we implemented both of these
interfaces what we need to do is we
actually need to use those methods so
actually I'm going to stick those right
after the on Kure because I don't know
just feels right and I'm going to hit
alt insert now I'm going to hit
implement methods so this is pretty much
saying okay you implemented this
interface on DoubleTap listener so these
are the methods from there you have to
implement or use essentially and on
gesture listener these are the methods
that you're using from there so as you
can see on scroll on down which pretty
much means your fingers down on fling
which pretty much means you like fling
up like you're scrolling through
something so I'm just going to hit OK
and what's going to happen is it's going
to automatically insert all of those for
us so again that's our promise whenever
we're implementing that we're going to
use all of those methods and now we
fulfilled our promise but is still kind
of boring because we didn't do anything
with them yet so the first thing I'm
actually going to do is go up to my aunt
Curie method and give myself a little
bit of room
now you need to add three lines of code
to the oncreate method the first one is
you guys probably could have guessed
that Bucky's message you actually need
to take care of it right here so you
guys remember how to do this don't
really need to talk you guys through
find view by ID
Arkadiy dot Bucky's message so now we
got a reference to the message now we
can actually tweak it whenever we have a
gesture now then another thing I want to
do is pretty much this housekeeping
stuff but this gesturedetector remember
that was the object I'm going to set
this equal to new gesturedetector compat
and i pass in this this so again what
this is is an object from this class
which pretty much allows us to detect
gestures simple enough so the last thing
i want to do is set gesture detector and
i'm going to call a method on it called
set double tap listener or set on double
tap a listener now I'm going to pass in
this and what this is going to do is
going to allow us to detect double taps
as well so it's kind of annoying that
they they probably have a good reason
behind this but they separated on the
basic gestures from the double tap ones
why they did that I'm not sure but they
did it so that's why we have kind of
redundant code from time to time so now
all I need to do is this and this is
actually really easy so on each of those
methods that we are implementing I'm
just going to call a quick little just
do this and copy and paste it a bunch of
times I guess all right on single
actually I'm gonna do this even lazier
all right so essentially what I'm going
to do is on each gesture that we're
overriding I'm going to set a little
message to change the
on the screen to ever gesture just
occurred so just like this and instead
of going through all of these actually
you guys can do that I'm going to pause
my video because probably going to take
like a minute or so and you guys don't
need to see me do the same exact thing
like ten different times so one second
alright guys so what I did is I added
the functionality to change the text on
the screen every time a gesture occurs
now another thing I want to mention or
but by the way I also added two little
comments to the source code so you guys
can tell when the gestures are beginning
and when they're ending and which is
pretty much the default code that was
there before so if you guys are copying
the source code from the forum and you
see that that's what they are so once
you have all of your messages set we
need to do a couple more things the
first thing is you see how all of these
return false by default well we actually
want to return true on all of those and
remember the reasoning behind that is
because return true essentially means
that okay whenever this override method
occurs return true says the event was
handled the touch event was handled if
you don't have this return true then
what's going to happen is for example
whenever you scroll it's going to say on
scroll on the screen the text is indeed
going to change but the event that touch
event isn't going to be consumed in
other words it's going to say okay well
you still got to take care of this touch
event whenever we return true it says
okay well actually that's all we wanted
to do touch event taken care of so it
doesn't pass it along for something else
to handle it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
