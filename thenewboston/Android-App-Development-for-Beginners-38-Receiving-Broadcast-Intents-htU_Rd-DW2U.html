we need to do for this project so the
next thing I want you to do is go to
file new project we're going to be
making like I said entirely different
app for the broadcast listener or
receiver so I'm just going to name it
was my last one send broadcast receive
broadcast and that's good that's good
now another thing I want to do is I'm
just going to choose add no activity so
again this is just going to be a
listener so we don't really need a
screen for it and click finish alright
so we don't have an interface or any
design but of course we still need
somewhere to write some code so expand
project and expand app Java and in this
first top package right here remember
that's where we put all of our Java
files so right click it and choose new
other broadcastreceiver
since that's all this is it's a program
that receives broadcasts simple enough
now for the class name I'm just going to
name it receive broadcast and make sure
that both of these are checked by
default and click finish so what it does
is it builds us pretty much a generic
class to receive broadcasts so
eventually we're going to be listening
for these broadcasts and whenever one
occurs and we actually accept it what do
we want to happen well all I'm going to
have happen is we're just going to print
out a little message on the screen it's
called a it's kind of like a quick
little notification or a pop-up you may
be familiar with them you'll see
whenever we do it but in order to do
that we actually need to import Android
we hit toast and this imports a piece of
toast so if you open up your CD Drive in
your computer right now you're gonna see
a piece of toast in there all right I'm
just kidding this is a for the pop-up
now like I said this honor received
method is going to be called whenever we
receive that broadcast that specific
broadcast that we're listening for so
what do we want to happen
whenever that message gets sent out and
we listen for it and hear it well all
I'm going to do is make a little pop-up
appear on the screen so it's toast make
text which pretty much means make pop-up
and the parameters three parameters we
got to pass in the first thing we have
to do is pass through this context the
second one is the string that you want
to appear pretty much for your pop-up
and now just write like broadcast um has
been received all right now the third
one just write toast length long and
this is the duration of how long you
want the pop-up to appear for so it's
either you have two options long and
short so we'll just make sure it appears
on the screen for like I don't know the
duration of this is not long it's only
like five seconds maybe so alright this
looks pretty good right here and this is
actually the only thing you have to do
for whenever you create a receiver to
receive broadcast messages now of course
how does this know to listen for this
specific broadcast because this was our
original broadcast that we created and
remember I told you guys there may be a
bunch of different broadcasts going on
in your phone a bunch of different
things sending them out in order to
identify each one we gave it essentially
a keyword so this is the keyword that
gets tied to this specific broadcast
whenever the user clicks the button so
in your other project we somehow need to
say listen for broadcasts with this
keyword now in order to do that we
actually go up to the manifest file and
click Android manifest XML now of course
this is the manager I say of course a
lot it's kind of annoying
probably so alright so this is the
receiver and where we can manage
everything now what we need to do is we
need to add something called an intent
filter this is pretty much going to say
don't just listen for any broadcast we
need to filter out these
broadcasts to only listen for specific
ones now inside here is where you write
which type of broadcasts you want to
listen for so if you right action an
Android name then what you can do is you
can paste your keyword in there so now
this program is only listening for
broadcast intents with this keyword aka
the only one that we did and that ladies
and gentlemen is it we set up our
broadcast receiver and whenever it
receives a broadcast with this keyword
it's going to call on to receive aka
make something pop up on the screen so
the first thing we have to do is we need
to run this and whenever we run this
check it out I don't know if you guys
can see but one thing I want to make
sure you guys do is click launch default
activity you see how this is default
well we don't want to launch this at all
because this is just a listener it
doesn't have any screen associated with
it or anything like that
so we're going to click do not launch
activity and then click run and what's
going to happen is in our emulator
you're not going to have like before
whenever you test it app in an activity
popped up and then you can click
something that's not going to happen
because whenever you run this all it
does is it starts listening for that
broadcast to occur so now if we go to
our other project send broadcast then we
can run this project and this is just
for the other one alright so now we got
that listener so again go to your other
project the one that could send out a
broadcast and just run this bad boy too
now whenever we click send broadcast
nothing happens because why are you not
oh is because I am a moron in
all right I essentially made a toast
which is that pop up but I forgot to
actually show on the screen so let's try
this again all right so hopefully
whenever we click send broadcasts check
it out this is that little toast I was
talking about broadcast has been
received so there you go and take note
of this remember first of all remember
to include your show method we check
this out the program to send a broadcast
is this and the program that prints out
that little message is an entirely
different system
it says broadcast receiver and this is
that little message so how sweet is that
that we're pretty much communicating
between apps between different programs
within our phone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
