3d with pygame tutorial this one still a
pseudo 3d and really everything we're
doing this tutorial video will be 2d but
anyway moving on sodor game loop
actually first let's go ahead and create
our square function so for now we'll
just call it square eventually it's
going to be a cube but we'll say define
Square and basically we just want to
know what the start point of that square
is and then also the full size of the
square so later on as we modify our z
axis we're gonna prime modify the full
size and you'll see what I mean in a
moment but first let's go ahead and
define our nodes so we'll say node 1
equals something and then and so on so
let's go ahead and say node 1 equals and
start point is going to be basically a
list that we pass through so node 1 will
be its own list because we want to be
able to modify the locations so it'll be
a list and it'll be start point zero and
then comma start point one easy enough
now we're going to define the rest of
the notes so this node is in theory the
top left node I'm gonna go ahead and
copy this real quick copy and then paste
three more times so one two three and
then this will be node two three and
four and so node one is that top left
now let's do the top right so what needs
to be modified we only need to modify X
not Y so how will we modify X well we
just add the size to it so it would be
star point zero plus full size so that
is the top right node now and by note I
mean the little you know dot it's the
you know you've got these vertices those
are our nodes see those are kind of
interchangeable but basically where all
the lines connect you know it's a node
so node 1 2 3 will be will make this the
bottom will make this one the bottom
left so X doesn't need to change but why
why needs to be plus the full size so
plus full size and then note for the
bottom right basically needs plus full
size to both so we'll do plus full size
and plus full size so those are the
notes so we've got these nodes now what
we need to do is first of all they're
not they don't even exist and we don't
have any lines between them so let's go
ahead and let's draw will draw the lines
to and from all the nodes and then we'll
also mark the nodes just just because
eventually you can get rid of the nodes
but it is kind of helpful to mark them
sometimes so anyway we'll leave them
there so that's one two three four and
then now we draw the lines
so first let's say you know top line and
the top line is going to be pygame dot
draw line where are we gonna draw the
game display what color do we want that
line white and then what two points do
we draw that line between so this is the
top line right so that's between node 1
and node 2 so node 1 and node underscore
2 and now let's go ahead and copy paste
paste paste so that would be the top
line now we'll do the bottom line and
the bottom line would be between node 3
and node 4 and then our left lines to
the left side line that's going to be
between node 1 and 1 2 3
so node 3 and then finally between node
2 and 4 will be the right line and then
we want to go ahead and draw our nodes
themselves so we're going to do a quick
tie game draw a circle where do we want
to draw that circle game display what
color do we want we're gonna make it
light green and I also just notice that
I left my font pretty small so me
a little larger for you guys so you can
see it better okay there we go
anyway um pygame dot draw that circle
game display light green and then we
want to draw that two node want or we
want to draw node one and then the width
of that node will just make five and
then I'm just gonna go ahead and copy
this paste paste paste and then two
three and four so that is a you know our
square functionality and now we really
just need to call square and so to start
we'll just need a starting location
we'll say that starting location is a
three hundred two hundred and then we'll
say the size equals two hundred
something like that and then basically
we'll just towards the bottom here fill
the black foot with black and then we'll
say square and then location and size
will say swirly location in size so
saver on that row
well we're not well first of all we're
not actually updating let's do a game
display to update there it is okay so
now we've got like our starting Square
and how am i we actually interact with
this square well what we can do is
whoops lost it obviously we can go
laughs right okay so we could say our
location is and then we'll add a current
move current move and we'll say that
equals zero and then you know you got
left right so then we could just say
current move equals negative 5 and then
current move equals 5 and then left or
right
releasing means current move is zero so
these are key down events this is the
key up event for left or right key and
then of course you would just do size
plus equals current move and now we will
be able to actually move oops what did I
do wrong here it's that I think we
modified oh yeah we modified size what
we meant to modify there was location
I'm like what's happening okay
current location plus equals current
move location we should be able I'm not
sure we'll get away with this one milah
struck yes okay so here we are we're
modifying the X variable is attempting
to modify X&amp;amp;Y there so you can modify
that and now we can obviously control
this this is nothing new really it's
this is kind of like our tank where
we've defined a multiple points so we're
kind of controlling many points at the
same time with you know one key press so
that's nothing new
obviously we could go up and down as
well but for now we'll just leave it
leave it like this but because what
we're really truly interested in
obviously is given the effect of 3d
so how do you get first of all how might
we give the effect of 3d well kind of
like what we did a second ago which was
instead of location doing size plus
equals and then like this now it's not
perfect but this almost gives the
appearance that maybe we're getting
further away from this square and now
we're getting closer to that Square
almost as if we're flying directly
towards the top left of our square here
now I'm gonna go ahead and close this
and that is what we're going to be
slowly getting into in the next next
video is how might we write some sort of
formula that dictates distance from it
cuz because really what we're trying to
do with pseudo 3d is to identify this
sort of Z variable right so when you
have a three dimensional axes you've got
X Y Z and you're attempting to define Z
without Z actually even existing in
pseudo 3d so it's kind of difficult but
anyways that's what we're going to be
getting into in the next video so stay
tuned for that and thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
