31st JavaScript tutorial and in this
tutorial I'm going to be teaching you
about a couple new methods the first
method I want to talk about is something
called the join method now what the join
method does is it takes an array it
converts it to a string so this method
is really useful whenever you have an
array and you want to output all the
elements to the user so this is the main
method that people use whenever they're
converting it to a string so again let's
go ahead and take a look at it so let's
go ahead and create an array of my
favorite movies and just set equal to
new array and I'm going to go ahead and
avatar that was a pretty good movie even
though I'm spelling around and let's see
Good Will Hunting one of my faves
and let's see Vanilla Sky kind of quirky
but hey I liked it and let's add one
more fight Wow
definitely type that our Fight Club just
like that so now let's see how many
movies I have one two three four
so I've four elements in the array so
every time alright
what's an easy way where we can convert
this to a string well what we can do is
go ahead and make a regular variable and
just go ahead and name it string one so
we're going to make a string variable so
in order to do this here's what we need
to do go ahead and write the name of
your array movies and then go ahead
using a dot separator we're going to
call the method join now it doesn't take
any parameters and what it does is it's
going to take every element in your
array separate it with a comma and
convert it to a string so now that
string is stored in the variable string
1 so now whenever we want to document
write this on the screen we just have to
write string 1 and now let's go ahead
and save this and see what we get
after Good Will Hunting Vanilla Sky and
Fight Club and as I told you it doesn't
take any parameters and whenever it
doesn't take any parameters by default
it says separates your list with a comma
we're saying alright what if I want to
separate it with something other than
the common like a hyphen or something
like that well it doesn't take any
parameters by default but you can pass
it in a parameter if you want it's
optional if you do pass in a parameter
then it's going to exchange that comma
for something else
so for example if we use a hyphen
instead of nothing what it does is it
changes all those commas two hyphens so
check it out
now you can have a customized string
depending on well first you need to use
that joint method and it actually
depends on what parameter you pass it in
and one thing you may have noticed make
sure you pass your parameters in in
between quotation marks because you're
passing in is assuring technically so I
just want to throw that out there so now
we know how to convert an array to a
string
pretty cool definitely useful but
another method that I want to teach you
guys about is called the pop method P o
P and what this does is it removes the
last element from an array so for
example I have four elements in here in
the index is 0 1 2 3 so let's go ahead
and just write out like document dot
writes let's go ahead and write the last
element just to verify that it is indeed
there and that would be movies index 3
and let's go ahead and add a break
because we're going to be needing it
later on so now what should appear is
Fight Club it's a third index which is
the fourth element so 0 1 2 3 so Fight
Club as we just saw on the screen is the
last element in the array so now if we
call this pop method and in order to do
that just go ahead and write the name of
your array object
movies and add pop now pop doesn't take
any parameters but what it does do is
it's going to is pretty much going to
alter your array where it's still called
movies but now instead of having four
elements it only has three so now your
movies array consists of Avatar Good
Will Hunting and Vanilla Sky so now
we're saying alright what happens if we
try to document that write the element
out now which is movies three
well movies three doesn't even exist
anymore since it's only has 0 1 2 so
it's going to give you an undefined so
check it out at beginning we made an
array called movies it had four elements
whenever we print out the last element
it gave us Fight Club appropriate and
then we altered the array we said all
right for this movies array call the
method pop and what this pop did is it
took the last element and it popped it
off so now array only have three
elements 0 1 &amp;amp; 2 so whenever we try to
print out the fourth element is set
undefined so that is what the pop method
does it pretty much removes the last
element from the array and what we can
do here is call it again and then it
would only have to in it so again we can
call it as many times as we want um you
know it's pretty much simple
self-explanatory so now that you saw it
you can begin moving on to the next
tutorial so remember join converts in a
righteous string and pop removes the
last element from the array so as long
as you understand those concepts you're
ready to move on to my next tutorial so
thank you guys very much for watching
and I don't get subscribe and I'll see
you next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
