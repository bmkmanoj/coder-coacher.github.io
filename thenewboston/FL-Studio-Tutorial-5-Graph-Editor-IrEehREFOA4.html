little buzz going on feeling pretty good
I am ready to teach you guys the next
tutorial number five the graph editor
now the graph editor is this little
button right here in to toggle it on and
off just like every other button
basically just click it and click it
again now let me go ahead and explain
you guys what the heck this is before I
start teaching you you know how to
adjust everything on it the graph editor
allows you to change the sound or the
feel of an individual beat so for
example we're only going to be working
with a kick in this channel and by when
I say change the sound there are a lot
of different ways that you can change
the sound so again since we're only
going to be working with the kick
channel I want to show you guys first
how to solo that channel so these
buttons to the left of the channel these
little green lights whenever they're lit
up they pretty much mean that the
channel is active or making noise
whenever they're off and you can just
turn them off by clicking them then what
it means is the channel is basically
muted so now that the kick channel is
the only channel that's active whenever
we play this we only hear the kick and
that's what I want because whenever I'm
talking you guys about the graph editor
if you hear all of these other beats
then it's going to be confusing it's
better if we only have one sound at once
and another thing I want to do is I'm
going to fill these in each two steps so
I think that will be a little bit better
so again make sure that you only have
kick active in another way that you can
do this is if you right-click it you can
actually press solo and that only um it
mutes every other channel but this one a
little shortcut but anyways click the
graph editor and now you see all of this
crap and we have no idea what does so
let me go ahead and explain first of all
like I said these are different ways
that you can change the feel of your
beat now velocity I don't know why they
named it velocity it's not really a
great description word because like
what's a velocity of you know it kind of
sounds like tempo but it's not velocity
is pretty much the intensity
Furby so if you have a drum and if this
is you know high velocity and you can
change it by just left clicking with
your mouse then imagine you beating the
drum really hard now if it's a low
velocity imagine you you know just
tapping on the drum so let me go ahead
and follow along um with your left mouse
just go ahead and paint a little curve
right here so as our pattern plays
you're going to hear the difference of
velocity with a high intensity to a low
intensity so click play so tie low low
low low low low low high low low low so
again as you can see it starts out high
and then it pretty much gets softer and
softer and now before I talk to you guys
about all these other things right here
I want to show you guys how to work with
the graph editor because besides just
left clicking with the mouse I want to
mention a couple things first of all the
channels you only really need to focus
on are the ones that are active so if we
fill this in every 4 steps this channel
this channel this channel in this
channel are the only ones that are going
to matter because these notes right here
for example these notes they don't even
play so if you have them high or low it
doesn't matter because the note is an
act of itself so whenever you're
adjusting the sound only were only
worried about the notes or the beats
that are active now another little
shortcut is again you can move them
around with your left mouse let the left
mouse button not the left Mouse and you
can also do something with the right
Mouse now whenever you right-click it
and by the way whenever I say right
mouse I mean right click now whenever
you right-click click and drag and what
this basically does is it acts like a
rubber band kind if it has a starting
point and ending point so instead of
just you know making a graph like this
with the left if I wanted it straight
it's a lot easier to use your right
mouse button now one more shortcut and
then I promise we'll move on to
something else if you use control or
excuse me if you hold down control on
your keyboard and then click and drag
with the mouse it
to change all of your beats at the same
time so for example if you're like
alright I like this pattern right here
but I just want it a little higher but
you don't want to just be like oh crap
messed it up what you can do is you can
hold ctrl down on your keyboard and just
slide them all up at the same time and
trust me it's going to save you guys a
whole lot of time so with that being
said we know what velocity does already
and let me just go ahead and change this
to oh let me I don't I can't even
remember what it was at somewhere around
there that was pretty good so anyways
we're back to default basically alright
so now if you scroll left
this is pan right here and you guys
should already know what pain is and if
I fill these every two steps it may be a
little bit easier what pan is and you
probably can hear this easier if you're
wearing headphones is the left speaker
I'm going to say this your really simple
the left speaker or the right speaker
and if you were in headphones your left
ear or your right ear so let me go ahead
and color all this one side and color
all this another side and now let me go
ahead and play this if you were in
headphones that probably gave you a
headache and hopefully whenever I upload
this video you can hear that on YouTube
but for some reason if YouTube I don't
know messes with the pan then it's going
for my right ear to my left ear so
that's what pan is and just to walk you
guys through some other things real
quick arm let's see what else we got
release it's probably not going to
display in this example but release
basically is how long a note is held so
whenever you're working with like piano
sounds or guitar sounds that's what
releases mod X mod Y C fine pitch and
shift we'll talk about all those later
on because there's actually well I don't
want talk about that but it will just
confuse you guys um if I try to explain
that now because we're not quite there
yet
bye anyways that is basically what the
graph editor is basically how you can
change you're in
tensity the pan and the release which is
basically how long each note is held of
each note and again it gives you a
little bit more control over each of
these beats and even though you may
think you know I'm probably never even
going to use that trust me whenever you
get making a song this definitely comes
in handy so now you are expert at the
graph editor we're ready to move on to
the next thing which is oh sweet mother
of Mary what the heck is this thing so
that's what we're going to cover in the
next video thank you guys for watching
and well I'll see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
