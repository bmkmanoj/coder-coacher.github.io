slash on that gamer for the new Boston
and in this tutorial we're gonna be
talking about polymorphism now this is
probably one of the scariest terms in
programming but it's actually very
simple and we'll be learning about it in
this tutorial so come down here and
let's do it run for the form one load
sub will just create a method or a sub
so private sub show car info and now
what we want to do is we want to pass a
car to the sub that we're creating so
we'll just call it argument car as car
or we'll do as all cars let's specify
the name space dot car and we'll go
ahead and hit enter now the reason we
had to specify the name space is because
that it is outside of the name space
that is used for our project now if we
didn't have this nested inside of a name
space then we wouldn't have to specify
that but since we do and we're going to
have to specify it so whatever whenever
they pass in the car to this method
let's go ahead and show the info of it
so we'll type our card dot to string
we'll go ahead and minimize that let's
come down here to button show car info
and we will type show car info and we
will pass default car to that now up
here this is not going to do anything
for us so we need to show that in a
message box so a message box our show
and we're going to convert that to a
string and we'll just set the title to
info we'll go ahead and close that off
okay so now that we've shown the car
info let's go ahead and run this and see
what we get now let's go ahead and click
show info we haven't set the name
we get the car name we get the color red
the number of doors 5 and the car speed
is equal to zero now this all works as
expected because we passed a car object
to this it is called the two string
function that is inside of this class
right here which returns all the info we
need about our car now let's go ahead
and come to show car info instead of
showing default car ledge so default
sports car now we'll go ahead and run
this now let's set the name of our
sports car to Mustang GT 500 go ahead
and click OK it will set the color to
black doors is 2 we will accelerate it
to 80 miles per hour we can look at the
power-to-weight ratio which is default
because we set that one form1 loads and
now if we show info you can see that we
get the name Mustang gt500 the car color
is black the number of doors is 2 and
the car speed is 80 now you might want
you might be wondering to yourself why
does this work well polymorphism
basically means that you can create not
create that you can use use one type as
another type so if you have an object
our car right here or the object that
you pass to a default sports car that
can be treated as a car object because
they fall sports car the object that it
has the class that comes from inherits
from car now polymorphism it comes from
the Greek word and it means many forms
now you can you could pass a sports car
to this and have it be used like a car
but you cannot put sports car right here
and pass a car to it because the car car
does not inherit from sports cars so
whatever sports car has in it
Carr will not be able to use it so any
stuff that you have defined yourself in
sports car it's not available to card
because it does not inherit it from
sports car so I hope that gives you guys
a basic understanding of polymorphism
it's a quite simple concept and once
you've used it a couple times you will
get used to it so we'll just go ahead
and do this one more time we can show
the info and you can see that we get all
the stuff we need and we don't get any
errors even though it passed a sports
car object to a a method that uses a car
argument so go ahead
type this corner if you have in practice
a little bit with polymorphism you can
create classes parent classes and
subclasses and once you got that down go
ahead and we watch in the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
