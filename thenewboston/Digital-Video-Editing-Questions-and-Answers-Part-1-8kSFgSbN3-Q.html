some terminology of editing digital
video and this is actually the request i
got from one of my subscribers they
messaged me and said si can go over
video frame rate and they also want to
know the difference between interlace
and progressive scanning so on in this
tutorial or a video I'm going to teach
you guys a little bit about that the
first thing I want to go over is video
frame rate now a frame of video is is
pretty much a picture in the video now
what video is pretty much a bunch of
pictures put together to create the
illusion of motion for example if you
remember those old uh video reels that
you spin this show dumb a picture of
some guy going this then another picture
of them going like this then mother
picture have going like this and when
you put it all together it kind of look
like his arm was going that kind of like
a foot book and this is pretty much what
video is just a bunch of pictures put
together and wants you to play them all
out one after another they give the
illusion of motion so um there are two
major frame rates that you're going to
be dealing with when we're working with
editing video the first is a North
American and Japanese standard and this
is called the NTSC standard frame rate
and this records at 29.97 frames a
second so every second there's 29
actually a closer to 30 pictures a video
in that one second the next you're going
to come across this called the PA el and
this is the European Standard and this
is i recorded 25 frames per second so
again the north american called the ntsc
29.97 the PA el which is the european is
25 now whenever you're looking at video
you're not going to really be able to
tell the difference between 30 and 25
frames a second so you're probably
asking yourself alright why is this
important well it's not very important
when you're viewing just a raw footage
but whenever you're working
with a project and say premiere pro or
something you want to make sure they
project settings are synchronized with
the settings on your camcorder so if you
have ntsc or PA el settings on your
project make sure that those are the
settings on your camcorder and this is
going to allow for a smoother playback
whenever you're recording to DVD or
posting it on youtube or the web or any
place like that so again make sure your
project settings are the exact same as
your settings on your camcorder in this
will allow for a smoother video another
thing I wanted to go over is difference
between interlace and progressive skin
since a lot of people who are buying new
camcorders they come across this and
then don't really know what means or
what to choose or if you're looking at
your project and says I or p you don't
really know what one to pick so here's
what that is back in the day when they
first started out putting video on TVs
and stuff like that they had a little
problem when they were shooting the
lines down one by one for each frame
whenever they got to the bottom line it
began to fade out because technology
wasn't really up to the part of what it
is today so they came up with the system
to shoot all the odd lines at one time
then come in and shoot all the even
lines to create an image and this solved
the law of the problems with them making
sure that the image in fade from the top
to the bottom so whenever you shoot all
the outlines of a frame then come in and
shoot all the even lines in putting
together so it creates one image this is
called interlacing um today what
camcorders and um ways the output video
can do is they can just go ahead and
output 1 2 3 4 all the lines down to
create a solid image this is just
because we have better technology now
you know we
have to worry about a lot of the
problems that they used to this output
in one two three four five six seven
eight lines at a time this is called
progressive scanning and this is pretty
much what all the technology is going to
be in the future it's going to use
progressive skin</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
