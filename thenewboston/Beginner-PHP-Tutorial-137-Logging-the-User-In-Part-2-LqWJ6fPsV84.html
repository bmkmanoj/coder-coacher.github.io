current file cut underscore file and
that's going to equal dollar underscore
server and remember this is an accident
associative array and the value we're
going to give this or the key we're
looking for here is a script file name
so let's just let's include that in
index or include that in yeah we're
going to clue that in index dot PHP so
require let's go back cord
Inc dot PHP and now here we can just
echo that just to test it's working so
that is current underscore file and
let's go back and refresh our page
okay so current file is index dot PHP
let's go back to cord
Inc I think what we could use is script
file perhaps no I think we can do
script name Oh script name fresh there
see what we get okay yeah this is fine
so now what we've got is the the
location we want to we want to submit a
form to because at the moment we're on
index.php however if I was to say just
as an example that we're not going to
end up doing this but in login form if I
was to require cor dot Inc dot PHP and
then I was to echo the current file
let's see how this changes so at the
moment we're all in next stop PHP and
that's showing us index dot PHP but
because this is dynamic it's going to
update when we change the page okay
maybe not let's oh wait sorry yep we
need to go to login form doing dot PHP
and then that gives us this value so if
the login form is included in index dot
PHP then whatever we write in here is
every right for the form action is going
to be displayed let me just give you an
example of that first of all let's open
up PHP tags and I'm going to echo
current file now you might be thinking
well we haven't required the cording dot
PHP file in here
so how on earth can we use this variable
well the answer is we've required it in
index dot PHP and we've also required
sorry not connect with a required core
here but what we're going to do is we're
going to include
the login form dot PHP galore include
login form ding PHP so then it will read
it still from here so think of this as a
long page with these included now
getting your head around this
structuring system may be difficult but
it just means that everything is kept
neat and tidy and you can reuse things
etc etc so let's refresh and see what
happens so go back to index dot PHP ok
so what we've got up at the moment if we
view the page source you can see form
action equals and we're going back to
index dot PHP even though this code
exists so even though we're inside a
login form ding dot PHP and we're
echoing the current file because it is
included within index dot PHP what we're
doing is we're still we're still taking
this this file name so we're submitting
the data back to index dot PHP which is
still going to be processed in login
form dot Inc dot PHP so it's quite hard
to understand but eventually as we go
along you'll you'll get it if you
haven't already so we've done that now
what we need to do is and specify our
username and password login fields so
let's say username and we create a form
field here basic HTML so typing text and
the name of this is going to be username
and then we want the password which is
another input type this time it's
password and the name is password so we
type the type of this is password just
so it sets of start out by our browser
and then let's create a submit button so
type click submit and the value of this
I'm going to say it log in so let's go
back and refresh our index page ok so
you can see that we've got this login
form now ok so the next thing to do is
process what's going to happen when this
login form is clicked so we can view we
can view an example of what's going to
happen on the index dot PHP page even
though we're processing it inside login
form because we've included it so let's
first of all check if the username and
password have been set meaning the form
has been submitted so you may have seen
this example a few times before so
saying if is set we're wrapping that in
brackets and we're specifying this post
data here that's coming through and
we're saying and is set dollar
underscore post and the password as well
needs to be set and then inside the
block we're checking if it's empty or
not to wear first of all saying is it's
set and if it is we're executing this
block or or running this block and now
we're saying if not empty dollar
underscore in fact note we can predefine
we can redefine the variables here we re
gonna check them into another variable
so username equals dollar underscore
post username and password equals dollar
underscore post password ok so now we
can say if not empty username and not
empty password do something otherwise do
something else so the something else
will be you must supply a username and
password and the if it is entered is
we'll just put for now ok so let's see
how this works so we'll click in the
topic index dot PHP refresh that page
click login and it says you must apply
username and password now what we can do
is type something in click login and it
says ok so we're on index dot PHP but
we're processing what's going on inside
login form door Inc so we're clipping
the index file as clean as possible and
eventually we're going to put this into
an if statement into a block which means
if the user is logged in we don't want
to show this login form otherwise we
want to show the login for</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
