show you guys how to install your gas
pedal now your gas pedal is connected to
a throttle cable and the straddle cable
goes all the way to the back of your
go-kart to the carburetor and pretty
much adjusts how much fuel is getting
into the engine how hard the engine is
working therefore a harder you press
this the more fuel gets in the engine
the faster you go so what you need to do
is I already um positioned this onto my
frame in one place but position that all
the way to the back just go ahead and
tie it on zip ties along the frame and
I'll show you guys how to install the
throttle cable in the next video but for
now let's just concentrate on the gas
pedal so first of all if you ever drove
the car before for you notice that
whenever you can press the gas pedal it
just doesn't stay down if you leave your
foot down comes back up in order to make
the car go faster after you press it
back down now the reason it keeps coming
back up is because of a spring so the
first thing that we need to do is
install this spring now for this fridge
right here the straight part goes into a
slip on your gas pedal like this and the
bent part goes into on enough I can give
a good angle on it goes on to the
bracket on your frame now go ahead in
position the spring so you can get a
bolt through now your gas pedal is going
to come with a big bowl so go stick that
through and make sure it goes through
the middle of the spring see if I can
get it just right
always a tank you may have to use a
hammer I'm going to have to use another
I'm a watching and we just are you beat
on this date all right
keep looking get better able come on
baby
there we go great like that now it
doesn't really matter how far your
spring stretching right now because
we're going to adjust that later on well
you need to worry about right now he's
just getting that bolt on there so go
ahead and take your nut and all the way
on the other side of the bolt set it
down so now the bolt is nice and tight
and check this out what the heck is
wrong with this obviously something's
around because this is not where we want
the gas pedal to go by default whenever
we take our foot off the gas cover so
now let me show you guys how to position
the gas pedal to pretty much go exactly
where you want it when your foot is not
on all right guys now that your gas
pedal is installed in the spring is
obviously working correctly because it's
spring to the floor let's go ahead and
get the default placement for your gas
pedal now what you want to do is
remember you can always adjust that
after you install it everything and
you're sitting in the driver's seat but
for now just go ahead and give it a
general location so right there it looks
pretty good now you have a bolt that
game came with your gas pedal and behind
your gas pedal it's going to go through
right there now you don't just screw it
in exactly right there because well it's
not going to work out so what you need
to do is you actually screw a nut on the
bowl like this now once you have that
nut on the bulb then you can go ahead
and finish screwing this into your frame
so I'm trying to get it so you guys can
actually see there we go so hopefully my
big old dumb arm isn't in the way now
what you want to do is of course tighten
this so once that's nice and tight your
gas pedal is ready to go now check it
out
any
time that you want to adjust this gas
pedal for example if you have everything
installed your seats and everything and
you decide that you actually want it I
don't know maybe there instead then all
you have to do is adjust these two
screws and it makes everything a whole
lot easier instead of having to pretty
much take this bolt out and then if you
try to adjust that then this bolt is
going to come out fall on the floor and
give you guys a whole bunch of crumbs so
that's why we use that additional nut
down there so it just makes adjustments
a whole lot easier
so now test it out make sure it screws
back up and if it does then you're ready
to move on to installing the throttle
cable</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
