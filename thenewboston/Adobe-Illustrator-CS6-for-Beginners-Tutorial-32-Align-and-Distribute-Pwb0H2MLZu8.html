exciting Illustrator cs6 tutorial today
we're gonna learn about aligning and
distributing objects and what that
pretty much means is that when you align
something you're going to put them
together in relative to the page or it
been relative to each other such as
trying to like line up everything in a
straight line or something like that or
putting everything to the right of the
page or whatever and distribution means
the amount of space in between each of
these objects when they're next to each
other so let's go ahead and start out by
going over what we need to have setup
first we need the align panel and you
need to go to window and align and then
I'll bring the panel up know when you
probably open it it's probably not gonna
look like this it's probably gonna look
some more I didn't mean to do that I'm
gonna look something more like this and
this is what you're gonna get so the
first thing that you want to do and I'll
explain why is click on use preview
bounce and you want to have that checked
because it takes into consideration the
objects effects or the like the stroke
or something like that and since I have
a stroke on here of about five I think
you have five points it's gonna take
that into consideration when it's a
lining if you don't and you start
aligning things they might start
overlapping and that's probably not what
you want so the next thing you want is
show options click on that and it's just
gonna give you these extra options here
distribute spacing and align to and I'll
go over those now I feel like
illustrators should just have these
already on there and that make you show
the options because if you're a newer
user you're not gonna think of going up
here and going to show options you're
gonna think it's something else or like
you got to setup stuff but it's not it's
just giving you extra options that
should be there already
so if we take a look at the panel we've
got align objects and we've got
horizontal left horizontal align Center
and right and these are horizontally
aligning parts and then we've got
vertical line top vertical align Center
and vertical align bottom the next thing
we have distribute objects we've got
distribute top distribute Center and so
on just like the other thing to what
these are distributing so if you want to
start go ahead and select your objects
now for aligning you got to have at
least two or more objects and when you
distribute you want at least three or
more objects let's start aligning things
the first thing we're gonna do is let's
click on horizontal align Center you can
see that now everything has been aligned
in the center alright but they're
overlapping the next thing let's click
on vertical align Center and it takes
into consideration the space that it has
been before and now everything is both
all aligned in the center on top of each
other if you want to do that that's what
you can have I'm not really too sure of
too many reasons why you might want to
do have everything all on top of each
other but a few but if you are doing
something and you've got like four
different sized circles and you want
them all in center in front of Earth
inside of each other but they are all
different sizes then that might be
something you would do and I'll go and
I'll do that at the end to show you what
I was talking about alright I just hit
control Z a couple times let's check out
our distribute objects alright if we
click on a vertical distribute Center
just watch how the objects move they're
not moving at all let's try vertical
horizontal distribute Center there we go
that's what I was looking for now it has
distributed them equally vertically or
horizontally my bed yeah they got these
uh you've got they've got these opposite
each other so on the align objects the
whore
Santals on the left and the verticals on
the right and the distribute the
verticals on the left and the
horizontals on the right
thanks for trying to mess this up Adobe
thanks all right now if we want these
all together we got to start aligning
these up a little better so we want to
get these into a straight line as
basically what we're trying to do so
let's use this align to button so we
want to have these let's click this and
it's we want align to selection select
this one we'll select them all let's go
align to selection and when you select
it you see that there is a nice huge
outline here and now we can start
aligning things to that I press
horizontal that's not the one I wanted
want vertical there we go now everything
is in the straight line and then if we
use the distribute Center everything
will be distributed evenly now go ahead
and mess around with everything we've
also got distribute spacing if you want
to start a spacing things out I think
we're gonna use horizontal here and we
space things out even more and you just
click on it and it starts doing the
jiggety-jig here so go ahead and mess
around with the whole entire the whole
thing that we've got going on here and I
think that's it for aligning now you
guys can mess with aligning on your own
so I don't have to go through everything
but I want to show you that little trick
I was talking about so we'll do it with
we'll do it with the the polygon here
I'm just going to duplicate the polygon
a few times
alright and I'm gonna make these varying
sizes
make this one bigger all right I'm gonna
select them all and now we're gonna just
add these in the and align them and
that's what I was talking about if you
want to make something like that then
that's when you would use the different
alignments now you can see that one of
the objects has been hidden in the back
so you would do something like let's
figure out which one's hidden by
clicking on these eyes so this last one
here is the one that's hidden go to eye
and click on that and we're just gonna
move it up and now it shows so that's
the way you do if anything's like hidden
you just bring it up back to the front
so that's all I wanted to show you guys
and I'll show you a couple of practical
uses for it and how and why you might
want to use a line to distribute so
thanks a lot for watching everybody have
a good day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
