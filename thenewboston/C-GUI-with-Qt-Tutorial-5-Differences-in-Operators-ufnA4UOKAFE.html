tutorial and in this tutorial I want to
take a break from the GUI programming
and I want to talk about something that
a lot of people ask me on my forum and
through YouTube messaging and that is
why do we need to use this arrow instead
of the dot separator whenever we want to
use this show function right here so a
lot of people are confused between the
dot dot I mean excuse me the colon colon
the dot operator and the arrow because
all of those allow you to use functions
from classes or objects so let me go
ahead and explain that right now say you
have a class called a and you want to
use a member called B you can go ahead
and use the dot dot just like this now
we're saying okay well why would I even
want to use that data or why do people
prefer this to other ways well they do
this to specify which class the member B
is coming from because you can have the
same variable names in several classes
the same functions names in several
classes say that you have a member B in
a say that you also have a member B in
the class Tuna say that you also have a
member B in the class Bacon well with
the colon colon does is it specifies
which class you are coming from so this
means use tunas B use Bacon's B use A's
be simple enough so that's when you use
the colon colon sometimes I accidentally
call it my apologies but the core reason
for that is because if you have be in
more than one classes then it allows you
to specify which class is coming from
now the dot separator like a dot B or
tuna dot B is very simple that's the
most common one that we use before
whenever tuna is an object and B as a
member from that object it allows you to
use that member from that object again
we really don't need to talk about that
because if you know anything about C++
and how to create an object that's the
probably the very first thing you learn
how to use members from that object now
the reason that we can't do that with
this right here is if we look closely we
know
step we didn't create an object what we
did is we actually created a pointer
that points to a label object so a
pointer and an object are two very
different things and you know it's a
pointer because this little asterisks
right here so what this means a arrow B
is basically not basically it's exactly
the same thing is this a dot B basically
you want to use the B member from this a
pointer
however whenever in guys I know this is
confusing but whoever invented C++ came
up with this so don't blame me that
there's all these rules but you can't
use the dot separator on a pointer so
you can't go label the show because this
label right here is a pointer it's not
an object you see so whenever you have
um a case where you have a pointer and
you want to dereference it and then call
a member from it this is what you have
to use an arrow so basically without
getting into too much details about
pointer and pointers and all that stuff
whenever you have a pointer you use the
arrow whenever you have an object you
use the dot separator so hopefully you
guys understand now why we have to use
the arrow instead of the dot separator
because label if you look closely you
can see that it's a pointer and not a
simple object</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
