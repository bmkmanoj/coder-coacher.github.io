JavaScript tutorial and in this tutorial
we're gonna be going over something
called a browser information now what
we're gonna be doing in this tutorial is
getting information from the browser now
if you don't know this whole thing is
the web browser now we can get
information for a bunch of different
reasons let's say we wanted to find out
what rep web browser the user was using
cuz maybe it wasn't compatible with our
program or maybe we just wanted to get
it to tell the user alright it's time to
update your browser or maybe we just
want to get it for the heck of it like
we're gonna be doing this tutorial so
let's go ahead and get started
and the first thing that we're gonna
want to do is make a variable and I'm
gonna call mine Bucky because that's my
name now after this what you're gonna
want to set this variable
Bucky equal to is sum is an object
called the Navigator object so let's go
ahead and type navigator add your period
now what the Navigator means in
JavaScript is the web browser they don't
call it a web browser they call it the
navigator would have been a lot easier
if they just call it a browser or web
browser but they didn't so you're gonna
have to learn navigator and can't change
it now after the period and this is
where you're gonna do every time you're
gonna type what part of the web browser
you want to use so in again these aren't
things you make up they are
like a preset determined pieces that
JavaScript already made so you just have
to memorize these or have a list with
you and these can be found on any
website so one of the things is called
app name and what this is going to do is
give you the browser's name such as a
like a Netscape or Firefox or Internet
Explorer and right now what we did is we
made a variable called Buckey and then
has the value stored whatever our web
browser's name so let's go ahead and
output this on a screen since we're
working with objects might as well use
document.write we won't use the alert
one right now since we're gonna be
working with objects so I might as well
get used to it now let's just type
you're using add a little space and type
in our variable Bucky and our parameters
so right now as you can see we want to
write on the screen you're using and
then add a space and then write Bucky
and again Bucky is just the name of our
navigator so let's go ahead and save
this and see what it has to say you're
using Netscape since that's the web
browser I am using
now go over that and figure out how to
do that and let me just show you one
more thing this variable when you store
this into variable it's very useful if
you're gonna be writing a bigger program
or if you're gonna be reusing this code
over and over again but you don't always
need to store it in the variable what
you can do is just copy what this means
or cut it and add it right into here and
then let's get rid of this because we
don't need that anymore and it says now
you're using and it will give the name
but uh let me just save that and prove
to you guys real quick so you don't
think I'm a liar refresh refresh you're
using that scape and one more thing
that's pretty useful is instead of app
name you can write platform and this
will give you the platform that your web
browser is running on and this is pretty
useful in trying to determine like if
there if your program is going to be
compatible with a computer or not so let
me just save this and I says you're
using win32 and that's what platform I'm
using right now and all of these things
all these browser objects are pretty
much just a test compatibility or to
give the user information and again if
you want to learn more about the rest of
these and if you want to memorize them
you can but they're on a bunch of
different websites so I recommend going
and checking them out but that's
probably going to be the only browser
objects we're gonna be covering for
right now and remember if you like my
