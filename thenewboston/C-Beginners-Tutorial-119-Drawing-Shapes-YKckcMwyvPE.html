tutorial that I'm making for New Boston
and in this tutorial I'm gonna be
showing you how to draw shapes so for
this tutorial all you're going to need
is a panel and once you have that on
your form just select your panel go over
to the events and scroll down until you
see click and then you stop and click on
that to create an event handle or
equivalent alright so the first thing
that we're gonna have to do is create a
new brush fill our shaded so we're going
to do solid brush I'll taught SB or
solid brush and set it equal to a new
solid brush and inside of here it calls
for a color and it says color structure
that represents the color of this brush
so we were to concept this color to red
well later on we're going to fill a
circle with this brush so if you wanted
it to be red the circle be red and the
book color red inside of here but you
can make it obviously any color that you
like when you want to open a public
class you saw that there were several
colors that we can pick from so I guess
I'll pick green and then none series you
call it selected just close it off so
now in order to create a new shape we're
going to create a new graphics so we're
going to say graphics G equals and then
I'm gonna say panel one dot create
graphics and this will just allow us to
paint on this panel surface and in order
to actually create shape we're going to
say G dot fill and then you see there
are many different shapes we have the
cues bug so we want it to fill a pie or
a polygon or a rectangle or something
like that then you could the first thing
that we're just going to fill is a
rectangle so first thing that it calls
for is a brush so we're just gonna use
our solid brush up here SB
and the next thing that it calls for is
basically the positions that where we
wanted to create this rectangle and
we're going to want we're going to want
it to create it at the 20 on the x-axis
so it's going to 1 right here and 20 on
the y-axis as well so put 20 love and
just so you know 0 0 is up in this
corner and you're not this bottom corner
alright so 20 20 and then we're going to
set the size of our rectangle now I'm
going to make it 55 50 now if you wanted
to make it like a rectangle amount of
square then you just mess with these
values idea let's just go ahead and see
what this does right now so let me click
we should see a rectangle that is 50
pixels by 50 pixels and 20 on right off
this corner if there's a green square
and just like that so if we wanted to
make it be a rectangle you just mess
with these values so if we wanted to
make it like longer on a horizontal we
would just screw the X so when I make it
60 this way then it would be 60 across
and 50 down yep launder that way we can
make it figure yet yep figure yeah okay
and we're not only limited to rectangles
for example if we wanted to create let's
say an ellipse so we'll first just gonna
have to pass through a brush solid brush
that we created and again now we just
have to pick the points so I guess what
changes to 50 and 50 and we're going to
make the width this bitty as well
everything will be 50 so it will be 50
pixels across and 50 pixels down away
from this corner right here and it will
be 55 50 the actual shape so we should
see a circle here if there's a circle
and again if you wanted to
like an oval shrimp or something we just
mess of these values so if we wanted to
make it like vertically longer than it
is horizontal or across and we just mess
with this value since this is the Y and
this is the X so we'll make it like
really long and make it a hundred
yep and now it's very long so that's it
for this tutorial so see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
