another pot game tutorial video in this
video what we're gonna be working on is
adding health bars to our games so right
now we're shooting at each other and
we're I don't know maybe hitting each
other who knows and even if we were
hitting each other how do we know how we
were doing so to do this or and to kind
of visualize this we generally use
something like health bars so that's
what we're gonna be adding in this in
this video so let us go basically we'll
keep the game intro and then above the
game loop so we're gonna add a new
function and that function is to be
health bars so we're going to define
help underscore bars and the parameters
for health bars are going to be player
health and enemy help then we're just
going to display the enemy's health the
idea is to have an enemy health from you
know 1 to 100 that makes sense
and if you couldn't guess generally a
health bar goes you know from if you're
looking at my screen you've got a health
bar and it goes down like this right and
so it goes you know left to right
anyways so why not you know the health
max health is 100 so our little bar at
max health will be a hundred pixels wide
if the user has 88 health it'll be AE 8
pixels wide and so on so that's easy
enough then what we can do is we can
take that one step further and we can
actually color the health based on
certain segments so generally when
you're like full health your green when
you're like middle health your light
yellow and when you're low health your
red so we can also add that in so let's
go ahead and do that so first of all how
we do this we would say we'll just say
if player health is greater than 75 so
if it's the top 25% basically we would
say player health player health
underscore color equals green then we
would say Elif player
health was fire health is greater than
50 we will just say player health color
equals yellow and then we can just say
else player health whoops play your
house color equals red we told me to cut
and paste that for any so now we're
gonna say if enemy health is greater
than 75 enemy health color equals green
I'm gonna go ahead and copy this now and
then we're gonna say if actually L if
enemy he'll greater than 50 enemy health
color equals yellow and then else enemy
health color equals red so here what we
have is basically we're using L if to
get around needing to use like greater
than equal to this and greater than or
equal to this less than or equal to this
and then greater than this so if this is
the case if the health is greater than
75 it will not go any further it will
just do otherwise it will continue going
now what we're ready to do is we're
gonna do we're gonna draw these
rectangles to the screen so let's do
pygame dot draw dot rekts where do we
want to draw it the game display what
color do we want to draw it well first
let's do player health color so paste in
player health color and then where do we
want it well we're gonna do probably
like we'll do six eight oops
680 25 and then we'll say the width is
player health as we were saying and then
hi it will do 25 now let's just copy
this paste this and then instead of
enemy health color its enemy army and
player health color its enemy health
color and then instead of player health
its enemy health location here we'll do
20
and that should be good now all we have
to do is we just have to call health
bars and then we pass through the
variables so within the game loop at the
top is where we'll define this so we'll
just say we've got player health and
enemy health so we would have player
health and that what is equal to 100 and
then let's take enemy health here and
enemy health is equal to hundred so then
we will come down to our actual game
here and underneath where we're like
filling White is pretty much where we
can put the health bar so we can
literally just call health
what was it health underscore bars
health bars and then it was player
health enemy health so I think I have
one of them yeah anyhow I have and I
copied and then player underscore health
so between the fill and gun we have
health bars player health any health
that's putting up the health bars so
let's go ahead and save and run that hit
play and sure enough we have these
health bars now of course we don't have
anything that's like talent like and no
no one is actually getting hit here and
it looks like we actually can't be hit
by the enemy interesting we can hit the
enemy because their enemy enemy is not
even moving but and this is why
artificial intelligence is artificial so
you might need to change the barrier
height or the maximum like distance that
can be over but anyway we can get to
that later on but let's close out of
this the other thing i what am i doing
is we have a lot of spam that i wouldn't
mind just shutting up I don't mind the
last shell and impact stuff but I don't
think we need to print where the shell
is and so that's it with this finally
get rid of current power as well keep
the impact there
air impact there as well and we don't
need to start in shelves there okay
let's try one more time
and see if we're getting all that nasty
output I just don't see it anymore
fire fire easy enough sorry debugging is
a little cleaner now so that's good
so and now we're gonna work on in the
next one is actually like making hits
take place and that kind of stuff and
then also we'll be changing
well the hit take place and then we can
also kind of change like the how close
that hit was as opposed to like how much
damage it does that kind of stuff so we
definitely have to do that and then we
want the health bars to go down but just
to show you guys that health bars are
actually going down we could start the
game with the player health at 66 and
enemy health at 33 and we can run that
and you can see that you know my health
bar is yellow his is red handicap huh
anyway so yeah we got a few more things
that we definitely want to change to
this game so stay tuned for those thanks
for watching and till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
