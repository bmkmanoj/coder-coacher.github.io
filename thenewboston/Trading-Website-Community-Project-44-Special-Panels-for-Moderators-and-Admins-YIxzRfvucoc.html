and in this video what I'm going to be
doing is I'm going to be showing you
guys how to create one of these panels
right here so you see these different
panels that say items trades messages my
account well all of these panels right
here are the default panels for every
single user however on this website
since it's such a huge website and it
needs kind of monitoring by managers
certain users are going to be assigned
the role moderator and administrators
the users who probably develop the most
help with the site they're going to be
granted the privileges and it's kind of
not a privilege because they're going to
be responsible for watching over
everyone deleting spam approving post so
on and so forth so what I did is I made
them a separate panel which you can't
see in this video because I'm just
logged in as a normal user but they have
a separate panel called moderator at the
top and instead of this you know blue
background navy blue there's is red and
instead of things like active pending
add item which any user can do they have
special things like um you know approved
spam or excuse me delete spam look at
reported items so on and so forth so I'm
going to go ahead and show you guys how
to make that panel and once you guys
understand how to make that panel you
guys are going to understand how to make
all these panels items trades messages
my account there's only one little bit
of code that's different to make it blue
instead of red so the first thing that
we need to do is we need to query the
database to see if the user viewing
their my account page is indeed a
moderator so this is how we do that
result equals my SQL query and of course
but my double quotation marks so in the
users database they each user gets
assigned a certain role now I can't
remember what the default role is I
think it's just called a user but some
users are going to have the role mod or
admin so that's where we got to look for
whenever the users you know queer
running this query so select all from
users
where of course user underscore ID
equals my yep that's right my ID and
because of course this is going to
return everywhere that it queries your
ID so it's going to return one row no
matter what but we only want to query it
if role equals mod or role equals admin
now if you guys are wondering what's the
difference between an admin and a mod an
admin is pretty much the god of the
website they can do anything they can
ban people they can delete people's
accounts a mod has a lot of power but
not as much as admin a moderator on this
website is going to be able to you know
delete spam delete certain posts but
they aren't going to be able to you know
delete users or you know like change the
style of the website or something so
that's the difference and of course you
can't be at mod and an admin it doesn't
make sense so that's why I query this so
if you are a moderator or an
administrator then what should happen is
this should of course query one row
successfully and let's go ahead and test
for that right now so if this does query
one row then that means that you have
the privileges so if MySQL num rows and
of course we need to pass in a result
set right here is equal equal to one
which pretty much means equals one then
that must mean that you have the
privileges or you are a moderator or an
administrator so what do we want to do
in this instance well we just want to go
ahead and display that moderator panel
because you know we don't want to show
it to every single user we only want to
show it to the moderators so only if you
are moderator or administrator then echo
your panel pretty cool so the panel for
this is div and it has the ID
I hate when I do that actually hate
putting all this crap in double quotes
but I actually need it okay so div ID
and this is mod nav and this differ
right here is just for spacing div so
that does for spacing now next thing I'm
going to write a span and all this span
does is it surrounds the one second I
can't type and talk at the same time it
surrounds the title and I'll show you
guys what I'm talking about the header
you know this one says items this one
says trades message is my account you
see how it's kind of white with a it has
kind of a shaded background that's all
it does this span is called nap headings
and it just makes that a title look cool
so the title for this panel is moderator
and and that spin so now our title looks
cool now what we want to do is you want
to list all the options so you see in
the trades panel it has four options
offers received offers made declined and
completed trades well in this moderator
panel I'm going to go ahead and uh well
you know what I'm going to do I'm going
to show you guys how to first make the
options and then in the next video I'm
going to show you guys why I wrote all
of this code because I know a lot of
people are saying you know what you
could have just made a loop or a single
variable or an array or something but I
cannot think of a way where I can do
this I don't know if I'm just you know
going crazy or just looked at this code
for so long but I know I have a lot of
subscribers so I'm hoping that one of
you guys could fix the problem that I
can't solve so that's what I'm going to
teach you guys what I did in this video
and hopefully one you guys will come up
with a better solution because i know
this is messy and i know it looks kind
of useless so you know I'm relying on
you for that so what it did is I put all
of those options like offers received
offers made decline to completed trades
in an unordered list so of course my
unordered list and I just put the class
is menu and this isn't the problem right
here this is just for styling purposes
now the reason that I made the unordered
list is because um you know like I said
for styling purposes so each of those um
options is actually of course a list
item probably didn't even need to
explain that you need list items in
unordered list now what I did is I made
them a link to you know add item offers
receive so on and so forth so the first
link is a href equals and what's the
first one mod underscore pending in this
link is where the moderator can go if
you are a moderator and pretty much
review all of the items that are pending
review do you want to approve them or if
it's like porn or spam or something then
you deny them in they don't get accepted
to the website so let me just go ahead
and write pending and that's where the
problem is but i'll explain that guy
i'll explain that in the next video so
now what I want to do is uh okay I'll
explain all of this i know that i'm
saying you know i'll explain it in the
next video but i need to go ahead and in
detail explain everything so i can't
really do it right here so pending
variable all pending and to end this
will just go ahead and end the link like
that so this is the style i have right
now and guys all this code is pretty
much good in my opinion it's this code
obviously that we need to clean up so
anyways let me go ahead and recap but
one last time why I did the things I did
in the next video I'm going to explain
you guys why I have a problem and why
I'm begging for your guy's help so
basically all we did in this video is we
wanted to make a panel for the moderator
so of course the first thing we need to
do is we don't want to display to
everyone only the moderators and
administrators so if you are a moderator
or administrator then this is going to
be one and then you're going to echo out
the panel now the div is just for
spacing to
no make sure it appears on the left and
at the top so on and so forth this is
just to make a cool title and all of the
links are putting eastleigh neatly and
nicely into an unordered list so none of
that is really bad the bad thing is this
and I'm going to be talking about that
like I said in the next video but for
now thank you guys for watching don't
forget to subscribe and please check out
the next video and yeah everything will
make sense then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
