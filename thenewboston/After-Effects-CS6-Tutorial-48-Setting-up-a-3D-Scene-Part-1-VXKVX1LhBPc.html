buddy Blackford and this is Adobe After
Effects cs6 I've got a cool tutorial for
you here today about setting up a 3d
scene and I'll show you some tips and
give you the basics about setting up a
3d scene and we can go into more
advanced tutorials later on so the first
thing I like to do when I setup a 3d
scene is create a background so the way
I'm going to do that is by going up to
here and going to layer new solid and I
want to type in BG for background and
make sure it's the comp size they're all
these are correct I'm gonna hit OK
now I'm going to add an effect to it
called a ramp which is and generate ramp
now a nice-looking current trendy kind
of background uses a rip that uses a
ramp you can change that to radial and
I'll move this top starter the ramp here
right into the middle by dragging on
this like little crosshair I'll drop do
that or you can click on this button
right here and I'll make like a target
and then you can click again and that's
where we'll put your crosshair now I'm
gonna take the bottom part which is
there's another crosshair right here
drag it out like this so we get a nice
like fade-out now we can change the
different colors of the ramp now what
usually looks best is have a bright
color brighter color in the middle and a
darker color coming out so I'm gonna
click on what I did was click on this
color box right here and it brings up
the pick color picker and I like this
kind of blue so we'll go here to like a
light blue and then we'll pick our other
color and I can use this dropper right
here
click on that and I can sample the color
that I already already picked out click
on it and then just make a dad just
darker maybe make this one a little
lighter again
I'm gonna make a darker
and that gives you a ramp that's not too
crazy it's a subtle background but it
looks pretty nice I'm going to lock that
layer because I don't like messing with
my background because sometimes when you
go to drag an object you go to click on
it but you accidently drag the
background which is annoying so I'm
gonna go back to my project project
panel here and we need something in our
scene to make 3d and to move around in
3d space so I'm gonna create some text
let's go to layer click on your timeline
down here or else you won't be able to
or else layer will be grayed out so go
to layer new text and hashtag nothing
not hashtags I hate those 3d is sweet
good enough cuz I'm gonna Center that
somewhere around the center good enough
hopefully no one's too OCD because
sometimes I don't put things exactly
where they want to go and I'm just say
good enough so we've got that there the
next thing we need to do is make a
camera so that we can move it around or
move our text around to show that it's
in 3d so we're gonna come up to here and
go to layer new camera and I'll explain
what these all this stuff means edit at
another time but you can select 50
millimeter camera and just name it like
main camera or something like that and
it okay and it creates a camera down
here and your layers so when you're
working with 3d sometimes you need to
work with different views and basically
in 3d space so you come down to this to
this drop down menu here and it gives
you different camera views now you can
select main camera which is the one that
we made and now we're looking straight
through the camera but it looks it looks
the same you can't tell that we're
really
and 3d so you can we're going to change
our layout here to two views I don't I
want to go to views horizontal there we
go so the one on the right you can tell
what camera it is is the main camera you
can tell up here in the top of the panel</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
