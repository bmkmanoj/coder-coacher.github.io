slash on live gamer for the new Boston
and in this tutorial we're going to be
finishing our day action program that we
have been making now if you have no clue
what what you're looking at right now
you might want to move back a little bit
to the enumerations tutorial and these
last couple two doors built build on
each other and we make a day action
program now if you remember from the
previous tutorial when we run the
program
everything compiles and it works and if
we change the date it says as 1600
richard is but it doesn't actually tell
us what he's doing so what we're going
to do is we're going to use this
enumeration right here and we are going
to use state because we haven't your
state anywhere else in here so what
we're going to do is we're going to set
the value of state according to whatever
the value is that is passed to the set
function in property so we'll go ahead
and just before we set the text of label
state we're going to get the value of
the value that is passed it's an integer
we're going to get the value of that and
set state up here according to the value
so let's just go ahead and use an if
statement so if value now let's come up
here and see what we have for the first
one so we have asleep so if value is
let's say what are they going to be
sleep let's say 10 o'clock to 6 o'clock
so if value is greater than or equal to
20 and value is less than 6 then what
we're going to do is we're going to set
state equals and since state is of type
day action we can set state equals day
action dot and then we have our options
right here we'll just go ahead and go
with asleep now let's go ahead and come
up here and look
what else we have we have waking up so
what hours would they be waking up so
we'll go ahead and do an else--if right
here so else if value is greater than or
equal to 6 and value is less than 7 so
if it's 6 to 7 then what do what do we
want to do well we'll set state is equal
to day action dot waking up and we'll
just go ahead and do this for each one
of the values so we can go ahead and
type else if again and we can type if
value and let's see what we have next we
at school so let's just say that at
school from 8 o'clock until 3 o'clock so
if value is less than or equal to let's
say greater than or equal to 8 and value
is less than what's 3 o'clock in
military time we got 12 13 14 15 let's
do 15 so if it's greater than equal to 8
and less than 15 then day action or
state is going to be equal to day action
dot school and we'll create another
elsif here so else if value is let's see
what they have lunch so let's just say
they eat lunch at 11 to 12 so if it's
greater than or equal to 11 and value is
less than 12 then state equals day
action dot lunch
and we'll do this two more times so if
value is greater than or equal to let's
say they get home and they do let's just
say this is when they're doing homework
so when they get home so we'll go ahead
if it's greater than or equal to 16 and
value is less than let's say they work
until 6 o'clock so let's do 18 then
state is going to equal day action dot
home and we'll do this one last time
for the programming so let's just say
they do this as a hobby or something so
we'll go ahead if value is greater than
or equal to 18 and value is less than 10
o'clock so 20 then go ahead and state
equals day action home now when I was
making this el-sayf right here I did 16
greater than or equal to 16 in less than
18 I just went ahead and gave them an
hour for the bus ride but to make it
simpler let's just do 15 right there so
this one has to be less than 15 but this
can this one can be equal to 15 so now
we're going to use state to tell the
user what Richard is doing so we're
going to go ahead and type an end sign
right here and then we can just do
current or not current state dot to
string so what this is going to do is
it's going to take the value of state
and convert it to a string so if the
hour is image 1 6 &amp;amp; 7 then it's going to
say Richard is waking up so let's go
ahead and run this
and we will bring it over here and you
can see it says at 18 o'clock Richard is
home so right now
Richard would be home so we'll go ahead
and we'll set this to two o'clock and it
says at 14
Richard is school or at school and let's
change is something else I change this
to 22 or here let's do 12 o'clock p.m.
let's see um let's try something else
let's set this to 12 a.m. and it looks
like we have a problem with our code so
if values greater than equal 20 and
value is less than or equal to 6
ok looks like we had a little bit of a
problem with the sleeping due to the way
that the time is set up so I just went
ahead and took that out so let's go
ahead and get rid of a sleep right here
so we'll go ahead and run this and we
can go ahead and set this to 6 a.m. and
I said says s 6 Richard is waking up now
let's send Richard to school so at 10:00
Richard is at school and now let's get
him working on his homework so at 16
Richard is home now let's have Richard
start programming so we'll set it to
8:00 p.m. and at 20 Richard is home
let's set it to 10:00 p.m. okay looks
like we have another area we need to
come down here and find this and set it
equal to programming okay
so at 18 richard is programming so go
ahead and if you have an engine in this
code and already you can enter it in
play around with you want sorry I have
some errors in this program but I've had
some people comment on my other channel
saying that when I make errors it seems
more realistic because it might be
something that they run into so practice
with this make some properties if you
want to find you can challenge yourself
to find a different way to do this
because in programming there's a lot of
different ways to do the same thing and
as a programmer you need to find the
most efficient way of doing it so you
can make this program modify it do
whatever you want then once you're done
with that go ahead and move onto the
next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
