key tutorial and in this lesson what I'm
going to be doing is I'm going to be
giving you guys a detailed explanation
about each piece of a cute program means
and how to create a very simple cute
program so before what I did in the
second video is I was like you know what
just drag this here drag this here type
this bit of code press running there you
go but I really didn't explain
everything and I didn't do that because
first of all I didn't have that much
time and second of all I wanted to take
this tutorial to take you guys through
manually each line of the C++ code line
by the line and give you guys a full
understanding of what each part of a
project does so first of all let's go
ahead and create an entirely new project
cute widget project cute GUI application
just like before give it a name
Bucky sounds good oh my god I got the
freaking hiccups are you kidding me
right in the middle of my tutorial go
ahead and click next next next and
finish so basically we got a very basic
project set up our interface has nothing
in it right now
and we actually have this extra file
this main window dot cpp and this is
extra file that we really don't even
need for this story because the very
first function that gets called whenever
our program opens up and starts running
is this main function right here so we
are only interested in this function in
like I said we don't even need this main
window file at our it's just a file that
cute gives you whenever you first start
a project so since we don't need that
let's just go ahead and not even include
that and since we don't have that class
we don't need this object or this
function so basically the main framework
behind any basic very basic queue
application are these four lines right
here the very first line is an include
of the queue application now the reason
that we need to include this is because
this allows you to create objects that
are responsible for controlling your
entire program this is pretty much the
main arm this is how you create the main
object that do things like execute your
program which
start it up and begin running the
program so basically this is like the
main thing that you always need that's
the most simple way I can put it
controls the main event loop technically
so that's what that does and actually
instead of a that is in a very
descriptive object name I'm just going
to change that to Prague because that
means program it is responsible for
controlling your main program a little
more descriptive object name now of
course this is your main function right
here the main function that gets called
is the first function whenever your
program starts running this creates the
main object that controls your main
program and I guys might as well talk
about this line right now return program
execute what this does first is it
executes your program or starts running
the program now once it's done running
and it exits the main event loop it
returns zero
hopefully unless you mess something up
and whenever it returns zero that means
it returns zero to the main function
means that your program ran and ended
successfully so again like I said this
is the very basic framework and if you
run this program arm you know it would
run successfully but nothing would
really happen because of course we don't
have anything in our program yet we
don't have any buttons sliders menus so
let's go ahead and learn how to do that
right now so I'm going to be doing for
this example is I'm going to be putting
some plain text on the screen so or to
put plain text on the screen you
actually need to use something called a
cue label now what a label is not only
does it allow you to write text in the
label but you can also use images but
we'll just worry about text for now so
include cue label allows us to create
label objects so let's go ahead and do
that right now so in order to create a
very basic label in your GUI just go
ahead and write cue label that's the
class we're using it from and label
equals new not you new cue label and in
the constructor go ahead and write what
text do you want this label to be uh or
what text you want inside this label
just go ahead and write gametime like
that so now we created a label that says
game time on it but even though we
created it it doesn't appear on the GUI
until we tell it to so in order to make
it display on the screen what we need to
do is we need to use that label object
and call the function show and by the
way I've been programming Java for the
last I don't know probably like week or
so so if I accidentally call a function
a method please forgive me because
that's what they're called in Java by
anyways what this does right here is it
takes your label and what show does
basically says okay display it on the
screen so now if we go ahead and run
this program
we should have a nice little GUI after
it's done building check it out
probably the coolest program ever it
says game time right on screen I could
play with this program for days and days
pretty cool huh so there you go that is
how you create an entire program through
strict C++ code and hopefully you guys
have a little more understanding of you
know the code instead of the designer
interface because that's what this is a
C++ tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
