to another one for objective-c tutorial
and in this tutorial I'm gonna be few
Jean guys and it's called synthesized
access or methods sounds confusing but
it's really a lot easier than stuff we
learned before what this is is it's a
way to automatically generate setter and
getter methods for example I don't even
know if you guys knew it or not but what
we did right here is we built a setter
method and this pretty much took a
variable and set of value to it now this
is a pretty easy way to do this and
there's also something called a getter
method where you build a method to get
the variable just the variables of value
but since setter and getter methods are
you so commonly objective-c gave us an
easier way to make it so we didn't even
have to build these methods at all so
why did I see guys mmm just for fun just
because uh later on you might need to
know what but there's a way to bypass
this entire system and it's called
synthesized accessor methods so let me
show you guys how it works in case you
can't remember from like one tutorial go
we have three different parts of our
program our interface our implementation
right here in our main program so in our
interface what we did is we outline all
the methods that we're going to use in
all the variables that we're going to
use with our program simple enough so
instead of using setter and getter
methods in building them one by one by
one I mean if we have a bunch of
variable is this going to get old so go
ahead and delete your setter methods
which is set age and set weight and
these are methods that allow you to give
age in weight of value so go ahead and
delete these and instead under turn gray
right there
I don't know but oh whoa and instead
under your two variables when you
declare them what you want to do is put
the @ sign press
property and put int age weight now
what this does is this identifies the
variables in your program and identifies
that they are indeed properties probably
any variable that you have since this is
persons their age in their way is one of
the properties pretty much any variable
you have is a property with some
exceptions but anyways go ahead and
delete your method declarations which
were those setter method declarations
because we don't need them anymore and
instead put a property and what this
does again like I said identifies the
variables that you want to have
automatically setter and getter methods
generated for so now that we did that go
ahead to your implementation section and
again go ahead and delete the set age
and set weight right there so now we
only have one little method our print
method so now what we need to do is we
need those setter and getter methods but
we don't want to have to build them
ourselves we want to have objective-c
bonum for us so right above your print
method but remember you need to be
inside your implementation go ahead and
press at sin synthesize I don't know if
I spell it all right sy and th e si ze
good looks good and this is why it isn't
there we go I was like it should
automatically pop up but put the @ sign
and synthesize together that's why and
go ahead and write H weight and what
this does is if you're saying what the
heck to synthesize me synthesize
synthesize means automatically build our
setter and getter methods for us so you
know those two methods that we just
deleted now objective-c is automatically
gonna build them for us and in addition
to that it's automatically gonna bodas
get ur methods which allow us to get the
variable as well so
again that just have instead of probably
twelve lines of code now we have one
literal line of code and instead of
building the methods by hand Objective C
is gonna build them all automatically
for us don't believe me check this out
now
oh nice a text now in our main program
again these methods are no longer Bucky
set age and Bucky set weight now how do
we use what we just created or actually
our computer created it for us well any
time we want to change the property of
an instance all we need to do is write
the instance name and remember I already
created an object object an instance are
the same thing named Bucky and he has a
property called age and any time we
wanna what this would do right here is
the syntax is instance dot property so
if we want to change the value of it
just go ahead and put age is equal to 12
Bucky dot weight is equal to you know
five forty or something
so this is a lot easier than having to
pass a parameter or argument into a
method this is a lot simpler way just to
see it look at the object and then look
at the property then add a value to it
and again if you just want to print it
out it would just be like Bucky doubt
weight but we already have a nice print
method Bill for us actually we built
that so let's go ahead and build and run
this and see if I messed up anything
succeeded so now what we need to do is
build and run this and I am using my old
I had another console open for another
program that's why it wasn't working so
right here I am 12 years old in way 540
pounds Wow hello Maury and last but not
least this is how it worked so in the
interface section instead of all of your
different methods that you would build
instead you're just going to add a
property and what
this does is say all right these are the
things I want setter and getter methods
for I want to be able to change these
variables
that's essentially what I'm saying now
in your implementation you go ahead and
write synthesize agent Lloyd so remember
your implementation is where you build
your methods so instead of building on
my hand we just say synthesize them
which means Karina for us a lot easier
again and then instead of using methods
to change the Asian weight we just go
ahead and directly call that property
and change it right there so I mean this
is like five thousand times easier and
this is probably what we're gonna be
doing from now on but I mean I need to
show you guys how to build methods and
mission accomplished so this is called
synthesized accessor methods
hope you learned a little bit so thank
you guys for watching and I will see you
next time oh by the way don't forget to
