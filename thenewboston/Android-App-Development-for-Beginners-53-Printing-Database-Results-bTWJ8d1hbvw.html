to add to this little class is just a
method to print out the database as a
string just so we have something to
display for this example and this isn't
even really part of the tutorial I just
want to do this real quick so we'll say
print out the dead face as a string
alright so public string database to
string sounds like a good name for it
and what is this give me that is because
I named it products alright so that was
annoying me alright so any ways to
promote to that base of the string we
probably need a variable to save it in
again I'm just going to do this real
quick so try to explain everything
though all right now we need a reference
to the database and how about that
reference looks good alright now we need
a query to query the entire database so
string query set this equal to select
all from why are you not in where you're
supposed to be select all from the table
in the table is take the products we're
pretty good might as well just copy the
whole thing alright so the query to
select all the data is select star this
means everything from this table where
one one also means um every condition is
met so this means select every column
and this means select every row alright
so now that we have a query again this
tutorial doesn't really deal with
cursors or anything but just so I don't
leave you guys hanging in a cursor is
going to point to patient in your
results so just think of it like a
pointer where if this was the first row
then it would point to here if it was a
second row would point to here it's just
so Android can manage arm where you are
in your results and what you want to
print out and everything like that
and the object for that is see if you
just call DB query then you can pass
your query in null so now we have a
pointer and to move it to the very first
location move to the first row again so
this is a cursor and the results that is
pointing to is the results of this query
and to move it to the very beginning we
just call move to first on it not really
important but you know now what I want
to do is I want to say wow not see dot
is after last now I'll explain this in
just a second guy so get string in in
the parameter here get column index and
the index is product name and make sure
that this is not equal no all right so
what this is pretty much saying is the
see which is your cursor is after lest
you want to make sure that it's not
positioned after the last row this is
essentially saying make sure that you
still have some results to go when
you're done parsing through all of the
results of course I guess we can just
end this now probably make sense if you
just close your database and since this
method needs to return a string we're
just going to return the database string
so of course this is essentially going
to loop through each row in your
database so every time we loop through a
row we just want to tack on some
information on the string that we're
going to return because the string that
we return is going to be printed out
right here so again I know this is a
real quick one too but this is kind of
like extra
bonus stuff for your store oh so in
order to add stuff onto the string plus
equals see the cursor get string and
this is C get column index product name
and then DB plus equals and I just want
to bump it onto a new line and that is
because this is not a string art so in
order to get let's say we had three arm
different products so we would have
three different rows each of those
products would have an ID in a name so
it'd be like apples bacon and cats say
that it was the weirdest store in the
world all this would do is it would loop
through all the results in your table
every single product and every time it
did it extracted the name of that
product and then added it to the string
and this just makes it on a new line
because if we didn't then it would just
say like apples baking cats and it would
all run on one single line and it'll
look kind of weird so again this is what
all this is doing we clean this up a
little bit and alright looks good to go
so now the only thing that we have left
to do is we need to hop back in main
activity and we can actually delete both
of these right there and we just need to
make it so the interface right here can
interact with this database handler
pretty simple so actually do that in the
next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
