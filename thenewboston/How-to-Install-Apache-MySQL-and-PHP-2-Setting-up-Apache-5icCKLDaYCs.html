exactly Apache is Apache is just a web
server so what's a web server I'll give
you guys like the two men explanation
whenever you get on the internet and you
request to go to a website say you want
to go to Google what you do is you type
it in your browser and it sends it over
to Internet to one of Google's servers
and which is basically computer and that
computer is like alright Bucky wants to
go to this site so I'm going to deliver
the page to him google.com so it
basically is a server that processes his
request processes processes however you
freaking say it and when it gets a
request from someone it delivers the web
page or web content to them so it's
basically a web server that that's
pretty much it so in order to download
armed Apache we need to go to this web
page again it's the same one that we
went before and right now the version is
Apache two point four point nine and
again like I said even if you have a
64-bit operating system download this
version right here so go ahead and click
this it's kind of a it's not really that
big of a file but it was downloading
slow for me so I actually downloaded it
before this tutorial so let me go to we
can actually close out of here for right
now once you have it downloaded it's
going to go to your downloads folder and
I have it right here that's what it's
going to look like all right sorry I
someone was at my door selling freaking
oranges for school or something
my anyways where was I all right so we
have this Apache zip folder downloaded
so now what we want to do is if you
double-click it right here you're going
to see this thing called Apache 24 now
we want to go ahead and move it right to
our C Drive so take this folder and drag
it right on top of your C Drive and it's
going to go ahead and move it over there
so weight to that stone
is a kind of awkward so uh you know how
was your weekend guys yeah mine was
pretty good oh my god is this thing
freaking done yet
all right so once it's copied what we
can do is go to our C Drive and we see
we now have the folder right there it
says Apache 24 so what I want to do is I
actually want to change the name of that
to Apache so I'm going to go ahead and
delete 24 and another thing that I want
to do is in also make sure that if you
change your name um know exactly what
you named it and also the case of it as
well for example if you are you know
just remember that it starts with the
capital A that's it so now what we need
to do is we need to open Notepad or any
text editor you have if you don't have
no pad + + then you can just use notepad
that's fine so what I want to do now is
I want to edit a file that was in one of
those folders that I just move to the C
Drive so file open and if you go to the
C Drive Apache there's going to be a
folder called conf and inside that
there's going to be a file called HTTP D
ok there's a squirrel running right in
front of my window and it's very
distracting
but anyways go ahead and open this and
what this is is your Apache
configuration file it pretty much has a
bunch of settings in order to run Apache
from your computer and one thing that we
need to do is we need to say where
exactly that folder is and what's the
name of it now I actually named the
folder
this was default 1 C Apache 24 so what I
want to do is I actually need to go
through and if I copy this then what I
can do is I could search find
and replace this with oops Apache so
basically the default setting um called
the folder Apache 24 but remember we
renamed that folder so what it's going
to do is it's going to go through this
configuration file and change all these
Apache 24s to Apache so check it out
replace all six instances replaced and
now the configuration file is set up
properly with the name of your new
folder pretty freaking cool so now all
we have to do in this file is change one
small other thing and if you scroll all
the way down to line let's see what line
is on right here 217 you're going to see
this little comment right here this
little hash tag means it's commented out
so delete that and by default the server
name is WWE example.com and what we want
to do is we want to delete that and
change it to local host
now local host pretty much means my
computer keep the port 80 so now
basically what we're saying if we go
ahead and save this file is alright I'm
running Apache on my computer
aka localhost in the name of the folder
whenever you're looking for Apache is C
colon slash Apache so that's all we have
to do for this configuration file like I
said we can just save that and close out
of there
and now believe it in around Apache is
pretty much set up and it's good to go
and if you guys want to test this out
then what you can do is you can open up
your command prompt in just type CMD and
hit enter in order to open in Windows
now the first thing that we need to do
is we need to change our directory and
if you guys aren't familiar with command
prompt put actually I better talk you
guys through this put CD slash Apache
and put another slash and put bin and
this is going to pretty much uh this
means change directory which pretty much
means change folder
then this pretty much puts you in the
Apache folder so now what we can do is
we can go ahead and type the name of
that file HTTP and it was d exe and
whenever we hit enter
um I don't know if you guys can see this
either because I don't know if my screen
recorder is going to pick up these
little window alerts but this is pretty
much saying hey Windows Firewall thinks
something's up but it's actually us
doing it so we can go ahead and allow
access and now what's happening is
Apache is running on our computer so we
can go ahead and open a browser and from
a browser if you type local host and hit
enter you're going to get this file that
says it works and this actually is a
file that came whenever you are
downloaded Apache so you know it's not
like I didn't hack into your computer
and write this or anything if you see
this then you followed my instructions
perfectly and it pretty much is saying
Apache is running and it's set up
properly the first piece of the puzzle
is doing good your patchy web server is
good to go so we can go ahead and close
out of that and now that we have Apache
downloaded and installed the next thing
that we need to do is we need to
download it and install PHP so I'm going
to do that in the next video it's going
to be freaking awesome so I will see
there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
