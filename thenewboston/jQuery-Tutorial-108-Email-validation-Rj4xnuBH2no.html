check the email address again so let's
click in here okay so it tells us going
into a valid email address I'm gonna
enter a valid email address and come
away then I'm going to click back in and
you can see that we don't have the same
message instead what we want to do is
something else and that is to check the
email as well so we're gonna leave this
for now I'm just going to change this
text here to say check email address
valid because what we want to do is if
the user has entered something into here
and then they click back into it we want
to revalidate it it doesn't matter
whether they've entered a valid or for
example an invalid email address we want
to revalidate it so we can tell the user
again if the email address is invalid or
if it's valid so now we need to create
the actual function that will do that
will will outline it at the top of our
page and this is going to be let's just
call this validate email
and in that we take an email address so
here's our function validate email now
it's going to cool it here it's going to
call this function just here so this
this bit later on when we've actually
filled in the block in here we'll equal
or we'll call the validate email
function also when we have a key up
event we also want to call the validate
email function as well so we've appended
like we have with blur the key up
function or the key up event had long to
the end of here and inside we want to go
ahead and create a function so in here
what's going to happen is we're going to
first of all retrieve the value of the
in fact we don't have to read have to
store this in a variable to waste memory
we can go ahead and call the validate
email function directly and here we want
to supply an email address and the email
address that we wanted to supply is the
email address field so email dot Val so
I've used a selector and the valve
function in jQuery to grab the value of
this email address field so we also want
to do this here so we can just copy and
paste that there so we've used this
function outside of here because
otherwise we would have to duplicate the
code here and here to validate the email
address now this function is going to
deal with the Ajax request and it's
going to take this email address here
it's gonna feed it to a PHP page which
we're going to create in just a moment
and it's going to you know PHP is going
to handle the validation it's then going
to return the result of this and then
with valid email we can return the
result and then we can put that into a
or we don't have to return the result
from this function we can go ahead and
just put this straight into our field
it's probably better practice though to
return the value so perhaps we'll do
that instead okay so now I need to think
about what what we're going to write
inside of our function well we're going
to use the post a jack
request so I've just outlined this here
it's a dollar sign a full stop post and
in brackets inside brackets we're gonna
give this three parameters the first one
obviously there's a comma separated the
first one is going to be the file we're
looking for or we're submitting our data
to the second in curly brackets remember
this is extremely important is going to
be our data and the third is a callback
function which is going to hold the
result returned by this page so that is
function data and we can go ahead and
bring that down okay so the file that
we're submitting this particular data to
that will eventually appear inside of
our brackets is PHP /e male PHP we need
to send some values so we are sending a
variable called email and this is going
to be the value we pick up inside PHP
and the email here is the one that we
want to put in here to be submitted so
I've used the same variable name here
and here but not to be confused this is
the name of the variable that we're
sending and this is the value retrieved
from our function so now that we've done
that it's going to submit this variable
here with this value to PHP /e male PHP
so the first thing to do is go ahead and
create that file and we're just going to
outline PHP tags and I'm going to save
this inside our PHP folder as email dot
PHP now that I have that we can actually
run some tests before we start to
validate so we can run tests to see if
our owl Ajax or our jQuery is working so
I'm simply going to say
email feedback dots text data now
remember this data here is what is
what's returned from this file here so
we've we've created a callback function
with data as the handler or the variable
that handles what's returned from this
file here and then we're just putting
that inside of our email feedback span
so now what should happen is we are
using the validate email function or
calling this with the email that we've
picked up we are then using what we're
calling this validate email function
supplying an email for example Alex at
PHP academy' de org this is then sent to
email dot PHP with the variable name
email and this value here would
correspond to Alex at PHP academy' de
org data then contains whatever email
throws back asks for example if we echo
something out in here we were to echo
hello hello would then be inside of date
this data variable here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
