and in this video what we're going to be
doing is we're going to be finishing to
set up Eclipse and also if we have time
we're going to start some coding so the
first thing I want you to do now is go
ahead and right-click your project name
which should be hand blaster and go the
way go to properties just like we did
before now by default since you were
already working in this section you
should see libraries but if you don't
just go ahead and click on Java build
path in libraries now once you do this
you're going to see all of the jars that
you are you know downloaded go ahead and
click this little arrow and expand LW
JGL jar and once you do that you're
going to have four options to choose
from go ahead and select native library
location now by default right now it
should say none in parentheses so go
ahead and highlight that now once you do
every button on the right hand side is
going to be grayed out except edit so go
ahead and click edit now what we want to
do is we want to tell it that we're
going to be working with a Windows
workspace so go ahead and instead of
typing the location path the easier
thing to do is just go ahead and select
workspace now we want to go ahead and
navigate to where our windows folder is
so go ahead and expand this and if you
can't remember well just go ahead and
look on the left hand side of your
screen you can see the directories but
go ahead and expand Lib now natives in
Windows now don't go ahead and expand
windows we just go ahead and um I gotta
quit saying go ahead go ahead go ahead
go ahead what we have to do now is just
select the folder itself and hit OK now
once we do that our path is going to be
to our windows folder hit OK again and
hit it again and bam we're good to go so
that's basically all we have to do to
set up the core libraries now what we
have to do is just uh make some actual
Java so of course before we can start
coding we need some classes but before
you start you know organizing all the
classes and writing some code
Syd's variables and crap I want to go
ahead and give you guys a little
background on the type of game that
we're making there are a few different
types of games that we can make but
we're going to focus on is something
called a state based game now right now
think of old nintendo games where each
state would actually be a screen so you
remember whenever you're playing um I
don't know like Super Mario Brothers you
first popped in the game in your
Nintendo and you saw it said okay Super
Mario Brothers that's the title screen
that title screen would be a state the
menu now if you were playing level 1
while you were playing you went to a
different screen that would be different
state if you wanted to view the high
scores that would be a different state
or screen if you wanted to you know view
the settings that would be different
ones so I will probably use the terms
state in screen interchangeably but they
really mean the same thing so in this
tutorial what we're going to do is we're
going to make a simple two state game
we're going to have the main menu which
is one state in the area that you play
which is you know probably a bunch of
hams going around shooting things that's
going to be another state so go ahead
and right click Java game or whatever
you name your package and what we need
to do now is of course make a new class
so new class now this is how I'm going
to set it up basically we may change
things up a little bit but each state is
going to have its own class you're going
to have the menu class which has the
main menu which says like start quit
exit and we're going to also have the
playing class which is going to be you
know the playing screen but before we
even jump into making the screens I need
a class called game so go ahead and name
this game and you also want to include
the main method in here so include that
and hit finish now why am I making this
class if it isn't a state it isn't a
screen well I'm making this class
because this is pretty much the master
class
the main brains behind our
the thing that controls everything so
this is like the boss class is going to
make okay I control everything on God so
that's what this class is going to be
responsible for and all the other
classes are pretty much going to
resemble different screens or States so
I know I'm stressing that but it's a
very important concept you have to get
in your heads one way or another so
actually I thought I was going to have
to type that in but it's already good to
go
so we already um have packaged Java game
which pretty much says okay we're
working in the Java game package now the
first thing I want to do is go ahead and
delete these comments because I hate
comments I can make my own now before we
actually start typing variables or
anything we have to import two different
things we actually have to import a
bunch of stuff but uh we can do it in
two statements and I'm not I think about
it this video is getting kind of long
and I didn't type anything yet so in the
next video I can't wait to get my
fingers on these keys and start typing
some Java code so we're going to be
typing the code I'm going to be going
through line by line telling you why you
need each line what does and why it's
useful so guys thank you for sticking
along with me this song we finally made
it
ready start talking some Java so anyways
thank you guys for watching don't forget
to subscribe and I'll see you guys in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
