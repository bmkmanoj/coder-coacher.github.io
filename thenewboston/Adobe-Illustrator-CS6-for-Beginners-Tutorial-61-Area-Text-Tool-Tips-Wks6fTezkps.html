be Illustrator cs6 tutorial and we're
gonna keep on going from our last
tutorial where I'm going to go over some
of the different tips that might not be
right from your face when you're using
the different type tools and maybe some
problems that might show up so the first
type tool that we're gonna use in this
video is the area type tool so go ahead
and click on that and then we're also
going to want a path be yeah a path
because that's what the area type tool
types and it types in a path so go ahead
and make something and I made an ellipse
so when you're using the area type tool
you need to click on the actual path and
then you'll be able to actually type in
if you click on the inside you'll get
this pop-up that says you must click on
a non compound not masking path to
create text inside a path okay so
basically all that means is click on the
path and then you can start typing now
if you notice the stroke is gone from
the path and you might be like well what
the hell I and then when you go to try
to put it on you know I'm doing
something when you go to try to put it
on well the stroke doesn't seem like
it's there okay what's wrong all right
well the thing that's wrong is that the
type this type tool actually converts
the path to a type object and it takes
away all the attributes that I had
before and a plot it's going to apply
them to the text so let's go back a
couple times and I have my object here
if you want to keep this like object so
I want to keep this ring right here what
do you need to do is copy and paste it
so go to edit copy and then we'll go to
edit paste in place and if I go ahead
and move it you can see that there's two
now when I go to type it's going to make
one of the paths into the text object
and one of the past is just going to
stay like it was before so now we're
getting somewhere
I don't know if I spelled that right or
not for some reason I think I didn't but
who knows all right so let's check out
some more things about the area type
tool so if you're typing in an area like
this and you're getting these hyphenated
words and you don't really want them all
you need to do is go ahead and just make
another space and now your word isn't so
hyphenated that happens a lot when you
have like a circle as your path or
whatever you just need to make a couple
more spaces and then you'll be able to
start from somewhere from some other
place within within the path you can
also apply your paragraph tools to like
start in the middle or something like
that and there you go
so just mess around with some of these
and it pretty much works like you're
making a paragraph but it's pretty much
just inside of it inside of a path or or
an object as you can see here and when I
move these around you can see the path
and you can see the text is inside it
and you can see our old path is still
intact so I just hit control Z to bring
it back to where it was
so area typing has a special section
within the type menu which is up here
type menu and we can go to I need to
click on it first let's click on our
area we need to go to type and then we
can go to area type options and now we
get a dialog box and we can set the
width and the height here we can add
columns and rows and change their span
and we have offset here where we can put
our inset spacing in and things like
paragraphs settings here basically and
then we've got our text flow so the text
can go from right till from left to
right and then go down start another
line or it can be by the columns from
left to right and if you ever want to
check out what you're doing just use the
preview button so I can bring this that
are bringing the width down and you can
see that the
to a width of the textbox is going down
let's try if we do a couple rows you can
see that's happening there and now I've
got rows attacks so I can make different
columns there yeah I was saying rows
before but I meant columns and here I'm
adding rows and then we as we can see
here here's our offset spacing and you
can see what this is doing and as I hit
make it go up the actual spacing that
you can type in actually goes down so
that's what that is and you can mess
with the other options I don't really
need to go on to a mile for you and when
you mess around with these things on
your own
you tend to learn a little bit little
bit a little bit better than just
someone talking to you so I'm just going
to hit cancel it's all going to go back
to where it was and it looks like this
is a good spot to stop and that's it for
talking about the area type tool so
remember you've got the options and
remember that you need to click on the
path when you're typing and if you want
to keep the like a stroke or something
like that with color or any effects you
have on it duplicate the object first
and then start using your text area text
tool so thanks a lot for watching the
tutorial I look forward to see you guys
in the next one have a good day
