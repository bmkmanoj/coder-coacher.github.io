tutorial and Adobe Premiere Pro and in
this story I'm going to be going over a
very helpful and important part of Adobe
Premiere Pro and those are panels now
you probably already know what panels
are it's all of these things but uh if
you're just watching this tutorial for
the first time then what panels are are
pretty much all of Adobe's tools are
docked and panels and all the tools that
you ever needed don't be put into a
panel so all the similar tools are
grouped together for instance this is
the project panel this effects panel
source panel in the first panel that you
don't want to see or you do want to see
and just go up here to window and any
these are all the panels right here if
there's a check mark next to it then it
means it's showing somewhere on the
screen and if there's no check mark that
means it's not showing so if you do want
it to show just click it and it will
show up so with that being said let's
get started as you can see all of these
panels are in a fixed location and you
can't move them around yet and that's
what we're going to be teaching you had
to do and as you can see some take up a
little space and some take up a lot of
space and people might want to change
this up a bit depending on what kind of
projects are working on so the first
thing that we need to learn how to do is
how to resize panels to do this scroll
over the edge of a panel until you get
this little symbol that has two double
arrows facing left to right with two
little parallel bars in the middle and
click down and you can drag a panel to
make it smaller or bigger now since
these panels are docked together which
means that they're connected resizing
one also resizes the other panel so as
you can see is I'm dragging one the
other
one's getting bigger or smaller so go
ahead and test this out and you learn
how to make the panels bigger and
smaller now the other thing that you
might want to do is remove a panel from
its group as you can see this panel is
alone while this panel has three
different panels in its group effects
source audio now if you want to get one
of these alone then here's what you have
to do as you can see once i highlight
panel or click on it three little dots
appear beside its name actually five
little dots if you want to go ahead and
separate that from this group as you can
see we have effects control source audio
mixer click and hold those dots and drag
it to somewhere else on the screen I'm
going to drag minor right here and let
go as you can see this panel effects
control and source now only has to an
audio mixer is alone in its own separate
panel and of course if you want to drag
that back just click on the dots and
drag it back until the title bar is
highlighted purple then just let go as
you can see one two three they're all
right there again so that's how you can
separate different panels or group them
together in a nice tab of fashion now
another thing that you might want to do
is undock panels and as you can see
these panels are kind all kind of stuck
together not like they usually are when
I you're working with windows or
something like that so to undock a panel
what you have to do is hold down the
ctrl tab on your keyboard and I assume
when you're working with the pc and
click where we did before to move it
around now as you can see our panel is
undocked and it can go anywhere freely
on the screen now we have a regular
window like we would when we were just
working with basic windows or
something like that and again if we want
to in this again it's called a floating
window because it's not dr. anywhere
just kind of floating around your screen
now actually I would never recommend
doing this because I think it's really
annoying and it kind of gets in the way
of every single other window but uh I
just had to show you a sense people
would be mad at me if I didn't so I'm
going to go ahead and get this back by
clicking and I'm not going to hold
control this time I'm just going to let
go so remember hold down control
whenever you want undock and when you
want to dock it don't hold control it
all now once we got our workspace setup
just how we like it you might want to go
ahead and save it or if you're made of
familiar workspace that you know you're
going to want to be using a lot you're
going to want to go ahead and say that
and to do that it's very simple go up to
this thing that says window go to work
space and go to new workspace now we're
going to name our workspace and I'm
going to name mine youtube since this is
for you to then go ahead and click OK
and as you can see when you go to window
workspace we automatically have our save
youtube workspace so anytime we shuffle
around windows and want to get back to
this just go ahead and click you to
begin and I'll pull us back to this and
again if you want to delete a workspace
just go down and delete whatever one you
want to then click OK I don't want to
delete that one I'll keep it and that's
how you can save windows in how
rearrange panels resize them and make
them float so study this tutorial and
get familiar with your panels and get
yourself a nice workspace that you want
because you're going to be using it a
lot and I hope you enjoyed and make sure
