Android tutorial I believe it is let me
check
just make sure 63rd 63rd Android
tutorial feels like the 64th for some
reason basically what I want you guys to
do in this tutorial is uh you know
either we can work with that Plus that
you guys created earlier or just create
a new little image that's 75 pixels by
75 and save it in your resource folder
called it green ball if you guys want to
follow along exactly with the code but
then just clean the project make sure
everything is working now what we're
going to do is we're going to create our
actual view which is going to hold our
animation or or whatever we're going to
want to do with this I haven't I'm not
quite sure exactly what I want to do yet
because you don't really want to use
this technique so much because it's
going to interfere with the user
interface or input stuff but okay first
let's just get into it before I confuse
you guys let's create a new class called
my bring back or whatever you guys
define this class name as the computer
doesn't crash here so you can either go
new class like this or I think you could
probably just hover over that and create
a class that way but make sure it's the
same as whatever you define your
variable type as so my bring back like
that and now we have this class called
my bring back what we're going to do in
this class is instead of extending
activity class we're going to say
extends view and you know we got an
import view and then it says hey we're
basically going to have to use a
constructor and you're like what's a
constructor well basically when we go
back into our graphics effects FX or GFX
I'll be switching between these back and
forth so if you guys get confused where
I'm at it's one of those two basically
what we're doing is we're saying hey we
want to new my bring back object we're
going to pass in some information when
we pass it in while we're passing in
this referring to the context of this
class that's what we're passing in so
now we need to get kind of a receiver
basically this through the football and
we need someone to catch it so basically
this constructor is going to catch that
information and create or you know
construct something from the information
that it gets so what we're going to do
is we can either probably just hover
over here again it'll add it for us
because as you can see you're going to
add as many print parameters as you want
and so we're just going to add the one
that takes into context because again we
did pass in a context and attribute set
or contracts and attribute set or int I
mean those are basically probably the
ones that most likely you're going to
use but you know you can also create
your own type of constructor for the
most part the sense again our taste in
the context we're going to click this
and there we go we set up a constructor
and now when we pass in the context of
this class it's basically you're going
to be like okay we got some context
right here we're going to call it
context so we can use it within this
opening bracket and within here we can
define some variables all that good
stuff so let's set up let's set up a
variable
well first we want something that's
going to happen or be able to be used
within our whole class we're going to
say bitmap and we're going to call it G
ball for green ball and we are going to
define it yet we're just going to say
hey there's going to be this variable
look out for it and now within our
constructor let's define it within there
so we're going to say G ball equals and
I believe we've done I believe we've
done setting up bitmaps before from a
resource folder but just in case you
guys forgot we're going to say bitmap
factory just you know repetition is
always good dot decode resources for
decode was it resource which one a
decode resource right here with the
resource and the int and then we're
going to click that and for this first
one we're going to say get read
method right here and then for this one
it's going to be our actual ID with in
our drawable folder that we just added
and again I called mine green ball so
it's going to be our dot drawable dot
green ball right there and basically
we've set up that variable type now I
think that's probably all I'm going to
cover for this tutorial I don't want to
get into too much yet but basically the
thing that we did is we created a
constructor and when you create a
constructor also as you notice it's the
same name as our class name so a
constructor has to be the same name as
your class name is and then you know you
give it the parameters that's going to
take in or the information it's looking
for and then basically when we create a
new object like we did in our graphics
here you can give some information to
start it up or give it some you know
specific information and then the mind
bring back classes can be like okay I'm
going to process this stuff I'm going to
create this unique thing for you and
pass it back so it's given it a new
object or new instance which is what we
are creating here for our view so I
don't know if that made sense or not but
basically that's just how we can create
a constructor so I will catch guys in
the next tutorial and we'll get into
some you know a little bit of animation
so see you then peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
