27th JavaScript tutorial and in this
tutorial I'm going to be teaching you
guys how to add methods to your objects
so let's go ahead and the first thing
that we need is a constructor function
so function go ahead and name in just
people or something and just like before
we'll give it a name and an age so all
these people will have two properties a
name and an age and you make sure if
that by setting their objects name to
whatever we pass in for name and the
objects age to whatever we pass in for
age simple enough so we have a
constructor function now we can begin
actually making objects so far let's go
ahead and make an object called Natalie
and set equal to we don't need that yet
a new object from the people blueprint
basically and the name it takes two
parameters first named natalie portman
and her age she's probably like the 28
I'm guessing I don't know who knows so
anyways we already know that we can
access you know Natalie's name now he's
age we can go ahead and print that out
yadda yadda we learned that before but
what we're learning in this tutorial is
how to add methods to this object in by
the way a method is pretty much just a
function that uses some of these
properties so you know how a function
might calculate the temperature
converted to Fahrenheit to Kelvin
well methods take properties like this
like it would take her age and calculate
how many years until retirement or
calculate when she's going to die or
calculate when she was born or something
like that so it takes some of these
properties from this object and it makes
the calculation with it so let's go
ahead and calculate how many years until
natalie portman can retire she can
probably retire right now because she's
extremely wealthy but let's go ahead and
say that the retirement age is 65 so in
order to create a method here's what we
do just like any other function go ahead
and give it a name years left looks good
won't take any parameters and the first
thing that we need to do is calculate or
in other words give a variable that we
can return so let's go ahead and make a
variable named num years and this is
going to store the number of years until
she turns 65 because it's 65 she can
retire so let's go ahead and just write
65 minus her age and in order to use
this object's age you use this dot age
and whatever object you pass in for
there it's going to take their age and
it's going to subtract it to 65 from 65
excuse me
so I'm 24 so if it was the calculate for
me it would be 41 if someone was 20 it
would be 45 if someone was 65 it would
be zero so anyways how many years until
you turn 65 that's what's going to be
stored right in here and now remember
whenever we wanted to make a calculation
and give us the answer back we need to
return it
whenever returns something it takes that
calculation and returns it to you so
then you can print out the value of it
and cool stuff like that so num years so
what I like to do is just go ahead and
highlight that to make sure they're both
the same and now that they're both the
same we're good to go
so this function is basically going to
work like this whenever you call this
function it's going to say all right
what object did you give me I'm going to
take their age I'm going to subtract it
from 65 and I'm going to give you the
answer back simple enough birthday and
all right here is the blueprint for the
object so how does this object know to
use that function well it doesn't just
yet so that's what we have to do in this
next line of code in order to tell this
object the
at basically we want to use this
function or in order to sell it that
this function is just not a random
function we actually want to associate
it with this object here's what we need
to do just like every other thing every
other object property you go ahead and
assign this dot and then you write
whatever you want your property to be
named and just go ahead and put um years
until retire or something like that
I suppose I look for you marry
everything right looks good enough so
then what you do is you have three
properties for your object every person
in the world has a name has an age and
has a certain amount of years until they
can retire their name is whatever we
give it their ages whatever you give it
and the years until retire it has to
make a calculation what is that
calculation going to be based off it's
going to be based off this function
right here so we don't set it equal to a
number like 65 or anything like that we
set it equal to the name of this
function so if we go ahead and copy that
and paste it and here's the one thing
that can confuse you guys you don't add
parentheses at the end of this I know
it's weird but they made it this way so
your object knows that this method is
associated with this object so this
makes sense we pass it in a name we pass
it in an age but for this the last one
we make it just like any other object
property just like this one or this one
but instead of a value that we pass it
in we set equal to a name of a function
without the parameters and the reason we
don't add parameters for that is because
it's going to take all its parameters
already from the object
pretty cool huh so now with that being
said let's just go ahead and use this so
now we can do something like documents
right again we already have an object
Natalie her name's Natalie Portman and
her age is 28 so now any time we want to
calculate her years until you're tired
here's what we do just go ahead and
write the name of the object
Nataly and then just go ahead and write
years check it out
she has three properties we can either
print out her name her age or years or
years until retire so just go ahead and
copy that paste it and here is where you
need parameters just like that
simple enough so let's go ahead and
print it out see how it works
37 years until natalie portman can
retire so let's go ahead and make
another object real quick one for me why
not um I'll make an object Bucky my name
is of course Bucky
Roberts and my age is 24 so now let's go
ahead and put Bucky years and so I'll
retire save it and see what I get 41 41
years until I can retire so basically to
sum it up one last time this is what you
do whenever you want to add methods to
your object you already have constructor
function with properties I have a name I
have an age we know all that so whenever
you want to assign a function to your
object you take the name of the function
and you assign it just like you would
any other object property simple enough
and don't forget whenever you make your
function the only thing you have to do
to get the extra information is put this
object's age if we wanted to print out
my name you would write like document
write this name easy enough so then
whenever you want to actually use that
function or excuse me the method now you
just write the name of your object and
then
right there check it out not the
function name but the object property
name simple enough so there are just a
couple neat little tricks they have to
watch out for the first one is don't
include your parentheses right here
that's your way of telling drive a
script that this method is actually a
part of this object because it has no
parentheses and the last thing is
whenever you actually use it add your
parentheses
after this it's a little confusing but
trust me if you make like if you do it
like three times you'll get the hang of
it and it'll be a breeze so that is how
you add methods to objects so now we
basically learn everything about object
how to create a constructor function how
to add basic properties and how to add
methods so simple enough thank you guys
for watching and next tutorial probably
going to be talking about objects a
little more so if you were confused at
all just move on next one then oh I've
got some phlegm in my throat and you'll
be fine so again thanks for watching to
subscribe and I'll see you next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
