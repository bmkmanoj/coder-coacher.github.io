ahead and create an external javascript
file that's going to handle this so I'm
gonna save this out in my jjs directory
room then the index dot PHP is the file
we're currently working with j/s is
where our JavaScript files are kept so
I'm gonna save this as pages or will
just say Navi is that would make it a
lot more sense
so Navi is we now need to go ahead and
include on our page so the script type
is text slash JavaScript the source is
js4 slash Navi is and we'll end the
script there
so we've now included Navi is on our
page and we can use this to pick up
these links that belong to the menu top
class and then load the appropriate
content into the content area div so
quite simple and the code is also
extremely simple as well so we need to
use a selector in jQuery to select the
everything that belongs to this
particular class menu top so we need to
say dot menu underscore top and then
we're going to say dot click and then a
function inside of here so essentially
what's going to happen is when we click
any link that has the class menu top we
want to do something inside of these
function brackets so we'll just pull
that down so it's a lot easier for us to
read let's just say for example at the
moment alert clicked now we have one of
two problems the first well one of the
problems is that we haven't actually you
know loaded the content into the Divya
when I click on home you can see it says
clicked however then it redirects to
home dot PHP now what we want to happen
is these links to be uh none forwardable
we don't want them to go over to the
pages directory and select the
particular file once we've clicked them
so we can do this using return false at
the very end of our function definition
so all of our other code will go here
and as long as return folks is at the
end this will not redirect the user to
the page so I've just gone ahead and
refresh the page when I click home we
have this clicked dialog appear but when
I press it press ok you can see that now
it hasn't redirected us two pages
forward slash home dot PHP and the same
with the other links as well so when we
click a link it says clicked but it
doesn't actually forward us to the page
which is what we want because we want to
then show the contents of the page in
the div area down here so now that we've
done that let's go ahead and get rid of
of the alert and the first thing we want
to do is we want to determine based on
which link where we are going so if we
click home we want to show the content
of home dot PHP if we click portfolio we
want to show this content of portfolio
dot PHP and then the same with contact
as well so we need to create a variable
called href and this is going to take
the attribute from these links so this
is an attribute and this is the value of
the attribute so we want to take the
value of href based on when we click it
so we simply reference this remember
this will refer to any any member in
menu top but when we define it as this
what it does is it takes only the
current link that we've clicked let me
just go ahead and show you what would
happen if we do dot menu top we want to
use the actual function which will take
a particular attribute from these this
class here so the class menu top we want
to take H ref so we type H ref in here
so now VAR href will hold the reference
the link location inside of this
variable so let's go ahead and alert H
ref now this isn't going to work because
we've used a selector menu top instead
of this so when we click home you can
see that we get oh it does work our
oh no okay it doesn't okay so now you
can see the problem we've got Paige's
home dot php' for each link and that's
because we're only referring to one
instance of this class what we want to
do is we want to use this and this will
then refer to whichever link has been
clicked so now by the changing by
changing that to this pages for such
home and now it says pages for such
portfolio.php and the same with contact
as well so now that we've got the actual
link based on the href here we can go
ahead and do something with this so what
we want to do is we want to reference or
select the content area so we're going
to go ahead and say hash Content area
and we want to say darked load and then
we want to load the location which is
the href so just a quick tip now or just
a quick pointer now the way we've done
this which means that whichever menu we
choose whichever menu item we choose it
will link to the appropriate place
because we've used this menu top class
and it will just instantly take the href
associated with it so there's no
JavaScript page on here and like an
on-click event for example unclick
equals like load you know and we could
we could say loathe pages /home dot PHP
this would be bad because we're using
inline scripting so to to cut this out
we have just taken the attribute
associated with the link so an extremely
effective way to do things</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
