After Effects tutorial and in this
tutorial I'm gonna be teaching you guys
how you use the graph editor to edit the
keyframe velocity so go ahead and keep
our position path just like this and
what we're gonna want to do next is make
a new rotation so again highlight your
layer and click R for rotation now make
sure that you can edit keyframes and I'm
just gonna make three keyframes real
quick one in the middle I'll make this
one you can do anything I make my 326°
that's pretty random and I'll make my
next one actually I make this one
268 sounds like good numbers me so now
after you're done doing this click home
to go back to your beginning in to
adjust the keyframe velocity of this we
want to work with something called the
graph editor now your graph editor is
right here so click that and as you can
see your little um keyframes converted
in a nice graph these yellow squares
right here represent your keyframes now
this is a visual tool that you can look
and see just how much your object is
rotating from left to right on the
x-axis left to right represents time and
on your y-axis these numbers represent
the degrees and what your object rotates
so in about one second our object is
going to rotate 300 degrees that's what
it's telling you right now and again if
you want to adjust these two just grab
ahold of them and either move them up
which is going to increase their
rotation down which is going to decrease
the rotation left which is gonna make it
rotate faster in or right that's gonna
make it rotate slower so I'm gonna leave
mine to rotate about 200 degrees in
about one second so once you learn how
you can move those this will give you a
certain control over your rotation and
again if you want to hover over a line
the little box is gonna pop up that show
you in that point in time what the
rotation of your object is gonna be so
after 20 frames Charlie's gonna be
rotated at 135 degrees now to give you
even more control over your rotation
just like we did in the last tutorial we
learned how to ease in and ease out but
we didn't exactly learn how to edit that
manually to do that we need to either
use this little button and this is the
easy ease bun go ahead and click that
and now you can visually see your object
ease in and ease out in the last
tutorial
we just click the button we were kind of
stuck with defaults and in this tutorial
we can edit the ease-in and ease-out
using these handles these handles just
like using on using them on your motion
path the greater you drag them the more
I don't know how it call a severe or
something that uh your things gonna ease
in or ease out as you can see it's gonna
start out rotating real fast then at the
end it's gonna kind of level off and
rotate kind of slow so enough talking
let me show you guys what this means
as you can see Charlie starts out going
real fast and then he slows eases down
and this is represented again in our
motion path the more dramatic the slope
the more dramatic he's gonna rotate in
the more even the slope the less he's
gonna rotate so right here in about ten
frames he rotated about two hundred
fifty degrees and then next ten frames
he only rotated about twenty degrees so
again that's how you can use your
handles and your ease easy ease button
to manually control the rotation and
ease of your keyframes and again if you
want to toggle that off just click
little button right here this is a graph
editor and if you want to get rid of it
completely again hold down control and
click the button and those will bring
you back to the normal keyframes so that
is how you use handles and the graph
editor to edit keyframe of velocity it
probably doesn't sound too useful but
trust me in the future it's gonna help
you out a ton so study that play around
with the graph editor a little bit in
the easies functions and once you learn
all this you can move on to my next
tutorial so I'll see you then thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
