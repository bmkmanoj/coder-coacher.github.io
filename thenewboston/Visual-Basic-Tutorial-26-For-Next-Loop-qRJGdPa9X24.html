slash on live gamer for the new boston
and in this tutorial we're going to be
taking a look at a for loop now loops
are a very important part of programming
and basically what loops do is it will
repeat a series of code or a block of
code for you a certain amount of times
now with the for loop it does that block
of code however many times you want it
to and later on we're going to be using
loops that will do it based on other
things so let's go ahead and get started
we're going to go ahead and create a
variable and we'll just call it int 1 as
integer now what we're going to do is
we're going to create our for loop so
we're going to start off by using
keyword 4 and we're going to specify int
1 and we're going to set in 1 equal to
something because it isn't equal to
anything yet and so now we're going to
start for 1 and then we're going to use
the keyword - let's just do 20 and then
you can see that it adds and next for us
so basically what this does is it takes
it starts off with 4 which tells it that
we're going to be making a loop it takes
int 1 and sets it equal to 1 and then
it's going to do it from 1 to 20 so the
first time it runs the for loop in 1 is
going to be equal to 1 and then when it
comes back up to the top int 1 is going
to be equal to 2 and then 3 and then 4
and so on and so forth so int 1 is going
to go all the way up to 20 and then once
it hits 20 it'll run the code the for
loop one more time and then once it's
equal to 21 it's not going to do the for
loop again so to demonstrate this I will
just type console dot write line int 1
is equal to
and we're just going to go ahead and use
our and sign and we're going to type int
1 so basically what this does is it says
n 1 is equal to and it takes the current
value of int 1 because we don't know
what what int 1 is equal to we're just
going to put the variable name there so
now we're going to do console dot
readline and if we run this you can see
that it says N 1 is equal to 1 N 1 is
equal to 2 N 1 is equal to 3 and it'll
go all the way down until it 1 is equal
to 20 now you can change this number up
here to do the for loop as many times as
you want so we can even do it a hundred
times and you can see that it has 100
lines right here and it starts off with
1 and goes all the way up to 100 but
here here's one thing that will
invalidate our for loop and keep it from
running so if we start out with N 1
equals 1 and then we go to negative 1
you can see that it won't print out
anything because default for loops will
count up one value so since int 1 starts
at 1 whenever it comes whenever it hits
the next keyword right here it's going
to send it back up to this 4 and it's
going to add 1 to N 1 and so since the
add 1 adds 1 to N 1 N 1 is now equal to
2 and our fruit for loop goes to
negative 1 so it's not going to run at
all so now that you have learned a
little bit about for loops you can go
ahead and make your own for loop and
they're very useful and we're going to
be using them a lot later on in
programming there's a lot of other loops
that you're gonna be learning about
you're going to be learning about so far
with on the for each then we're going to
learn do until do-while there's your
while loops and then there's a lot of
other loops that are very useful in
programming so thanks for watching and
stay tuned to the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
