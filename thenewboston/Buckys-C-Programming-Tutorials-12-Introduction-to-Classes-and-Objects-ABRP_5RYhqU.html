to your 12th C++ tutorial and in this
story I'm going to be giving guys an
introduction to classes and objects now
classes are basically an easy way to
group all your functions and variables
and the group a bunch of stuff together
for example people like to group similar
functions together in the same class for
example if you had a bunch of functions
you know maybe working with temperature
or you had a bunch of other related
functions you might want to group them
all in the same class and makes them
easier to work with later on so then you
know if you have like a thousand
functions you say all right where are
all my temperature functions because I
need them now oh they're in my
temperature class so that is kind of the
usefulness of classes and the basics
behind that so let's go ahead and in
order to create a class we go ahead and
make sure you're outside your main first
of all I want to say that so I'm going
to create mine before my main and in
order to do this go ahead and type the
word class and now after this go ahead
and add a space and name your class now
people typically name their class with
uppercase letters and I'm going to name
mine Bucky's class just like that and
now go ahead and add curly braces in a
semicolon at the end now everything all
your functions all your variables all
your crap goes inside the body of your
class right here so basically all your
crap that you want to go in the class
goes in the class body just like that
and I believe whenever you create a
class is called declaring a class but
you know if your teacher ever asks you
to make sure you say that they'll
probably be impressed
so before we start adding a bunch of
functions itself I want to talk to you
guys about something called an access
specifier now sometimes you want to make
functions that you can only use in your
class and sometimes you want to make
functions that anybody can use outside
your class so if you want for example
the main to be able to use your
functions inside your class you need to
make your functions public if you don't
want main to be able to use the
functions inside your class then you
do something called private but we're
going to be going over that later for
now just remember whenever use the
public access specifier it says that you
can use it outside of the class so in
order to use that public access
specifier just go ahead and type public
with a colon not semi colon just a
regular colon and this means that
anything you put after this you're able
to use it outside of this class so if
you didn't have that then you would only
be able to use your stuff right here and
what's the use of that if you need to
put it in main so anyways
make sure you add public it's called an
access specifier if you're taking you
know C++ test or something so now let's
go ahead and we create a function just
like before I'm just go ahead and print
out something on the screen so it's not
going to make any calculation so it's
just going to print something out so
void I'm going to name it cool saying
and it's not going to take any
parameters a really simple function here
and all it's going to do is print
something out on the screen now I got to
think of a cool saying um preaching Wow
totally messed that up preaching to the
choir I think that's how you spell choir
not sure hope I don't look like a fool
in front on my subscriber so now just go
ahead and end line and so all this
function is going to do is print out
preaching to the choir on the screen
simple enough so now you're saying
alright this class is it looks good go
we have the class declaration class body
we have public and we even have one
function in our class this is a pretty
sweet-looking class so let's go ahead
and use this right now well now I want
to talk to you guys about the other part
of this tutorial I told you guys I'm
going to be talking about classes and
objects I already talked to you guys
about classes now I want to talk to you
guys about objects an object is how you
access the stuff inside of your class
for example why do you need to make
objects at all why can't you just write
cool sayings just like this and use it
just like that well whenever you're
making big computer programs and you
have a bunch of different classes and a
bunch of different functions and them
may have this cool sayings you may have
a function that says cool sayings inside
Bucky class you may have another
function cool sings inside tuna class
you may have another function cool
sayings inside a class temperature class
well how does C++ know what function you
want to use well it needs an object and
the object basically tells it what class
you're working with so in order to
create an object it's basically the same
as creating a variable you go ahead and
you do this you type the name of your
class which is Bucky's class and then
after this you give your object a name
and I'm just going to name my Bucky's
object just like that and go ahead and
add a semicolon and now this object
Bucky's object you use this kind of as
the key whenever you want to access the
crap inside your class so now instead of
just writing on the function name we
have to write the object name first like
Bucky's object and then in order to
access anything inside the class we need
to use a dot separator and a dot
separator is basically our way of
accessing the variables the functions
all that stuff so as you can see we'll
put the dot separator up and it already
knows that we're what we want to do we
want to access cool saying just like
before just type the name of the
function and empty parameters and bam
wham thank you ma'am we now have a full
working program so let me run this for
you real quick to show you guys that
it's working make sure I don't have any
errors and then I'll talk you guys
through it one last time preaching to
the choir works perfectly pretty cool
huh
so anyways people make classes in order
to group a similar function so if I had
you know a program that just had a bunch
of cool sayings I'd have cool sayings
cool sayings one cool things too I want
to put them all in the same class for
now we only have one function because
this is just an example so we have a
function that we put inside the class
and make sure to make it public that
means that main can use it as well so we
have a class and we made
that by making public and through a
function inside it pretty cool so now we
wanted to actually use that function
that's inside the class well we can't
just go ahead and write cool saying
because if we had a bunch of different
classes it wouldn't know which function
named cool saying to use so it wouldn't
know what class we wanted to use so in
order to use that function we needed to
make an object of that class so we're
saying all right we're making an object
called bucky's object and it is from the
buckey's class class so now whenever we
use buckey's object it knows that we're
going to be working with bucky's class
so we use buckey's object cool saying
and that knows and that's basically our
way of telling c++ that we want to use
the cool saying function and we want it
to come from buckey's class so we use
buckey's object so that is why you need
objects classes and yadda yadda out of
all that stuff so that is your basics of
classes and objects and why you need to
make objects before you can use the
stuff inside your class so I know this
is kind of confusing um but this is the
basics behind object oriented
programming so if you understand this
then if you understand this tutorial
then the rest of your programming life
is going to be a whole lot more simple
so watch this tutorial watch it again
watch it again until you understand
exactly how to make classes and exactly
why objects are useful and once you do
you're ready to move on to next tutorial
so for now thank you guys for watching
you guys have no idea how important the
information you just learned was so
anyways thank you guys for watching
don't forget to subscribe if you have
any questions about any of this feel
free to ask me on the new boston.com
slash forum so yeah enough of me talking
I'll see you next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
