your second objective-c tutorial and in
this tutorial well in the last tutorial
we open this program in reran it and in
this tutorial we're going to be
understanding what this program means
and also adding just a little bit of
code so the first thing I want to point
out and the first thing that you guys
should know is something called a
comment now we have one comment in here
by default that Xcode gave us and it
says insert code here now what a comment
is is it's just something that the user
can insert that doesn't affect the
program at all you can add one comment
or 100 comments it doesn't affect the
program at all the only purpose of a
comment is to make it easier to read or
understand so for example you can write
insert code here or you can write my
name is Bucky and you can write as many
of these comments as you want and say
you have a huge program and says and you
made some weird method you can write a
comment tell you what the method is but
we'll be going over this later on but
anyways if you add two forward slashes
and put some text this is a single line
comment and there's also something
called a multiple line comment which is
you do forward slash and Asterix excuse
me first less Asterix and then have some
text and do asterisks forward slash and
this is a comment if you want to write
it on multiple lines but like I said
we're not going to be common anything
because what we're going to be doing is
kind of simple I just had to show you
guys what a comment was in case you came
across them in like any books or
anything so now let's go ahead and start
understanding what this program means
there's a lot of extra stuff that we
really don't care about but I know you
guys grammatic are just tell me what it
means anyways because I'm curious well
the first thing right here I'll go line
by line the first thing is called an
import statement or import state well
you know this is called an import and
what this is is basically there
well certain stuff that you have to do
on every program and it took up a bunch
of lines so whenever you see import it
pretty much means include other bit of
code and put it in this program so
developers got kind of aggravated of
having to type the same stuff over and
over and over again so what they did is
they put it in a file called foundation
H and what you have to do is just import
that file and then it says all right
instead of typing all this I'm just
going to import this one big file so
this is actually a file that was already
created for us by some awesome people so
we don't have to type out extra bit of
code so anytime importing a file is
pretty much just using another bit of
code from somewhere else we'll learn
more about that later on now the next
thing you see is this int main and this
is actually the entire method that's
wrapped you see this is called or excuse
me your function header and these are
arguments right here and this is a
function statement now let me explain a
computer program all it is is it's built
up of a bunch of functions so if I was a
computer folk program one of my
functions would be brush my teeth one my
functions would be drive a car when my
functions would be um brush my teeth
again or eat food or something so if I
have all this stuff then and I ran it in
a computer program every bag all right
you got all this stuff to do but where
do you want me to begin well main is a
special function that says all right if
we have a hundred functions we want you
to start with this one so this pretty
much the keyword main gives the computer
program a starting point of where to
start so later on when we build ten more
functions it always starts at main and
since we have one you'll be kind of
confused maybe but you'll see later on
when we have more functions and like I
said
inside a function is a bunch of these
things called statements and you see
each one of them ends with a semicolon
what a statement is it's pretty much a
bit of instructions so you have a
function and inside the function is just
a set of instructions so for example if
I had a function which this one's called
main but if I was programming a robot I
would make a function called
make grilled cheese sandwich and its
first statement would be get out the
bread its second statement would be put
butter on the bread third one fry the
cheese and the fourth one would be eat
it so you have a main function which is
like a main task and these statements
are like separate bits of instruction
telling you what to do and they each
must end with a semicolon so now let's
go over what each of these statements
mean real quick
this one again the exact syntax we'll be
getting in the later on but NS
auto-release pol this pretty much
creates a pool of memory so you need to
reserve some memory in order to run your
program so it's pretty much your program
saying hey I'm Mac I heard you got some
memory in your a mexic yeah what of it I
got like 10 gigabytes and then your
programs like well I have this awesome
program here so let me borrow some
memory I'll give it back later and then
you're at max I like alright here you go
and you know that's pretty much what
pool does kind of reserves memory or
rents it from your computer now an NS
log the next statement now that we have
our memory this is pretty much something
to log information or display on your
screen so anything that goes in the
parentheses of n that NS log is just
going to be printed out on your screen
and this a little at sign if you didn't
have that it would be a different kind
it would be a C string and this is not
going to make sense but an @ sign
it's just proper coding for an NS log so
this NS log all you need to know is it
prints out stuff on the screen so this
one stores memory or reserves it this
one print stuff on the screen so now
that we created our pool
oh why the heck are we draining it well
what this means is you're pretty much
saying hey we're done with the memory
I'm going to drain it and then your
computer's like alright thanks for the
memory back so this one says all right
we need some memory do some crap right
here and then once we're done with the
memory we got to give it back I mean
it's only fair we got to drain it and
we'll be going over those key words
later on but this is the basics and
lastly every function has a return value
this integer means our a I have this
function called main and I'm going to
need something back I'm going to need
two integer back well what this
statement right here says is Ari I'm
going to return the value of zero back
every function has to return something
well there's void but we'll get in that
later on and when you return zero in a
computer program it means that
everything went perfect so for example
you might have a check earlier on in
program and you might return nothing at
all and not zero or another number aside
from zero and your computer
automatically knows if it gets anything
aside from zero if it gets a letter or
any other number then something effed up
so it's looking forward to zero and if
it doesn't get it you're going to get
some error messages so if you finally
get to this return zero zero says all
right this one could this went good this
went good
I can finally return zero which is
pretty much my program telling the
computer all right this program went
good it ended normally so the last thing
that I want to mention well that's
pretty much good enough for this story
on the next tutorial
I'll mention some other stuff but I mean
we had a pretty good run in this
tutorial so that's pretty much the
basics of what this program means and I
know you guys are probably still
confused but later on when we get
programming it'll all make sense I
promise when we actually use it so for
now thank you guys for watching this
tutorial don't forget to subscribe and
I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
