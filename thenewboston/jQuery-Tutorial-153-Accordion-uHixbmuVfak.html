this so essentially what we want to do
is go ahead and wrap this content if
that we've already created in another
div and I'm gonna call this main we're
done and that div there and let's just
go ahead and indent this content here
now inside star dot CSS I want to go
ahead and style this main here so main
and what I'm gonna do is give it a
height of 300 pixels now you'll see that
nothing's changed it hasn't filled to
that particular space so inside you ijs
we can specify a couple of one option
and that is fill space and if we set
that to true by default it's set to
false that will fill a particular space
so you can see that now with 300 pixels
down and this has filled the space that
we require okay so now let's go ahead
and look at things like changing these
icons here now you can either provide a
custom set of icons which I'm not going
to go ahead and and go through because
it's too much CSS to probably include in
the tutorial however we're going to use
a predefined set of icons and change
these drop-down little icons here so I'm
just going to go ahead and show you how
to do that I'm gonna come and separate
this and come down just so we've got
enough room I'm going to specify the
icons option now inside some more curly
brackets I'm gonna go ahead and specify
another two options the first one being
header and the second one what we'll do
the head of first we're gonna set an
icon for the header and that's going to
be UI plus icon for sorry UI icon plus
so now what's happened is when we
refresh you can see that the ones that
aren't open have a plus symbol here you
can go ahead then and comma separate
inside of these curly brackets and say
set the for example header selected
option and we can set this to something
like UI icon - instead so now when we
refresh we have plus and minus icons so
you can go ahead and set these to your
own defined icons as well okay so lastly
we're just going to take
look at the event which is an option
itself it's not a collection of events
but this option will actually specify
when the accordion opens so when these
particular panels actually open so at
the moment it's when we click on a
particular header that's all handled for
us however we might want to go ahead and
change the event to mouse-over for
example now what this will do is with
when we roll over an option without
actually clicking on it each description
area or div area actually opens as we
roll over this header area at the top
now we're going to take a look at the
collapsible option now let's just go
ahead and change this event or delete
this event option so we have the
clickable option set okay so what
happens now if we want to say closed
portfolio when I click on portfolio I
can't actually close it so or there
always has to be one div area open at a
time so inside here we can set the
collapsible option to true and let's
just spell it right collapsible okay so
you can set the collapsible option to
true and what this means is that we can
actually collapse all of them so they
can all be closed otherwise you're gonna
always have one open so this might be
useful for for example when you enter a
website let's just say it is a personal
say web developers web site you might
just want to leave these open these
options closed before you allow your
users to actually go ahead and
immediately click on a on an option so
if you were what if you wanted to say
let's just refresh the page you can see
that the first header and content has
automatically opened then we can go
ahead and open subsequent headers and
content areas however if you wanted to
say enter the website and they all to be
automatically closed you would have to
go and define an option inside of
here and that is the active option now
what you can do with the active option
is either define a particular a
particular header and content area that
you want to be open for example if we
were to set active to - when we refresh
the page this automatically opens this
one remember we start at 0 1 and then 2
so 0 would be the first one which is
automatically set by default then you
would have one active one would open
this second one and then we've already
taken a look at the last one so by
setting active to zero we don't disable
it so what we need to do is specify it
false and what this will do is it will
deactivate all of the open elements so
now a user can enter the website have
all of them closed and choose which one
they want to click so this is extremely
useful for functionality issues if you
wanted to click keep all these areas
closed so I think we've taken a look
enough at this accordion widget in the
jQuery UI it's an extremely powerful and
easy to implement tool in order for you
to have these content areas which expand
when clicked</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
