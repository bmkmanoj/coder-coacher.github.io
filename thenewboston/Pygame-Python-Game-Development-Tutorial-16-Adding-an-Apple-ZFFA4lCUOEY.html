16th pygame tutorial video in this video
we're going to be talking about how to
add an apple to our snake games so up
until now we've got a little I don't
know 1 segmented snake we can move them
around and we fall off the screen in it
you know it gives us this error not
error message quit game over kind of
things so um now we're ready to add the
Apple get the Apple handle getting the
Apple make our snake longer and all that
so let's go ahead get started so the
first thing we want to do is like when
we add our Apple we want like our our
snake we added our snake and we want
this neat to kind of start in the same
place every time and the snake doesn't
really reset the only time the snakes
ever going to reset is if it's a game
over so with the Apple it's a little
different we want the Apple to appear
kind of randomly somewhere on the screen
and that's it we just want it somewhere
on the screen but we need it to be
random so these thing to do when you
want something random is to import
random so we'll go import random here
and we're going to use R and range so if
you're not familiar with R and range
it's just a way that you can say I want
a random number between this number and
this number and that's a random range so
for example underneath where we've got
frames per second Oh hold on anything
here game loop um yeah so we're going to
put it at least in the game loop here so
we'll say under lead Y change what we're
going to want to do is we're going to
have two more variables here and they're
going to be we're going to call this R
and Apple X equal something and then R
and Apple y equals something and what
these are going to equal is going to be
the following it's gonna be random dot R
and range and the range we want is
anything between let's just think about
it together right we want this to be
anything between like say 4x anything
between 0 and the whole display width
right so we'd want it to be between 0
and
display wit like that I believe we
didn't capitalize W and make sure yeah
so zero display with but what happens if
we just did this like what if we we said
okay that's good enough right what might
happen if we do just zero to display
with is again where we measure the X&amp;amp;Y
or where we say X and y is is at the top
left corner so in theory this is
anything between 0 and 800 so it could
start our block at 800 and then make our
little block from 800 to 810 and it
would be off of the screen so we can't
go 0 to display with so instead what we
want to do is 0 to display with minus
block underscore size like that
and now that'll work out and then the
same thing we want to do just down here
except for display height so again it'll
be random dot R and range 0 whoops 0
comma display underscore height minus
block size and that will be R and a
random location for the X and y of our
of our apple now what we need to do is
we actually have to draw the Apple to
the screen so there you could draw it in
a couple of ways just keep in mind when
you draw stuff to the screen the order
that you draw a matter so if we draw it
after our snake the Apple will appear to
be above our snake as we cross over now
if we handle the code right that won't
be a big issue for this specific game
but say you're having like a driving
game or something and maybe you drive
off the road or something you would want
to make sure you draw the car last
otherwise as you drive off the road the
road will cover your car basically and
you wouldn't see yourself or something
like that you always want to draw like
the main thing what's supposed to be on
top of something think about it that way
like you have to make that the most
recent drawing so in our case we display
the snake here so we probably should put
the Apple like right here
after the fill so to draw our Apple it's
pretty much just like this so again it's
going to be PI game dot draw dot rect
where do we want to draw it we still
want it on the game display what color
do we want it's an apple we're going to
make it red and we have red text I think
so yeah we're good red and then this is
where we're going to actually put this
stuff it's going to be um you had the R
and Apple X R and Apple why so here's
that so I'm going to copy that
so R and Apple X comma paste Rand Apple
Y and then again block size by block
size so block size and block size so
it's again just to run through this just
in case anybody got lost we've got PI
game drawer X where do we draw at game
display what color red and then this is
the list here of the X element Y element
how how why do we want it to be and how
tall do we want it to be and that's it
when we run game display to update it
will show up so let's go ahead and save
and run this Oh Randy Apple okay um yeah
we didn't capitalize the y so let's do
that
there we go so there's our snake there's
our Apple down here so we can move about
and you'll see though there's a couple
of issues here first of all obviously
we're not eating the Apple but it is
there and then the other one is it's not
perfectly aligned with our snake which
can create a problem later on I'm going
to show you guys both ways of handling
cross over but we'll get to that and
then just to check okay let's go ahead
and die let's play again
you see it's now in there now it's over
here and so on so clearly it's at least
random but we obviously don't have any
handling for if we run into the Apple
and we eat the apple um or anything like
that so and we also aren't getting
longer when we run into it so we need to
have some handling for that and so
that's what's coming up in the next
videos as always thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
