the firt when that this YouTube video
first went up you see that little name
the top right corner that's my actual
name it's actually playing with my
brother this game and guess what I'm
using my Barrett 50 Cal with a thermal
scope this game because don't have that
MJ it see headshot don't have pull up my
spaz 12 and I get another headshot with
my spaz 12 because it is awesome and I
decide I want to do a little bit of
sniping this game instead of using like
my FAMAS or an m16 or anything like that
I just I was pretty lucky dude having a
shotgun I think right here yep pretty
sure I get at least one guy
nope nevermind that wasn't it last stand
m9 especially no that would be a us
because he was using arrangers I said I
was actually I decided this game instead
I wanted to start using my USP I didn't
have a sound support yet apparently so I
just decided I wanted to run around with
it this game instead of the sniper nose
I just wanted to run around like a
freaking maniac I guess anyway that's my
brother right there okay here we go
headshot I've got my aiming is pretty
like a hit it's almost like a headshot
I'm sorry
not pronounce the word and it's already
a minute are almost two minutes and and
I've got my almost try Harry
see you have no chance of survival you
want because you are being hit by a
bullet don't know whether the missile
kind of obvious
okay um throw out my care package
because you ought to be building I try
to get this guy over here and my care
package is a UAV which I just use it
instead of trying to get my kills I just
try to bait it he's like oh baby it is a
technique where you throw I don't like
something like a care package or
something like that or something that
the enemy team would want and you
basically just you can't vote you
basically camp it and just wait for
people to come so you can get a higher
kill streak which is basically what I
did to get my hair strike and my hairier
it seems like it's almost getting me
like a triple kill
I got like a 14 kill streak because of
my hair here I'm like out of ammo
I'm like around everybody I was
literally probably around the entire
enemy team and on two deaths I mean yes
- does I am at like 15 and two or
something like that
at this point at this point again me and
my brother we are just pretty much just
going around camping there's not really
camping there spawn but being in their
spawn I'm not sure if you call it
camping because it's not being in one
spot or just running around in it I'm
not sure if you call that camping but
see you see that's why that's why
commando that's why sometimes you need
commando bro
jump in the air right in front of the
guy and you can't knife in oh well at
least with Ninja Pro people can't hear
you umm that's one thing on talking
about um commando Crowe
kind of annoying sometimes you see and
with that I had Ninja Pro and I was even
a farther distance away from the other
guy and I still got him and I didn't get
him excuse me um I'm already 25 in 3 or
4 in this game as you just as I just
pulled up the scoreboard and the game's
not even halfway done
yeah there's got my another predator
missle I think I either try to use it
and I die wait no don't remember what
happens not sure if they get another
Harrier strike either die or get another
herring strike definitely one of those
two okay well I throw out my care
package and I hope for an ac-130 like I
did last game but I'm now think I get
something very good precision airstrike
isn't bad not best it's definitely not
bad
in this game I keep running keep running
around actually a tip for this map if
you eat there's two things that you
probably make sense unless you're
playing search-and-destroy what you
should do see they run around with like
an assault rifle or you enter an UMP or
something like that look and there's my
areas my secondary strike either should
run around or you should either use
night definitely one of those tools cuz
you like running around with a shotgun
you saw that guy had the problem most
likely bling 1887 yeah he has no chance
against somebody with the UMP who can
probably shoot you from a decent my a
decent amount away from where you are or
from where he is you can shoot them or
vice versa series in the shotgun um if
you're gonna use a shotgun though which
I don't recommend as I just said you
should probably camp in the middle
building where that's usually a decent
amount of the stuff happens unless you
me I'm playing team deathmatch here Oh
actually one thing I completely forgot
about um my killstreaks no not like
he'll fix my perks our marathon
cold-blooded and ninja
and I got a purpose oh maybe I'm not
eating no never mind I'm using stopping
power of this game Wow
usually I use cold blooded because you
don't have to deal with air support and
there's the game when he killed there's
a gaming to kill with double RPGs that's
pretty much it
um let's see what Mike overall katie is
thirty six and four definitely one of my
better games Kyle out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
