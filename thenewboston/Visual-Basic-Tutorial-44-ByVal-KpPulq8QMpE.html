slash on live gamer for the new Boston
and in this tutorial we're going to be
taking a look at by Val now when you're
making subs and functions sometimes you
want those subs or function to be able
to use other variables that are outside
of it now
one way of doing this is by using by Val
which is pretty much just giving your
function or sub a variable to use in
it's inside of itself and it doesn't
know what what it's equal to but it gets
it from another part of the program so
let's go ahead and create a little demo
application for this we'll go ahead and
create a new project now let's go ahead
and select windows forms application and
we will just call this by Val and we'll
go ahead and wait for that to load now
I'll just come over here to our tool box
and we will add a text box if we can
find it we'll add a text box and then
we'll add another text box
and then we will add a button that says
subtract so we'll set the text value of
this to subtract and then we'll come up
here inside the name to button subtract
and just for the sake of saving time
I'm not going to rename these text box
text boxes so let's go ahead and
double-click on the subtract button so
that it will generate our event handle
it for that and now what we're going to
do is we're going to come down here and
we are going to create a function so
we'll go ahead and use the private
keyword so that nothing outside of this
class can use this function so we'll use
private function subtract numbers and
now inside of these parameters we're
going to add a by Val so we'll just
start off by typing by Val and then
we'll type num1 which is the name of
what we're going to use what our
variable is going to be called inside of
our function as integer or let's go
ahead and do double just in case they
enter values that won't return a whole
number when they subtract and then we'll
do by Val num2 as double and then we
will do as double so that our function
will return a double so let me go ahead
and explain this a little bit to you
when somebody calls the function
subtract numbers they're going to have
to enter two values the first value is
the first number and the second value is
the second number so that lets our
function subtract numbers use the two
numbers that we've given to it and then
it can do whatever it needs to and then
give you back the answer so we'll just
go ahead and type return num1 - num2 so
now what we'll do is we will come up
here and we'll go ahead and create a an
instance of subtract numbers so we'll go
ahead and start by typing messagebox
show and the first thing that we want to
show in the message box the
message of it is we are going to type
subtract numbers and then we're going to
need two arguments for this the first
argument is going to be the number 1 and
what we're going to use as num1 is
textbox 1 dot text so basically what
this is going to do is it's going to get
the text from our first text box right
here and it's going to use that as the
number in subtract numbers and then for
our second argument we are going to use
textbox to dot text now we'll go ahead
and close off these parentheses and now
if we run this you can see that it shows
up our form and if we type the number 30
and then we type the number 10 and click
subtract it's going to show us a message
box with 20 now this part right up here
may be a little confusing to you so I'll
just go ahead and try and simplify it a
bit so we'll go ahead and create a
double variable so we'll type answer dim
answer as double and we will set it
equal to subtract numbers text box 1 dot
text and then we will use textbox to dot
text so what this is going to do is
going to return a double and it's going
to be stored in the variable answer so
now instead of printing all this putting
all this in my message box I'll show we
can just add answer and we can also use
answer anywhere else so we can type
answer plus equals 1 and we can use that
later on instead of it just being used
inside of this message box show so you
can add as many by thousands you want
you can do them with different types you
can use strings integers boolean's
characters and they don't have to be the
same as your function type so I could
type num1 as string and it will work
perfectly fine
though our function type is a double and
just going to need to return a double we
can still pass whatever data type so we
need to it so go ahead and practice with
using by Val you can create some
functions and the easiest way to
practice this is by making some
calculator functions and reference use
by Val to pass variables or numbers into
your functions and once you've done that
and you're familiar with it go ahead and
move on to the next tutorial and thanks
