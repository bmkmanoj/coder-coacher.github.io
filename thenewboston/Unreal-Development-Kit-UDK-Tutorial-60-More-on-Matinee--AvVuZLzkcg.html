tutorial and in this lesson I'm going to
finish covering the rest of the matinee
interface so now that we covered the
toolbar or basically they're a couple
buttons that we forgot to cover but I'm
actually going to be saving those for
later let's go ahead and cover these
tabs right here so what these tabs are
they're basically a better way of
organizing your tracks so some
animations you're going to have a bunch
of tracks like a movement track and let
me go ahead and add another you know
event track or something so what these
do is they organize your track so any
camera tracks would go in here and these
skeletal message tracks would go in here
since we added that one event track
whenever we click our event tab then
that event track would go right there
but usually you just want to work with
all so whenever you're working under the
all tab you can see all your tracks so
now let me go ahead and delete that
event track for now because we don't
need it and the next thing I want to go
over is this what I've been talking
about all along and that's the time
slider so remember I told you guys that
you basically we're going to have an
animation made up of keyframes give a
starting point and an ending point in
this case scenario well what the time
slider does is it basically you can
slide it to somewhere in between to
basically give you the current time of
that animation again if you just
visually look what's going on you can
see a lot better than I explained it so
again it's pretty obvious what that is
now this thing with the green triangles
and I got idea that this was bothering
you because you guys probably going to
figure out what this was because
whenever we scrolled over it nothing
really happens this and this button
right here kind of go hand in hand this
green shaded area controls the loop
preview playback and what I mean by that
is you can select a special area with a
screen and if you hit the loop section
playback it only plays that section of
your animation so you guys can see
what's going on right here so if you
have a long animation
and you have a little piece that's going
wrong and it's kind of bothering you and
you just want to focus on that then this
is where you can you know maybe you want
to make a loop of something in playback
it's pretty obvious to see what's going
on so now let me go ahead and scroll
that out of the way because if you're
not using it I like to move it to be the
gate to the wood to the beginning I so
wrap there or it kind of bothers me so
that's what that does so now I'll talk
to you guys about this red triangle I
touched on a little bit before about
this red triangle at the bottom controls
the entire length of your animation so
typically you want to have animation
that starts you know at the beginning
and it ends you know after three seconds
or something but then you can have your
entire movie play for longer so say you
wanted to oh no do something like this
you want it to have your door move from
zero to three seconds but after five
seconds or four seconds you wanted an
announcement to play so you would have
your entire movie four seconds long and
then you would have an announcement
coming off this completed thing so I
just want to tell you guys that you can
have an animation within a movie so you
guys might think that this is just
wasted space but it's there's actually
kind of a art to you know deciding the
time of your animation using your key
frames and also the overall length of
your movie so I'm going to go ahead and
move that 24.5 because why the heck
mount and the last thing i want to touch
on is these keyframes i told you guys
about it before but the key frames are
basically just points in time or
checkpoints where you want things to
occur so at the beginning and my 00
keyframe I want the door to be right
there and now at my what time is this
266 keyframe I want my key frame or
excuse me I want my door to be on bottom
so in between your key frames the UK's
automatically gonna fill in and here's a
nice little tip if you go ahead and hold
ctrl and try to move a keyframe it moves
that keyframe to you know whatever time
you want however say I was trying to
move this to three seconds
and you know maybe I know I'm nervous
because I'm just getting married and I
can't quite get it on three seconds if
you go ahead and right-click a keyframe
you can go ahead and set that time to
3.0 and it's going to do all their dirty
work for its going to hop that right to
three point oh so that's a nice little
trick whenever you're trying to position
keyframes exactly how you want them so
then I can go ahead and you know
position that right there and now my
entire animation kind of plays exactly
how I wanted to pretty to go home so
aside from that I guess I'll talk to you
guys about the individual tracks now now
I remember that I told you guys that you
can have groups and if you right-click a
group you can add individual tracks now
a track is basically saying what do you
want to animate in the UDK so you can
animate things other than just things
moving around you can animate I guess
I'll go through a couple of these things
well let me go ahead and well I guess I
might as well just test this out abilene
don't worry about that it's kind of
confusing a new event track is one that
we're going to actually be using quite
often what a new event track does is it
basically if you go ahead and select
that track and move your current time
indicator to like one and a half seconds
and add a keyframe and you're going to
want to go ahead and name this event
like um play announcement and make sure
you spell it wrong and hopefully I did
and now whenever your animations playing
go ahead and look in kismet right now
whenever your user triggers that trigger
and plays this animation it's going to
play and as soon as it hits that one and
a half second mark then this play
announcement event is going to fire so
this can kick off an announcement and
you might want to add you know a new
action an announcement right there to
play an announcement so basically an
event track is a key frame where it
triggers an event to happen at that
point in time so now let me go ahead and
delete that and when I delete this look
over in kismet
that event disappeared as well so i
guess i can go ahead and delete that
cleanup purposes and i'll just go over a
couple more of these real quick to show
you guys the different things that can
be animated face effects is for whenever
you're making like an animation and you
want their face to move then there you
go animation control is for skeletal
meshes and like character movement
particles whenever we deal with particle
systems flow properties has again to
deal with kind of like certain actors
and objects have a flow property and
let's see what morph weight has to deal
with skeletal meshes and character
movement and again all of these things I
just want to demonstrate a few of them
tell you guys you can animate things
other than just moving crap around on
your screen so you can basically anime
anything that you can pop into your mind
so with that being said that basically
covers everything I needed to cover
again there's this property section down
here but with all my tutorials I'm just
going to be going over the properties as
we need them so i won't really worry
about that right now the two other
things i want to go over that kind of
don't fit into this interface at all but
i need to tell you guys is whenever
you're working in you want to alter
keyframe you may have a little trouble
and that's because you don't have a key
frame selected whenever you have a key
frame selected a couple things are going
to happen it's going to say the name of
the key right there and it's also going
to say a just key with ever the key
number is in your perspective view so if
you're trying to edit a keyframe make
sure you are on that key because some
people would get off a little bit like
right there and they try to move this
around and it doesn't work and the
reason is because they're not on the key
so I want to give you guys that nice
little tip before you run into that
problem and the last thing I want to
tell you guys is this by default
whenever you add an interp actor the
collision is off so let me go ahead and
show you guys what happens when I run
through the store I'm going to go ahead
and my character can run right through
that door so what the heck
so you obviously want to change this
like if you have a door or something and
you don't want your character to run
through so like I said by default the
properties of an interp actor has no
collision so if you make a door or roof
or you know anything that you want your
user to bump into go ahead and hit f4
and under collision let's see if I can
find it again collision type no collide
that means your player can run through
it shoot through it they can drive
through it and if we have a door we're
just going to want to hit block all that
means that our user can't run through it
and it basically acts like a big chunk
of wood that now they can shoot it and
bump into it with cars and stuff like
that so I just want to tell you guys
those couple things because I get those
questions a lot on my forum so I thought
I'd come for him right now again they
didn't really fit in this tutorial but
might as well get that out of the way so
that's all I have for you guys in this
story so I think guys for watching don't
forget to subscribe and yeah I'll see
you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
