because in our next video they're gonna
help us solve some triangle problems so
a square is basically like it's written
like this and it's basically the number
times itself so right here we have x
squared so that's just x times X so
we're gonna do some examples where we're
just gonna write out this square and
find out what it equals
so 11 squared is just saying 11 times 11
equals what and 11 times 11 is equal to
a hundred and twenty-one so 1 times 1 is
equal to 1 4 times 4 is equal to 16 2.3
times 2.3
now
5.29 six times six equals thirty-six and
when we have a fraction like we do right
here you square the top and square the
bottom so ya 1 times 1 over 2 times to
the top equals 1 the bottom equals 4 so
that's what you do when you square a
number now to undo a square you take the
square root of a number so when you take
the square root of a number you you're
finding what number of times
no you're finding what number times
itself equals the square so for x
squared we know if we took the square
root of x squared since we know that
it's x times X when we take the square
root of it we just have X a square root
is how you undo a squared function so
now we're you're going to do some
examples the square root of 121 well
this is just saying the square root of
11 11 times 11 so when you take this
square root you get rid of one of those
11s and you just get 111 because this is
saying if I squared 11 I would get a
hundred and twenty-one which is true so
this one's pretty easy what times one
equals 110 times 10 so you get ten now
just like we square the top and the
bottom of a fraction we're gonna take
the square root
of the top and bottom separately so what
times itself gives me 4 well 2 times
itself gives me 4 and what times itself
gives me 5 5 so the answer is 2/5 the
square root of 9 is just 9 is just 3
times 3 and that gives us 3 16 4 times 4
and then 1 over 9 since the square root
of 9 is 3 and we know that the square
root of 1 is 1
it's just 1/3 so when you raise a number
to the second degree you're saying x
squared and when we want to undo that
squared we take the square root and we
go back to the original number so this
is gonna help us with triangles and
solving sides of triangles in our next
video so make sure you come back and
watch that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
