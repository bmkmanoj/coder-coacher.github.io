squares because in our next video
they're going to help us solve some
triangle problems so a square is
basically like it's written like this
and it's basically the number times
itself so right here we have x squared
so that's just X times X so we're going
to do some examples where we're just
going to write out this square and find
out what it equals so 11 squared is just
saying 11 x 11 equals what and 11 times
11 is equal to a hundred and twenty one
so 1 times 1 is equal to 1 4 times 4 is
equal to 16 2.3 times 2.3
now
five point two nine six times six equals
36 and when we have a fraction like we
do right here you square the top and
square the bottom so yeah 1 times 1 over
2 times to the top equals 1 the bottom
equals 4 so that's what you do when you
square a number now to undo a square you
take the square root of a number so when
you take the square root of a number you
you're finding what number of times no
you're finding what number times itself
equals the square so 4x squared we know
if we took the square root of x squared
since we know that it's x times X when
we take the square root of it we just
have X a square root is how you undo a
squared function so now we are going to
do some examples the square root of 121
well this is just saying the square root
of 11 11 x 11 so when you take the
square root you get rid of one of those
11 s and you just get 111 because this
is saying if I squared 11 I would get a
hundred and twenty one which is true so
this one's pretty easy what times one
equals 100 10 x 10 so you get 10 now
just like we square the top and the
bottom of a fraction we're going to take
the square root
of the top and bottom separately so what
time's itself gives me 4 well 2 times
itself gives me 4 and what times itself
gives me 55 so the answer is two-fifths
the square root of nine is just nine is
just three times three and that gives us
3 16 4 x 4 and then one over nine since
the square root of nine is three and we
know that the square root of one is one
it's just one third so when you raise a
number to the second degree you're
saying x squared and when we want to
undo that squared we take the square
root and we go back to the original
number so this is going to help us with
triangles and solving sides of triangles
in our next video so make sure you come
back and watch that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
