welcome to your tenth objective-c
tutorial in this tutorial I'm going to
be talking a little more about data and
it won't be the most exciting tutorial
but this is definitely things you need
to know or else is going to confuse the
heck out of you whenever you start the
program in the future so the first thing
we need is Frizzle you know tester
program is couple variables let's go
ahead and make three floats let's go
ahead and make two actually let's say
the first one F one and set this equal
to like twenty point eight six pretty
much set it to anything with a decimal
point and now go ahead and make another
one just named F two and we won't set
this equal to anything yet after this we
need a couple of integer variables just
go ahead and put a 1 and then go ahead
put I two and set this equal to 15 and
set one called
I three and sets equal to like ten all
right looks good and now what we're
going to be doing is converting one type
to the other and stuff like that or a
sign actually I should say convert
that's a little bit later but the first
thing I want to talk to you guys about
is if you have this integer variable
called I 1 and you try to set it equal
to F 1 which would be twenty point eight
six let's go ahead and take a quick look
at what happens NS log what that how the
heck to do that okay NS log don't do it
again
there we go listen to me not bad what
happens when you do this is it gets
something called truncated and go ahead
and press % I and then go ahead and
press I 1 and if you don't know what
that means you'll see in a second as
long as I don't get any errors oh we're
good for now alright it says 20 but our
number our float was actually 20 point
what was it 86 so why did it output 20
well here's what happens when you assign
a float which was F 1 to an
energy value like I said it gets
truncated what this means is basically
the decimal point gets chopped off it
doesn't care about it anymore so it
pretty much turns into an integer
cutting off the decimal point so that's
a pretty interesting for now so let's
move on the next topic so if you ever
build programming this weird thing
happened um that's why I did I'm going
to be talking about two more weird
things and what we getting in the fun
stuff but for now I mean this is just
some rules do we have to follow the
second one
sorry I got kennel cough when two
operands in this expression what are
pretty much the two numbers you divide
by our integers the decimal point gets
discarded even if you assign the answer
to a flow so let's go ahead and show you
that if you take that float to which we
didn't assign any value yet and set it
equal to I 2 divided by I 3 check it out
it should be 1.5 since 15 divided by 10
is 1.5 in our answers flow so I mean it
should be good to go but now let's go
ahead and NSLog this chizz right here
and copy paste it and put % F of course
and put F 2 and now let's go ahead and
see what happens here go to run this
save all succeeded now we see instead of
1.5 we get one right here
but hold on Bucky you just took 15
invited by 10 so why didn't we get 1.5
even though it's a flow answer well any
time you're dividing by two integers not
floats it treats the expression entirely
as an integer and just assigns it to a
float value so that's why if you come
across this problem that's what's
happening so what you usually need to do
is turn one of the operands pretty much
one of the numbers into a float
so let's go ahead and do this last let's
go ahead and
take that f2 and we're going to make a
full answer this time put f1 which is a
flow we know f1 is a flow and divided by
integer to four as your three doesn't
matter any integer and now let's go
ahead and print that out again so copy
paste I hate that it always does it and
it's go ahead building a run and now
check it out we now have a perfect flow
answer right here so the three concepts
I wanted to go over whenever you take a
flow and assign it to an integer
variable the decimal points gets cut off
number one weird thing number two thing
I wanted to go over whenever your two
numbers you're dividing by are both
integers even though that the variable
you're assigning it to may be a flow the
decimal point is going to get thrown out
and it's just going to be an even flow
like 1.0 even though it should have been
1.5 that's a second thing the third
thing anytime you want to make sure that
your answer is a flow you have to have
one of the numbers in your expression as
a flow so we put the first operand which
is the numbers that were dividing as
float and look at that we got a perfect
flow answer so now you should be able to
work perfectly with floats and integers
and if you come across anything weird in
your programming can't figure out what's
going on this is probably the source of
air so that's all I got for you for this
it's ro in the next tutorial we're going
to be going over some pretty cool
operators that you haven't seen before
and soon enough we're going to be
getting to making your program a little
bit smarter so thank you guys for
watching don't forget to subscribe and
I'll see you next sorry</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
