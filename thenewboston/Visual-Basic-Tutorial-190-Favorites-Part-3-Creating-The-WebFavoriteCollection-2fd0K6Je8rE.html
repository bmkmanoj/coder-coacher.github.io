slash on live gamer for the new Boston
and in this tutorial we're gonna
continue working on the favorites viewer
now before we get started I just want to
say like I do in every single tutorial
I'm where I don't where I use a program
that isn't made by me all the credit
goes to the authors of beginning
Microsoft Visual Basic 2008 and the
authors are a Theron Willis and Brian
Newsome they created this great program
that I'm using to teach you guys some
object-oriented programming techniques
and I'm gonna explain it to you in a lot
of detail and you don't have to have the
book yourself so if you don't know what
you see right here and you don't know
what that is then you may want to move
back to one of the previous tutorials so
we'll go ahead and let's create a for
each loop that will process each line in
our file so we'll start off by typing
for each and we're gonna do we're giving
you a string line in string lines so
basically what we're saying is for each
of the lines in our array of lines so
we've got our file and we split it up
into separate lines for each line in
there what do we want to do well we want
to search for our URL so we can use a
simple if statement so if string line
dot starts with now this is pretty
self-explanatory determines whether the
beginning of the string instance mass it
matches the specified string so if it
starts with URL equals then what do we
want to do we want to set URL equal to
string line dot substring at index of 4
so
and if this happens we just want to exit
our for loop because we have found what
we're looking for and we don't need to
go through the rest of the for loop so
what this does is it checks to see if
the line starts with a URL and what URL
equals and after URL equals is going to
contain the URL of the website that's
our favorite so what we do is we set URL
which is a public variable and it's a
string we're going to set that equal to
the line at substring and we start at
index 4 so we have index 0 1 2 3 and
start at index 4 so it's gonna set our
URL to the URL we want and it's going to
leave out URL equals right here because
we're starting at index 4 now let's go
ahead and we need to read the the file
or the data that's in the file I don't
know how I forgot this in the last
tutorial but we're gonna set string data
equal to my computer dot file system dot
read alt text and we're reading all the
text from the file name which has been
passed to this method so let's just
enclose all of this in a try Bock try
block so we're gonna try and if for some
reason we get an error in here let's go
ahead and catch it now we're going to
catch an error of type IO exception so
if we get an error reading or writing or
something then it's gonna catch that so
whenever we catch that we'll just show
it so message box message box show e x
dot message okay so now that we've
created our web favorites class remember
to put this line in right here that I
forgot from the previous tutorial which
basically reads the lines reads all the
text of the file into your string data
so now what we need to do
is we need to continue by creating a
another class so we'll come over here to
favourites viewer YouTube will right
click and we will add another class now
let me go ahead and shrink this down now
this class is going to be called web
favorite collection now this is going to
hold objects for each of our favorites
that has that have been read from our
computer so what we need to do is type
inherits collection base now says
provides the abstract base class for a
strongly typed collection so what this
means is that it's a collection and we
can store a bunch of objects in it now
we're going to be storing objects of
type web favorite now you said you saw
it said strongly typed collection and
what it means by that is that you can
only use a certain type of data in it
and it's whatever you specify so
whenever we inherit from collection base
we need to add some stuff to the class
so we need to add a method called add so
this is gonna take an argument and we'll
call it favorite as web favorite so it's
gonna be a type web favorite which is
this class that we've created right here
so whenever they add we want to add the
item to the collection so we'll just
type list dot add favorite now you may
per you may be wondering where we got
lists from well list is what this class
uses to store all of its items or its
objects because it inherits from
collection based we can use lists so the
list in this class is going to store all
of our objects now we need to create a
remove method so public sub remove and
this is going to take an argument of an
index so we want to remove something at
a certain index so we'll type if index
is greater than or equal to zero and
index is less than count you see the
counts gets the number of elements
contained in the collection based
instance so if it's less than the number
of items in our list then we can go
ahead and remove it so the list starts
at index zero and then it has a certain
count so if the index isn't outside of
these pounds then we can go ahead and
type list dot remove and this is gonna
take an argument so we'll just type
index so now we need to do is we need to
come down to the low end sub and we'll
type public read-only property so we're
making a read-only property now here's
something I just realized the writers of
this book have messed up they took an
index for the argument of this but when
they removed they removed they used
remove and used an index and it will
never find that because when it tries to
remove it'll look at that number and be
like well there's nothing in here with
that value so we're not remove it so we
need to use list dot remove at index so
we'll create a read-only property called
item and it's gonna take an argument v
out index as integer so whenever they
access the item property they're gonna
have to put an index in as the integer
and it's gonna give them back the item
at that index and we want to make it of
type web favorite because this
collection holds a whole bunch of web
favorite objects so what we want to do
is we want to give them back in an item
from our collection or our list based on
what it's index is so we want to return
and we want to use c-type because we're
going to be converting object types so
we'll type list dot item at index and we
want to convert that to type web
favorite so what this is it's going to
return a value and it's going to take
the value at in our list which is our
collection that we have for this class
at the item and the index of the index
that they gave us so let's say we've got
a web favorite at index of five and is
equal to two YouTube so it's gonna get
the item at index of five and it's gonna
be YouTube and it's gonna convert that
to type web favorite now because it's
already a web favorite we will have no
problems with converting it to web
favorite and it'll work just fine
so go ahead put this coder and if you
have it if you're confused with anything
leave it in the comments maybe somebody
will be able to help you I might even be
able to monitor the comments and see if
people need help so thanks for watching
and stay tuned for the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
