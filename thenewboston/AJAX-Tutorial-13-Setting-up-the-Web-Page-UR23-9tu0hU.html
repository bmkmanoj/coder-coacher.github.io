you guys in this you know little segment
this is basically how you set up a web
page using Ajax you get you pretty much
set up your web page so that all the
static data is right there and then you
go in and you add empty divs and they
don't have to be divs but they're the
easiest to work with because you can
stick anything inside a div basically
just go ahead and add div and this is
how I like to add it although some
people use a single one and that's
perfectly fine just go ahead and give ID
of something like div movies so
basically this empty div is where the
dynamic content is going to go say you
you know are linked up to a database and
you had different movies for different
users well this part would be the same
however their movies which are all
different that's the part that would be
different and changing so that is why
you need empty divs wherever you have
dynamic elements now another thing I
want to mention is this if you're saying
okay is it really necessary to put this
on load I mean why can't I just go ahead
and put all my JavaScript right here
it'll just be all in the same file nice
and neat and work out perfectly right
well that works out for a lot of
JavaScript applications but not this one
and let me tell you why now if you know
you know pretty much the basics about
computer programming they work from top
to bottom
now they go this line execute them this
line the sign lists sign until you get
to the bottom so if you go ahead and say
something like this arm say we're going
to reference this div right here div
movies so we're going to put div movies
and put the innerhtml
equal to you know a list of my favorite
movies well whenever we do that we're
going to get an error because remember
we're working top to bottom here
whenever we set div is equal to
something it didn't even come across
this div tag right yet so it doesn't
even know that this div movies exist so
it's going to say okay you're trying to
set this div movies equal to something
is just just like a freaking variable
or what is this I didn't even discover
this because I'm still way up here
working so that is one reason why we use
this let me go ahead and tighten this
back up this great list because then
what happens is your entire webpage
loads so this is all done in pretty much
JavaScript knows all about every single
tag that you had created every single
div and then in your JavaScript file
which will be over here you can go ahead
and edit them make them dynamic so that
is what I wanted to say make sure that
you always use an onload function
because anything in here executes after
your webpage is loaded and anything in
here in the head of course executes
before the body is loaded make sense so
now what I want to do is go ahead and
all right I think I have everything good
go here now let's go ahead and create
that movies javascript file so go ahead
and put file save as and I'll just go
ahead and save this is movies JavaScript
and now what I want to do is function in
what I named this create list so now
what it's going to do is it knows about
all of these divs now in this function
once the webpage is loaded it's going to
go over here and call this function
pretty freaking sweet humm so let me go
ahead and just I guess inside this div
we can just put like a an unordered list
or something on my movies so let's go
ahead and since we're going to have you
know kind of a big list let's go ahead
and make a variable s will stand for you
know just string you can name it
anything you want and s is just going to
be equal to and this is going to be a
really simple function um just go ahead
and put</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
