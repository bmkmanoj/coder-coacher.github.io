Photoshop cs6 tutorial
I'm your host buddy Blackbird and today
we're going to be using the history
panel again to talk about using
snapshots to your advantage and what
snapshots are are an image of the
document that exists at the time that
you take it so it pretty much holds all
like your information and stuff and you
can revert back to it that snapshot and
you like go back in case you like mess
something up or something like that or
you didn't like the look of your new
changes you just go back to the snapshot
that you took and you can start back
over again so let's open up the history
panel which is up here at the top with
this these I honestly I don't really
know what this icon is it's just like
some boxes as an arrow going up maybe
it's just something like a list looking
thing who knows it's not the best thing
for history maybe like a clock or
something but right now it's just this
picture right here and if I take a
snapshot I can do that by coming down to
this camera looking icon and click on it
and it will create a new snapshot for me
and you can see his name snapshot one
and you can rename it by clicking on it
and then I'll just type a corn dog or
something like that so I know that's the
first one now let's go ahead and I'll
I'll just make some changes and I'm just
going to draw on this for fun I'm gonna
have to rasterize it so I can draw on it
and then get myself fun some looks like
I only got coffee stain brushes right
now but I'll draw some things and just
goof around
all right so I got that and I want to
add some other stuff just so we know
that just to like emphasize my point I
guess so here here's what we got now
take another snapshot of this and I'll
just name it corndog - all right and
that's what we got so I'm looking at
this and my client hates this and he
wants me to redo it from scratch so what
I'm gonna do is all I need to do is
instead of going back all these times
and figuring out where I left off I'll
got to do is click on my old snapshot
and I can start working on it from there
again easy enough now as you can see
even like rest your eyes and stuff it's
back to like a smart layer so I'm gonna
have to rasterize the layer again and
then I can start drawing on this again
so that's a pretty much a snapshots work
now I can go back to my old snapshot
that are my other snapshot that I took
if I feel like you're a client or your
boss Desai said he liked what you've
done and this has happened to me several
times where I do something he's like now
let me try something else
because they want to see what their
options are so you take a snapshot of it
and save it and then you do what he
wants you to do take another snapshot of
that so here's my other one that I made
and then you can just go back to where
you have done without having to do a
whole bunch of work now you can create a
snapshot from the menu options also and
then when you do it that way you get a
an option box that comes up so let's
come up here to the options go to a new
snapshot and then we've got this option
panel you can rename your snapshot
easily so
fun I just just named it at some random
and then you've got this right here in
this from where says full document
merged layers are current letters so
full document means it saves you it
saves the entire visible image and all
the layers merged is it only saves the
merged layers and current layer only
saves the active layer so that would
only save that layer right there so when
you're taking your snapshot you can
refine it a little bit to different
different methods and things that you
want to use so remember that the
snapshot is good for moving back and
forth between different versions of your
of your document quickly and to be a
fast efficient artist you'll need to
learn how to do this and I use snapshots
a lot and I think they're great so
thanks a lot for watching this one be
sure to use snapshots in your workflow
have a good one everybody and thumbs-up
if you liked the video see you guys
