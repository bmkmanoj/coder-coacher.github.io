was a necessary by newest now that we
got all of our code type go ahead and
let's go ahead and start working in the
interface so go ahead and click on main
window the xib and this is going to open
your main interface file so let's go
ahead and let me rearrange everything
all nice and neat and let's go ahead and
take a look at these icons five owner
responder app delegate of course a
window by saying all right what we are
missing here is actually a view
controller and we actually need one so
let's go ahead and add one right now so
go ahead and click on the view
controller and the icon for that is
right up here if you click on it you can
see it says view controller that's how
you know you got the right one selected
and go ahead and drag this over to the
window that says main window to xib with
all the other icons so now you see a
little view controller pops up and we'll
be working in here later but just move
this aside for now actually what you can
do is move this window out of the way
and put your view controller right here
because now this is well I'll talk about
this later on but noise so now what we
want to do now that your main window has
a view controller go ahead and click on
that view controller icon and in your
identity inspector go ahead in by
default this classes UI view controller
we want to go ahead and switch to this
to switch class so now this view
controller is the switch class it pretty
much switch class is now the class that
handles the main windows view so again
by adding a view controller to your main
window and by changing that view
controllers class the switch class now
thats which class of the co in there is
now the class that handles the main view
for your program pretty cool huh that
easy so go ahead in from your library
well what we want to do now is we want
to start working with this view I mean
since it's pretty much the main view for
our program now so the first thing we
want to do is add a view to our gray
window so go ahead and the view is right
here it's just
under windows views and bars just a
little white dotted with grey background
go ahead and drag this over on view just
like this and now we have a pretty much
a blue background and this is pretty
much a view for our screen easy enough
servicing all right I remember you said
that the only thing that's really going
to be in here is a toolbar at the bottom
and I wasn't lying now we need to add a
toolbar at the bottom I mean need to
keep my promise don't I so go ahead and
select to a bar and that's a little
symbol with a button that you can't read
up on I wonder what that says hmm
interesting maybe toolbar so go ahead
and drag this over on the bottom make
sure it's lined up looks pretty good and
now what we need to do is I mean you
don't need to change the buttons title
but I'm gonna just go ahead and click
this input like switch views and now
deselect it and it'll pop up start
saying alright looks cool we're done
right no not yet what we need to do is
actually add that action method to this
button but check it out go ahead and
select this button and make sure you
just don't click it twice or else it's
going to double click press it once and
then it's going to select tool bar wait
a couple seconds so you don't double
click press it again and it's going to
select the button itself and you know
when you select the button if in the
attributes that says bar button that's
how you know you select the button on
the bar so if we're saying all right I
know how to add actions go over to your
inspector click touch up drag it over to
files owner no no no a button is a
little bit different it only has one
really thing that you can do to it it's
only touch up so you don't go over to
your inspector right here and click
touch up and drag it over this is weird
but I know just follow along what you
need to do is control drag it to your
switch class so once your buns can
select it control on your keyboard
keyboard drag it over to your switch
class and now you see the methods from
that switch class that we can use go
ahead and select switch views and
this is the method that switches from
one view to another again there should
only be one method in there because
that's all we created aside from a
couple properties but though shouldn't
pop up so now we added an action to that
button you're saying all right now I
finally done no no no there's one more
thing that you need to do and I promise
that's it for this tutorial in order for
that your app delegate which is pretty
much the code that runs automatically
when your program starts in order to
access the switch class and remember it
needs to access this class so it can add
this view to the main window so in order
for your delegate to access the switch
class and add that view to the main
window what you need to do is control
drag from this icon beans app delegate
or whatever your project name is control
drag over to switch class and that means
to access it via the outlets which class
and now once they are linked together
and you gave it that outlet again like I
said it can now access that switch class
and why do you need to access the switch
class well to add a view to the main
window so I know that might have been a
little confusing but that is what you
need to do to a pretty much get
everything hooked up and situated so our
next tutorial we're going to be building
the method itself that switch view
method to switch from one class to
another it's a I haven't have nothing to
say so um yeah watch that tutorial it's
going to be a good one and we're almost
done with this program so if you have
any questions just ask me in my forum
and I'll be happy to help so thanks for
watching don't forget subscribe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
