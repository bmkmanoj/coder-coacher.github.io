and in this video I'm going to be
showing you guys how to import images
into your game because you know these
ovals and rectangles in plain old text
that's pretty interesting but usually
whenever you develop a game you make the
graphics some rel it's like in a program
Photoshop or something and you import
those into your game so what I did is I
actually downloaded an image off the
internet so let me see if I could find
it downloads I just found you know the
cutest most handsome smartest guy I
could and you know whoever the heck this
guy is that's who I got but another
thing on a serious note make sure that
you work with pings because you can
import like a JPEGs and gifts and stuff
but ping is the best resource graphic
wise to work with because I don't know
it's just in my experience I don't have
any you know technical rationale behind
this it just messes up the least amount
of time so go ahead and grab a simple
ping image and if you just want to you
know download one off the internet if
you don't have Photoshop or anything
that's fine now what we need to do is we
need to import it into our project so
look how easy this is if you have
Windows just go ahead and grab your
image and drag it over to your AR ES
file and drop it now it says okay do you
want to copy the files or link to files
go ahead and copy those and select ok
and now if you go ahead and expand your
folder you can see that my face dot ping
is now imported into our project so
that's pretty cool thing about Eclipse
and Windows it makes it really easy to
import images so now that we have it
imported and accessible what we want to
do now is probably delete this oval so
actually 201 30 let me go ahead and
write those coordinates down 200 130 and
that's where we're going to be putting
the image instead or so as you can see I
deleted that oval hopefully we can put
the image of my face right
there so the very first thing you need
to do before you work with any graphics
or images is you need to make an image
object so in order to do that we use the
image class and then just go ahead and
give it a variable name I'll just name
it face you can name it whatever you
want if yours is you know not my face
now in order to create a new object from
this class new image and the parameter
that it takes is actually the location
of the image now that's another cool
thing of having it right in our own
project it's really easy to link to our
es /o was this my face ping so now we
created an image object basically the
face object represents this image right
here so now all we do is draw it on the
screen and we drop pretty much just like
any other thing we've been drawn use our
graphics object because you know that's
responsible for drawing everything on
the screen even images or pings draw
image is the method that you want to use
and see that's why I hate when that pops
up because we actually only need three
parameters not 318 like they gave us by
default so the first parameter is what
is the object that you want to draw on
the screen well the object is of course
this image object which is my face in
second - of course x and y-coordinates
200 and 130 we're good to go
so that's basically again to recap one
last time go ahead and drag and drop an
image preferably a ping into your folder
right here and then basically just go
ahead and create an image object and use
that a graphics object to draw on the
screen so now hopefully there we go
right there it actually works amazing I
thought I was going to mess that up
somehow so look at our game now hand
blaster 2.0 even though you know this is
our very first version it just sounds
cool are you ready to blast some hamm
here is you know probably a gun or
something in here is the big old ham
right here
so anyways that's how you import images
into your project or into your game in
the next tutorial we're going to be
working on is actually doing something
interactive with the user maybe
animation clicking buttons having these
things move around it's going to be
awesome we got a long ways to go but for
now thanks for watching don't forget to
subscribe don't forget to add me on
Google+ follow me on Twitter and send me
you know $5000 in mail if you want so
I'll see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
