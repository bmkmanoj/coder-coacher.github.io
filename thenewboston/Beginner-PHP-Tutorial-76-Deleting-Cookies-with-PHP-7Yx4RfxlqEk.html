creating this video for the new Boston
and I'm back to tell you how we're going
to unset a cookie
so we've already set a cookie in the
last example we set this for 10 seconds
now just for the purpose of this
tutorial I'm going to increase this to
say a larger time so I'm going to say
1000 seconds just so we can show you
shall show that it's working so in view
dot PHP we can view the this the
contents of the cookie so if we just
refresh at the moment we can see that
there's nothing set so we go to set PHP
that sets it we can go back to view and
you can see that the data is being shown
and that's a corresponding to this data
in here now what if I want to break this
before the expiration time that I've set
which is a thousand seconds now you
might think oh there may be some kind of
function you know or unset cookie or
that's a sunset to unset cookie or
something like that but in actual fact
the way to do this is to reset the
cookie now by this I mean we use exactly
the same line of code however if we want
to unset it and we just put a minus
value in it's as simple as that and that
will unset the cookie so even though in
this instance here we're setting the
cookie a line down we are unsetting it
so even when we access set dot PHP that
previously set our cookie we've also
unset it as well so now if we were to go
back and click on view you can see that
the name Alex doesn't appear because it
won't be able to find this value because
we have set then unset it so why do you
need to unset a cookie or why would you
ever need to unset a cookie well the
answer is quite simple I've already
spoken about login and registration
systems if you had logged your user in
and you're storing the fact that they're
logged in in a cookie and you may be
logged them in for a thousand seconds if
you wanted to log them out you might
have a logout button now when I click a
logout button
we need some way of ensuring that that
cookie is deleted and unset so we the
users no longer logged in so obviously
clicking a logout button would perform
some kind of operation like this to
ensure that the cookies unset and the
users no longer logged in so that's a
simple example of why you'd unset a
cookie and that's basically a simple way
and well I think the only way to unset a
cookie in PHP</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
