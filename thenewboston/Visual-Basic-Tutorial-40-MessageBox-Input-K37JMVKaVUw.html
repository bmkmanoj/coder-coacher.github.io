slash on live gamer for the new Boston
and in this tutorial we're going to be
taking a look at message boxes and what
we're going to do is we're going to get
what the user has selected so let's say
we choose message box buttons dot abort
retry and ignore well we're going to get
which one they clicked and then do
something according to that so let's go
ahead and create a new project and let's
go ahead and call it more message boxes
select windows forms application and
click OK now let's go ahead and resize
the form and now let's show our tool box
and we'll add a button now let's go
ahead and rename this to button message
and then we'll go ahead and double click
on this now this is going to open up the
event handler for that and we'll go
ahead and zoom in some so now what we're
going to do is we're going to show a
message box so we'll type message box
dot show and for our arguments we're
going to use click something for the
message and then we'll just do title for
the title and then we'll do message box
buttons dot abort retry ignore and now
for our last argument we'll just do
message box icon dot question
okay so now that shows this message box
we are going to create an if statement
around this message box so what we're
going to do is we're going to type if
right here
so if message box I'll show and it's got
our abort retry and ignore so if that
equals just type in a board and we can
see right here that we've got windows
forums dot dialog result dot abort so
what this does is it tests to see if the
user has clicked abort so it's got
window stop forms because the message
box is stored under the windows dot
forms and then we've got dialog result
which is the result of what they clicked
in the message box and then we've got
dot abort now there's other stuff we can
use here we can use cancel ignore no
none okay retry and yes so we're just
going to do abort so now we're going to
add an ENDIF right here so we can get
rid of that error showing up so now what
we're going to do is we're going to type
message box dot show and we'll type
aborted so they know that they have
aborted whether whatever operation it is
even though there isn't one this is just
a demo program so now we can run this
and you can see here that we've got form
one and we can click button one and
it'll tell us to click something and
then when we click abort you can see
that it shows a message box that says
aborted now if we go ahead and run this
and click something else other than a
board like retry it's just going to
close out of that
so here I'll zoom out a bit here so you
can see all of this code or that's not
going to work so if message box I show
and then we've got our message box and
then we set the message box buttons to
abort
try ignore so if that equals abort then
go ahead and tell them that it is has
aborted now my challenge for you guys is
to add some else if statements that
we'll handle if they type something
other than I mean if they click
something other than abort so let's say
if they click retry it's going to
message box not show retrying you can
also put this in a select case statement
which is more efficient than an if
statement so go ahead and practice this
this might be a little bit confusing for
you at first but you'll get the hang of
it and once you got this down go ahead
and move on to the next tutorial thanks
for watching guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
