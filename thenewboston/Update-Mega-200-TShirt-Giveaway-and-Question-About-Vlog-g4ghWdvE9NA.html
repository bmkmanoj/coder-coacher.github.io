first of all let's just get out of the
way obviously I know I'm wearing very
nerdy glasses right now and I look kind
of geeky but this is all I got to wear
right now because I ran out of context
and my other ones haven't came in the
mail yet but anyways we're not here to
talk about my fashion we are here to
talk about t-shirts so the first thing I
mentioned I got a whole slew things here
I want to talk about is I'm shipping the
other t-shirts from the last giveaway
today later this afternoon and if you
guys want to know what 100 t-shirts look
like check it out I had to fill up this
laundry basket filled these little
packets I'll make sure not to show
anyone stress this one right here in
this one right here so I gotta like
freaking a hundred pounds of t-shirts so
those are the ones from last contest so
I'll be mailing those out to the winners
now I figured you know what since we're
done with one t-shirt contest might as
well go ahead jump in to start another
one or start another one right now so i
figured i'm going to do this one a
little different instead of giving away
my usual 100 t-shirts I figured you know
what might as well give away 200
t-shirts so I'm giving away two
different types of t-shirts of 101 and
100 of the other the first style is this
if you guys follow me on Google+ or if
you guys know me in real life whenever
anyone asked me for advice I pretty much
say follow your heart every single time
because it's cheesy and really good
advice at the same time so I say so much
it's annoying and it's my slogan on
google+ so the first tee shirt is this
follow your heart and I know you guys
can't see it but it says the New Boston
right is like a subliminal message on
the heart but anyways it's a plain white
t-shirt that says follow your heart I
wear all the time and everything
everyone thinks I'm very cheesy but I
love it so you guys can either choose
that one or this is a more serious one
when my subscribers made this design for
me it just says the new boston in it's a
dark grey t-shirt and has a dove in the
middle and it says Boston
the bottom in its maroon with like white
outline pretty sweet actually like this
one too so I have two different styles
like I said the heart one and the Dove
one so whenever you send me your
information make sure you tell me what
style you want now what else did I need
to talk about here let me see if I can
see this with my glasses same rules as
before everyone in the world is eligible
it doesn't matter where you live I will
ship it anywhere in the world whenever
you tell me your size I have sizes if
you're like a girl I think they were
sizes like numbers like four in ten and
stuff don't send me that I have small
sizes small through three XL so you know
standard t-shirt size tell me that your
full name of course you have to send me
your address in guys please make sure
that your address is properly formatted
because a lot of people just like type
it on one long line and I don't know
what the street name is or what your
city name is so make sure that you
properly format it just makes it a
little bit easier for me and also like I
said tell me what style of t-shirt you
want either the Dove that grey one or
the follow your heart t-shirt now of
course you must be a subscriber to win
probably if you're watching this video
then your subscriber already and the
last thing is I got a lot of comments
both on my forum and on what is it
YouTube asking me how to private message
and you guys probably saw this too if
you're reading the comments so I went on
Google+ and YouTube in these are both
ways that you can enter so this is how
you private message on each and if you
guys are to know how to private message
and you know skip forward a minute in
this video that's what I'm going to talk
about so on youtube on the top right
hand side click on your username now
when you do you're going to see a
section that drops down says inbox click
on the link that goes to your inbox now
once you're in your inbox on the left
hand side there's a button that says
compose click on that it creates a new
message now of course where it says to
that's who you want to send it to fill
in the New Boston because that's my
username that's who you want to send it
to now on google+ if you want to enter
through
Plus then go to your homepage your main
page now go to the section where you
make a new post now as your post where
you normally would enter you know what
you're doing today or pictures go ahead
and type in all the information like
your name and address and where you want
to send it to right below it by default
it's set to public now if you leave it
at public it's going to be sent to
everyone so don't do that you only want
to send it to me so X out public and
instead type this plus a plus sign Bucky
Roberts now whenever you do this
hopefully I'm in your circle as soon as
you start typing Bucky Roberts my name
will automatically pop up you'll see my
little dumb face right there click me
and again if you do this it won't go to
anyone publicly it'll only go to me so
that's how you send a private message on
google+ well I think I just spit there
so uh let's see yeah I said that already
and another thing that's make is going
to make my life a whole lot easier
whenever you enter through YouTube you
have of course the subject line in the
body as the subject right what sure you
want and also which size so for example
a right heart shirt small and it just
makes it a lot easier because I send all
my smalls first because I have them in
piles so I want to send all my smalls
then on my medium zemin all my largest
and if you format it that way oh sorry i
got kennel cough if you format it that
way then it's going to make my life a
whole lot easier so right here uh as the
subject right what sure you won't want
yeah there we go what shirt and what
size and in the body that's where you
want to write your full name and
properly formatted address I know it's a
lot of work but trust me whenever you
send 200 t-shirts um and you get like
thousands and thousands of messages
things can get confusing kind of fast so
I just want to make sure that I send it
to all the proper addresses and
everything like that and the last thing
is and guys I promise this is the last
thing I want to talk about for this
little video I'm going to start vlogging
because I did
think it's fun and my friends want to
start vlogging with me too so I'm pretty
much just going to start carrying my
camera around everywhere I go and I
filming my life basically so I was
thinking because i know i have another
channel dedicated to my personal stuff
but most of my subscribers are on this
one and this is kind of like my personal
life instead of like my podcasts or
something so if you guys want me to put
my personal vlogs on this channel the
new boss then then go ahead and just say
so in the comments below I'll read them
all and i take whatever the general
population boats but if you guys want me
to put it on my other channel the new
boston TV then let me know that as well
because i'm going to start making them
in wherever i upload the vlogs either
the new boston or the new boston TV
that's up to you guys so let me know and
yeah I think that's pretty much it
that's all I had to talk about hopefully
my contacts come in today so I don't
look like Steve Urkel or some nerdy guy
for the rest of my life so I will send
out these t-shirts today and for
everyone else if you don't win one trust
me you guys are going to have plenty
more opportunities including oh maybe
some even more awesome t-shirts in the
future hint hint so anyways thank you
guys for watching of everyone who isn't
subscribed don't forget to subscribe to
enter the contest and uh yeah I'll see
you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
