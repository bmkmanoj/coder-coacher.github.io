org and this is another video tutorial
in PHP for the New Boston in this video
I'm going to be talking on the subject
of operators but we're going to be using
comparison operators and I'm going to be
showing you how they work and what
they're useful for now let's go back to
our previous examples of having
variables I'm going to say 10 and number
2 I'm going to make that equal to 9
now comparison operators are basically
when we compare one or more values we
can compare any amount of values we want
in this example we're going to be
comparing sort of a maximum of three
values just to demonstrate but without
going going too far over time now for
this example we're going to be using if
statements so if you haven't already
learned about if statements go to the
video about if statement and have a look
at that so you can get a general idea
but as far as this is concerned I'm
going to set up an if statement with my
block just under here as well so I've
got the block of data that's going to be
executed here if this equals true now
remember this inside here evaluates to
either true or false
therefore if I was to say if true
I'm going to echo out inside so this is
inside out our block I'm going to
refresh and that's as inside however if
I was to change this to false and I
refresh it's not going to echo anything
out because this has evaluated
automatically to false I've used the
false keyword now it's the same as if I
was to do 1 equals 1 now you probably
noticed I've just put two equal signs in
there now remember when we assign values
we use a single equal sign however when
we use double value of double equal sign
we compare so we're comparing the number
one to the number one now the number one
is equal to the number one this means is
equal to so we're asking the question is
one equal to one and this statement will
evaluate to true so we are going to echo
out
text inside so let's refresh inside now
we can say if does one equal two it
doesn't so we're not going to echo this
text down now the other the other
assignment opera comparison operator
sorry are not equal to so what we do is
we use an exclamation mark and then we
still use a single equal sign so we've
got two characters here we've got an
exclamation mark and a single equal to
sign and this in plain English reads two
does one or doesn't one equal to or does
this not equal this now the answer is
yes it doesn't one doesn't equal two so
therefore we this is going to evaluate
to true so one doesn't equal two
therefore we're going to echo out the
text inside now if we change this back
to a 1 does 1 not equal 1 1 does equal 1
so this is going to evaluate to false so
let's refresh and we don't echo the text
down so now what we can do is start
working with things like greater than
and greater than or equal to or less
than or less than or equal to so for
example just to let you know beforehand
this can also be written like this so
we've got sort of conflict in less than
and greater than signs so 1 is equal to
1 so we're not displaying anything
however if we change this back to 2 as
I've shown in the previous example it's
still working so that can be this or
this it's entirely up to you I always
prefer this I just think it's a lot
easier to to read and process in your
mind because we tend to think of this as
sort of maybe a perhaps a negative thing
like her we're exclaiming something so
doesn't equal to you know it's just a
lot easier to read so let's go on to
incorporating our variables up here that
I've assigned earlier into this if
statement now I want to say does is or
is number 1 greater than number 2 so in
here I'm going to change this text so
I'm going to say either yes or no
so yes is going to be our text
we're echoing out otherwise echo no so
we're using an if-else statement now so
if number one is greater than number two
we say yes otherwise we say no so
obviously in this case number one is
equal to ten and number two is equal to
nine so number one is bigger than number
two so or greater than in real terms
so we're echoing out the text yes now if
I was to change this to smaller than so
is that or less than is number one less
than number two it's not so this
statement here is going to evaluate to
false and we say no it's not so we
that's the text we echo out to the
screen now what we can also do is we can
say is number one greater than or equal
to now if we just left this as greater
than and we had 10 and 10 10 isn't
greater than 10 its equal to 10 so this
is still going to evaluate as false
so we're reading is 10 greater than 10
and the answer is of course no it stays
does now however if we incorporate an
equal sign in remember when we did the
not equals we're incorporating the equal
sign this now reads is number 10 greater
than or equal to number 2 and in fact
this statement is going to evaluate to
true because 10 isn't greater than but
it is equal to so we get the text yes
echoed and we can do exactly the same
with less than or equal to we're still
going to be receiving the value yes
because it is still equal to as well if
we were to put this as 2 this is now
smaller than it's not equal to but it is
smaller than so when we do refresh we
still get the value
Oh down okay so now these are the
comparison operators we're comparing two
different numbers or two different
variables as it stands this may as well
read obviously two and ten because we're
just replacing the variables inside here
but however simple they may seem they
are extremely useful you'll probably
find yourself using the double equals a
lot if you're creating code for example
if a user was to submit a password
through a form you may want to check if
their password is equal to maybe a
preset password or a password stored in
the database and therefore what we'd do
is we'd do something like if we were to
have a preset password I'm going to set
my password up here to password so
obviously quite a basic password and I
might say if password so it helps if you
read it out English if password equals
equals password then we echo correct
otherwise so else echo incorrect so the
way we read this is in English would be
password the variable password equals
password this is the password that needs
to be matched now we say if the password
so the password up here is equal to
password correct otherwise incorrect so
refresh at the moment it's correct
however if we were to change this to
something else it's incorrect so you can
see how on a daily basis this could come
into great use and and these comparison
operators can help you operate your
program really really well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
