and we're gonna warp it a little bit so
it's a little bit above and there we go
I might want to make the wipe a little
less or a little shorter
there we go
and that looks pretty good
now we'll probably want to make this
reflection a little bit more blurry so
I'm gonna add another blur which I I'm
just going to type in blur over here and
use this fast blur and put it on and
we'll just increase it to like five or
something like that
now it looks like you need to put push
down the top picture first
have a little line in between which I
don't want so let's move this one up a
little to get rid of that line I moved
it up way too far if I press my arrow
keys I can move it down just a few
pixels so I think my problem here is
probably my blur is I'm going the wrong
way so just maybe just change this to
horizontal and now it looks a little
more correct let's blur it on the sides
but it's not all messed up here at the
edge where it should be reflecting so
we've got our reflection going on here
but we need something to make it look a
little more realistic so we're gonna add
a light in here and we're gonna go to
layer new light and I'm gonna add a
spotlight and it's just gonna be a white
light and I'll edit these I'll edit
these here later I'll just put that 250
because I think that's the default and
hit OK now this light needs to back off
so let's go into another view like our
what's going to our left and back this
light off a lot
and I'm gonna go into the top and maybe
move it to the side bring it out here
like this
and I want it to shine down on it so
make sure it's up in the up in the air
above it and then shining down let's
check out and see what this looks like
no it's not it doesn't seem like it's
bright enough
unless I get shine down a little more on
the wrong thing
now we'll set the object here to have a
shadow so we'll come down here and to
our material options and cast shadow on
and there we go
shadows a little hard
so let's soften that up
let's go to 30 and diffuse it out a
little more see what this does
there we go
let me increase this cone a little bit
go to get a little more light in there
now it looks like we've got a light
reflecting on here and it's casting
reflection onto the ground let's add an
ambient light in here their new ambient
was this ambient so I know which ones
which and decrease the settings here
will decrease the intensity by a decent
amount looks like wait now that I have
the ambient on here it looks like I'm
gonna have to adjust my my shadow
and now I've got a scene here that has a
reflection and a light and it makes it
look like it's a impossibly real life so
the only thing I think I do again is
make this reflection still smaller there
we go that looks better and the opacity
of this reflection let's bring it down
there we go and there you have it for
your fake reflections that's how you
make them in after-effects without any
plugins and it's pretty much a
rudimentary way of making the
reflections and if you just search on
the internet for reflection plugins
other people have made some that you can
use that will probably work a little bit
better but this is how you do it without
using any plugins so thanks for watching
this and hopefully you figure it out how
to do it and use it whenever you need to
make something look a little bit more
realistic so thanks a lot everybody have
a good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
