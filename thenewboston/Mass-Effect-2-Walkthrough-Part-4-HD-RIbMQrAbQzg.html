what's the quickest way to those
shuttles depends where the mechs are
thickest it's probably best if chick
check anyone on this frequency anybody's
still alive out there hello Wilson this
is jacob i'm here with commander shepard
just took out a wave of mex over in d
wing shepherds alive never mind you need
to get him out of there get to the
service tunnels and head for the network
control room Roger that Wilson stay on
this frequency i think i remember a
Wilson checking on me one time when I
woke up that's him he's the chief
medical tech answers directly to Miranda
come on service tunnels are this way
hostiles detected motion is crawling
with men I'm doing the best I can be
physical reconstruction of subject is
complete but we still need to evaluate
all mental and neurological functions
our orders were clear make a commander
shepard who he was before the explosion
say mind the same morals the same
personality if we all day
Shepard Jeb bastards got me in a leg we
need to get off this station I'm not
going anywhere until someone fits as my
leg should be some meta gel in the first
aid station on the wall hopefully
there's enough to get him up and moving
again grab the meta gel from the
first-aid station on the wall thanks
Shepherd never thought you'd saved my
life guess that makes us even now I
thought maybe I could shut down the
security mix but whoever did this fried
the whole system completely irreversible
we didn't ask what you were doing why do
you even have security met clearance you
were in the bio wing what are you
listening I came here to try and fix
this besides I was shot how do you
explain that you're all strangers to me
let's get someplace safe and we'll sort
out who's all minutes right Shepherd we
need to find Miranda we can't leave her
behind forget about Miranda she was over
in D wing the mechs were all over that
sector there's no way she survived a
bunch of mex won't drop Miranda she's
alive where is she why haven't we heard
from her there are only two possible
explanations she's either dead or she's
a traitor then why did you wake me up
and warn me about the attack okay maybe
she's not a traitor but that doesn't
change the facts we're here she's not we
need to save ourselves the shuttlebay is
only a few
we can overload the canisters to clear a
path have a nice trip okay we took him
down but this is getting tense Shepherd
if I tell you who we work for we can
trust me this really isn't the time
Jacob we won't make it if he's expecting
a shot in the back if you want to piss
off the boss it's your ass Jacob the
Lazarus project the program that rebuild
its funded and controlled by servers I
think I rented a Cerberus a few times
while I was investigating Sarah some
kind of pro-human splinter group right
well that's what the Alliance wants
people to believe there's more to the
Alliance declared your debt they gave up
Cerberus spent a fortune to bring you
back look I'd be suspicious too but
right now we have to work together I
thought you deserve to know what's what
once we're off the station i'll take you
to the Illusive man he'll explain
everything I promise well if I won't get
any more answers here let's get moving</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
