video and in this video the only thing
that I'm going to be doing is I want to
show you guys how to properly organize
your project into different layers
because if you don't then trust me
everything is going to be very confusing
and complicated as you keep adding more
stuff so what I want to do first is
separate this background layer from the
layer where we're going to be adding our
other stuff now the reason I want to do
this is because if you think about it
our game is going to have this one
background that's going to stay the same
no matter what it's also going to have a
bunch of other stuff such as our player
the enemy the bullets all that stuff is
going to be moving around and
interacting with each other so it's good
to separate these in different layers so
you don't accidentally you know armed
you aren't accidentally able to shoot
your background layer and blow it up and
end the game or something stupid like
that so if you go over to your layers
panel which is right next to your
project panel right here you can see
that we have one layer so far now this
is of course the background layer so
what I want to do is actually rename
this so if you select it you can click
on this little um I don't know if it's a
pen or a pencil but it says rename layer
and just rename this to background so
it's always good to rename your layers
something other than layer 0 layer 1
layer 2 and this is just so well
obviously um it's less confusing you
guys you know know the benefits of
renaming layers don't have to explain it
and another thing I want to do is I want
to go ahead and right now make a new
layer now in order to make a new layer
just click this little plus icon and
that adds another layer on top of the
background layer so pretty much anything
that we add to this layer is going to
peer on top of this instead of behind it
because if we put behind it we wouldn't
be able to see any of the players or
enemies and stuff like that so again
make sure that layer 0 is on top of the
background layer and I actually want to
rename this one too so make sure it's
selected rename this one
two main enhancer again not the state
just word and uh well there's a stay in
America called Maine in case anyone
didn't know that most of you guys did
but anyways the next point is this
so Maine as I said this is going to be a
little layer where everything is moving
around our players are in our enemies
our bullets they're all going to be
interacting with each other this
background layer however we don't ever
want to touch again this is perfect
right now as is so in order to ensure
that we never accidentally edit this
layer we can go ahead and can click this
little lock icon next to it now as you
can see it goes from a lock that was
open to a lock that's closed this
basically means that this layer is now
uneditable you can't accidentally click
it and actually if you try to select it
now you can can't select it sorry house
but that's what we want so now since we
can't select that make sure you have
your main layer selected and we're going
to be working on this layer for the
continuation of these tutorials so it's
also very important to make sure you
have it selected because arm it's
whenever you have a layer selected it's
called the active layer and any objects
you out of your game are going to be
added on the active layer as you're
going to see them a little bit so now on
the layout what we can do is we can
double click to insert a new object now
the first thing that I want to enter is
just a mouse object so if we scroll down
we can see that it has a couple
different forms of input now input is
just the way that the user can tell the
game how to do something so you can use
a gamepad such as like a Nintendo
controller Xbox Playstation you can use
your keyboard and mouse you know what
those are and this touch is actually
from like iPods and iPads and Android
phones touch like that so the first
thing I want to do since we're just you
know working with our computer is add a
mouse object so just select that and hit
insert now basically our game can take
input from the mouse and also another
thing I want to do
is add keyboard input so again double
click this scroll down to input select
keyboard and hit insert so right now
what we just told this game is okay
you're going to be getting information
from the mouse and also from the
keyboard so just be ready for that
whenever we move on and another thing I
want to point out is unlike before
whenever we added the texture and we had
to give it a position like 0 0 and give
us a size we don't need to do that
whenever we insert a mouse and keyboard
object because these aren't physical
objects you don't place them in a
physical location like you would arm a
character or block or a coin you would
just you're pretty much just telling the
game that is what kind of input you're
accepting so just remember that there
are different types of object objects
and that's what objects we just use so
now that our game knows that it's going
to be accepting input from the mouse and
also again from the keyboard let's go
ahead and start adding all that cool
stuff those characters those enemies
those bullets explosions all that stuff
we downloaded and that stuff is called
sprites and I'm going to be talking to
you guys about what sprite is it's not
the soda and also why we need them in
the next tutorial so now that our game
is ready to accept input I will see you
guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
