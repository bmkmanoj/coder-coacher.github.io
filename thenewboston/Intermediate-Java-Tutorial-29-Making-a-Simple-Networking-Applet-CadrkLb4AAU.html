Java video and in this tutorial what
we're going to be doing is working on
the Java code that basically grabs the
information from an HTML file and it
utilizes it an applet to take your
browser to a different website basically
we're basically creating a browser
within a browser except our browser is a
lot crappier than like Chrome or
anything so you know not really a useful
application but you know it's useful for
learning job at least so what I did is I
created a new project and I just made a
new class you can really create a class
inside any project as long as it you
know as long as you code correctly but
anyways if you want to follow along with
me then go ahead and make a new project
and call make a class called Bucky's
sites Java now the first thing we want
to do is import everything that we need
to so the first thing we need to import
is java.net there we go
second thing import Java dot util and
this is like Auto type in everything for
me import java.awt talk to easy import
applets so java applet Wow
Airport okay now i'm messing up this is
where things start going south import
Java dot swing
and last but not least import probably
could have typed this out beforehand but
you know maybe some people wanted to
watch me type it Java X dot swing event
there we go so these are all the imports
they need pretty much to you know
utilize applets and make a GUI and you
know open to other housekeeping stuff
and aside from that what we want to do
after this is remember anytime we're
working with applets we want to inherit
from the J applet class so extends J
applet okay so we're good to go now
before we start you know grabbing the
information what I want to do is show
you guys how I'm going to set up this
applet I'm going to have three arm well
I might as well not talk and just go
ahead and start typing private hash map
in this hash map if you guys don't know
what a hash map is it's basically
something that takes keys and values
kind of like a dictionary and what this
is going to do is it's going to store
the titles and associate the title with
a certain URL so for example Bucky's
Twitter is going to be the title in the
URL is going to be HTTP twitter.com you
know the big URL so the title is
basically this what describes the
website in the URL the URL is what you
need to type in so of course the title
is going to be a string in the URL is
actually a URL object you think it would
be a string but whenever Java needs to
go to a website it can't just go to you
can't just type in the URL as a string
so even though well I'll show you guys
later what we're going to be doing but
we pretty much need to type in the
address as a string and convert it to a
URL because then Java says okay now that
I know that this is a URL URL it's a
valid location on the internet that we
can go I can use my networking
capabilities to take you there so that's
what we're going to be doing creating a
hash map
does that and I'm just going to name my
hashmap website info now after this I
want to create pretty much a list that's
going to store only the titles
themselves so private ArrayList now
again the information that this stores
is only the titles so the titles we can
go ahead and keep as a string won't need
to convert those to anything and I'm
just going to go ahead and name this
titles which is going to be you know the
New Boston org in Bucky's Twitter and
last but not least we need to go ahead
and create a list private main list and
of course this J list is pretty much the
list that is built into Java it's pretty
much the GUI itself because we can't
just type a bunch of crap in here we
have to turn into a list that Java
understands that you know we're
eventually going to make a GUI out of it
so there we go that's the basics of how
we set everything up I know we didn't do
a lot of you know useful crap we're
learning networking in this tutorial but
this was the boring stuff make sure that
you inherit from J applet and also setup
your project like I have it right here
and make sure you inherited everything I
did and in the next tutorial we're going
to be doing is we're going to be working
with the init method and I'm going to be
showing you guys all the in-depth
networking stuff so anyways thank you
guys for watching we're going to
subscribe and I'll see you guys in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
