the game Dante's Inferno so I thought
I'd take you along with my game playing
experience so let's see what this says
King Richard
prisoners detained a holy relic was
taken interesting I have to remember
that and let's see unsure haha so the
fate of prisoners was left undecided so
maybe I have a slight idea what the
storyline is here well let's see what's
going on here at the midpoint on the
journey of life I found myself
with a clear path was most
all right what's going on here that's me
evidently what are you doing here that's
it she's dipping it in some dirty water
dip no no a needle and uh oh oh that's
good that that should sanitize it and oh
I mean this makes sense me perfect sense
why not definite it took a long time and
been very painful
all right now as a cartoon on and then
moving all right so this is all
happening on my chest
remember that was unnecessary
really actually think this game is based
on the church stories
so these must be the prisoners all right
I understand that
all the what he's just hopped out all
right that it's me of Henle evidently I
decided to put some clothes on so I
really don't know what I'm something X
right now and just destroying these
people so let's see your jump a
there we go something that's why for
heavy attack alright I got now
all right so I guess I just kill these
people see this is a combo on my left or
something we'll find out later
ladies I'm supposed to be going or if
you like I said these people worked and
kill in fireballs from the sky really
because everyone does for me that all
right
going somewhere kill more people stop
coming a decent prisoner I'm not like
trying to free them and they're throwing
me and gods like shooting fireballs
coming from the sky what's going on
I'm just gonna keep hittin X&amp;amp;Y until it
I mean is this the whole game just one
spot maybe it is I'm not sure I hope not
let's see alright for these people maybe
that maybe I have to get a kill shrink
of like 30 or something like the book
that tells you what the lunatics come
shooting so art I think they're almost
done
$10 right there so I mean I'll get four
eventually there will go over here
hey no one left what's what's going on
here
well that can't be good
and I hop on there to a heavens vote Hey
double jump huh
all right well I'm just run over here
this of trouncing I don't do don't do it
right in the back
seriously come on man you can make it if
it just says the end right now and it
gives giving me the credits then I died
we'll be joined by those nice ruined
who's so well I guess that's the game
guys I'm sorry I thought it would be a
little longer than this well you know I
think I'm yeah rip that out oh I am not
done yet yeah if you want to take me
down you're gonna have to put off the
fight and that's gonna be in the next
video so I will see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
