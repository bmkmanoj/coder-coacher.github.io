are returned from search PHP inside here
and that's going to happen every time a
user presses a key and then that key
comes up from their keyboard so this
will happen instantly okay so nothing
really else is required on index dot PHP
we've included search PHP so we're going
to go ahead and write that code just in
just a moment however we've got our
input field and our div just here so
when we refresh now not refresh this
refresh our page we have this input
field here let's go ahead and just say
start searching there so it looks a bit
more user friendly so we can start our
search here for example we type London
every time we press a key down and then
it's released from our keyboard we're
going to be calling or performing a
function in insert j/s like I said which
will return results from search dot PHP
and then they will be placed into here
so hopefully that makes sense and
hopefully you understand the link
between each of these files let's go
ahead and create an event handler for
this input field in search Jas so we're
going to use the selector to select the
search input field room we'll use a hash
to select an ID in this case the ID has
the value of search so we've written
search just in here and then we need to
use the event handler key up now when
key up is pressed we want to perform or
when key up happens we want to perform a
function inside here and the content of
this function will obviously go in
between these curly brackets I'm gonna
move these down just slightly so we can
write our code in here and it looks
nicely we an indent it so now what we
want to do is go ahead and test this key
up event so I'm going to just place an
alert inside of here and we'll just say
something or we'll just right key up and
that will indicate us the event and how
it works or indicate to us how it works
so let's go ahead and type a character
I'm going to type a and you see that we
get this input key up now this should
give you a good clue as to how this is
now going to work every time we type
a letter or a character on our keyboard
we're going to send the result of this
this entire contents of this input field
to our search dot PHP file and then that
in turn return the results so we'll be
able to handle this quite easily now and
that should give you an idea of how it
works so the first thing to do is
obviously would retrieve the value of
the input field return whatever is
inside of this so we're going to create
a new var and I'm going to call this
search underscore term now that's going
to be equal to and we use the this
selector and that this here essentially
references this search field here we
reference here so this dot Val will
return the value within this text field
so now what we can do is go ahead and
alert search underscore term and what's
going to happen now is when we type a
key you can see that it returns the
result of the field now if I was to go
ahead and type an L you can see it
returns the updated value e it returns
that an X again it returns the updated
value so we now know that we have an
updated value every time we type a key
so we can send this search term variable
to search dot PHP in order to perform
our search on the value of this field so
now what we want to do is go ahead and
actually send the request so we're going
to be using the post HTTP request in
jQuery now this takes three parameters
in this case the far that we're going to
send to the variable set and also a
callback function now we look at the
callback function here in just a moment
however we know where the file is that
we want to send the results to and that
search PHP now that's located inside the
PHP folder in my directory structure so
let's go ahead and take a look at the
directory structure you can see that
we've got index dot PHP which is the far
we're working with here search j/s is
within these JavaScript folder the J's
folder here and PHP contains some files
like search PHP and DB dot PHP which we
have open here
so inside search is we want to send this
to PHP forward slash search dot PHP now
the variables that we want to send we
return of a key so the name of the
variable and then the search term so I'm
going to call the variable search term
and this here has nothing to do with
this here this is the variable name that
we pick up inside our PHP and we want to
send this with the value search term so
this here corresponds to this search
term that we retrieved and we send it as
a variable called search term so these
aren't to be confused with equaling each
other okay so finally we want a callback
function and the reason we take our
callback function is so we can return
the data sent back from search dot PHP
so we go ahead and create a function
outline here inside here is what happens
after this request has been complete so
we can pull that down so in here what we
want to do is go ahead and display
results and by displaying results what I
mean is inputting the results into this
div so changing the contents of this div
however we need a variable inside here
that holds this data so I'm just going
to go ahead and call that data so what
we're going to be doing now is when we
display the results we're going to be
setting the value or the contents of
this div to this data value here so
let's go ahead and test that out we're
going to use a selector to select the
search results div which is just here
and then what we're going to do is set
the HTML to something and this will be
data so as we send data to search dot
PHP and this data here we return the
content in this data variable of search
dot PHP for example if we were to just
say echo
from search PHP the data would then
content contained this value here from
search dot PHP</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
