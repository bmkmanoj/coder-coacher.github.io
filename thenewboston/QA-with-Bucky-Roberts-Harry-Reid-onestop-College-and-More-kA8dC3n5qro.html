my first question in answer video and I
decided to do this one in my bed and set
up on my regular chair uh you know just
because I felt like it so sorry my face
is really close to the camcorder and I'm
not wearing any pants by the way so
anyways I got my list of questions for
you guys and I'm gonna go ahead and try
to answer some for you so let's go ahead
and start a question for my blog
anonymous ooh yes obviously you're
gifted just couple questions first what
do you think of college and what do you
think of learning computer science in
college well I would like to say to
whoever you are that my opinion of
college is not very high at all I think
especially with computer science for a
$60,000 education you can get exactly
all you need to know or all you ever
want to know for like a couple hundred
bucks of books off of amazon.com but UH
the thing is aside from the education
you probably aren't even going to get a
job even any employer to look at your
application without degree so that's a
pretty dumb that you need a degree
filled a 90% of stuff you're never going
to learn again like biology and cooking
classes to good job in computer program
but that's the way it is so again I
don't think too highly of it in I uh you
know personally I went to school for
four years and it uh was probably one of
the biggest mistakes in my life I mean I
like to say I don't regret anything in
my life but uh this one thing going to
school myself if I could take it back
and just learn everything on my own just
off of books and reading I really would
do that so anyways that's what I think
about College not very highly of it now
the NY the nips said
what is the best way to get much
subscribers on YouTube what we should
work on that grammar first of all but
definitely the best way to get a lot of
subscribers is copying other people's
videos definitely that's the best way
make sure you have no original ideas at
all just uh copy as many people as can
like I saw thing on Fox News I guess a
spraying Axe body spray on yourself and
lighting lighting down fire I guess
that's pretty popular now anything with
cats or babies that's popular I would do
that maybe you could get a bunch of
babies and then lay them on the ground
and then spray a bunch of X body spray
on them and then um you know you
probably just shouldn't do that so uh
you know just uh actually the real
answer make videos that you would want
to watch that you find interesting and
then other people are probably going to
find an interesting in it's just going
to spread it's just going to grow itself
so make videos that you would want to
watch and other people probably going to
want to watch them too now the link fan
22 how did you become interested in
computers I become it I became
interested in Peters because I wanted to
create a computer game like it's called
like pirate quests or something like
that it's a it's like treyvion pretty
much and first I want to learn how to
create a website to do that and then I
need to learn PHP and from then
everything was just like oh cool I can
build programs and make money and uh I'm
going to go to school for this and then
that's when I really got started editing
video and I just fell in love with it
and that's what I'm in love with now so
pretty much I want to learn how to make
computer games in high school back then
alias Fang asked elbow WTF is one-stop
that sound clip I told you guys about
and to be honest I have no idea what it
is it's just a random little jingle on
your computer it's a it's pretty weird
but
you know if anyone knows why it's there
then I put me in comment something
because I have no idea why all right
let's see D shady what is your favorite
porn site really really do shady come on
seriously guys all right make some real
questions here rich to rock Harry Reid
and his next the advertisements hey but
other than that cool video dude is that
even though that's not even a question
or anything you know what whatever you
know I'm done with this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
