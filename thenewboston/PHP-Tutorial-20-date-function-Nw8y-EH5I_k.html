and this tutorial just couldn't be
telling you guys how to add a date to
your PHP scripts now it's a real easy
tutorial so follow along now what the
date function does is add a date to your
website or script and all you need for
the date function is the word date and
some parameters like that it's a
built-in function so you don't need to
program anything yourself now there are
three things that you use in the date
function the first is D a lowercase D
and that stands for the date of the
month the next is the letter M and this
stands for the month 1 to 12 it's going
to show up in numbers and next is a
capital y and this is going to display
the year and you can format these
letters any way you want so for example
if we had echo date which just means
echo the function date out put it on the
screen what we're going to want to do is
format this in any combination we want
so say we want a month day year and then
close it and strings because it's going
to be a string this is going to show the
month the date in the current year so
let's save this and refresh it and as
you see it's seven 20th 2008
and let's say you wanted to change this
up and you didn't want to use these uh
slashes you can format this anyway you
can put the date I mean on the day and
then the month and you could also use
periods or dots and save it as you can
see 27 2008 and you can also use
something like minus signs and anything
you want really and you and that's how
you can format it using the day the
month in the year and of course you can
use just the day just a month in just
the year you don't have to use all of
them but that's how you use the date
function it's a built in function in PHP
so study that this was a real easy
tutorial and I hope you watch the rest
