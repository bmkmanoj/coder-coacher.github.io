html5 tutorial and in this lesson I want
to start talking to you guys about the
web storage API so what the web storage
API is is basically a new way that we
can store data using websites so before
if you ever made a website and you
wanted to store some data from the user
for maybe a shopping car or maybe they
were playing a game and you need to
store some variables you were kind of
limited to sessions and cookies but the
web storage API is going to change all
that it's going to give you a new
awesome way to store data make it much
more efficient and give you guys another
set of tools that you can use it's
pretty awesome so let's go ahead and get
started
so the first thing I did is I wiped out
everything in my CSS and JavaScript file
however I'm linked to them both I didn't
want to go ahead and rewrite the whole
template because that's kind of
worthless so what I'm going to do is
start from scratch the first thing I'm
going to do is build a new section and
I'm just going to give it the ID of left
ID now I guess I might as well go ahead
and explain you guys what thing I'm
going to be building actually let me go
ahead and name this left box that might
be a little better what I'm going to be
doing is I'm going to be building two
boxes on the screen on the left hand
side it's just going to have a forum
where we can pretty much insert some
simple data and on the right hand side
or on the right box where we're going to
be doing is just testing out displaying
that data so I'm not gonna be you know
inserting into a database or making it
into a game or anything I'm just going
to be showing guys how to save it
through form and how to display it but
once we learn how to save it and also
how to access it then you guys can use
this for anything you want a game a
shopping cart you know Facebook MySpace
type website whatever the heck you want
so anyways that's what we're going to be
doing so I didn't want to just leave you
guys in the dark so we got a section in
this left box right here is where we're
going to be putting our form but for now
let me just go ahead and make the right
box while I can copy that code and I'm
just going to go ahead and name this
right box now by default it's not going
to display anything so let me just go
ahead and write nothing yet Haase right
in there because we're going to be
changing the inner HTML of this
to display what we stored but by default
before they even use this application
before they even store any data they're
going to see nothing yet Hoss because
you know might as well test out I don't
know what we're doing I just felt like
typing something to be honest but
they're you so what I'm going to be
doing is building a form with three form
elements in it text area two text areas
actually one's going to store the key
the other one's going to store the value
and the third one is just going to be a
button where you can press it and
actually save your information so let me
go ahead and make three paragraphs and
copy this crap right here all right now
the first one like I said is going to be
the key now I want to mention this
whenever we are storing information that
the user enters it's basically like
storing a variable you have your
variable name in the variable value so
you the name could be like age and the
value could be 15 the name could be
username in the value could be the New
Boston so what they do is they call
these variables keys and they call the
values I don't know if you could guess
this one value but let me just go ahead
and I'm just going to write one like
that and two because I'm gonna show you
guys what I'm doing in a second and it's
going to make sense so for the first one
what I'm going to be doing is I'm going
to be putting a simple input and this is
just going to be a type of and someone
is sexton area that's great a type of
text in the ID for it is just going to
be one and I named it ID one because
it's the very first text box and you
know I figured it hey why not give it
the idea of one so for number two what
I'm going to be doing is I'm actually
making this a text area and you end
those with text area it's not a single
tag it's a double tag and I'm going to
be giving this the ID of two in that is
just because whenever I don't want to
give it the idea of key in value because
whenever we're working in our JavaScript
functions there's actually a
method called value or property called
value so I don't want to confuse the two
so anyways just go ahead and name this
first textbox give it an ID of one and
give this second textarea you can make a
textbox if you want but I'm going to
give this an ID of two you can give them
names if you want but names aren't
really going to matter for this tutorial
so the last thing we want to build is a
button so input type equals button and
for the ID just give it the ID of button
and give it a value of safe now the
value is what text you want to appear on
the button so I just want my button to
say safe just like that
so as you notice and I probably should
have done this I don't know I do it this
way but I always build what's inside the
form before I actually build the form
itself so that might have confused the
guy so let me just go ahead and build
that form form and go ahead and copy
this Rutley and paste it right there and
ending form so as you can see we have
two boxes on the screen right now a left
box which pretty much has a form with
three elements in it the first one is
just pretty much an area to enter text
the second one is the area to enter text
and the third one is a button to save it
basically we're going to be making a
variable with the name of this giving it
a value of this and whenever we have
everything set we can save that variable
by clicking this button right here so
let me go ahead and save this and run
and launch in Chrome and show you guys
what we got we pretty much got a
variable name which can be like person a
value which can be Bucky and whenever we
save it it's going to display in our
other box but as you notice a couple
things first of all this is probably the
ugliest looking website I've ever made
in my entire life so what we need to do
in the next tutorial is style this you
know we don't need to make it look great
but make it look at least a little
better than this piece of crap and also
add some functionality to this baby so
you know I don't have to sit here click
and save all day and nothing happens so
that's what we're going to be doing in
the upcoming tutorials and yeah I can
tell that you guys are excited already
so
anyways there you have it thank you guys
for watching and we're just subscribed
and I'll see you guys in the next lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
