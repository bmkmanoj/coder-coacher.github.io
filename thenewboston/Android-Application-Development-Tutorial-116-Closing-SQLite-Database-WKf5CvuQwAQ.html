Android tutorial for the new Boston and
you know our SQL Lite database projects
coming along quite nicely we're just
going to add another method to it
because in the last tutorial we allowed
our database to be open and able to
write to it so we also want to be able
to close our database because we don't
want to remain open for the most part so
we're just gonna create another method
called public and it's gonna be void and
we're just gonna call this closed pretty
simple a little method here all we're
gonna do is we're going to refer to our
database helper and close that so we're
just gonna say art helper dot close and
that's gonna close again our basically
our class right here our database helper
or SQL Lite open helper is what it's
actually closing so that's pretty simple
now let's see what we want our
application to do so we're gonna switch
over to our SQL Lite example class and
again you guys hopefully set up all this
stuff already basically referring back
to our SQLite example XML and just all
the references and all that good stuff
so basically what we're gonna have is
the person is going to enter some
information for the edit text and then
hit the Update button and within the sup
date button what we're going to do is
we're going to just set up two strings
so string name equals basically our SQL
name which is our edit text get text and
to string
so nothing new there and we're also
going to set up you know the
attractiveness or the hotness so we're
just going to say hotness here and refer
to our other edit text which is our edit
text hotness
and now what we can do is we can refer
to our hot-or-not class or we're going
to set up a variable from a hot or not
class and we're doing is just gonna call
this entry and again we're just gonna
say new hot or not and we're gonna pass
in the context of this this class or you
can even say SQL light example dot this
so now what we can do is we can just
open basically our entry because we just
set up that open method and there we go
and we can also close that entry and now
what we want to do is we want to be able
to write some information to our
database which is what we're gonna work
on in the next tutorial or two but again
what we're gonna actually do is we want
to pass in both strings so we can
actually set up her method right now we
can just make it up so we're gonna say
entry and then we're gonna say we're
gonna say create entry something like
that and you know it's gonna give us an
error because we haven't set up this
method but what we want to add to this
method we want to parameters because we
want the information from this class so
we're gonna pass in both string names
we're gonna give the first parameter the
name and the second parameter the
hotness so again we're passing in two
strings so we want to make sure this
method has access to both of those
strings that are being passed in so now
what we can do is we can hover over and
we just say create method entry string
string in the type hot-or-not so we're
just going to click that and as you can
see it creates this entry or this uh
this method here called create entry
which we're actually going to program in
the next tutorial but quickly let's just
talk about everything that's happening
so you guys kind of understand more of
what's going on when we hit our update
button it's gonna basically get the text
from both of our edit texts set it up to
a string variable then we're gonna
create a new instance of our hot-or-not
class
which we pass in the context of this so
what's gonna happen is it's gonna shoot
over to our hot-or-not class it's going
to look for that constructor here and
it's gonna see that we're passing a
context we're gonna set it up basically
the context that's being passed into a
private variable that is only available
in this class then what's gonna happen
is we call that open method which is you
know gonna basically set up our helper
and we're gonna create a new helper with
the context again that's being passed
into this class we're gonna pass in that
context for a new helper object and so
that's going to be passed up here or
again we just set up our from our
database name the version all that stuff
and basically set up our database if it
hasn't been created yet or if it has
been created it's going to drop it and
you know recreate it or upgrade it and
then what we do is we have this method
called create entry within our other
class that we call where we're actually
going to write to our database and then
we just close our database or close our
helper variable that we created again
here within our open method so hopefully
you guys kind of understand what's going
on now and again in the next tutorial
we're gonna actually write to our
database so have a good one guys
and I'll see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
