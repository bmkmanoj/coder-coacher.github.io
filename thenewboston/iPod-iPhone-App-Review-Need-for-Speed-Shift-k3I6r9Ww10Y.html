another app review and today I'm gonna
be going over a little app called Need
for Speed shift so let me turn this down
a little bit and there it is right there
now a need for speed shift is an awesome
game especially for my phone and iPod
Touch whatever you have for just being a
game for one of these it's so advanced
and it's pretty much like a real console
game like Xbox or Playstation
so all this says if you want to race
don't do it for real just do it on video
games so let me go ahead and here's how
it starts out I already have my profile
set up and you're looking at it let me
go ahead and erase real quick just to
show you guys a quick taste of what it's
like um I'll do one in my courier and
these are a different location in
Chicago this is a London something go to
London and do like this first one I see
um they have different types of races
and let me show you guys they just give
you tips before but they have different
types of races so it isn't always like
NASCAR style race with a bit like
eliminator races where you have to stay
in first and they have like drift races
where you have to drift but here is
Eliminator race I think and I'll show
you guys what what the default do in
order to accelerate again it accelerates
foria and why was it stopping because I
was touching my fingers on screen and in
order in order to steer all you have to
do is tote it like this then you want to
stay you try try to stay on a dream
right there and again if you want to
drew it I can't do it right now because
I'm not going around the bend but you
just told it or twitch it like this I
mean and you're beginning to drift and
again like I said any time you want to
break just touch anywhere on the screen
like this and it would break free so
breaking you have to do yourself but
accelerating is automatic and since I
just break for no reason that's why I'm
doing a really terrible right now but oh
and the last thing after you've seen me
erase for a little bit any time you want
to pause it just go ahead put two
fingers on the screen and swipe down
just like this and this is gonna pause
your game for it so I'm gonna go back to
home right now and I'll show you guys
another cool stuff our sugar one our
turn just click yes and so gives us that
little message right there so aside from
just doing a bunch of races you get to
do some other cool stuff with your car
too - first of all if you go to my
career you see that I don't have
everything unlocked only have two areas
unlock that's cuz you need to get
something about stars the unlock more
errors and you get stars by of course
doing more races so you see to unlock
this area right here
I need 45 stars in that 44 so I'm gonna
probably erase when I'm done with this
but anyways um just like the regular
games you can also do stuff like unlock
cars and also upgrade the car you have
so go ahead and click cars right here
and you see that these are let's see
these are the cars that you can buy and
I don't have enough money well those are
my cars actually here the cars that you
can buy um I can buy that one that one
and they give you a whole bunch of
different options you know of course
some of these are locked up and they
unlock the more races you and stuff like
that and aside from just buying new cars
that enhance your driving ability you
can also upgrade the car you have and
this is upgrade performance or up look
great looks I'm gonna upgrade
performance and say this is acceleration
brake tires Nitro say you wanted to add
nitro just go
had impress check button metro stage
three and I'm sure you want to make this
purchase yes and now I have third grade
third stage nitro which is pretty much
well you'll see you later
and that's another thing I forgot to
mention electrodes in the bottom right
of our screen and whenever you want to
use it just go ahead and press that
button and it uses a nitro so this is a
pretty sweet game again I've been
playing it for a while and have no
complaints for it so far so that's why
I'm gonna write this game my first ever
whoa I should I had won another one but
this game is definitely a 10 out of 10
because it's awesome you can keep doing
it for you know as long as you want and
it will take forever to beat if you
actually did ever beat it so it's only
$6.99 again like I said an awesome
amazing game so I would highly recommend
getting it and I'm gonna reg this noob
right here and hopefully I pull them and
this is another type of race where you
race the same exact specs as your car
