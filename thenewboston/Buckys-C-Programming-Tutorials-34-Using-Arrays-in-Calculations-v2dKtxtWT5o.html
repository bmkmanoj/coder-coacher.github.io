tutorial and in this lesson I'm going to
teach you guys how to use an array in
calculations and it's actually a pretty
simple program definitely useful
definitely something you want to stay
tuned for so let's go ahead and make an
array right now let's call it tuna I'm
getting tired of using Bucky every time
and let's set the tuna array big enough
to hold five integer values looks good
enough and now let's go ahead and use an
array initializer list um let's go ahead
and throw in 2050 476 832 and whatever
this number is right there so now we
created an array called tuna and it has
five different elements or five
different values in it so now what we
want to do is say our boss came to us
are a teacher and he's like build a
program that calculates the sum of all
of these elements so we're saying all
right the first thing we need is a
variable to hold that sum and by default
since it doesn't have any elements at
first we're going to set it equal to
zero so what we could do is this sum
equals looks I try to type Bucky again
tuna zero plus tuna oh you know what I'm
getting a bunch of typos and this is
just taken too long not very efficient
way of doing it although it would work
so let me go ahead and show you guys a
much easier way to use an array in
calculation so instead of all that
typing let's go ahead and make a for
loop instead so now what we need to do
is just like before
find out which array index is our array
is going to need and just use our for
loop to loop through those array indexes
so of course as always we need to start
at zero because the first index in every
array is zero alright now let's do a
little bit of thinking but not too much
tuna holds five values so that means the
last index in that array is four so if
you're right X is less than 5 what it's
going to do is
going to go from zero to four it's not
going to do five because five is not
less than five so now when you press X
plus plus we now have a four loop that
loops from zero to four so it's going to
go zero one two three four those are
going to be your X values so what we can
do now is just use some plus equals tuna
X now what this is going to do is this
the first thing it's going to do the
very first time it runs the loop is
going to say this all right X is equal
to zero so add tuna zero which is 22 the
sum now the sum is going to be equal to
20 the next time it's going to be one so
add tuna one which is 50 for equal to
the sum which is 20 so now it's going to
be 74 so it's going to go through each
of these elements one by one and add
each value to the value of sum so let's
go ahead and just print out this on the
screen um see out some end line and now
you can see a better idea of what's
going on so like I said one by one the
very first time it runs it's going to
add tuna zero equal to sum the next time
tuna one equal to some tuna - two -
three - four so if you add up all these
values right here you get the value of
1528 so one last time what we did is
this we created an array called tuna
using an array initializer list that
holds five integers 1 2 3 4 5 now what
we wanted to do is we wanted to
calculate the sum so we made a variable
called sum and of course by default
since it didn't have any value we set
equal to 0 then we made a for loop using
the value in here excuse me the variable
to loop through each index of our array
so it started at 0
and since we know this one was two and a
four that's what we put for here X is
less than five and of course we want to
go one at a time we don't want to skip
you know this one in this one or
anything so then what we did is we loop
through each value and added it to the
variable sum and then we just printed
out some on the screen and that's what
we got 20 74 115 9 82
15 28 so that's a real simple program in
order to use arrays and the array
indexes and elements and values and
calculations yadda yadda yadda all that
fun stuff so now you guys know how to
use arrays in calculations you're ready
to move on to my next tutorial we're
going to be talking I'm going to teach
you guys something else about an array
that's actually pretty cool so don't
forget to watch that tutorial thank you
