done for now what we need to do now is
we need to make that new scene pretty
much that the game is going to be
happening again this is going to be real
simple it's only going to have one level
and it's just going to be that dude
shooting balls whatever but let's go
ahead and make that level right now so
again making a new level or new scene is
a two-part process we first need the
interface and then we need the brains or
we can do it in the opposite way it
doesn't really matter what order you
created it but if you go to file new
file let's uh let's make the brains
first who cares alright so file a new
file and make sure you're an iOS source
and what we want to select is cocoa
touch class and click Next now for the
class is just what do I want to name my
C and I'll just name it like shooter
scene and it is a subclass of SK scene
this is a sprite cutscene that we're
working with Swift looks good and right
there it looks good as well
great alright so first let me get rid of
all this and it's giving me an error
right here because it's saying alright
you need to import sprite kit so there
you go alright so that takes care of the
error and right now these are brains to
something it doesn't have a user
interface to go with it so let's go
ahead and make that spray kit scene
right now so in order to do this if you
go to file new file what we can do is
click I Oh s resource now from here we
can choose sprite kit scene and click
Next and we actually want to save this
as shooter scene now you're like alright
well you actually named that other file
shooter scene but that's actually what
you want to do so if you notice the name
of the brains and the name of the scene
of the same exact name and that's just
because I don't know it makes sense
you're like alright so where's the
brains of
this oh it's the one with the same name
but with a swift extension instead of
SKS so oh it on a second I just sprayed
Cologne and now it's a like getting all
in my nose alright so right now here is
our scene again this is the main level
that we're going to be playing
eventually it's going to be full of a
bunch of things dropping from the sky
and dudes shooting things right now it's
blank but if we run the game we have a
little problem we have this new scene
but we have no way to get there I mean
it says tap to play but I'm tapping and
I let me play so let's fix that problem
right now so if you hop over to the
brains in game scene dot Swift so
insight touches began which again is
going to be called any time the user
taps the screen the first thing we want
to do is get a reference to that label
and we can just call child no to the
name intro label so now this constant is
a reference to that label that said tap
to begin so the first thing I actually
want to do is just make sure that it is
not equal to empty pretty much verifies
that it did have time to load and then
we can start with the transitioning of
going to the next scene so essentially
all we want this to do whenever the user
taps the screen is take us to this game
scene now right now it's empty but
eventually we're going to be you know
setting everything up on there so how do
we do that well we can just write like
one or two lines of code to take us
there but I'm going to show you guys how
to add transitions because I know they
just make your game a little bit better
so I'll just make a simple one that will
fade out and if you call SK action
fade out with duration how long do you
want this fade-out to last well how
about one second so again this is an
action now remember only nodes only
objects can call actions your dude runs
your do toots the enemy attacks
well this label is going to call this
action so intro label run action now the
action of course we just made is called
fade-out now there's an optional
parameter called completion and inside
here you can write what code you want to
happen whenever this action is completed
so the label is going to fade out and
then what well essentially we just want
to go to the next scene but let me show
you guys this first there is actually um
this transition called doors and it's
hard it's going to be easier if you just
see it but it's essentially just like a
box opening up and it looks like you're
walking through a set of doors and I
think it's a really cool way to go to
the next scene so you can call it
anything you want just going to call it
doors set equal to SK transition doors
there's actually a bunch of different
stores with duration doorway with
duration so how long do you want this
less actually let me put it for like a
1.5 I know the frame rate on my screen
recorder is kind of weird so I'll try to
slow everything down let me put this to
1.5 as well again you might want to put
a little faster whenever you're actually
making a game but I just want to make
sure that you guys can see it on YouTube
alright so now we have all these
transitions but we don't even have a
reference to the other screen yet so
again this other screen is called
shooter scene so let's get a reference
to that because then when you say hey we
want to go to a new level it's going
back all right well we're alright so let
show your scene
equals
shir scene file name shooter scene and
they always add that extra stupid
alright there we go so now shooter scene
is a reference to that new level so this
is again how you get a reference to it
so now we have in memory we actually
have to say go there so in order to that
one last line of code self dot view
present scene now what scene that we
want to present well we want to present
shooter scene right there and an
optional parameter is how do you want to
get there well how about this transition
doors so it um I know it's it's better
than just popping up in my opinion so
this is how you set up a course
transition this is how you get a
reference to another scene or level and
this is how you actually make it take
you there so now if you run this check
out what happens whenever we tap the
screen it's going to call touches began
and then this is going to fade out for
one second and actually let me run that
again I'll explain you guys what's going
on so again watch what happens this
label right here is going to fade out
and it's going to take a second and a
half now once it's done fading out
what's going to happen is it's going to
open those doors which is going to take
another second and a half and present to
you that new level so let me click fade
out for a second and a half open the
doors and it pops up the gray level the
gray boring level but that is pretty
much how you create new levels and
transition between them so now if we
wanted to we can add the same
functionality to go back but obviously
we actually want to start building a
game so that's what we're going to do in
the next video so I'll see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
