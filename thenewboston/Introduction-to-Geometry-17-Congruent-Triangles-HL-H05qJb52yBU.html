last way to prove that you have
congruent triangles
it's called H L okay so HL or hypotenuse
leg is a way to prove that right
triangles are congruent
because only right triangles have a
hypotenuse so the hypotenuse and the leg
of one triangle are congruent to the
corresponding parts of another triangle
so like we said this is going to be a
right triangle because the hypotenuse is
the side opposite the right angle of a
triangle and only right triangles have
right angles so we know that the
hypotenuse of this triangle is congruent
to the hypotenuse of this triangle I
know that this leg is congruent of this
leg of this triangle and a leg is just
any side of the triangle of the right
triangle that is not its hypotenuse and
we know that these are both right angles
because they're right triangles so
therefore I can say that triangle a is
congruent to triangle B by HL except we
want to say that it's a right triangle
because HL only works for right
triangles because if you think about it
right angles are always congruent to one
another because right angles measure
always is 90 degrees so you have a side
an angle on the side so now that we know
that we're gonna do some examples so for
the first one I have these two triangles
I know that this lake is congruent to
this leg of this triangle since they
share their hypotenuse that is congruent
to itself and we know that these two are
right angles so we can say therefore
triangle a is congruent to triangle B by
H L so we have these two triangles down
here we know they're right triangles
their hypotenuse is are congruent and
they share this leg right here
so therefore this will be triangle one
and so we triangle to triangle one is
congruent to triangle two by a gel and
for this last example we know we have
these two triangles right here they have
we know they're right triangles and they
share this leg but to prove they're
congruent by H L we need a hypotenuse
and a congruent leg but we don't know
that these hypotenuse is are congruent
so therefore
we cannot prove triangles congruent
because we don't have enough information
so we just learned all five ways to
prove that triangles are congruent now
in our next lesson we're gonna talk
about special properties of isosceles
triangles</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
