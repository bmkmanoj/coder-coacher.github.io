here I want to get down tune off to some
flatter grounds because it's getting
pretty late and it's also really windy
up here and even though it looks cool
like I said it's pretty disappointing
because as you can see absolutely
nothing in any direction and I
definitely don't want to fall off the
cliff
I'll show you guys will cliff I'm on her
right now I'm not getting that's the
wind all right I'll attach my camera to
the tripod right now and I'll hang it
over a cliff and show you guys how steep
it is I don't even know if you guys will
be able to realize how high I am at
least 150 feet in the air
so now I'm a cliff number two I wanted
to see if I could see any better from
over here but show you guys what I found
I got to be very careful not to follow
up here this is incredibly steep that's
pretty much a straight drop if you can't
tell all the way around I don't want to
get too close to the edge but all the
way around sheer drop-off for at least a
hundred feet but anyways that's where I
was over here I was on this cliff
earlier and I was sitting right
I was basically sitting right there when
I was making my videos and now I'm way
over here on another massive cliff and
again no surprise much more of nothing
it's pretty much a common sight now it
doesn't even surprise me anymore but I
really can't get a good view for any
other angle so uh wow that's really high
I just noticed that I'm gonna back up
here because it's starting to get windy
and I really can't like stay on this
cliff for tonight first of all I'm
scared to death right now that I'm gonna
fall and second I want to see if I can
find something a little more well better
to sleep tonight then a cliff that's
about 200 feet in the air so I'll let
you guys know whenever I find something
well it's the end of day five about an
hour left the Sun before it sets it's
getting pretty dark in the woods as you
guys can see but anyways I climbed down
from the cliff and I fell and as you can
see
see that rookie conference idea
right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
