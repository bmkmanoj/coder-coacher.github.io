tutorial one thing that I left off in
the last tutorial make sure that inside
the wrapper CSS rule you go inside and
you also change the float to left as you
can see when you do that you get this
black background and you will be able to
it would be able to apply that
background to the whole day ever ever
all right so now we are going to add
some padding to separate these a little
bit so let's go over here to our CSS
rules and let's double click on wrapper
let's go to block actually move down to
a box and let's give let's give a 10
pixel padding for that and as you can
see it it added padding around the
outside now let's add some padding to
our other diffs specifically our maint
if we're going to want to separate the
left from the main from the right so in
order to do that visually we're going to
go inside of box again and do the same
thing we did for ravage give it some
some padding there I'll actually give
some margin that way it'll it'll move it
over sorry about that there we go we can
also actually we can also leave that
padding to space it out a little bit
inside there
and you can see that the main div is a
little bit lower than the other and that
is because we gave it margin all the way
around and what we really want to do is
we just want to give it some margin on
to the left and on the right so change
the bottom 20 instead of 10 and the same
plot there we go moved it up a little
bit now we can see that our our right
div does not extend all the way over to
the end so let's go in here inside of
right and let's change that with a
little bit let's say 160 there we go
actually let's changed it 17 these kind
of all it's got room for 10 more pixels
in there there we go now you can see
that that looks much better we've added
some padding and margin in our main
which is separated from the right and
from the left and the next tutorial we
will show you how to make a header and
footer that will start to make our a
little sample sample page here look much
much better so make sure you continue to
watch and subscribe if you haven't
already it's</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
