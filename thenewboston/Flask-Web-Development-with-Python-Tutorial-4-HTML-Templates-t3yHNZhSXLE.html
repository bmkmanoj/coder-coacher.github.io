video I'm going to talk to you about
templates and static files so basically
whenever you make an actual website not
just these little demos we've been
learning so far but an actual website
you're going to have more files than
this one Python file I mean you're going
to have images you're going to have CSS
JavaScript you're going to have you know
HTML all of this stuff now the way that
you actually organize this in your
project is already kind of predetermined
by flask so first of all I want to take
you guys back to a few tutorials ago
where I said that whatever return value
of your function is basically your
server responds remember that and then I
said since that is the case what you can
do is pretty much type HTML in here so
you can throw heading two you can I
don't know like make your text blue
whatever you want to do and then I
refresh it and I was like look at that
HTML in your functions return well to be
honest you usually never want to put
HTML in here I mean I was just trying to
demonstrate that point but the rule
whenever you're using flask is never put
HTML directly inside your return method
in the sense that you can actually see
the tags so we obviously need to have
HTML for our website so it doesn't just
look like Craigslist so how do we do
that
well what we're going to do is we're
going to make these things called
templates now a template is pretty much
just a basic structure or layout with
HTML in it so I'll show you guys a real
quick example and it's going to make a
lot more sense so you see right here
this is just my website the profile page
that's everyone's profile page is pretty
much the same I mean you have your
profile image right here your little
About section and this is my profile so
just as my profile but if we were to go
to someone else's it would say their
actual name so again profile picture
same things on the left and their name
on the right well instead of writing the
HTML for
every single person since it's so
similar what we do is we make a template
a template that says okay this is the
structure of it and then whenever you go
to someone's profile just stick their
profile photo right here and put all the
information you need but the HTML the
layout it never really changes so that's
what we're going to be doing and that's
oh I'm going to be showing you guys
right now so the first thing we're
actually going to do is we're going to
import render template and that just
means that we can actually use these
templates or layouts now we're going to
make two directories and remember my
main file right here so I'm going to go
new directory and what wouldn't do let
me just go templates first I'll make
them both at once
one for templates and another one called
static now your templates inside here
that's going to be basically just think
of it as your HTML files for now so HTML
files that we can plug that into now
static these are for static um files
that never change like CSS of course
that's just going to be the same until
you know you update it to a new theme
but generally your CSS file is never
going to change so all of your static
non-changing files so we'll get to
making those in just a second but for
right now let me actually show you guys
and we'll switches from the index to
like we'll make the profile so what
we're going to do in this example is
we're going to make a fake profile page
and we're going to pass in a user name
so the layout for everyone's profile is
going to be the same but it's going to
be a little bit different the content
depending on their name so now let me
just write profile and remember you pass
a name right here and instead of just a
straight-up bit of text that we're going
to return for the server response we
actually want to return render template
all right looking cool so what we're
going to do here is we're going to go
profile HTML and we're going to make
this in just a second and this is going
to be
template or HTML file now what does our
layout need in order to know what
information to display well it just
needs the name variable and we can throw
another ones but I just want to keep it
real simple for right now so now what we
have to do is we need to make this file
inside our templates directory and
that's why I said you need to have two
directories named static and templates
you just can't name them anything you
want because by default
flash is expecting all of your templates
to go in a directory called templates so
a new HTML file called profile and we
can delete all this should keep this
doctype at the top and there you go
not wow I don't even want to say that
doc alright so what happens right here
before we start coding anything else is
it says ok whenever the user requests
this URL profile with someone's name
after it like profile Bucky profile
Emily then what I'm going to do is I'm
going to look in my directory templates
for a file called profile to HTML right
there now I'm also going to give it a
name variable and I'll show you guys how
to use variables in your templates might
as well do it right now so just code any
old regular HTML in here just like it
was you know not even part of flask so
title um alright title and I'll say
welcome to the new Boston
alright so like I said just regular HTML
and now let me just write a heading 1 in
here heading 1 and I will say hey are
let's say um yeah let's say hey there
are Bucky or hey there Emily whatever so
anytime you want to use a variable and
remember our variable is called name
which is going to be equal to some
user's name what you do is you put it in
between two curly braces so curly brace
curly brace and in curly brace and in
curly brace
now remember you actually write the
variables name which is name right there
so this gets passed through to your
template and eventually this is going to
say hey there Bucky hey there Sally
whatever so if we run this right now
check it out what it was profile
all right so profile slash Bucky it says
hey there Bucky profile slash tuna face
hey there tuna face so again one last
time what we're doing instead of writing
HTML directly in here
what flask is doing is its generating
the HTML for us how does it do that well
it uses this template and it throws in
these variables it generates a bunch of
HTML using this template and then it
returns it as a server response</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
