and welcome to your very first tutorial
in nmap now nmap is a tool that you can
use to scan a network or advice and if
you guys are like ah one the heck would
I ever want to do that
this tool sounds a useless well I'll
give you guys a quick set of examples so
let's say that you just set up your
Wi-Fi for your house and you have a
feeling that your annoying neighbor
keeps connecting and using all your data
well what you could actually do is you
can use this tool to scan your entire
home network and it can show you every
device that's connected and give you a
little information about it as well so
like I said it can scan an entire home
network in that example and what you can
also do and people use it for this more
often is to scan servers or routers or
actual devices so if you guys are really
why would I want to scan a server well
whenever you let's say have a website
set up you can scan your server and
it'll tell you all of the ports that are
open all the services that are running
and that way once you see what's open
and available um like maybe you have FTP
available or MySQL database running on
it and you don't want to have it running
because it's a vulnerability well can
pretty much show you that it's open and
you can analyze your server security a
little bit better so it's a lot more
interesting if we just kind of hopping
hop into it and you know look at some
examples so that's what we're going to
be doing but first you know you guys
probably need to know how to install it
so if you're on a Debian or in boot to
Linux system then what you can do is you
can use sudo apt - get install nmap now
I'm on Kali right now that's what
distribution so I already have it
installed and by the way you should
probably mention this before you watch
these tutorials you should have a basic
understanding of both Linux and you know
some basic networking so if you don't
hop over and watch my Linux and
networking sorro's and then back in here
and you're going to be good to go now
like I said you can also install it on
Mac in Windows but I'm kind of anti
Windows since Windows 10 came out so I'm
going to stick with a
Linux in this tutorial series I
recommend that you do too so anyways
let's go ahead and get started in by the
way I know I give you guys like a
million disclaimers before I even start
you just can't use this tool on any
server so you just can't find some
website online you're like oh I wonder
if you know I wonder what services are
running on my bank's server that's
actually illegal you need to have access
or permission to scan your own network
or a website that you own or have
written access to so again just don't
scan any website on the internet it's
illegal so in these tutorials I'll just
be scanning my own website in my own
network but let's say you get hired for
a job make sure that you have written
permission and boom roasted you'll be
good so easy peasy let's just go ahead
and scan my server so let me delete that
and if you just write and map the new
Boston comm what this is going to do is
it's going to go hit up the DNS server
and it's going to translate this into
the IP address for us so just enter and
there you go so this is the easiest way
to scan a single website target and
what's going on behind the scenes is
it's actually sending the new Boston
comm my website server packets and it's
going to look at those responses and
analyze them and this is what it came
back with so in my server right now on
my website I have three ports open 20 to
80 and 43 so those are all open and this
right here under the service column this
pretty much tells you the services that
are commonly associated with the port's
now if you guys know a little bit about
networking you know that you can
actually change these but it says ok
port 22 is open that usually means that
they have SSH available and these of
course are just regular you know HTTP
protocols HTTP secure and of course I
have these open because I'm hosting a
website on it but there you go and also
gives you the IP address which is really
cool and if I copy that I'll show you
guys something else so you can just use
the domain name the new Boston comm and
you can also do the exact same thing
with the IP address it doesn't matter
there you go you get the exact same
results either way so before we continue
I actually want to talk to you about
these different states so right now all
of these just say open but they're not
always going to say open you're going to
see key words like closed filtered
unfiltered so I'll explain what those
mean right now whenever you see that a
port is open it means that it's active
and it's open to connections so easy
enough what about closed
what about whenever we see that well
closed means that you know how I said
that what we're doing is we're sending
it a probe or packet and analyzing the
response well whenever it says closed it
responds to that probe but most likely
it doesn't have any services running so
that's what closed means that it's
responding but no services are running
filtered whenever you see that keyword
it usually means that this port is
protected by a firewall and unfiltered
you really don't see this too often but
you may it means that nmap can't
determine whether it's open or closed so
if you guys are like why can't it
determine well this tool it isn't like
going to some API me hey give me all
your information and you know there's no
like built-in wait for the server just
back ok here all the ports I have open
so it has to kind of like get around it
and that's you know kind of the cool
thing about this tool it crafts every
single packet for every single port in a
unique way and it analyzes the responses
one by one and of course every server is
set up a little bit differently so if it
ever gets confused then there you go so
let me clear out of here and well I
guess that's all you guys get for this
tutorial I will see you guys in the next
