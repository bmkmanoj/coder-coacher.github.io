tutorial and this one is probably going
to be a real quick video because I just
want to show you guys one other tip that
you can do whenever you're working with
constraints and that is pinning in other
words if you ever want more control over
exactly where you want an item to appear
or how you want to position then you're
going to need to do this but first let's
go ahead and look at our example so
alright in the first tutorial what we
did is we took care of that top right
button looking good but if we ever take
this and we rotate it right you know up
that bottom right button even though it
appears on our design it's not appearing
here and another thing this is just a
little side note if you hold down
command and you press left and right on
your keyboard then this is just a nice
little keyboard shortcut to rotate the
simulator back and forth so again no
matter what way you rotate it that
bottom right button isn't appearing
where we want it to it's like off here
somewhere and that's because we didn't
add any constraints to it yet so for
this button select it and I'm going to
show you guys a new cool way to use the
pin icon or the pin tool and yeah you
guys cannot see that so let me hopefully
this all appears alright hopefully you
guys can see this alright so anyways let
me get this out of the way now make sure
that you have like I said your bottom
right button selected and choose this
little icon right here I don't even know
what it looks like like a square with a
line behind it and two parallel lines so
anyways click this and this says add new
constraints these are just some settings
for um your constraints in other words
your positioning settings so what are we
looking at right here what's all this
mean this middle white square it
resembles the button so to the left
right up and down this is the
positioning of how you want it to appear
relative to your screen now right now it
doesn't have any constraints and that's
why I all
these orange lines are dotted if we ever
want to lock into a constraint then we
can just click those lines and you see
how they appear solid well that means
give this a fixed position so if we just
left it like this which we can do for
now
this is going to appear zero distance or
zero spacing from the right and 20 from
the bottom so again we have a little bit
more spacing on the bottom than the
right but whatever it'll work so again
lock it to the right and lock it to the
bottom corner of the view which is
pretty much your screen and I don't know
if you guys can see this but at the very
bottom it says add new add two
constraints so we can just click that
and check it out now I can expand this
and whenever we click it we have those
blue guidelines and also if we looked in
this we can see that we have two new
constraints two new rules and of course
two of those are for this item in two of
them or for this item right there so now
if we go ahead and run this bad boy
again check this out
our bottom right button is now locked
into the bottom right corner no matter
what device we have and also if we
rotate it then there we go as well and
if you would ever want to change the
positioning of it if you're at home you
know what I kind of want to move this to
the left a little bit and maybe down I
don't know then you can change like the
value to ten on the right and like ten
on bottom but the default values are
good for now so that is how you manually
position elements using constraints and
also how you can drag the set up general
constraints and there are some other
things that you can do as well again all
of these have to deal with how items are
positioned on your screen but I'm going
to talk to you guys in detail about
those later on so in the next example
what I'm going to do instead of just you
know showing you guys a bunch of weird
demos because look at this you would
never make like you never make an iPad
app that
look like this layout it is disgusting
it is ugly they're just random buttons
everywhere so in the next example I'm
going to be showing you guys how to do a
bunch of cool stuff like add background
images and we'll talk about some people
were texting me and I'm rambling so
anyways cool tutorial coming up next
I'll see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
