welcome to your seventh java game
program tutorial and in this story we're
going to be going over how to load some
awesome graphics on our screen and my
graphics actually aren't that awesome
because I made them about 5 seconds but
well you'll see actually let me show you
my graphics right now let's go to my
computer I put them in the C Drive and
folder called test and here is my
background right here as I told you it
not that exciting
and here's the image I'm going to be
putting on my background it's a ping the
face ping and there's my face so like I
said not that great but hey there image
and by the way my background is 800 by
600 jpg in my face is like 100 by 100
ping so if you want to make sweet
graphics like that then go into
Photoshop and make some but that's what
we're going to be learning this tutorial
but let's go ahead and as you see our
main class before which contain the main
method before is named Bucky let's go
ahead and copy all this and I made a new
class called images now you don't need
to do this but in case I really miss
anything up then I'll still have that
Bucky class to work with but I'm going
to go ahead and copy everything in
images of course we're gonna change the
class name to images and let's set this
to images I equals new images just like
that and just put i dot run and now we
transferred everything over to our
images class now we need to import one
thing to work with images or graphics
and that's this import Java X dot swing
dot image icon just like that
actually just like that that's a little
bit better and now what we can do is we
can load images like I just showed you
we can load those images and use them in
Java so let's go ahead and get right
down to it um the first thing we need to
do is some housekeeping things so right
under your main method right here again
this is where your run method starts run
method right there and this is where
your main method ends see this let's go
ahead and make some variables
let's go ahead and make private screen
because remember this is our screen kind
of manager right here and we'll make a
variable called s now if we go ahead and
take this out right here because we
don't need to put screen s twice and now
so that should be on line 21 or
somewhere around there and that's just a
we can't before that screen s object was
in this run method and we want to take
it out of the run method and declare it
up here and that's just because if we
want to use it in every any other
methods then if we put it outside the
methods then every other method has
access to it so go ahead and put your
screen object right there and let's go
ahead and make two more private images
variables so private image will put BG
for background and that's going to be a
gradient I showed you the first time and
let's go ahead and put private image
pick in that pick is going to be that
little face I made that's ping a little
hundred by 100 and what we're going to
be doing is testing if these images are
loaded or not if the images are loaded
then we want to paint them but if
they're not then we don't want to worry
about it
so we're going to make a boo lean boo
lean in loaded and what we're going to
do is set this to false to begin with
because it's not loaded and once they're
loaded we're going to be changing this
to true right here so let's go ahead and
um in your run method right here the
method that you had before the first
thing we probably want to do is set that
loaded loaded equals false
so now boolean loaded it initially
starts out as false because remember
nothing's loaded yet and again we
already have that right there
and now in our try block in our run
method again this is all from our code
before went out right after you set the
full screen we want to call a method
called load picks and everything all
right word heck this method come from
and what does it do well actually we
made this method call because we're
going to be creating this method right
now and what this method is going to do
is load all the pictures and look at
same great
method load picks all right you talked
me into I will sew in here create a
little loads pictures make sure you
spell it wrong and there we go now we
can actually that's kind of annoying me
change two pastors or change two posters
huh I'll change it to pastors there we
go right there and let's go ahead and
create this method before I let me make
sure you got everything first all right
now let's go ahead and put public void
load pics and this method is going to
load our pictures and it's not going to
take any parameters and here's how you
load pictures from your computer to use
in Java take that variable name remember
we made to image variables one called BG
and one called pick set BG equal to new
image icon with image icon and caps and
as your first parameter for this type
the location of your image and remember
this is a string in mind C colon
backslash backslash and they have to be
two backslashes because remember the
backslash like back end back T is an
escape character so whenever you put two
it actually views it as one so you know
you should know that for my last orals
test and my image name is back dot jpg
right there so here's the location of
our first image and in essence what I'm
saying any time you need backslash put
two so it escapes it and only sees it as
one and now once you get your image
location all you need to put is dot get
image and it gets the image its built-in
method we don't need to worry about that
and if you got no errors then you're
good to go
so now we have our background image
loaded into the variable BG so anytime
we do anything with BG it's this image
since I mean come on do you really want
to type that every single time you use
the background image
I don't so next let's go ahead and what
I need my other variable pick right
there
so set pick and we'll set this equal to
new image icon test and this is actually
face that ping that's what I named mine
yours might be a little different in
yours might be in another folder
so I recommend you putting it in same
location as I do but if you don't want
to don't do it and now look at this we
have our background loaded and we have
our pic loaded so what can we do now
well we can change that loaded boob
leaned to true right there
sorry swine flu and now Java knows that
our pics are loaded so now we're going
to go ahead and repaint the screen and
what repaint does this is again another
built-in method it means all right you
already called your paint method
whenever you made your J frame initially
automatically so now what we want to do
is call this again any time it says
repaint it means call this paint method
again so now what we got to do is paint
the images on the screen so after this
if block actually get rid of this entire
string we don't need that anymore go
ahead and put if loaded so this is only
going to happen if the pics are loaded
aka if we call this method what do we
want to do well in order to draw the
images on screen you need your drawing
variable or object right there and
there's built-in method called draw
image and you don't need all those
parameters half of those are optional
and what do you want to draw is an image
you want to draw out the background the
location which is zero zero in this
fourth parameter we don't need to know
about that right now it just confuse it
because it confuses me G draw image and
oh yeah I get all those parameters again
that's the last parameter is actually
your image observer in case you're
wondering but again you don't need to
know about that right now
so for draw image what do you want to
drive through we draw a background that
pick which is actually my face put it
somewhere in the middle which is like
170 180 or something that should appear
somewhere in the middle and for your
image surfer put a null and that's all
so let's go ahead and run this and I
know you guys are going to see black but
I want to make sure that mine ran
successfully and it didn't so hold on
one second you know and I am back and
look at this guys I did something really
embarrassing I named my method load pix
and when I built my method I named it
load pick so let's go ahead and name it
correctly and then we should be good to
go so hopefully I'll run this again
hopefully I
anymore typos so now I know you guys
can't see it but I have a gradient
background in my little face appearing
on the screen right now and this is what
you guys are going to see right here I
made this before I made this tutorial
just to make sure it worked and whenever
you load your images here's where you're
going to see your background and then
your a little face on it like that so
that is how in essence you load images
in Java and again what we did is created
four variables
arm pretty much called a method called
load picks and how you load picks is
using image icon get image that's how
you load them on your computer two local
variables and then when you want to draw
them on your screen you have to use the
method draw image so that's how you do
that and now that we work with graphics
we can actually start doing things that
the graphics like moving them around
manually making them collide into each
other making them hop go down tubes
stuff like that and bam you got yourself
a game but for now that's how you get
for this tutorial don't forget to
subscribe thank you guys for watching
I'll see you next time and I'll see you
later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
