buddy Blackford here with another
Photoshop cs6 tutorial we're gonna talk
about adjusting vibrance today and it's
basically vibrance adjust the saturation
so that the clipping is reduced when
colors approach the full saturation so
basically what happens is it's a smart
tool that increases the intensity of the
more muted colors and leaves the already
well saturated colors alone so it
prevents skin tones from becoming overly
saturated and unnatural so that's a good
thing about it I like so when I'm using
something and I want the tones to be a
lot more rich but I don't want to screw
up everybody's skin tones I use vibrance
so we're gonna go to image adjustments
and then we're gonna go to vibrance
which is right here at the top of the
second set of options and it's another
small adjustment here it's only got two
things we've got our vibrance here so if
we dragged vibrance slight to the right
it's gonna apply the vibrance to the
less saturated colors so let's move that
to the right let's do this at 50 and
then I'll change the preview so you can
see like a difference here well you can
see in the long maybe I should go up a
little higher let's just go all the way
all right there well that's too much
there we go so that's what the vibrance
does there so in taking until to the
left is gonna make it a little more
saturated do it that way you can see
it's more saturated
I got a got to keep the preview on when
I'm doing that so you guys can see
what's going on so to the left is more
saturated to the right is more vibrant
obviously so let's put this at zero and
let's see how the saturation works out
let's drag that to the right and see the
difference you can see everything's
becoming more saturated when you use the
saturation and it's not like a smart
kind of tool move to the left and you
can desaturate stuff and eventually you
can get to a grayscale image so here is
an example of +50 saturation you see
what that looks like compared to not
let's put this to zero and put this to
50 saturation are 50 vibrance and
compare and you can see it's a little
bit of a smarter tool and it doesn't
blast everything out so that's how
vibrance and saturation work not a whole
lot to go over but there you go you can
see the difference and see how they work
together so let's do something like add
a little saturation and then add some
vibrance as well and preview it and you
can see how like the pumpkin and the
back wall and things like that become
more vibrant and these letters here on
his shirt and I like down here how this
pumpkin is already like halfway rotted
out
I bet this pumpkin is going to last
about like one week and then it's just
gonna be a pile of flabby pumpkin on his
doorstep
that's probably why he's flipping
everyone off so hopefully hopefully you
guys learn something from the tutorial
and I'll see you next one have a good
one everyone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
