Photoshop cs6 tutorial on my host buddy
Blackford today we're going to be
learning about a new layer style called
a drop shadow we're going to learn how
to create it and modify it and I'm going
to go over the different properties with
you that you can modify an adjust so
let's go ahead and get started right now
I just have a text layer and then I have
a shape layer and I could apply the drop
shadow effect to either of these so
first I'm just going to start with a
shape layer or what yeah I'll just start
with the shape layer doesn't matter
which one I start with actually so I'm
gonna double click on it and it's going
to bring up the layer styles now you can
also get to the layer styles by clicking
on this FX button down here or you can
just double-click like I did so no I've
got the layer styles and I want to go to
drop shadow which is down here at the
bottom because this is the first one
we're going to learn about so if I click
on it and have the checks bak check
checkbox click it's going to apply the
drop shadow and it's going to apply it
to the edges of the object at an at a
light angle so that we specify within
the within the properties here now just
go ahead and zoom in on the this real
quick I'm going to cancel out real quick
and zoom in on this so we can see it a
little better all right drop shadow
there we go looks like I'm zoomed in too
far oh well so we've got our blend mode
here which is our blending modes and
it's always set on to multiply it as
default and that's fine you can leave it
at that here you can pick your color and
usually for drop shadows you want to use
a off black color we've got our opacity
here which does the transparency of it
of the drop shadow as you can see like
that
here is our angle and whatever angle we
put at is going to simulate where light
is coming from so if i move the angle
the drop shadow of the angle of the drop
shadow is opposite of the angle that you
put on here so if i want the drop shadow
to be come on the bottom right you want
to put the angle to the top left it's um
basically simulating where the Sun is
coming from the next check box here is
called use global light and if you use a
global light it's going to affect
everything in your project that has a
drop shadow so that way all your drop
shadows are coming from the same angle
we've got our distance here and if I
increase that you can see that the
distance from the actual object that you
are putting the layer style on that's
the distance and you can see that how
the drop shadow actually looks if you
increase the distance the transparent
areas in my object you can see them in
the drop shadow as well so I'll just
move this back to some work a little
closer so it looks a little more real
we've got our spread here which is going
to increase the size we've got our size
which is also going to increase the size
but it kind of like fades it out and
everything like that there's a really
huge thunderstorm going on right now or
something it's really really loud out
there and I just looked outside it's not
actually thunderstorming it's snowing
and the wind is blowing really really
hard which really sucks because that's
basically the first snow of the year and
thus no less a long time where I live
which kind of sucks but let's get back
on to our layer styles now we can come
down here into quality so the first one
we've got here is a contour and what
contour is it's a like a mathematical
process that Photoshop has to determine
the brain asst of the shed
I like different levels so let me put
the spread are the size back down to
something manageable like that then I'll
go to my contour and if I change it you
can see how it is a little different but
mainly most of the time you want to use
these two will here on the left they're
usually the best ones because I look the
most real we got anti-alias here to have
a visually smooth drop shadow you can't
really tell that much when you're using
it on here we've got noise and you can
go from zero to 100 on this and it just
gives like a random shift in the colors
of your drop shadow and like ads like a
speckling noisy kind of effect and then
the last thing that we got here is a
layer knocks out drop shadow check box
and it basically creates a knock out
with the underlying layers so that's how
you use your drop shadow and I'll just a
zoom out and that's what your drop
shadow looks like a shape and if I just
throw it onto my text drop shadow as
what it would look like on some text so
that's what we got going on there and
that's pretty much it for drop shadow I
went over all the different styles there
if you want to see what it looks like
all the time on you as you're messing
with your different what are these
called properties you want to make sure
you have the preview button checked and
that way you'll be able to see it but
that's it and that's all I wanted to
show you so hopefully guys are masters
of the drop shadow now a lot of times
now in in graphic design and other
things drop shadows aren't really used
anymore they're considered a little
tacky so be sure to use your drop
shadows with some restraint and don't
put them on everything so just keep that
little tip in mind so thanks a lot for
watching see you guys in the next
