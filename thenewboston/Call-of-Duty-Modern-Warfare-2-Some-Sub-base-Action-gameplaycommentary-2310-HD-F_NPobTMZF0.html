a quick game are not not a quick game
but a game of team deathmatch on sub
base with a silenced famas scavenger
stopping power and ninja pro using a lot
claymores which I get a decent amount of
kills from and stun grenades which I
don't even think I used this game um who
shot back in this video I'm going to be
talking about my two types of assault
rifle setups the one that I use for this
type of gun being first fire and a
regular one I would use for example an
ACR um for this at first I'm going to be
talking about my first fire set up um
how i use my burst fire set up it's
basically the same way I you would use
any other burst fire gun it's just
simply um was it called scavenger pro
because you get a lot of extra ammo UAV
stopping power pro so you can kill in a
burst of
and what else is it called ninja pro
which i use for basically every set
except my except maybe my sniper class
let's talk about scavenger pro scavenger
pro of scavenger itself is probably the
best park in the game not saying best
first perk best / blue perk I'm talking
about in the game in general just for
the simple fact that you basically it's
basically unlimited ammo if you can kill
your enemies or have your friends kill
your enemies you can pick up you can
pick up the extra ammo and boom you've
got you've got more ammo simply we've
got you get another claim or another
grenade Friday night etc is what you get
and always killed me and I'm still his
mother this um and you basically have
all the ammo or anything you could
possibly need you get that ammo stun
grenades if you pick up a blinged weapon
you can get more ammo for that okay next
I'll talk about stopping power stopping
power is her in cold duty for primarily
was basically a default for any weapon
mp5
the gear sniper where your m16 or m4 you
had UAB had to have stopping power
otherwise it would take an extra 10
bullets or five bullets even with a
drastic change and lastly are in this
game though the only reason I would use
it would probably be only would only be
because of a burst fire weapon like you
see I'm using I'm obviously using up the
moss here the famas if you use cold
blooded which I used for my other type
of assault rifle class it doesn't kill
in one burst it only kills in one burst
if you feel if you get a arm if you have
stopping power on it cause for the
slightly next rope or bullet damage
and thank you thankfully for that it
does kill in one burst when you have it
on stopping power or and lastly I'm
going to talk about ninja pro real quick
ninja pro vs commando pro commando pro
very useful perk the pro on it is very
good it's very cheap perk ninja pro I'd
have to say is better definitely is a
search destroy or both reasons why you
would have it and the reason people use
it and regular game types is because
let's say you're in an area where you
can hear where you can hear other people
if you hear other people with ninja pro
you know it's not you simply put it is
what is a hundred percent not you or
there's the definitely not you unless
you're like shooting the wall or
something stupid like that if you have
ninja pro because you enjoy probe
everywhere you walk on metal on concrete
on anything um on dirt on snow wherever
the wherever you're walking it nothing
happens there's no sounds you get so you
whether it be from either like you or a
teammate or something it's that it's not
you it's out I'm just trying to get
through your guys's heads it wouldn't be
you
and this chopper oh by the way I just
stay in this building over here for
about another minute because it was
chopper gunner it's like one thing I one
thing I hate just as much as being
killed by a noob tube is getting killed
by air support I'm just saying cause I
hate it um okay I'm gonna talk really
just really quickly I'm going to talk
about my regular assault rifle class
only because it's basically the same
except for i would use cold blooded
instead my regular assault rifle class
as i said for an example an ACR which
i'm about to unlock actually on the name
Oh what i would do is I'd slap on
instead of stopping power pro I would
put on a cold blooded andorra
cold-blooded pro if I have it
random challenge as I died because
cold-blooded makes it so you don't die
from air support or can't be attacked
from air support or by air support and
that's basically it we won this to count
this team deathmatch game and the guy
that got killed was the guy that I
missed that's it 23 and 10</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
