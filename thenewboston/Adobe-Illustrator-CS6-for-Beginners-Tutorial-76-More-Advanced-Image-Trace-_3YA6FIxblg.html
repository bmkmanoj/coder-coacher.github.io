gonna show you more advanced options in
image trace with a enna W Illustrator
cs6 today and I'm gonna just start right
from where I left off in the last
tutorial so if you haven't seen that one
you might want to check it out I went
over it basically the top half here and
what stuff mint and I'm gonna get down
here into these options down here paths
corners noise method etc so what I'm
gonna do is first I'll just go over what
some of this stuff means
so for paths here what you're going to
do is if you drag the slider you're
gonna be adjusting the path fitting and
the higher the value the tighter the fit
so if you want um here it is that's what
it says right here on this little I
forgot what that's called a little
information box there but if you make it
higher it's a tighter fit and go ahead
and experiment with that to get an idea
of how it actually works
so what I'm gonna do well it's doing and
so now is was I was going to adjust it
up higher and see what we can get right
now I have it on the preset of high
fidelity photo and a good thing to note
is that what you've already traced you
can start moving the sliders and when
you let go of them for a second they'll
start creating more or another like
another sample of what you've been
working on so a new image trace based on
the new settings that you put in so I'm
gonna pause this until it gets to the
part where it's all done so I can keep
on going alright everybody I'm back and
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna increase
the paths here too I'm going to increase
it to something pretty high and then I'm
going to let it do its thing here and
when the progress bar is all done I'm
going to come back from a pause and show
you how the paths being increased
affects the image trace
so see you guys in a second hey
everybody welcome back and I'm gonna
show you what happened when I change the
paths up to high let's go to our view
and we're gonna go to outlines check out
how it recuit some of these outlines are
on these birds and if I want to zoom in
so let's zoom in a lot here 600 you can
see look look how badass these paths are
and that illustrator is able to make
these and make it look a lot like the
actual image so one thing I wanted to
note that I probably didn't be from
before was that the colors up here are
on up a lot higher so I'm gonna actually
turn that down and then what I'm gonna
do is increase the amount of corners and
decrease the path back to its normal
value to default value so I'm gonna put
colors and like 20 I'm gonna put colors
at like 30 the paths back to 50% and
then the corners up higher so when I
mess with the corners the higher the
value the more corners there's gonna be
so it basically adjusts the number of
corners so I think I'm gonna upgrade I'm
gonna put this up high and put 50% low
here so I'm gonna pause it and come back
with those settings for you and see you
there hey everybody welcome back and I'm
back with the preset error with the
settings I was talking about so here we
go this is what we got I turned on the
pass down low and I turned on the colors
down low if I go to our outlines here we
can see that there's still a decent
amount of paths in here and even more
corners from adding up the corners up
higher so we can zoom in and if we look
at these were these there's there's
these different corners here that's what
it's talking about instead of these
being all nice and smoothed out you're
gonna have corners so if I put this down
to less it would end up having these
corners here these sharp ones
they're gonna be a lot more smooth out
and the image probably gonna look a lot
better so this is what we got now and
you can see all the hard and pointy
edges so I'm gonna lower the corners
down and I'm gonna we're gonna see how
it affects this section so now that the
screen has turned black I'm gonna pause
it again and let it do its thing hey
everybody welcome back that's gonna be
the final time I'm gonna pause out for
you guys and because we're getting close
to the time limit and then I'll have to
take over some more parts of this with
you in the next tutorial but what we did
what I did was put the corners down to
16% and if I go over here to my outlines
you can see that there's no more sharp
edges anymore
they're more curved and round and you
don't see any of those pointy parts
anymore and when I go to look at my oops
that's don't click on when I go to
change my view you can see that it's a
lot more round around these like pointy
edges and stuff like that so that's what
the corners does so the next thing that
we're going to go onto is noise but
we're gonna have to do that in the next
tutorial and then I'll probably be able
to fit everything the rest of it up and
the main thing that takes a while for
image trace and the main drawback is
that it takes a second to render your
pictures out if you have a smaller dpi
or which is a resolution in an
illustrator then you're going to have
faster loading and stuff like that but
it didn't want to have a low resolution
picture for you guys because it's hard
to show you the details and those so
thanks a lot for watching be sure to
subscribe to keep up with the latest
tutorials from New Boston thanks
everyone have a good day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
