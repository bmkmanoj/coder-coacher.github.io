tutorial that I'm making for a new
Boston and in this tutorial I'm going to
show you how to overload methods and how
to use a numeration so I touched on
using our overloading methods before
well I didn't really explain like what
it was so I'm going to do that now so
basically overloading a method allows
you to use the same method as many times
as you would like as long as you change
the parameters for example if we were to
copy this show message method right down
here you would get an error if we tried
to debug debug and yeah we get an error
and it says that this my namespace top
my class already defines a member called
show message with the same parameter
types and what that means is these
parameters are the same as this one so
we cannot have two methods with the same
name that have the same parameter so we
would have to change the type of the
variable being passed or passed multiple
parameters into our method so we could
also do we could do like string my
message and it would allow that too but
another or you could change the type of
the variable you pass so if we change
this into an integer then that would be
perfectly fine this is you've got to
string right there as we can't we have
to convert it into a string so now when
we go back to our form 1 and we do this
show message method we have two options
we can either pass an integer in or a
string in I'm gonna pass an integer in
first so like 21 in there now when I
debug that's perfectly fine because it
knows which method to go to it knows to
go through this method because it's
passing an integer
so now I should get 21 yep and if I were
to change this to passing a string in
such as Adam
now let me be bug you're going to
message boxes Adam and yep because since
it was a string in you to go to this
method right here
now you can overload a method as many
times as you would like like I said
before like we could overload this
method like 20 times and that would be
perfectly fine but we would just have to
change the parameters being passed in so
now that we got overloading methods out
of the way I'm going to show you how to
use the numeration
so basically what an enumeration is is
and it's a it's an integer array that um
uses names to like like represent each
of the integers inside of it so in order
to create an enumeration you're just
going to type the keyword email and then
following that you're going to want to
name your numeration and I'm just going
to call it names and after that you just
want to have your curly braces now you
can put anything you would like for the
element so if you can name these
elements anything you would like I'm
just going to put names in there I'm
gonna put the my name and then in order
to put multiple elements so you can want
to separate them by a comma and you can
either put them all in the same line or
like stagger them or whatever you want
Jo and then do Bob down here or we could
put chill on this line down here just on
its own line usually you're probably
going to want to have them on different
lines but if you only have like three or
four elements inside of your names are
inside of your enumeration then you can
just probably put them all in the same
one but you're obviously not going to
want to have is like one line or
elements all the way across your screen
either alright so now that we have this
enumeration names we can create a
variable with the type name
so we just do like names and then we
create a new variable I just name it
like let's call my name and then we just
got to set it equal to something inside
of the names enumeration so we just do
names dot and then whatever element they
would like like since my name is Adam
I'll the student named Adam so now this
variable my name holds the value of Adam
now like I said before this is like
similar to an integer array that like
each one of these names the element
inside of it so like Adam is default
equal to zero and Joe is default equal
to zero or one and so on
so like the first element always equals
0 and this is 1 and this is 2 and so on
but if you wanted to override that you
could set adam equal to the first
element equal to 1 and then the next
element will be 2 and then 3 but if we
were to set joe equal to like 4 then Bob
would be equal to 5 so whatever it just
it's the next element is always 1
greater than the previous element and
these are default integers we could
change these to another variable type
that is like numbers by doing a colon
here and then typing the name of the
variable we want it to be so if we want
to make a little plight then we could do
that so now 1 is a byte and now 4 is
applied and so on so instead of it being
like an integer array it's not like a
byte array with Adam equaling the first
element in there so that's pretty much
it for this tutorial so see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
