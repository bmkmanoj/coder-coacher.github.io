shifter cable now the shifter cable is
responsible for changing gears in your
transmission now thankfully our engine
and transmission on this engine is one
big thing and that's awesome because
they're usually separate and
transmissions are really complicated so
this is going to save us a whole bunch
of work so as you can tell our
transmission only has three gears
forward neutral in Reverse so this is
going to sit in between the driver and
passenger seats so the driver can access
it easy and whenever he moves the
slugger
what it's going to do is it's going to
be connected to a cable and at the other
end it's going to switch right here now
depending on that switch I'll show you
guys where the switch is hooked up to
right above where we hooked up our gear
this is where the transmission output is
Luci if I can get a good angle right
there so what's going to connect to that
and depending on what the driver does
this thing is going to turn into forward
neutral or reverse so the easiest way to
probably do this is to make sure that
your transmission is in our seasoning
neutral right now and then what you want
to do is you want to make sure that your
shifter gear is in with my beautiful
feet that's board that's neutral
that's reverse so go ahead and put this
in neutral too now whenever you install
it you're not going to have to adjust
everything everything is going to be in
the proper location so let's go ahead
and actually install this piece first
since this is a little bit easier and
then I'll go ahead and install the back
piece on the engine so your shifter
right here is going to come with three
bolts one on this side one on this side
and one on the backend which I guess you
guys can't see I'll go ahead and it's
probably easiest to set all your bolts
in first
and the last one which is a little bit
longer on this backside now what you
need to do is you need to use these
three nuts and secure it on the bottom
of your frame at least on this style
frame so make sure you have a good grip
on the top and also the bottom it's
really easy if you're working with
someone else but it's only me right now
so out to do this by myself so that's
what I'm going to do right now tighten
it up so now our handle lever is
complete
looks good make sure that slice is
carrot shape a little bit looking pretty
good so now what we can do is we can go
ahead and move on to the back where it
connects to the engine and by the way
even though I know because I already put
this on before that this one's adjusted
properly whenever you need to adjust
that what you do is you put these two
bolts on here and there's also a bracket
like this on the back and you need to
turn these however tighter or looser
depending on what kind of adjustments
you need but like I said the easiest
thing to do is to make sure this is in
neutral and make sure that your
transmission is in neutral on your
engine and then once you do that it
should be good so anyways let's go ahead
and move to the back and put that up
alright so after trying about 500
different camera angles I finally
admitted to myself that there is no way
that you guys are going to be able to
see me attach this once I put the big
bracket on as well so I'm just going to
go ahead and explain it to you guys as
best I can and it'll make sense so this
right here is where the shifter wire is
supposed to be attached on your engine
this is connected right to your
transmission and how this thing shifts
gears is it turns so whenever I would
turn this if I was strong enough to turn
it by hand but actually takes a lot
force I would turn it once it would be
in forward I would turn it in the middle
it would be in neutral and I'll turn it
all the way back and it would be in a
reverse so the wire or the cable is
actually hooked up to this thing and
whenever you pull the cable you pull it
like this and then it's in forward
neutral reverse so again how this thing
goes on is if you can't see they're like
little teeth in there
there you go it slides perfectly over
this and then you need to tighten it
down of course because it when you first
put it on it's nice and loose you need
to tighten it on by tightening this bolt
and then whenever you do that it pinches
together just like this it clamps down
on this little nub your transmission so
again like I said that's what I'm going
to do right now and that's basically the
only two pieces that you need to install
your transmission the lever that the
person pulls or the driver and this
connection right here so I'm going to go
ahead and put this on and I know you
guys aren't going to be able to see but
anyways that's how you do it pretty
simple and the upcoming videos I'll make
sure to have a proper camera angle this
is the only piece that you know I kind
of have to explain so sorry for that but
I think you have to watch it you guys in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
