ninth physics lecture and in this
lecture I want to talk to you guys about
something called vector subtraction now
vector subtraction is a lot like vector
addition which we learned in the last
tutorial but instead of taking two
forces and adding them together to make
a bigger force what this does is you
have two forces acting in opposite
directions so you end up with a force
that's kind of averaged between them so
let me go ahead and give you guys an
example and hopefully you understand it
or understood vector addition and if you
did this should be pretty easy to catch
on so say that you have an airplane and
it is traveling north at a speed of 100
miles per hour
so that's your vector which is going to
be symbolized in the up arrow and the
other force is say that you have a wind
it's going to be a windy day and this
wind is blowing south east at 25 miles
per hour
now of course south east if you're
thinking north is up and South is down
is going to be to the right and down so
you have two forces acting in opposite
directions even though they aren't
completely opposite they're different
from each other so how do you find the
bine force or the end result of these
vectors well what you need to do just
like in vector addition you first draw
the first force or one of the forces
which is north or up at 100 miles per
hour so let's go ahead and do that draw
a arrow north and I'm just going to
write 100 and I won't put the unit's
right there doesn't really matter at 100
miles per hour so this would symbolize
your plane right here so now what you
have to do is you need to draw this
other vector south east at 25 miles per
hour but you just don't draw anywhere
you need to draw a head to tail the tail
of this one needs to be drawn on the
head of this one so you go ahead and
take the tail and you draw it right
there
so this force would be 25 miles per hour
in the southeast direction now remember
whenever you are actually drawing these
on graph paper
you know it's kind of hard to drive to
scale when I'm just drawing on my
computer screen
but whenever you're drawing them on
graph paper make sure that this right
here is four times the length of this or
else you're going to get skewed results
so whenever you do that the last thing
you need to do the last step in this
from is you need to draw your last
vector from the tail of the first one to
the head of the last one so let's go
ahead and do that right now
I'll draw mine is a dotted line and this
right here actually probably shouldn't
draw an arrow I'll just name this vector
X is your end result so even though I
can't measure this let me just go ahead
and guess the mate and say this is 80
miles per hour and that is you know
north east or somewhere in that
direction so this is your end result you
take the end vector and you just measure
the length of it and also you can figure
out whatever direction it is by where
it's pointing so again like I said this
is vector subtraction and whenever you
do this you end up with your end result
somewhere between your biggest vector
and the vector acting in opposite
direction towards it so this is a way
that you can calculate the path of a
plane and actually planes need to take
wind into account before they make their
flights in if you're a pilot then you
would need to figure out the stuff out
or the air traffic controller I don't
I'm not really sure who figures are that
stuff out but someone does so hopefully
through this crazy example you
understand vector addition and vector
subtraction and we're ready to move on
to the next topic which are Newton's
laws of motion it's going to be exciting
so I'll see you guys then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
