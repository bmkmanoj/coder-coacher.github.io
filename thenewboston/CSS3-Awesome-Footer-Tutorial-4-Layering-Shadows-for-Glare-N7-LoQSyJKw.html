a one pixel shadow that I don't even
know if you guys can see it but it's a
thin white line right at the top only a
one pixel white shadow at the top so now
let's go ahead and create this main
gleam this 10 pixel big bulky glaring
gleam that you can see across all of
your footer and all of the buttons so in
order to do this you actually don't need
an additional entirely new line you can
just copy this and let me turn my word
wrap on press comma and paste this
entire thing again now unlike before
where we just have you know 0 1 pixel we
don't just want to put a shadow on top
of shadow although sometimes you do do
that what we wanted to do is we want to
change the second one to 10 pixels and
we want to bring down the opacity to
point to so this first shadow that I'm
highlighting is you probably can't even
see on the YouTube video it's so thin
it's just as a nice bright one pixel
gleam on top and the second shadow that
we just created is actually this big you
know it's almost um the height of my
cursor right here it's this white glare
across the top of the footer and that's
um you know usually everyone's favorite
glare because it's the most apparent so
now what I wanted to do is I actually
want to add two more shadows so they're
gonna be kind of the same so in set 0 10
pixel 20 pixel RGB a 255 255 255 and the
last value for this one is 0.25 this
third shadow that we just created lays
on top of this footer and it's actually
a very blurry white shadow and it fades
from the top to the bottom so as you can
see this entire footer is
light at the top then it gets darker as
you go towards the bottom of the browser
this is what this shadow accomplishes so
as you can see we're basically saying
create this size shadow that's white 255
255 255 that lays on top
now there's mmm got a piece of crap in
my mouth
there's one last shadow that we need to
create guys I promise that this is the
last one even though it's by the way I
need to give you guys this claimer
whenever I'm developing for shadows for
this effect and I'm trying to explain
you guys where they all are it's very
difficult you know to explain oh you see
the shadow right here Oh what about this
one over here oh no I'm talking about
this one over here it's very hard to
explain but go ahead and play around
with it in your code you guys are gonna
see what I'm talking about but for the
last one what we're gonna do is we're
actually gonna build a black shadow and
that is another reason why it looks so
dark at the bottom and it fades away as
you go up of course gleaming at the top
so let me just go ahead and code this
last shadow and the code for this let me
get my cursor in the right place it's in
set 0 negative 15 and yes you can have
negative values negative 15 30 pixels
RGB a and of course I said this one is
going to be black so that means 0 0 0
for black and the opacity of this is 0.3
so just to recap one last time I created
for shadows and if you guys you know
don't understand where they are just
play around with them in your code you
guys are gonna see him maybe change one
to pink if you don't know where it is
and it's gonna make sense but the first
one was the top border the very thin one
pixel top border the second one was this
main glaring top white section that is
10 pixels the third one you guys
probably can't notice it it's hard to
point out it
overlays in its top white and the fourth
one is just a dark shadow that comes up
from the bottom just to make the bottom
of your footer a little bit darker
it makes the glare pop out a little bit
more so anyways that is how you use
multiple shadows for an awesome effect
of a transparent footer but guys we are
nowhere close to done yet but for now
thank you guys for watching and well
I'll see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
