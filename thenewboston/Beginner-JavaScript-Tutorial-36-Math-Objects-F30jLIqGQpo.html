JavaScript tutorial and in this tutorial
actually I think it's a 36 tutorial
anyways in this story I'm going to be
going over the math object now just like
the array object we saw in the last few
tutorials the array object had built-in
properties such as length and also had
built-in methods such as sort and
push/pop so aside from the array objects
that's one of the built-in objects in
JavaScript you also have something
called the math object so this is really
useful whenever you're making like a
calculator or a program that does
calculations on any kinds of numbers the
math object has built-in properties and
these properties are most often
mathematical values such as pi Euler's
constant and let's go ahead and actually
enough of me talking let's go ahead and
take a look at some of those properties
right now like documents right and let's
go ahead and write one of the properties
such as math dot pi now pi is going to
be like 3.14159265 35 so in order to
save us the trouble of having to write
out that number every time what we can
do is we can just go ahead and save it
and check it out javascript already
stores the value of pi so anytime you
want to use pi whenever you know
calculating the area of a circle or
something you don't have to go google
the value of pi and set equal to
variable javascript already stores it as
property of that math object to give you
very easy access to it so that's one of
the beauties of the properties of your
math object another one is Euler's
constant and Euler's of course begins
with the e because they decided on the
spelling of that and that is this again
so the properties of the math objects in
JavaScript are basically just um values
that have mathematical meaning so you're
saying all right that's pretty cool I
don't have to go Google the number every
time but aside from that the math object
is useful for some of its methods as
well such as in order to find the square
root of a number
yeah we could go ahead and make a
function for it but a lot of these easy
simple mathematical functions are
already built in JavaScript so such as
finding the square root of a number or
whenever we're doing like five to the
third power there's a form excuse me
there's a method for that already and if
we wanted to make a function for
rounding up or rounding down we could
use a built-in math method for that as
well
so let's go ahead and make a program
that calculates that allows the user to
enter a number and it calculates the
square root of that number so again like
I said we can go ahead and create our
own function for finding the square root
but why do that when we can use one of
JavaScript's built-in math object
methods so let's go ahead and make a
variable and set it equal to n and this
will be equal to the number that the
user enters and in order to do that we
need to give them a prompt box
aka a space to enter a number and we'll
give them a real simple prompt like
enter a number and by default we'll set
it equal to nothing at all so now we
need another variable to store the
answer of that so the math object is
going to calculate it and we're going to
store the answer and variable called
answer so now in order to use this math
object that square roots a number you do
this right the math object use a dot
separator and the name of the method is
this sq R T now the parameter is what
number do you want a square root well
they already entered a number it's going
to be stored in the variable n so just
go ahead and stick that number in there
say they entered 81 what this is going
to do is it's going to take the square
root of 81 which is 9 and it's going to
store that 9 in the variable answer so
now all we have to do is print out their
answer so we can you know document write
it but let's go ahead and make a little
box because we already have a prompt box
that pops up in the lower box what do
you know make the feel of the program a
little more natural so now let's just go
ahead and write something like
a square root of and now we would just
go ahead and write n since that was the
original number then just go ahead and
write like is answer so now it's going
to well let me go ahead and run it and
then I'll talk you guys through it one
more time so it's going to say enter a
number and just go ahead and type in
like 16 press ok and it's going to say
the square root of 16 is 4
simple enough let's give a a harder one
to you know make sure it's running
correctly and our number 144 ok the
square root of 144 is 12 working perfect
so basically the program works like this
you give a prompt box and the user
enters a number such as 144 now 144 is
sort in the variable n so it takes that
value of 144 finds the square root of it
using this built-in square root method
and it stores the answer which is 12 in
the variable answer and then last but
not least it just says the square root
of 144 is 12 there you go
so as you can see using this little you
know 8 characters of code and whatnot is
a lot more simple than having to write
our own square root function and then
calling our function and then making
sure that they you know enter the right
values and yadda yadda yadda a lot of
these functions are already built into
JavaScript so why am I telling you this
I just want to save you guys the trouble
of you know having to write your own
functions all the time because they were
saying you know what this is really
common function
I bet JavaScript already has this built
in chances are it does so that is why
the math function or excuse me the math
object is useful not only when working
with math constants but also simple math
methods and if you want to listed the
math methods um just go ahead and look
online they have a huge list of them
they're probably I want to guess like 30
or so many ways enough of me talking
that is all I'm going over for the math
object so thank you guys for watching
don't forget to subscribe and I'll see
you guys in the next story</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
