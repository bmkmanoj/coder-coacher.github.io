welcome to your twelfth intermediate
Java tutorial and in this tutorial we're
going to be going over some more
collections methods and I'm going to be
talking specifically about the method at
all and what you can do in this tutorial
is take elements from one collection to
add to another collection simple enough
but there's some little things you need
to take note of so the first thing we
need to do is make sure you have
everything imported from the class Java
util you only like for things imported
but go ahead and import everything
because might as well be lazy and the
first thing we need to do is create an
array and it's going to hold string data
and you can pretty much put anything in
it so go ahead and put um let's add a
little comment make sure your caps-lock
is undone convert stuff array to a list
actually I probably don't need comments
for this but oh well and then go ahead
put string and you can name your array
anything you want I'm going to name mine
stuff or you can I'm probably going to
be putting food in it so let's go ahead
and put like four or five things it
really doesn't matter and I'm going to
put apples through one and beef and
let's see what else pops into my head
corn and ham try to make it all the same
type of like I'm making mine all foods
and then I'll make my other array like
all websites or something and that's
going to help out view for it it's the
demonstration so now we have an array
created in this called stuff simple
enough and now what we need to do is
take this array and convert it to a list
so the easiest way to do that is go
ahead and put list we're going to be
casting string data into this and I'm
going to name it list one and go ahead
and set it equal to arrays dot as list
and of course that's built and method
from the arrays class and as a parameter
it takes what array do you want to
convert into a list so I named mine
stuff so I'll go ahead and pass stuff in
there for the parameter and now we have
an array created and we passed it in
the view is a list name the list 1 so
now aside from this since we need to
list or to collections for the
demonstration let's go ahead and create
another list right now and this is going
to be an ArrayList unlike the first one
that's a list this is going to be
changing and remember an array has a
certain size but array list is dynamic
you can change size so that's why I'm
using the collection ArrayList and go
ahead and we're going to be putting
string data into it and might as well
name it list 2 for simplicity and set
this equal to new array list and we need
to put string in with empty parameters
and what we did now is you pretty much
created another list an ArrayList but it
has nothing in it right now so in order
to add elements to an ArrayList go ahead
and type the name of the list and - a
list - and then put add and then as your
argument you just put what you want to
add to the list so I said website so let
me put YouTube and go ahead and just
copy this I don't feel like type in it
again copy and we'll add like three
things of this so put YouTube Google and
dig some of my three favorite websites
right there so what we have here is we
have list 1 which is populated with
apples beef corn and ham and we have
list 2 which right now it has YouTube
Google and dig in it so what we want to
do is first of all let's just go ahead
and print out list 2 so we'll make an
enhanced for-loop input string X list 2
and we'll go ahead and test this out
just to see if it prints out first so
system out what do print format since
it's the easiest way and for argument 0
just go ahead and put like um per
sentence and then go ahead and pass X in
here and let's go ahead and see if this
program works first run it okay so right
now it prints out list 2 and this is the
list we're going to be changing YouTube
Google dig so everything is going good
so far so go ahead and after for loop
what we want to do is we want to add
elements
the stuff to the list to array so go
ahead and put collections dot add all
and as your parameter um go ahead and
put lists to and also stuff and what
this does right here is it takes all the
elements from stuff and it adds it to
list too so let's go ahead and we'll
print out a blank line system.out.print
line and also copy this so what we're
going to be doing is we print it out
list to and then we're going to be
adding all the stuff and stuff to lists
to and just go ahead and print out a
blank line and print it out again let's
go ahead and run this and see how it
worked as you see an original our
original list was YouTube Google and
Digg and then we added this add all
method on it and then we print out blank
line for you know ease of viewing and
then now our new collection is this
combined with this so this is all the
modified lists do so that's that for
this tutorial in the next store were
probably going over more collection
methods but like I said that's it that's
all the time I have for now so thank you
guys for watching don't forget subscribe
and I'll see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
