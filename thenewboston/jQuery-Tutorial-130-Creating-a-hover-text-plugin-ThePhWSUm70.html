actually disable this so we need to find
a way to include something in our code
that's going to say temporarily remove
it now what we're gonna do here is just
before we show our out div we're gonna
go ahead and we're actually going to
remove the top the tooltip attribute
well we're not going to remove it we're
just gonna set the value of it to
nothing so we want to say this dot
attribute and in here we want to say
title and we want to set it to nothing
here we've just set it to nothing so now
what's going to happen is when we hover
over we don't get the annoying tooltip
appear the only problem we have now is
when we come away this title attribute
is now set to nothing so when we hover
back oh well it has worked but you know
depending on how how everything works
we've we've removed it we've removed it
here and then we could have some
problems later on so what we want to do
is we want to make sure that we actually
reapply the title to a title attribute a
bit later on so when the mouse comes out
we want to restore the title attribute
back to its original value so again we
go this dot attribute and obviously
attribute is title and we want to set
this to title remember the variable that
we took earlier so although it worked
before we want to make sure that we
replace the text before we go ahead and
actually actually you know you know so
essentially what we've done is removed
it and then replaced it now there is a
problem that this can cause let me just
go ahead and get rid of the resource
putting it back in and I'm gonna go
ahead and copy this link and we'll just
do a line break for now and not very
good code but let's go just ahead and do
a line break let's go ahead and change
this to PHP academy' to org and it's
changed the title to PHP or video
tutorials and in here let's go ahead and
just change the text so now we've got
one link underneath each other
now the problem at the moment is is that
you've already probably seen we've got a
powerful search engine here and video
tutorials here but when we actually go
ahead and hover over both of them they
have the same essentially the same value
so what we want to do is inside inside
of our plugin J s we want to go ahead
and actually restore this back to its
original title so in here we want to say
this dot attribute and the title set
back to the initial title and now when
we hover over oh no it's still the same
and let's go ahead and work out why that
might be okay so maybe this is something
that I haven't actually thought out ok
yes so I get it
basically what we've done is we've
included this in the wrong place so what
we want to do is we want to go ahead and
actually put this inside of the mouse
mover then altogether so let's go ahead
and just rearrange this around a bit
this is good that we've caused a problem
because we can go and actually look at
the solution to this where it has the
same description for each link when we
come in here and when we come in here so
we'll go ahead and obviously this was
unplanned but we'll go ahead and change
this around a bit so let's go ahead and
just the first thing I'm going to do is
just get rid of this and I'm going to
place this inside of here and now I want
to take this loop here all this if
statement here and just get rid of it
and pull this up and then I want to go
ahead and delete this here so now I'm
gonna just read sort of indent that or
take it back a bit and we can go ahead
and apply this if statement inside of
here right so let's let's take a look at
the code as it stands okay we've got
nothing obviously okay so this mouse
move and then we
having the title attribute of the
current element so so now what we want
to do is this is causing the problem
because we're setting the attribute to
nothing I think that should be the
problem
maybe not let's come back and just take
a look at how this is working so let's
just run through this again we're
applying the DIF afterwards the mouse
the mouse move event here we're grabbing
the title from here using the attribute
from the currently hovered over link and
that's applied to all h raf all a tags
we're grabbing the top setting the ties
well let's just comment this out for now
and see what happens okay yes so now you
can see that that was the problem we're
removing the title attribute so we're
still getting this sort of that title
attribute you know sort of pop up and
also we've still got the problem of this
not being moved that's not a problem we
can go ahead and just rearrange this
let's go ahead and cut that and just
paste it underneath here so it doesn't
interfere with anything oh and it has
interfered okay so let's just get rid of
that altogether and we'll deal with that
as we go so I'm going to go ahead and
get rid of this as well so hover text
art hide when the mouse comes out let's
just check yeah that's working so we've
got the we've got the functionality of
it working now with both links and it's
actually going ahead and taking the
title from each one as we wanted it to
however we've now got this problem of
the hover over taught it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
