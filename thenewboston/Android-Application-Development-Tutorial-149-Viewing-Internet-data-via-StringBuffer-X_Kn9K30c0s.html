Android tutorial for the new boss in
we're going to do in this tutorial is
basically read our code from our our
bufferedreader and we setup again our
inputstreamreader
within our bufferedreader and last
tutorial took out that parenthesis but
you still want that one in there so
basically what we're going to do is
we're going to use a string buffer to
read through our input or buffer reader
and this is kind of a Java thing so I
probably won't go too much into it I'll
kind of explain what's going on but if
you guys want more information just
check out probably Bucky's Java series
I'm sure he has some more stuff within
within there but I'll give you the basic
concepts so what we need to do is we
need to set up our string buffer so
we're going to say string buffer and
we're going to say SB going to set this
equal to new string buffer and we're
just going to put you know make pretty
much null now to start out with so now
what we need to do is we also need to
set up a line so we're going to say
string line for L or L for line and
we're just going to set this also equal
to B nothing to start with and we also
want to set up basically a new line type
string because you know we don't want
all of our data just in a paragraph
where it's hard to read so we're just
going to say like new line and now and
we're going to set this equal to B the
system dot get property and there's
string properties that we can refer to
we refer to one called line dot
separator so that's just going to
separate our lines and now what we need
to do is kind of like when we were
processing data or reach receiving data
we're going to use a while loop to read
all of our data and put it within our
string buffer so we're just going to
create a while loop and we're going to
say as long as their line is equal to a
bufferedreader dot read line as long as
there is a line available to read we're
going to we're going to read that line
so then we go with it outside that
parentheses and we're going to say as
long as that
is not equal to be null we're going to
basically read that specific line so
going to refer to our string buffer
called SB and we're just going to say
append which is basically a return the
value that we're reading so we're going
to say our line plus we want to add a
new line when it's done reading that
specific line and that's going to loop
through again and as long as there's a
line available it's not equal to null
it's going to append the next line and
then create a new line and do that over
and over until you know it's read
through the whole document and then all
we're going to do is we're going to
close our buffer reader so we're going
to just say I enclose this is pretty
similar to when we were working with
data this is how we kind of refer to a
string buffer and then what we can do is
we can set up our string buffer to equal
a string of some sort so again we set up
our string and the first tutorial of you
know this get method called data so all
we're going to say is data is equal to
our string buffer dot to string and then
what we're going to say is return our
data because again this class is looking
for some kind of a return method that's
going to return a string so that's what
we're going to return is the data we get
from our string buffer and then we also
need to add a catch clause or finally
statement so we're just going to say
finally and we're going to say we're
going to just make sure our our buffered
reader is closed again we're just going
to say if like you know I n is not equal
to null which you know for the most part
it should have already been closed but
if it wasn't closed that's most likely
means that's still not equal to null so
we're just going to force close it so
we're just going to say again like try
and then I n dot close and then we're
just going to return turn data as well
because hopefully we got some sort of
data attached and also we're going to
add a catch clause and we're just going
to say catch
like an exception II and then we're just
going to print that to the stack trace
again we're pretty familiar with that
and there we go we pretty much have
everything set up now let's just kind of
test this make sure it works so we're
going to go back over to our HTTP
example class and all we're going to do
is we're going to set up a new get
method that we just created e^x we're
going to call this test something like
that and this is going to be equal to
new get method e^x and then we can use
that method so we're going to say test
or we can set up a new string may be
returned we're going to set this equal
to our test dot and we have that method
we just said created called get Internet
data and that's what we're going to
return to the string and then just we're
just going to set our text view that we
have set up to equal that string so
again just HTTP stuff and we're going to
say dot set text to our new string that
we just created called the returned and
also we have to add a catch clause
trying to catch around this because
again we're working with you know an
exception of some sort that could be
thrown so what we want to do is we also
want to set this text within that catch
clause as well so then if it doesn't get
set to anything we know we have some
sort of air as well just always good to
keep that in mind of how our application
runs and if it's actually working so
we're just going to run our application
and we're going to go down to our HTTP
example click that and hopefully our
textview yeah and see our textview
already changed the data and this is
kind of the stuff that we get back as
you can see you know and we can also
break this down which we'll get into
later but as you can see is kind of
nicely structured of information that's
being passed in through our website
again I had that
scrollview just for this reason so we
can scroll through here and kind of see
some of the stuff like keywords the meta
name just some of the background stuff
of the website that we can read and
process and access some of that
information but that's pretty much it
for the get method using the HTTP client
we'll get into again that Twitter I'm
just like kind of breaking down some
code a little bit better using JSON in
the next few tutorials but uh just to
give you guys kind of idea how to get
some information with that get method
through HTTP client that's how you do so
so thanks again for watching guys and
I'll catch you in the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
