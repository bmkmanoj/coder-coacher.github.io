Effects cs6 tutorial
I'm your host buddy Blackford and today
I want to go over a 3d lighting setup
called
a three-point lighting setup and this is
a traditional basic lighting setup that
works in pretty much all situations
especially when you have something front
and center that you want to light up it
contains three lights at certain points
and it's it covers all the shadows and
blocks out hard shadows and everything
like that so I'm gonna show you how to
set this up so you can light up your 3d
logos and everything properly so that
they look professional and nice so what
I have here is some text and then I have
some vectors I converted into 3d so if I
use my camera here to just like look
around real quick I've got the 3d on so
it's gonna take a second to render every
time I kind of do something but you can
see that we've got some 3d objects in 3d
text here now if you want to you can
just use a 3d text to follow along you
don't need to have the vectors but I
just threw them in there for good
measure so you can see them a little
better so I've got a camera here also
that is set to the 35 millimeter preset
because I wanted it closer to the
objects here and I'll start by going
over the different kind of lights and
what they are and then we'll set them up
so I'm gonna go into my top view here
and show you my lighting setup
looks like where I headed into the top
of you now there we go so I've got the
camera back here and that's right here
and it's just on right on the objects
right in front of them and then I've got
a three lights there's two in the front
illuminated in the front and then
there's one in the back illuminated up
some lights and setting off the
background so the different types of
lights are set at different intensities
to not like blast each other or blow out
the camera and to help illuminate the
person so they're not like really have
hot spots or have like dark spots on
their face which would look unnatural
but we need to pull them off the
background and pull them out and make
sure they look nice so we need to add
the camera or the lighting so there are
three different types of lights the
there is a key light which is your main
light and that's this light right here
and I'm using spotlights for all these
because that's pretty much what you you
would be using in a studio so this
lighting setup is based off a lighting
setup that you use in like a real film
studio when you're setting up actual
lights in real life they're gonna be on
like tripods or light stands or anything
like that so this look here is your key
light this is the primary light and it's
going to be usually opposite the camera
so the camera right now is head on so
it's going to be too left of the camera
so this is the camera here and then this
is the key light now I aimed it so it's
right at the point of interest here I
mean I could move it a little more into
the middle but I liked how it was with
the cone angle and everything like that
so I'm gonna go into the settings and
show you what I have here I have the
color isn't white which what you want to
usually have that at intensity is at a
hundred percent I've got my cone angle
at seventy Inco and feather at 50 now
the cone feather I didn't worry about
too much I also made sure it casted
shadows so here's my shadow darkness and
diffusion so that's my key light
settings hit okay
so that's your main light that's the one
you want to have it 100% the next one
across from it this is called the fill
light and when they when you have the
key light on its gonna cast some hard
shadows on the object it or it may not
illuminate everything that you need to
have illuminated because of the shadows
so this light is called the fill light
and it's basically called the fill light
because it fills in the shadows created
by the key light so it's everything's
even across the subject so what we want
this to be and I'm gonna open up the
settings for you I made it a little bit
of a warmer color and make it a color
that looks good with your object here I
have Browns and Brown is a kind of a
closer in color to some skin and stuff
like that so I made it like a warmer
color now if you have something like ice
or that you like an icy logo or a watery
logo you might want to use like a blue
fill light and I barely brought this up
so it's like barely more than white it's
kind of like a I don't know like an
orange cream color now my intensity is
at 50% you want your intensity of your
fill light to be at 50% of what your key
light is so make that basically half of
what your key light is and then
everything else I have about the same
now you want it positioned across from
your key light in an it in like an angle
that is somewhere on like this half of
the screen so I can't show you in this
but I was going to try to draw a box but
this takes too long and this so not
going to but you want to have it on the
opposite side on the opposite half it
could be could be up here and angled
more more in if you wanted it to be I
really hate this updates every two
seconds it's really annoying especially
when you're like not even really looking
at so you can have it over here and
angled to the side like this what
ever gets the lights whatever gets the
shadows filled in that you need to get
filled in and however it you want to
make it look so it looks nice</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
