tutorial and in this video I want to
talk to you guys a little bit more about
variables and also we're going to be
jumping into dates and we'll see I'll
show you guys how to avoid some problems
that a lot of people have so the first
thing we're going to do is we're going
to make variable called name and we're
just going to set it equal to my name
which is Bucky Roberts
now what I want to mention is whenever
you're using a function so let me go
ahead and use a simple function called n
chart and what this is going to do is
it's going to count the number of
characters in a variable so we'll just
go ahead and pass it in name so
basically what we're saying is how many
characters are in this variable name and
if we highlight this and run it Bucky
Roberts has 13 characters and also on
this space right here our counts space
is a character as well so there are 12
characters or 12 letters and a space so
that's why it returns 13 but this
tutorial isn't about this end char
function so why am I talking about it
the reason that I'm talking about it is
because I want to show you guys the
difference between name and name in
quotation marks now whenever you pass in
a variable to a function without
quotation marks like we did right here
this is telling our that we are using a
variable this name is a place order for
something else in this case bucky
roberts whenever we pass it in with the
quotation marks what it does is it says
okay get the number of characters in
this and AME which is 4 so this is just
a couple of characters this is a
variable and I'll show you guys right
here if we run it we can see that this
name that is the variable has 13
characters because it's Bucky Roberts
and what this one is displaying is 4
because it counted n am E which is of
course four letters so that's why I said
that so just remember basically whenever
you use quotation marks it means
the text whenever you use it without the
quotation marks and means a variable a
place order for something else so now
that we got that out of the way let me
go ahead and delete all this I want to
tell it to go oh got piece of freaking
string cheese in my throat I want to
talk to you guys about dates because
dates kind of had the same issue so let
me go ahead and type bunch of stuff out
and then I'll show you guys what I'm
doing as date and let's just go ahead
and what data are you going to put might
as well put the date today so it's 2014
628 and now let me go ahead and it's
easier if I just type all this out I
know trust me on me and I'll I'll
explain what I'm doing in a second
this and let's just put class tuna and
class ham and run this crap alright so
basically whenever we run this whenever
we work with dates in our let me start
there what you need to do is you first
need to tell our that what you're about
to enter is indeed a date if you don't
it's just going to look at it as a
string of numbers with hyphens in
between them so this isn't the number
2014 - 6 - 28 this is actually a date
but you know it's just a computer so it
doesn't realize that so whenever we work
with dates before we store them in a
variable we need to pretty much take
that text and convert it to a date using
the as dot date so whenever we do this
this tuna variable now holds a valid
date and this ham it just holds a string
of text so that's why whenever we output
class tuna it says this is a date but
class ham we we never converted this to
a date so that's why it just says
character so this is actually important
later on whenever we're trying to do
things like sort dates or make a graph
based on dates if you forget to convert
it to a date before you know you try to
organize everything or sort everything
it's either going to give you your error
message or something's going to mess up
so uh
update is ready to install for like the
8,000th time today but anyways that's
what I want to point out that's when you
use quotation marks that's when you
don't some things you need to convert to
dates other things they're just going to
be plain old characters thank you guys
for watching in the next sort is I'll
see in the next video I can't talk today</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
