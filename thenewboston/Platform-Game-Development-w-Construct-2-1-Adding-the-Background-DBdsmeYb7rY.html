welcome to your very first tutorial and
how to make a platformer game with
construct two now if this is your very
first time you can construct two you
never even use a software before then I
would highly recommend checking out my
other videos first they're pretty much
the beginner videos and they give you a
nice introduction to what the software
is in the basics of how to use it and
actually if you go to my website if you
aren't on my website already
Bucky's room no org slash videos that
PHP and scroll down right here - you see
game development with construct - and
click on it then you have 15 videos
right here and these are the best videos
for a really basic introduction they
gave up and started and familiar with
construct 2 so also I probably should
have mentioned this first but if you're
watching these on YouTube or even on my
website make sure that you're watching
these tutorials in full screen and also
1080p I'm recording my entire desktop so
if you try to watch it on that little
youtube player then you're not going to
be able to see what's going on watching
in full-screen 1080 everything is hi-def
crystal-clear so of course if you don't
have this downloaded already go to this
website I don't even know how to say the
company serie dot-com slash construct -
and this is a software it's completely
free and it allows you to make awesome
games but again I talked about that in
my last video series so I'm not going to
talk about it again and actually um the
tutorials that I'm going to be teaching
you for the platform game someone I
found a written tutorial but it's like a
few years old and it's kind of outdated
so I decided to remake it into a video
series and I'll show you guys how to do
you know how to use it with the new
software that you guys are using right
now instead of you know it was written
for the old software those made like
back in 2010 so first of all what is a
platform game well a platform game think
of like Super Mario Brothers for
Nintendo or Sonic the Hedgehog for Sega
it's basically one of those 2d games
where you have this world and you can go
you know left and right up and down
collect coins hop on things shoot
enemies like if you ever played
that's another platform game um it's not
3d and it's not like like a top-down
shooter like the last video so this is
actually a really popular game for web
development and also well a lot of stuff
actually come to think of it so that's
what kind of game we're going to be
making and it's a little bit more
complex than the last game so um if you
want to learn a little bit more about
the software then you're in the right
place so the first thing that we need to
do is actually open up the software and
I have open right there and start a new
project new empty project just open that
now before we start doing a bunch of
crap we obviously need some images such
as you know the background the platforms
that they can jump on the enemies the
dude itself like the main character so
if you have constructive downloaded I
believe actually I don't know if the
images come with the free version but if
you go to excuse me file and then you go
to this a little about thing then once
you click that it's going to give you a
link to download media bundle now if you
click that I'm just going to close out
of this because I already have it
downloaded you're going to be able to
download all of this crap and again like
I said this is the stuff that we're
going to be using the background image
all the enemies you jump on and of
course you know the platform's your main
dude shown too so there's our main dude
right there and like I said if you have
the free version of this I don't think
that these are very available for
download but what you can do obviously
it doesn't matter like you don't need to
use the same character or same images as
me it's going to work fine whatever you
use so if you just go to google and type
in platformer tileset then what it's
going to do is it's going to give you a
bunch of options like this and you can
just use these images for your game just
pick a a title set that you want
pretty much one whatever looks cool with
this actually looks pretty cool right
here
it's like Super Mario Brothers so this
is pretty much going to be the like all
the things you jump on like I said the
land and of course you need a character
too so if you type in sprite sheet what
a sprite is as we're going to be
learning is just a bunch of um
individual it's pretty much a file an
image file but you can break it up into
a bunch of individual pictures and
format animation so of course what we
would do with this sprite sheet if I
decide to download this one is we would
play these images one after another and
all of that crap is actually built in to
UM construct two and once we play them
right after another it's going to look
like this a little cat is running or
Jaguar or whatever it is so I would
actually recommend getting a dude not
that dude it's kind of weird but um yeah
just go ahead and download either this
media bundle or a sprite sheet and a
tile set and then you're good to go so
again now that we are set up what we
need to do now is pretty much just set
with the basics of our project and the
first thing I wanted to do is I want to
change the layout size so if you
actually click anywhere since we don't
have any layers on there yet
just this basic one we're going to see a
property called layout size and right
now it's 17 away by 960 and typically
you want to make this for whatever
device you're making like this is going
to be different if you're making an
iPhone game or just a HTML game for the
web but for now we just need enough
space to where we can work with pretty
much so go ahead and make yours 4,000 by
2048 and hit enter and you guys probably
couldn't see it but my layout just got a
little bit better which is orc sees me a
little bit bigger which is this big
white space and to scroll out I just hit
held down ctrl on my keyboard and you
can either scroll in or scroll out and
just like before you can if you hold the
middle mouse button you can click and
drag to pan
and to get back to where we were hold
down control and hit zero under keyboard
and that's going to give you the basic
zoom the default where we started so now
that we have the layout or the gaming
area the right size that we want it the
next thing I want to do is add that
background or add any background any
image you find off the computer is fine
so if you double click anywhere in this
white area it's going to allow you to
add things to it so we want to add is
actually a tiled background so if I
scroll down oh look at this tiled
background and what tiled means is you
can stack them up right next to each
other and it's going to create a
seamless background so if you just like
take a picture of your backyard when you
stack them right next to each other
they're going to look weird why they
where they touch so um just click
anywhere right here for now and it
pretty much says okay so you want to
create a tiled background well what
actual image do you want to use let me
go ahead and load an image and I'll show
you guys how you did that if you click
this little folder right here that's
where we can select the image and if you
have them if you have your own one then
go ahead and load it now but if you have
the media bundle just double click this
and I believe it's in sprites jungle
performer background image and there's
only one called background so right
there and alright this is a little big
right now but what we can do is actually
close this and as you can see alright it
looked a little bit different whenever
we were loading and this isn't exactly
what we expected so what we need to do
is actually make this image fit our game
right here so in order to do that make
sure that you have an image selected and
you know that it's selected because it
has these little dots around it in this
little blue border and the first thing
we want to do is position it in this top
corner so if you just try to drag it
it's probably going to be a pain so an
easier way to do this is again once it's
selected go to this position property
and just type 0z
what that means is make it so it touches
the top-left corner perfectly now hit
enter and check it out so pretty much
you're saying where do you want this top
corner be well we want to x0y0
boom roasted so the only other thing we
have to do after this is make this image
fit our layout perfectly so remember our
layout is 4,000 by 2048 so now select
this image and guess where we're going
to do pretty obvious stuff here the size
of this we want to be 4,000 2048 hit
enter and a look at that our background
image now matches our layout perfectly
this guy's this is incredibly easy so
far so I think it's time to step it up a
notch so go ahead and hold ctrl 0 pan
tool you know the very beginning and in
the next tutorial now that we got that
easy crap out of the way um hopefully
we're going to be importing some sprites
and which is pretty much our main
character but before we do that there
are a couple other things that I want to
teach you guys that are going to make
your game development experience a whole
lot easier so for now thank you guys for
watching this uh um you know little
video and I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
