Illustrator cs6 tutorial and we're still
in the typing section and today we're
gonna learn how to select type and that
might seem dumb but you can save
yourself a lot of stress and getting
pissed off by pretty much knowing how to
select your type correctly so let's go
ahead and we're gonna type a few things
first let's make some regular type and
then we'll do some vertical oh man I
have set to middle here as you can see
instead of a top or bottom so there we
go with that and then I want to make a
an area type let's go to here we go and
set that to nothing and then we'll set
this to something really go fast okay
that's good alright so
start out let's type in the area type
and click on the path and I'll start
typing that's okay that the stroke fell
down it's okay okay so the first one is
your selection tool now when you use a
selection tool it's gonna allow you to
click on either it's gonna allow you to
click on both the text and the text path
so pretty much it's selecting the
character and its object the direct
selection tool so if I click on this
text area you can see that the object
and the text is actually selected if I
use my direct selection tool I can
select either the text or the path so
that's pretty helpful and then I also
wanted to show you that you can select
certain types are certain parts of the
words are certain parts of your text so
if we go to our like our text type tool
here and I just want to grab this part
that says Ghul and I want to make a
really way smaller you can do that and
you can edit certain parts of your text
and that's easy enough so go ahead and
grab your text tool any text tool that
you're using and if you click and drag
you can select more text as much text as
you want this is in case you don't know
how to do this and that's how you do
that if you double click on it it's it's
going to just select the word if you
triple click it's gonna select the whole
entire paragraph which is all the lines
in the paragraph and if you want to
select everything you can just hit
select and then call go to all and I'll
select everything within where your
cursor is now if you
something selected like that all you
need to do is hold down control and then
click and it will deselect the text for
you while still allowing you to keep
your type tool on and not trying to type
anything else out I wanted to also show
you that you can take text from from
documents that you already have going on
so we'll open up this one and paste them
into let me control see I'm hitting ctrl
C so I can paste copy it oh I brought
that over on the wrong screen sorry I
just brought up this I just opened up a
text document in notepad and I'm going
to copy it and then I'm gonna go ahead
and click it's not when I do want to do
I wanted to click on my text object
maybe hit enter and then ctrl V to paste
it and it goes ahead and pastes know the
size was too big and it overflowed as
you can tell by this plus sign here but
you can just copy and paste the text if
you don't want to import or anything
like that then this that's a good way to
do it if you need to end up changing
your font type go ahead and grab your
text tool and select what you want to
change and go up here into type and
we've got our fonts here that we can
change out and they also have the
regular or they have the different
styles that you can use if you want to
and then you have a couple of recent
pots that you might have used here you
can change your size and pretty much for
size I just use this right here but for
my different fonts I like to use type
and then go to font because you can
actually see what you're picking is
really hard to remember all the
different fonts and after you just click
on this arrow down here you're going to
be able to go through the different
fonts so if I wanted to use this
obviously that's not a good one to pick
but here we go if I delete all this
other crap that I put in there you can
see that I have changed it to a new text
easily and that's pretty cool so that's
pretty much it that I just wanted to
show you about selecting the text and
being able to modify it a little bit and
it's just good to know this stuff so
that when you're selecting things and
you want to select just the tag so you
just want to select the object or
something like that you're not using the
wrong tools and it's not making you all
mad and you don't have to swear and
stuff like that so thanks a lot for
watching the video and give a thumbs up
if you liked it thanks a lot everybody
have a good day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
