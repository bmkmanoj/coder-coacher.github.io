and the first thing we're going to be
doing in this video is working on some
minor CSS classes just the classes to
style the dates the usernames the
subtitles and then we're going to be
working on the main layout of the
website how wide is our website what do
we want to appear on the left on the
right all that good stuff so the first
thing like i said is we're going to
style the little itty gritty details
just to make everything look pretty
before we get to the good stuff now
whenever we have a date to appear on the
website for example on this item was
listed on 316 or this item was listed 10
minutes ago we want those dates to be
orange in bold so let's go ahead and
change the color to orange which is CC
6600 and I actually like the make them
capital CC 6600 and we also want
font-weight bold just like that now
aside from dates we also need to style
offers whenever someone offers you a
trade their item for your item we want
that offer to be a certain color and
I'll show you guys what exactly we style
as offers later on push it out let me go
ahead and make the offers class offers
and I'm just going to make the color and
font way bold except the color it's
pretty much going to be the exact same
as dates except it's going to have a
different color so the color for this is
40 40 40 which gives you a nice well
you'll see later on obviously now the
next is user names now I don't want the
user names to be the exact same thing is
a link because although whenever you
click on someone's username you get
taken to their user profile I want these
to be a little bit more bold so you can
easily see when scanning a webpage that
the user names pop out so the user names
are going to first have a color and
let's just go ahead and copy this lazy
so user names first have a color of 006
699 in the font weight let's go ahead
bump this to 900 so aside from just bold
and normal what you can do is you can
set actual values and 900 is a really
good value it's somewhere in between
bold and normal now the reason I do this
is at first I made a bold and it looked
really weird and then I was like you
know what not as bold so you know that's
the little history of what i was doing
I'm just going to go ahead and shut up
now and style the next class which is
the subtitles so of course whenever you
make a listing you give it a title like
PlayStation 3 game on modern warfare or
whatever and the subtitle might be
something like only been played twice so
the subtitle for your listing we don't
want it blue we want it like a nice
subtle gray so color and the reason that
we don't want just to stand out in a
bold color is because that's what the
main titles jobs for it to stand out the
subtitle is just like additional
information so that's why we're going to
give it a nice soft gray which is 70 70
70 now that is basically all the classes
that we have to cover for right now I
thought we were going to have time and
actually we probably do have time when
the next tutorial what I'm going to be
doing is I'm going to be concentrating
only on the layout how why do we want
this website how big do we want the
section on the left hand side to be
exactly how we need to place things and
why we need to play some that way so
anyways for nothing guys for watching
don't forget subscribe and I'll see you
guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
