is show you guys how to apply gravity to
these objects so whenever we run this
these actually look like they're falling
to the ground and yeah a little more
like you would expect so the first thing
we need to do is we need to create an
instance of a UI dynamic animator class
and whenever we have this object that's
the object that allows you to apply
physics like animations to whatever
objects that you want so I'm just gonna
call mine animator and of course it's an
instance of UI dynamic animator looking
good all right though I am I getting air
alright so again whenever we initialize
this what we need to say is this the
animator that we just created it's equal
to UI dynamic animator and for did that
pop up all right throughout these
parameters in myself
for the reference view it's just this
class's view so what we're basically
saying is we want to apply physics like
like animations to this screen right
here
simple enough so now once we got that
taken care of we can go ahead and start
adding those behaviors now there are a
bunch of different ones that you can add
one of the most common ones is gravity
and that's the one I'm going to show you
guys but in the next tutorial I'll show
you guys like collision detection and
some other ones later on but for right
now we'll just say we'll just learn how
to use a grab deep so the first thing we
need to do is we need to set up a UI
gravity behavior and what this says is
okay you want to apply gravity like
behavior to which items while the items
and you can toss any objects you want in
here but apparently not it's not letting
me delete it alright so inside brackets
what objects are named green square
and Red Square so now it's saying okay
Green Square and a Red Square are going
to be affected whenever we have gravity
on a view simple enough
now before we just say okay run this
it's good to go
we need to kind of set up the gravity
because your computer your iPhone it's
just you know a bunch of electrons it
doesn't understand gravity the way that
we understand it because whenever we
like are just living life we know that
gravity is always pointing down towards
our feet and let's we're like hanging
upside down but your phone doesn't
really understand that so what you need
to do is you need to first give it a
direction and in other words you need to
make a vector that most of the time it's
going to point to the bottom of your
iPhone screen so I'll just say let
Direction equal CG vector and the
parameters for this are say zero zero
one point zero so again the first one is
the X direction which we're not going to
change it's not going to go left and
right at all and we'll put it one in the
Y direction so now this vector is gonna
be pointing down so that's all that does
so now if you need to call vector make
in there you go there you see the
parameters so it takes two floats the X
direction in the Y direction and if I
just copy this
paste that bad boy right in there all
right so now what we need to do is we
need to say okay on that gravity that
we're creating we want to set the
gravity direction equal to that vector
in that vector is called direction so
now the property that this is supposed
to point is down so I know it's kind of
weird and you think all right it's
probably was like that by default but
you have to do it manually manually kind
of stupid but whatever so now we have
our gravity set up the only other thing
that we need to do is we need to say
this animator which is responsible for
animating things on your screen we're
gonna add that gravity behavior to it
because check it out
we built the gravity and we built the
animator but we didn't link them up yet
so one line of code animator add
behavior what behavior will that gravity
that we just built and since the Green
Square in the Red Square we said are
going to be affected by gravity and this
view has gravity check out what happens
whenever you run it boom falls down now
you're like okay where did they go like
down here somewhere
well of course what we did is we just
made gravity and it said point down but
we didn't add any collision detection so
in the next story I'm gonna be showing
you guys how to say okay we run this one
more time treat this as the bottom of
the screen so whenever they hit it they
don't go right through - I don't know
they're probably like 10 feet away from
my iMac right now so that's what we're
gonna do
learn how to use collision detection to
get the boundaries of the screen it's
gonna be awesome
see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
