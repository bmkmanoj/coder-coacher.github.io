talk to you about responsive and non
responsive images and the difference
between the two and also how to embed
responsive videos so they don't look
horrible on your website now before we
get to responsive and non responsive I'm
just going to show you guys some really
basic image classes is some styling that
you can do with them and the first one
is image and I have two images that I
imported here is one called ladies JPEG
and here's another one
this is me when I was uh like in third
grade or something like those chompers
right there those are some beautiful oh
that's exactly what I look like now by
the way I did not change one fit all
right so the source of this first image
let's go ahead and use that teeth one
teeth dot jpg and that's in my images
directory teeth JPEG what a name alright
so let's say that we wanted to round the
corners of this well there is a built-in
class and this is called image rounded
now whenever you stick these on a
website let's say a social networking
website you usually want to give it a
set width and height so they don't
appear at weird proportions now all the
images on my social network are 230 by
230 so actually let me just go ahead and
make both of these at once so this is
going to make an image that's 230 wide
by 230 tall and the corners are going to
be slightly rounded now for some reason
it's the trend to have images that are
completely circle now especially profile
images so in order to get that effect
use the class image circle so if I run
this check it out so this is the first
one with slightly rounded corners and
you see these circular ones a lot on you
know like I said a bunch of different
social networks Google+ is doing it I
really like just plain old square images
but you know whatever floats your boat
there you go now another thing I want to
mention is what is the difference
between a responsive and a
non-responsive image now let me go ahead
and just delete these completely all
right so for this let me go ahead and
use just ladies JPEG and let's just go
ahead and make the responsive one first
so anytime you want your image to be
responsive use a class image responsive
now what this is going to do is whenever
you shrink your screen or you're just
looking at on a small screen and the
image is wider than the screen then it's
going to shrink with it kind of
confusing but it's easy to see what's
going on whenever I put a non responsive
image and you just do that by getting
rid of this class so this is a bootstrap
class that makes your images responsive
and this is just you know a plain old
image so now let me run this and I'll
show you guys so at first alright not
that big a deal nothing's really
different but look what happens whenever
I start to shrink this and this is going
to resemble smaller screen like a tablet
or a phone so I'm shrinking it and as
you can see the top one that's
responsive it's shrinking along with the
device so on a phone or tablet this
would still look great now down here
look what happens the image just gets
cut off because if it's like hey I'm
longer than the screen don't care you
can just chop half me off I mean oops
embarrassing so you clearly always want
to use responsive images whenever you
are working with bootstrap unless you
know you want to go with that half of
your image cut off effect which no one
ever does now the last thing I want to
do is show you guys how to make videos
responsive and I already have this one
pulled up so grab any video on YouTube
and get the code so if you look at V
equals all of the after it is the video
code it's pretty much the ID for the
video and I'll show you how to make
videos responsive
now the first thing you need to do is
you need to make a div and the dips
class is going to be embed responsive
and embed responsive sixteen by nine now
this right here is just going to say
whatever item I stick in here give it
the proportions of sixteen by nine and
that's a standard videos proportion now
inside here is saying okay what do you
want to embed well we're just going to
embed this as an iframe and the
parameters for this is class and this is
dependent on what you're trying to embed
but I happen to know that for YouTube
videos the one I love the most is embed
responsive item and the source we just
put the URL of the embedded video so
http:www.youtube.com/watch v me i looks
good enough don't need to clean up but
now if you run this check it out alright
so since this is responsive whenever
your screen is wide it's going to take
up the full width of the screen so if we
start to shrink this instead of just
getting cut off since this is I believe
this videos 1920 by 1080 which is my
entire computer screen look what happens
so this is excellent no matter how big
your screen is especially recommended
for tablets and phones because look at
that nothing's getting cut off you can
play it beautiful so that is how you use
images responsive images different image
styles and also how to embed a
responsive videos and I know that you
know this looks a little bit goofy with
all the different repetitive classes and
better responsive embed response sixteen
by nine is better uh but hey you gotta
yell to people who made bootstrap not me
so anyways think guys for watching see
you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
