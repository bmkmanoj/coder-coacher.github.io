another amazing tutorial and this one is
going to be about inheritance I actually
forgot to teach you guys a little
something about inheritance and that's
called overriding methods not overloaded
methods those two can kind of confusing
but anyways an overriding method is
pretty much this whenever you build a
method in the superclass and then you
inherit it from a subclass you can't
delete any of the methods so what
happens if you have a method that you
don't want or a method that you want to
change a little bit well since you can't
delete it or get rid of it the best
thing that you can do is change what you
want it to do so that's what I'm gonna
be doing in this story so go ahead and
go ahead and click add new file and I
can't see it but you guys don't have to
do it and click Next and I'm gonna name
this file mom and it's also going to
create a mom header so let's go ahead
and delete all this and go ahead and
again we're working in mom H the mom
header right now and let's see change
this the foundation wow I totally messed
that up foundation in foundation just
like that hate how it does that so let's
see interface mom let's go ahead and add
one variable here it won't make it int
num1 and we'll just say that this number
is gonna be like the age or something
doesn't really matter for purpose of
this tutorial and we'll add one method
that we're gonna override later set num1
so we're building a really simple class
here all we have is the class mom that
has a number which is gonna represent
her age and we're gonna be able to set
that number via a method so let's go
ahead and copy this and in mom m you see
i already imported mom that h for us so
the only thing we need to do is build
the body to that method so in order to
do that all we have to do is take that
number one and set it equal to something
like 70 I know it's old but you know
it's necessary I'm just kidding it's a
anyways go and your since we're done
with that mom class we just want to go
ahead and add a new file that looks good
next and you can name this uh whatever
your name is I'm just gonna name my son
so it's pretty clear to see what is
inheriting from what so let me just
click on source all right so now in your
son header what do you want to do well
the first thing that we want to do is we
want to import from mom eh and why
because we don't need to uh well we're
not inheriting right from nsobject we
are actually inheriting for mom just
like that and this there we go
I mean we don't need any variables any
variables because by default we already
have all the mom variables which is
number one so what we're gonna do is
just gonna be building two more methods
right here and we're gonna be building a
method called void set num wait a minute
actually that's set num1 and you're like
hold on a minute we already have a
setting on one and mom H so why would
you build another method called set num1
and son hold on if you already have a
method and you build it again what
happens well since you can't take away
ever setting on one once you inherited
it for mom what we want to do is we want
to rebuild this method build it again
but this time we're not going to do what
we did in the first time we're not going
to set equal to 70 when we build it
again we're gonna set equal to something
else so let's just go ahead and while I
was going to add a comment but we don't
really need to so after this we want to
add another method that's just gonna
void and print number looks good enough
so now let's copy these and in our get
rid of this see if I need to import son
H I already did it for me so now in our
implementation remember this is our new
and improved
implementation for set number one so by
default it was it like 75 or 99 or 70 or
something I can't remember something
high but now we want to take the number
one and reset it to 14 and now to print
out the number something nice and simple
make sure I don't have any errors so
again anyways like I said whenever you
override a method what you do is before
you inherited this method called set
number one we don't even have to build
this at all but well since we needed to
change it you need to recreate a method
of the same name and it must have the
same return type is void and the same
number of arguments which is zero so
pretty much this header needs to be the
exact same is the one that was his mom H
it just does something else in the body
so now again like I was saying let's
just go ahead and print out this number
using NS log and let's just put
something simple like the number is
percent I and C let's just go ahead and
put num1 so it's going to take that
variable whatever it is and it's going
to print out the number is that so now
in your main program I'll just go ahead
and we need to import some header to get
all that information since we're going
to be building some objects so son I'm
just going to name my object s and set
it equal to just type all this stuff out
son
Alec get some space for it
and now we can go ahead begin building
some methods so s which is the Sun
object set num1 and this is either going
to set it equal to let's see what i have
70 or 14 we'll see in a little bit wow I
definitely must that up didn't I that
could've been in bed it could've been
real bad and see I trying to think of s
that what's called print number I think
that's what it was called
we'll see in a little bit and once we're
done with this just go s release so
let's go ahead and run this and let me
see if a get in airs and if I don't I'll
talk you guys through this program one
last time all right it says the number
is 14 so it uses some methods instead of
the mom's method so what happened here
don't forget we have a mom class this is
the main superclass we also have a son
class now this son class inherited all
the methods and variables from the mom
class but what it did is when inherited
this method right here it kind of
rewrote the method to use it how it
wanted to use it so the mom by default
set the number 17 but when the son
inherited the method it says alright I'm
changing this up right away I'm actually
gonna use this same method but I'm gonna
set the number 214 instead so whenever
you called the method right here through
son even though it inherited it that the
number was 70 it changed it and turning
the number into 14 and that is why it
prints out 14 so that's what overriding
a method does it pretty much says all
right even though you can't remove the
methods you inherit you can change how
they act so I mean that's pretty much
the basics of this and in order to make
an over a method override it you must
create a method with the exact same name
must have the exact same return type
which was void right here and it must
have the same number of arguments so
that if this had an argument passed in
but it would be a totally different
method so that is the beauty of kind of
overriding if you don't understand then
uh I know it can be kind of confusing
but if you have any questions then just
leave me a comment in my forum I'll post
the link below and also I'm gonna be
taking all this source code thing we
talked a lot of source code this
tutorial and I'm gonna be posting it in
my forum link below once again so thank
you guys for watching don't forget to
