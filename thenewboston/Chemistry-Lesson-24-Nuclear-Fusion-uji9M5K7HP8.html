twenty something tutorial and don't even
know myself but anyways in this lesson
I'm going to be talking to you guys
about nuclear fusion now in the last
tutorial we talked about nuclear fission
which is basically taking a nucleus of
something in breaking it apart into two
or more pieces well in this tutorial
nuclear fusion
as you'll learn is just the opposite we
take two or more pieces and combine them
or fuse them together hence the word
fusion into a bigger heavier nucleus now
actually nuclear fusion produces energy
completely in a different way than
nuclear fission so we'll talk about that
later on
but first let me go ahead and show you
an example of exactly what I'm talking
about now here is what scientists are
working on right now they're trying to
take two different elements which are
both versions of hydrogen these red ones
are protons and these white ones are
neutrons so again this um version of
hydrogen is called deuterium it has one
proton one Neutron this one is called
tritium it has one proton and two
neutrons and what they can do is they
can fuse them together to form a helium
now a helium in this case has two
neutrons and two protons and also
creates an excess Neutron so you're
saying okay I can see that fusion is
basically taking two lighter nuclei and
fusing them together into one heavy
nucleus and also you have this excess
Neutron which doesn't really matter for
now so how on earth can this process
create energy well it gets kind of
different it doesn't have to do with
kinetic energy in gamma radiation it
creates an entirely different way than
fission so pay attention so you know
when I talked about that glue I called
it the nuclear glue that held together
the protons in the neutrons in the
nucleus
well that nuclear glue is more commonly
called the strong force now whenever you
have a nuclear fusion that takes place
in this case basically it takes less
force to hold the heavier nucleus
together then the
- lighter nuclei now the excess energy
gets released and that's the energy that
we capture on now let me go ahead and
explain it like this well I'll go ahead
and say this first so there is some
amount of strong force that's holding
this proton with these neutrons and also
this proton in this Neutron together now
there's also a certain amount with
strong force needed to hold all this
crap together and there's no force
needed to hold this Neutron together
because it's just one Neutron you don't
need to hold it together with anything
so let me go ahead and throw some fake
numbers at you because the numbers
themselves actually don't matter that
much but just to demonstrate my pretty
much my example I'm just going to go
ahead and make up some numbers here so
say a strong force of 20 was needed to
hold this together and say a strong
force of 10 was needed to hold this
together so if we add up 20 plus 10 we
get 30 so you need an entire force of 30
to hold together deuterium and tritium
now whenever you fuse those elements
together you get this helium which is
two protons and two neutrons in the
force it takes to hold together helium
let's just say it's 15 so we have an
entire force of 15 needed to hold this
side together because you don't need any
energy to hold a neutron together it
takes zero is just floating there so
this entire side right here takes 30 20
plus 10 and this entire side right here
only takes 15 so where did that excess
energy go well it gets released and
that's the energy that we can capture so
remember
basically it takes less force to hold
the heavier nucleus together and the
excess energy is that's the energy that
we can capture and hopefully fuel our
vehicles and heat our homes and use in
you know industries and all that good
stuff so that's what scientists are
trying to do right now so saying okay
they have fission why don't they just
stick with that it seems like a pretty
cool way to you know make energy well
first of all they want to use fusion
because in this case where you have two
hydrogen atoms
hydrogen is basically unlimited on earth
we got a whole bunch of it just look at
the ocean it's basically unlimited and
also if we remember from fission it
produces harmful byproducts it pretty
much takes uranium and splits them into
two radioactive elements that also give
off harmful radiations and we don't want
that all this produces is helium which
is awesome in a neutron that Neutron
isn't going to hurt anybody now aside
from that uranium and plutonium are also
very limited on earth we're going to run
out probably in a hundred years and
aside from being limited the biggest
concern is that they produce a lot of
radioactive waste like I said so that's
why fusion is a much more better I want
to say it's a better way to do things
however it's a lot more difficult
none of the nuclear plants right now use
fusion they only use that in a bomb and
that's because the hydrogen bomb that
they were making they didn't like need
to control it at all they just pretty
much let this thing explode and it's
like so much more powerful than a
regular fission bomb but whenever we use
it in power plants so we need to control
it we need to say okay we're not just
going to explode it randomly we need to
actually release this energy in a
calculated way and it takes very high
temperatures it takes time as issue and
also containing the elements so again
Fusion is the better way but right now
it's just kind of in the in the testing
stages let me say so that's where we're
looking forward to probably in the next
20 years it's going to become the main
source of energy or at least that's what
they tell me so anyways thank you guys
for watching hopefully you'll understand
fusion a little bit better now so yeah I
will see you in the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
