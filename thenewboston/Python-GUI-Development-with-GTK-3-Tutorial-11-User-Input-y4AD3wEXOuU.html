this video I'm going to show you how to
use entries now an entry is just an
input area if you guys are familiar with
HTML basically a little section that the
user can type something in and then you
can get the value of it so if you're
ever making a form or they have to sign
up for something then this is going to
be perfect and in this little example
I'm just gonna make a quick little login
form so let's say we're making some kind
of messenger app and the user has to log
in with a username and password
so I'll write Messenger 2.0 and not only
am I going to show you how to actually
make the elements but I'll show you guys
how to get the value from it and I'm
just gonna print it out on the screen
but you would usually want to do
something like make sure their username
exists in the database and log them in
whatever you want to do so who's gonna
hit self sets border width equal to ten
and if you don't do this then all the
form little input areas are gonna be
bunched together against the side it's
gonna look kind of goofy
so after this self sets size request the
default size of the window just can be
like 200 by 100 we don't need too big
it's just going to be a little area for
these are name and password so you know
not that much to this program so what
I'm gonna do is if I just start throwing
everything in here by default its gonna
appear to the side however with most
forms all of the form elements appear on
top of each other so that's what I want
to take care of right now I want to
change the layout to a V box sets is
equal to g TK box orientation equals TK
orientation
vertical and I just said spacing equal
to let's do eight all right so as we
stack convertible vertically there's
gonna be eight pixels between each one
if it looks a little too big then we can
tighten it up a little bit but I don't
know I think I look alright so self add
this layout we're adding it to the main
window right there so myself tip it more
room and I'll just do the username area
first so for the username I'm just gonna
make a variable called username self
username and I'm gonna set this equal to
gtk an entry class so an entry remember
this is pretty much the input area
that's what they call it now you can go
ahead and add default text to it and
what you probably should do if you're
making these is you should probably add
a label on the left-hand side and then
the input area on the right I mean
that's kind of how every form looks on
the internet or you know whenever you're
signing up for you know like a username
for Skype or something but for this I'm
just gonna add a little indicator inside
it just to save some time so for
username I'm just gonna set text and use
your name now if they already logged in
before then we can do is you can
actually fill in their user name form so
you know whenever you go to like website
and it's like save my username then if
they click that then you can pop it in
their forum but for now I'm just doing
this because I'm lazy alright so we made
the input area and now we just need to
add it to the layout so ad self username
true true
zero all right looking good mate and now
actually I can go ahead and do this if I
want all right so this is what I'm
talking about
of course this layout is not complete
yet but you guys can understand what I'm
talking about
and so you see when I said that I'm just
gonna throw everything in here by
default usually what you want to do is
you want to take this make it a label
and put it on the left-hand side and
then they can you know just fill in
their name right there but I'm just
gonna stick it all in there because I'm
lazy and another thing I want to show
you guys how to do is how to make one
with a password now with the password
fields they're gonna be a little bit but
different because remember whenever you
have a password field you have all of
those hidden areas now I actually just
like the the Asterix like keyboard right
now but usually you would want to do it
form so show you guys had to kind of had
it have hidden text so so fast very
equal to GT k entry and whatever I'll
just do about this so self password set
text and I'll just set this equal to
password
so usually you'd want to just make this
blank but I just want to demonstrate
that it is indeed you know hidden from
other users that may be looking on so
anytime you want to make password text
it's actually the visibility properties
so self password set visibility now if
it's visible then it just looks like
plain text but if you set this to false
then it's gonna be covered up like those
little asterisks --is so like that so it
doesn't mean like invisible it just
means like kind of a secure I guess that
would probably be a better word for it
so now we just need to add this to the
layout still and boom roasted oh we are
good go now the last thing you probably
want to do is just make some kind of
sign-in button or a login button
or submit form whatever but I'm just
gonna make myself button and just set
this equal to button and I'm not gonna
you know explain this because I already
did in like the second tutorial and
whatever text you want to appear on your
button submit sign in whatever so so
button connect and in here we want to
connect the clicked signal to whatever
function we decide to make so I'll just
make a real quick function that prints
out the values of whatever these are
typed in and we'll just name that sign
in so we'll do that in just a second but
for now we need to add this to the
layout
and before we test this layout let's go
ahead and make this sign-in function or
else it's not going to know where we're
trying to connect the two so define
sign-in and remember we passing itself
which is pretty much the instance of the
class in widgets now check this out
anytime you want to get the value of a
field they typed in so if they typed in
Bucky for a username any time you want
to get the value of that then you just
write self in the name of the field
which is in this case username and then
remember from like the second tutorial
there are getters and setters now by
default we set the text to username but
they probably change that to their
actual username so get text and remember
this doesn't take any parameters because
you don't know what it is yet it's just
whatever they typed in so it could be
Bucky could be the new Boston could be
tuned ahead 87 whatever so I'm just
gonna print out whatever they typed in
and I'm also gonna print out their
password so again you'd usually want to
do something like check it in the
database but I'm just gonna print it out
for simplicity and check this out so we
gave a default username and password
just because we were lazy but usually
the user would type in something like
Bucky and their password can be some
super secret password and now whenever
they hit sign in hopefully it should
print out right there so there's my
username and there is my password so
again one last time the reason that this
work is because we created two fields
and we populated them with default text
even though we you know usually don't
want to do that and after that we made a
button and we connected the clicked
functionality to this method so whenever
they click Sign In it called this
function so hop down to this function
and all this did is it said all right
I'm gonna print out whatever value you
typed for a username
and also I'm going to print out whatever
you typed in for the password so that's
the basics of how to make forms and
there are some other properties that you
can add aside from you know just visible
and nots but we're gonna be going over
some more of those as we need them but
for now thing guys rushing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
