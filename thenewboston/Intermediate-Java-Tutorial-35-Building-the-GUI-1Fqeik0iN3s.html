intermediate Java tutorial and now that
we did all the coding of address bar
what we can do now is just go ahead and
add it on the screen so add address to
us as though address bar and where do
you want to lay it we'll just keep this
simple border layout north so pretty
much now our address bar is appearing at
the top of the screen you can put it at
the bottom if you want but you know
might as well keep things standardized
so now like I said our GUI is going to
have two main parts the address bar
which is where the user types the URL
that they want to go to and also the
main display which is the big area the
main area where the webpage the pictures
the text all gets displayed so we
already made a variable for this called
display as a J editor pane so let's go
ahead and actually create it right now
so display equals new J editor pane
doesn't take any extra information now
what I want to do is actually call a
method called display set editable false
now set editable is a method which
pretty much asked do you want to be able
to edit the contents inside the J editor
pane now the reason that you would ever
have this is true is if you're making a
program like a notepad or Microsoft Word
or something something that you would
need to change the contents of then you
would want to set this is true but
typically whenever you go to a browser
like looking at YouTube or something you
can't just change the titles of people's
videos so that's why you want to set
that equal to false so you can't change
the crap inside only view it so after
this what I want to do is take this
display which is the main window and I
want to add a hyperlink listener now
what a hyperlink listener is going to do
is it's going to sit on every link that
gets displayed because you know whenever
you go to a website there's a bunch of
different links usually on every single
website so what this is going to do
is it's going to sit on the links and
wait for you to click a link now once
you click a link it's going to grab the
URL that that link points to and it's
going to pass in to load crap so
basically remember load crap method is
responsible for going reading HTML files
and displaying them on the screen so if
you want to go to a web so sorry if you
want to go to a website you can do one
of two things
you can manually type it into the
address bar or you can go ahead and
click on a link which is going to go
ahead and grab the URL and it just saves
you from typing in you know a link I
mean typing in the URL when you could
just easily click a link so that's what
add hyperlink listener does so well
let's go ahead and not you know work on
all the good stuff so new hyperlink
listener is our class make sure I got
everything typed in I need to alright
new hyperlink listener is our class and
the method that gets called is hyper
link update so public void you know I
keep wanting to type in uppercase L for
hyperlink I keep forgetting ins to work
hyperlink update and this gets passed in
hyperlink event event so there you go so
first of all let me explain this why is
it called hyper link update instead of
you know um hyperlink click well the
reason that you have hyper link update
is because this method is called
whenever a hyper link event happens so
basically whenever an event happens on
your link so you may be thinking okay
only one thing can happen on my link
right either you click it or you don't
if you click it it's an event if you
don't click it then nothing happened
well that's actually not true and if
you're familiar with something like
JavaScript this may be a little more
familiar to you
see your computer is also going to
recognize a couple more events
the first one is when you roll over an
event so check this out this is actually
pretend this is a link right here I'm
not clicking anything but just when I
roll over it you see how this little
documentation pops up that's an event as
well so I think that whenever you roll
over it the event is called enter and
whenever you roll away from it then the
event is called exited and of course you
can just go ahead and click it and you
know that would be going to the website
so remember pretty much the sum all that
up there are not only one hyperlink
event which is clicked but there are
also three rolling over it rolling away
from it or clicking it now those on
aren't the technical terms and I'll tell
you guys as technical terms in a little
bit but I just want to explain that
there are more hyperlink events than you
guys probably think so what we need to
do now is we really don't care if they
roll over a link or roll away from it
we're only concerned with if they click
the link itself because we only want to
go to the new webpage if they click a
link so the first thing we need to do is
determine what they did to that link so
in order to do that if events get type
and this this pretty much returns the
different types of events you can have
such as click which is called activated
rollover which is called entered in roll
away from which is called exited so okay
we want to say okay this is equal to
hyperlink
this is a pain to type and there we go I
was waiting for something to pop up it's
like a little satisfaction knows that
you type something around I mean type
something right okay one second so if
the event or the type of event that
pretty much the user did was equal to
activated which pretty much means okay
did they click the link then that's the
only thing I'm concerned with then what
I want to do is of course use that load
crap method that we didn't create yet to
go to whatever location that hyperlink
is pointing to so of course load crap is
going to take a string as we learned in
the last tutorial so in order to well
this is probably going to be easier if I
type this out the event is rolling over
the link in order to get the URL of the
link get URL now this pretty much
returns a URL which if you can see is
actually a URL object so you know we
already learned about URL objects
whenever we made the very first
networking app but what we want to do is
we actually want to convert this to a
string so in order to convert a URL
object to a string object use the method
to string okay looks easy enough so why
am I getting an error here oh I get
event type so there we go so basically
to summarize one last time what we did
in this tutorial and I'll add everything
to the screen the next tutorial well we
worked on the main brains for the
display so the display was a J editor
pane you couldn't edit edit it so what
we did was we put a listener that sits
on top every single sits on top of every
single link whenever it gets displayed
and it waits for you to click one of
those links whenever you click one of
those links which is called activated
that's the event name what it's going to
do is it's going to grab the URL from
that link convert it to a string in
pass it into this load crap method and
that's the last method that we're going
to program in the next video so once you
know it gets passed in the load crap
then it's going to go to the new URL
whatever you clicked on and display that
webpage on the screen so in the next
tutorial what we need to do is actually
display or add this to the GUI and then
work on the load crap method which is
actually incredibly easy
so anyways think guys for watching don't
forget subscribe and I will see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
