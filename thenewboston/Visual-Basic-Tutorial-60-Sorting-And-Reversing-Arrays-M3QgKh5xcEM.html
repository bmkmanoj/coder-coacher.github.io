slash on live gamer for the new Boston
and in this tutorial we're going to be
talking about sorting arrays and
reversing arrays now if you remember in
the last tutorial we talked about
creating an array and using a normal for
loop to add that array to a list box now
in this tutorial we're going to go ahead
and start off by creating two new
buttons so we will add button 1 and
button 2 then we can go ahead and close
out of our toolbox we'll make these
buttons a little bit bigger so they'll
fit in to our program and we will set
the name of button 1 to button sort
array and we will set the name of button
2 to button reverse so now what we're
going to do is we are going to come down
here and set the text to sort array and
then for this one we'll type reverse
array so we'll go ahead and create
events for each one of these and under
sort what we're going to do is we're
going to clear the list just in case
there's anything already up there and
then what we're going to do is we are
going to sort our array so let's go
ahead and we will take this right here
we will press ctrl X to cut it and now
what we need to do is make it accessible
by all of the subs inside of this class
so we will just paste it right there and
instead of using dim when we will type
private so now this array can be
accessed inside of button sort array so
now what we're going to do is we're
going to type array dot and you can see
there's a whole bunch of stuff that you
can use so what we're going to do is
we're going to choose sort now it says
source the elements an entire one
dimensional array
systems are raising the system not high
comparable implementation of each
element of the system array so basically
what this does is it sort of
alphabetically so we will just sort
string classes and now we will come up
here and here is our for loop that adds
every item to the list box so we'll just
copy that and paste it down here now if
you didn't watch the last tutorial
basically what this does is we got a for
loop we have a value num as integer and
as integer is not needed because the
default for for loops is integer and
it's equal to zero and it goes to a
string classes length minus 1 and since
the length is 6 and it only goes from 0
to 5 we will get an out-of-balance
error if we do that so all we do is we
take minus 1 so it goes 0 to 5 and it
still covers all 6 of those and then
when we do list arrays dot Adams dot and
string classes at the index of num so it
starts at 1 and it goes all the way to 5
so now we can do the same thing for this
but instead of sorting the array we can
reverse it so we can type array dot
reverse and now what we're going to do
is we're going to do string classes
and so if we go ahead and take this for
loop again copy it and paste it you can
see that it will print everything out
now one thing you have to keep in mind
is that when you do this if you click
this button it's going to sort the array
and it's not going to go back to the way
it used to be and when this one reverses
it it's not going to go back to the way
it used to be so if we go ahead and
click add array elements we've got all
of our array elements now if we reverse
the rate we get web-design Spanish
chemistry English history and now if we
click it one more time it sets it back
to normal and now if we sort the array
it gives it to us in alphabetical order
so we've got CA CH we got e HSN W and
now if we reverse it we get web-design
Spanish history English chemistry and
calculus which is a reverse alphabetical
order and now if we look at array
elements what this does is it resets all
the values of add array elements by
assigning them and it changes it back to
the way it used to be now this is a
pretty simple tutorial teaching you how
to sort and reverse arrays now what you
can also do is just play around with
this and type array dot and look at each
one of these and read the description
and see what you can do with that and
then once you feel satisfied with what
you've learned and you know you're not
going to forget what I've taught you in
this maybe you've learned something new
from doing it yourself go ahead and move
on to the next tutorial and thanks for
