tutorial that I'm making for the New
Boston and mr. Torrio I'm really showing
you I'd have a splash screen through
your application and a splash screen is
basically just the form or screen or
whatever you want to call it that will
load for your actual application does so
this could tell the user that settings
are being written in or the applications
loading or something like that and
typically it has like the icon of your
application and I don't know information
about your application alright so the
first thing that we're going to want to
do is add an actual form for our splash
screen so it's going to go up the
project and add windows form then we're
just going to make sure when those form
is selected and I'm just going to rename
it to splash screen but you can call it
anything you like and once I have the
name you want let's go ahead and add all
right so here's our splash screen form
and the person that we're going to want
to do is make it so there's no border at
all around this so that we can only have
like an image on it or text or something
like that so just select your form go
over to the properties panel and change
the form border style to none and that
just basically takes away everything
because all we're going to be having in
this form is a picture box now you can
add like obviously like a status label
or something like that but we're not
gonna get into that in this tutorial so
I'm just going to have a picture box
with information about my application in
it and I just made something for the
paint because it's obviously an actual
application but you're typically going
to want to have information about your
application what's going on at the
moment and why this faded all right
so once you have your picture box all
positioned and stuff just go ahead and
right click on your form and click the
view code so what we're going to want to
do is basically have this form show for
two seconds and then Vince is formally
done showing we're going to want to load
up for awhile so with our form selected
just go over to the event and go over to
show and then just double click on that
and this big event will basically occur
when you when the form is shown on your
screen so what we're gonna want to do
right here just create a new timer up
here I just call it t and then we're
gonna set t go to a new timer
we're gonna set the interval or 200
milliseconds or two seconds so that
after these 200 milliseconds or two
seconds are up we're going to show the
actual form and then we're just going to
start the timer so that the timer will
actually begin and then following that
we're going to want to create a new
event handler for learning timer ticks
so that we can have form show when the
timer ticks all right so now is seen at
the timer ticks we just want it to stop
because we only want one form to be
shown then following that we're going to
I just want to create a new form one
I'll just call it up and set it equal
giving a new form 1 and then we're just
going to want to show our form one and
then we're going to want to hide this
splash screen forms or to say to this
right and this just refers to this class
right here so it's going to be hiding at
all all right so we can't debug yet
because currently the form that will
load first is this form one area we want
this splash being a little person so
we're gonna have to go over to the
program class or just go over your
staging Explorer and select the program
class and we're not going to run around
run a new form one we're going to run a
new a splash screen so this will be V
form that will load that start up all
right and I'm just gonna dock his
picture box in the parent container on
this form one I'm you should probably
make a splash we got this alright and
the last thing that we're going to want
to do is when this closes we're going to
want to have it do application exit that
just closed is closed when you close the
current form and song we want to do
application exits so that will
sit out of both the splash screen and
this form line even though we can't see
the splash screen form it'll still be
there we're still gonna have to exit out
of it
so the select your form and go down to
form clothes and then we're just gonna
do an application dot exit and that was
this basically close everything every
every form and everything to do with
your application it'll just exit out of
it all all right so now when you bug
here we should see our splash screen yep
this is Adam and then after two seconds
our form loads and now let me exit out
our applications your clothes yep
perfect so that's pretty much it for
this tutorial on setting up a splash
screen so see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
