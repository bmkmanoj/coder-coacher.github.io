video what I'm going to do is I'm going
to teach you guys how to get input from
the user how to have the user type in
things on their keyboard and get that
information and use it in your computer
program it's going to be pretty sweet so
let's just go ahead and make a simple
program just so they have something to
type in I'll have them like typing their
name and the name of like their crush
and obey hey you're going to get married
to this person it'll be pretty cool so
let's go ahead and we've got my mouse in
the right place we'll just go ahead and
make a couple strings first because of
course they're going to be storing their
name and a string so I'll just put that
as a first name array and we'll give
them 20 characters to work with that'll
be long enough unless anyone has a real
long name um another thing is crush
which is going to be the name of their
crush mine is Rachel McAdams kind of get
married and the last one is int number
of babies will say how many babies are
they going to have now the reason I want
to have a different data type is because
you actually have to treat this a little
bit differently and I'll show you that
later on so basically the first thing we
want to do before they type something is
we always want to give them a prompt so
that way it's like hey type your name on
the screen if we just have a cursor
blinking on the screen they're not going
to know um you know my supposed to type
in a number my name what the heck so
let's just go ahead and add a simple
printf and we'll say something like I
don't know what is your name and might
as well pump that on a new line now the
function to allow the user to input
information is scan F now this is
actually really similar to printf in a
lot of ways so you guys probably going
to like it so the first parameter it
takes is of course a placeholder which
they are going to fill with whatever is
uh whatever they type into the keyboard
so since they're going to be typing a
name we need % s because that's going to
be a string so the next piece of
information is
whenever we get this input what variable
do you want to store it in well the
first thing they type in the string is
going to be their name so we're going to
store in first name right there so
basically like I said whenever this line
runs it's pretty much going to be a
blinking line on the screen and whenever
they type in something like Bucky and
hit enter it says okay now store the
string Bucky and first name so then we
can just print it out and use it as a
normal variable just like you know we've
done for less like doesn't stores or
whatever so I she can copy this because
I'm lazy and the second question is how
we going to say but who are you going to
marry and of course for this one you
want to store in the crush array it
sounds like like want to smash something
but basically it's going to do the same
thing and the last one and the reason I
needed int is this actually going to use
well we can actually copy all this so
for the last question we'll just be like
how many kids will you have now of
course since they're going to be
entering a number we don't want to store
that as a string we want to store that
as a percent d for integer and for crush
of course change that the number of
babies because that's the variable now
one thing that you need to pay attention
to is this right before number of babies
right before the end go ahead and hit
the ampersand the symbol above the 7 on
your keyboard and you guys are going to
understand exactly what the symbol is
when we talk about pointers later on but
for now just remember this a very
general rule you need to use that
ampersand symbol between every or excuse
me before every single variable except
arrays arrays have a pretty much up
built in ampersand it's I know I didn't
talk to you guys about pointers yet but
that symbols already built into an array
more
us so anytime you use a flow on a
character and an integer you always want
to put ampersand right before the
variable name or else it won't work your
program or crash if you don't believe me
try it out so now that they enter
definitely don't want to do that all
right so now we have all the information
stored inside these variables so let's
just go ahead and print something out on
the screen so printf and this will just
verify that you know we have everything
in there correctly so what we will say
like a percent s and percent s are in a
love and we'll have % D babies and of
course this will fill with the first
name and then the name of your crush and
this is number of babies so hopefully if
we didn't forget a semicolons or
anything we can run this and check it
out and I want to note one other thing
before we learn this tutorial and how to
use a scanf function our program
basically ran all at once and then said
okay return zero could go however
whenever we use scanf what's going to
happen is our program is running a line
by line from the top down so it's going
to say printf what's your name and
that's what you see right here but when
it gets to scanf it pretty much pauses
your program and it waits to continue it
until um you typed in something so this
isn't only a place that allow the user
to type in it's basically pausing your
program and waiting for you to hit enter
to tell it to continue so what is your
name I'll hit Bucky hit enter and also
another thing I want to point out is my
crush is rachel mcadams however whenever
you use a space with scanf it thinks
that it's the end of the string so never
use spaces just go ahead and type in one
word Rachel if you want to UM like make
a program to have a first name and last
name then you're going to need another
variable so you would put something like
crush first name crush the last name but
for the simple simple program the whole
can't talk that's what we're doing
so Rachel hit enter now Rachel is stored
in crush and how many kids will you have
I'll just put you know something small
like 53 and hit enter so now it says
Bucky and Rachel are in love she does
love me and we'll have 53 babies or more
probably more so hopefully you guys
understand how to use scanf again it's
really similar to printf this is how to
pretty much give information to the user
by displaying on the screen and this is
how to get information from the user and
also remember this use the little
ampersand sign before every single
variable except when you use an arrays
you don't need it so well that's it for
this tutorial
thank you guys for watching and I'll see
you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
