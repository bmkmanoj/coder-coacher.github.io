fourth networking tutorial and in this
surah I'm going to be teaching you guys
about something called the OSI model
now this is the OSI model and if you're
wondering what this is is pretty much a
model to help standardize networking so
before uh in the old dinosaur days when
networking just began they didn't really
have a lot of standards
I mean aa standards in communication
between different nodes itself would be
like chaos such as like companies like
IBM would make a computer and it
wouldn't be able to connect with like a
Macintosh computer or anything like that
so in order to broaden the range of like
stuff like the internet and stuff they
had to come up with something called an
OSI model and this stands for open
systems interconnection I'm never going
to be saying that again because everyone
always says OSI model but just so you
guys know so what this pretty much did
was allow different companies nodes and
stuff to talk with different other
companies their devices and just broaden
the range of communication for everyone
so this model is actually useful and you
need to know it because it lets you know
how different devices can communicate
with one another and it also lets you
know things like how devices know when
and when not send data or not so
although you might think this is quite
useless right now by the end of these
tutorials trust me you will be thanking
me for teaching you this so as you can
see the OSI model consists of seven
layers from bottom to top and as you can
see the bottom layer is called the
physical layer or also layer number one
so remember this is with one two three
not one two three like this that
confuses a lot of people so always
remember because you never know if I'm
going to say layer one physical layer or
bottom layer they all mean the same
thing so now that we can see
all the layers are and where they are
let me give you a brief overview about
what all these layers of the bottom
layers are in these kind of blend into
each other the bottom layers usually do
stuff like transmit data and transmit
like frames and packets and stuff and
I'll teach you guys what that means
later so that's what these letters do
the middle layers do stuff like
communicate between different computers
and stuff so if I had one computer and
you had one that's what the middle layer
would be doing and the top layers right
here those do things like um those are
like your software applications and they
they present the data to you and include
like data formatting stuff and I know
you guys might be lost on everything I
just said but trust me I'm in a little
bit you guys are going to thank me
I just I'm going to be teaching you guys
what the physical layer is today but if
you guys got antsy and wanted to know
all that other stuff then on that there
it is but I promise I will clear things
up for you as I move on now moving on
the physical layer is the layer we're
going to be going over today and what
this layer does is it combined is it
encompasses all the things like your
wire cables your fiber optics your radio
waves and stuff like that
your physical layer also has your
network connectors and these are network
topology and that's why it's named the
physical layer since it's the layer of
stuff that you can see so if someone
says alright there's a problem with the
physical layer it might mean that
there's a problem with like one of the
pieces of hardware in your network now
as you know um all data in computers is
transferred from binary code and this is
one in zeroes for example if you have a
code called one zero one one zero
this might mean a certain thing to a
computer but for saying all right how
exactly does in computer read this
information you just send it like
pineapple Express or whatever it's
called you send it in a plane a bunch of
ones and zeros
No you don't to send one set of data to
another computer you have to use one of
two signals one is called an analog
signal and this is like signals in waves
like radio waves and microwaves and
stuff like this and the other one is a
digital signal and this is well I'll
show you later what this is but let's go
over analog signal and I will shorten
that to Anil right here and let me tell
you guys what an analog signal is it's
pretty much a wave of voltages that you
can send across a network so for example
um this equals zero volt this blue line
we have right here say you have a radial
wave that's a sending a certain amount
of voltage so your radio wave might look
something like this it might vary a
little bit like this one wave might be
higher than the other but their
frequency is always the same any time
you have a positive volt
right here and of course these are
supposed to be touching right there I
just really suck at drawing then any
time you have a positive bolt your
hardware on your network is going to
read a 1 and anytime you have a negative
Volt
your hardware on your software is going
to read a zero now this is built into
your hardware and as you can see this is
how um analog signals can send ones and
zeros so for example if you have a wave
just like this this one's going to read
one zero one zero one zero but again you
your hardware you have can show off the
signal at certain times so it's kind of
like Morse code
you have one zero one one one zero and
this means something to your computer
and this is like the computers language
so this is how you send ones and zeros
over a network
but recently what
the makers of networks in hardware and
stuff decided to do is they saw that
there is a better way of doing this than
sending signals over the radio and stuff
like that so they decided to make
something called a digital signal and
let me go ahead and view my grade it
might be a little easier show grid there
we go that looks a little better and
they decided that we could do something
called sending digital signals now what
digital signal is is a distinct level of
voltage to generate ones and zeros and
this is really common especially with
the lands in local networks and stuff
like that
so for example and set up a wave whoa my
grid is messing me up let's uh get rid
of my grid show how about not show grid
there Bessie actually you know what that
grid is going to be perfect for this
think again all right so a digital
signal look at that look how cool that
says digital even looks digital this is
so perfect and I will name that digit
for short that use a distinct level of
voltages such as um say you have five
volts right here oh my god that is
perfect and zero volts and as you can
see a digital singer works a lot
different in again this is five right
here and this is zero so instead of
waves that vary you can send distinct um
levels of voltage over a digital signal
and another thing you might have is like
positive five and also negative five
like this and as you can see this one's
kind of messed up but as you can see
this is the difference between digital
and an analog wave and another thing
that you guys might be worried asking
about is something called fiber optic
now this is the fastest thing we have
out right now and to do this anytime you
have a piece of light
one and any time you have no light it
equals to zero so for example if you
wanted to send the zero one zero zero
one you would have a piece of light sent
and then you have zero zero and then you
would have another piece of light sent
and this is fiber optic and that is also
a digital signal so again um I hope you
don't mind my awesome drawings but those
are the basics of how to send binary
code using signals using a digital
signal and also using an analog signal
and as you can see digital's are a lot
more distinct and they're usually just a
lot more precise and better and faster
so that is that is your networking
tutorial in the next tutorial I'm going
to be going over the next layer of the
OSI model so thank you guys for watching
make sure to please subscribe to my
channel and I hope you enjoyed and I'll
see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
