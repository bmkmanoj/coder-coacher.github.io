I'm going to be finishing up the last I
want to say very basic information about
vectors after this you're going to be a
vector Pro so one thing I want to cover
is what if you try to do those
operations like adding vectors together
but the vectors are uneven lengths so
let me go ahead and show you guys a
scenario when that's going to happen say
that you have a vector and let's just
make it like 1 through 5 and then you
have another vector all 1 through 3 well
what's going to happen is let me just
output these first whenever you try to
add those together it's going to go
ahead and start adding them together
like normal so this is vector a and this
is vector B so you adding together you
get 2 for 6 but then you get 5 and 7 but
where does that come from because there
are no numbers right here well what's
going to happen is this is going to loop
through 1 2 3 but as soon as B runs out
it's going to start over again so this
is basically 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 until all
the operations are done so that's why
whenever you added 4 plus 1 you get 5
and 5 plus 2 gives you 7 now this
warning message right here says longer
object is not a multiple of shorter
object lengths basically if this had 6
items in it 3 goes into 6 perfectly so
you wouldn't get error message but since
this has 3 items in this has 5 3 doesn't
go into 5 perfectly it's not a multiple
they aren't a multiple of each other so
that's why we're getting this error
message so again that's what happens
when you try to do operations of vectors
of different lengths it works just I
just want to explain to you guys that if
you're getting numbers that you didn't
expect that's why now another cool thing
that you can do is go ahead and clear
everything out is you can also run
true and false those logic tests on them
so let's make a vector a and let's just
set this equal to I don't know like 1 to
10 or something well what we can do now
is we can test a less than 5 so check
this out let's run it it says true true
true true false false false false
let me count false false false false
false false so what is going on here it
basically takes every single number 1 2
3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 and it plugs that in
for a is 1 less than 5 yes is 2 less
than 5 yes 3 4
yes is 5 less than 5 no it's equal to
each other and everything else is false
so again this is 4 1 2 3 4 5 so on and
so forth so aside from that there's
actually a lot of different things that
you can do vectors as you're learning so
there are some rather basic ones but
another cool thing that you can do is
you can actually use those logic
operators with functions as well so
again if we have a vector called a and
this is just a list of numbers 1 to 10
what we can do is say something like
this let me just go ahead and type all
this out
all right so basically whenever I run
this you're going to see a lesson five
true a less than five false whenever you
use the function any what this is going
to do is it's going to run this test
right here test all of these numbers to
see if they're less than five if any of
those numbers return true then output
true so that's what this does it tests
if any of these tests are true then it's
going to say true well all means is if
all of these numbers are less than five
then say true however we know that only
four of those are less than five not all
of them so that's why it's false so
basically whenever you want to test up
any of the tests or all of the tests you
use any and all pretty freaking sweet
and the last thing I want to show you
guys concerning vectors is how to get an
individual item out of that list of
numbers because you're going to want to
do that quite often so let's make a
brand new vector and let's just name it
Hoss and let's just set this equal to
like 50 to 60 so now when you run this
we see 50 through 60 right here but
let's say we only want to pluck one of
these numbers out let's say I don't know
maybe one of these well what we can do
is we can use these square brackets in
there next to the P on your keyboard and
we can type a pretty much a number in
there such as let's just put three and
see what happens what this is going to
do is it's going to say okay we're going
to give you the third item in that list
so this is the first one this is the
second one this is the third one 52 so
that's why it returned 52 so remember
square brackets say give me a certain
item in the list so that's what that
does now just so you know I hopefully
can use you guys even more you can also
return a range of items so if you put
one
five what this is going to do is it's
going to give you the first five items
in that list so let me clear and run
this and check it out 50 51 52 53 54 so
again not only can you pull one item
from a list you can also get a range of
items in that list so hopefully you guys
understand now how - I don't know run
tests on list how to uh you know do a
whole bunch of crap with brackets and
now that we covered the basics of
vectors we're going to be moving on to
UM well you guys are going to see it's
going to be awesome as always
so thank guys for watching don't forget
to subscribe and I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
