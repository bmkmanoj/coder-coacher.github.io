21st chemistry tutorial least I think
this is the 21st not positive on that
proton on that but anyways I think it is
a 21st chemistry tutorial anyways in
this tutorial we're going to be talking
about electron capture my favorite type
of capture so I don't even know any
other types of capture so I guess this
is my favorite so basically what the
heck is electron capture the definition
is whenever an electron from the
innermost energy level the one closest
to the nucleus gets sucked in or
captured by the nucleus so you know how
your nucleus is full of protons and
neutrons it has a positive charge in
your electron spinning around it have a
negative charge so there's always that
attraction and I guess this is a symbol
for attraction between those two so
basically your nucleus is always trying
to suck in those electrons and once it
finally gets one that's what we call
electron capture now you know a couple
tutorials ago I told you guys that you
can have a neutron which has zero charge
and it can be decayed and once it is
it's converted into a proton with a
positive charge and also an electron
with a negative charge well the opposite
of that is also true what am I talking
about
whenever the nucleus captures an
electron it's going to go ahead and
combine with one of the protons that are
already inside the nucleus and it's
going to form one of these neutrons
pretty weird huh so a neutron can either
decay into a proton and electron or in
this case an electron is going to
combine with the proton to form a
neutron pretty a lot of ons
they need to rename these things so they
don't sound so dang similar but anyways
let me go ahead and show you an example
of what's going on so say you have an
element let me think of an element that
this curve look like nickel 59 nickel 59
is we're in 59 28 and this symbol for
nickel is NI now this is the main
element and it's going to go ahead and
combine with an electron that was
already spinning around it and we'll
symbolize that 0 negative
want to Eve now whenever this combines
you get an entirely new element you get
5927 and remember 27 is the atomic
number for cobalt and you also get a
byproduct of x-rays there we go
so basically what the heck is going on
here well like I said before whenever
you have an electron it's going to
combine with a proton to form a neutron
so since neutrons and protons weigh the
exact same amount the mass of either of
those elements is not going to change
however since we're pretty much
destroying a proton in forming a neutron
instead we pretty much turn a proton
into a neutron that is why our atomic
number goes down by one because the
atomic number is the count of protons
how many protons so saying okay that
actually makes sense in a weird sort of
way but then where the heck to these
x-rays come in well remember before when
I said that whenever an electron drops
down to a lower energy level then
basically what happens is it has to
release some sort of energy so what
happens is your electron from the first
energy level is going to get sucked in
by the nucleus so that means this
electron or excuse me this energy level
is now missing an electron so what has
to happen is an electron from the second
energy level has to drop down to fill
the empty space in the first energy
level whenever you have that occur in an
electron from the second energy drops
down the filled space in the first one
it releases energy and sometimes I said
that it releases photons or light energy
it actually is not visible like you
would think of it it's actually lower on
the electromagnetic spectrum in a I
don't even I didn't even talk to you
guys about the electromagnetic spectrum
but it pretty much releases x-rays which
is a kind of light I guess so that is
why the release of energy you also have
a byproduct of x-rays in this type of
nuclear decay so to recap one last time
electron captures are basically when
where you have an electron from the
innermost energy level captured by the
nucleus now whenever this happens it's
going to combine with the proton to form
a neutron so that is why you have the
same exact mass because the mass isn't
changing the only thing that's changing
is the amount of protons in it it's
negative one whatever it was before and
also since all those electrons are
getting sucked in one of them has to
drop down and whenever those electrons
drop down they release energy in the
form of x-rays so hopefully with that
recap this is now burnt in your brain
and you understand what electron capture
is so if you don't watch the video again
or look somewhere else because that's
the best I can explain it but anyways
