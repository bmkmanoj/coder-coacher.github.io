and JavaScript and this time I'm going
to be teaching you guys how to use the
if-else if-else statement now what this
allows us to do as you as you saw in the
last couple tutorials that we gave
JavaScript either one or two choices but
this time we're going to be giving it an
unlimited number of choices
so first let's type of variable I'm
going to use the variable name I'm going
to set equal to Gregg now
as you learn first we can set this
condition equal to something and have XQ
a block of code so I'm going to say if
name equals Gregg then I want you to
alert
uh Pat hey Greg and this is a basic if
statement in the next choice that we
want to give it is not going to be the
else statement like we're learning
before it's going to be else space if
and then you give it a new condition and
we say in this condition if name is
equal and notice I'm using two equal
signs instead of the just one the two
equal signs is when you're comparing
something the one is just called the
assignment operator and for when you're
setting variables but since we're not
resetting this variable we just want to
say if name exactly equals Steve then
what we want to do
is alert
okay Stevo so we'll say now this is what
we're telling JavaScript right now if
the name equals Greg then give us hey
Greg else if the name equals Steve then
tell us hey steve-o and for the let and
for this else if you can do this as many
times as you want you can do it just
once or you can do it 100 times
each with a different name and a
different command I'm only going to do
this one so because I just want to teach
you guys the basics first but any time
you want to end your if-elsif statement
you end it with a syntax else and you
don't need any condition like before
because this already knows our if we run
through this and it isn't true then
we're going to go this and if it isn't
true and if we get through all of this
then we're going to execute the else
statement so that's the automatic
condition that it puts in for itself if
none of these are true that's when we're
going to execute the else statement but
we still need to give it something to do
if they are not true and in this case I
will say else I want you to alert
um we'll say who the F are you because
it doesn't know who we are then get the
right name so let's go ahead and save
this and as you can see right now our
variable name is equal to Gregg so it
should execute
hey Gregg so let's refresh this and it
says hey Gregg and you click OK
and it ran through the rest of it just
fine but again let's set this equal to
Steve and what's going to go say if name
is equal to Gregg no it's not that so on
I don't want to do that else if name is
equal to Steve and then it's going to
say yes the name is equal to Steve so
I'm going to output hey steve-o so let's
save this refresh it as you can see it
skipped Gregg and went right to steve-o
that's what we wanted and again if this
name is Bobby or something or Bob knee
as I type that's alright we can leave it
as that it's going to say all right if
the names
Gregg do this but it's not great well if
the name Steve then put hey Steve oh but
it's not Steve else if I get through all
these and they're all false
then I only have one choice less left to
alert who the F are you so let's save
this refresh it and finally it tried
everything good try and finally it was
only left for one option to alert who
the F are you so that is how you can
give JavaScript a bunch of choices on
how to do different commands using the
if-else if-else statement so study this
and practice it and watch my next
tutorial Thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
