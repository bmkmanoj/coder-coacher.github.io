midpoint formula which to find the
midpoint of a segment with coordinates
x1 y1 x2 y2 we're going to use these two
equations and as our final results we're
going to have an ordered pair whose
coordinates equal these these two
equations and this is going to be our
midpoint so we're going to do some
examples and then we're going to graph a
midpoint problem so first for the X we
have 1 plus 3 over 2 comma 8 plus 10
over 2 so we add the x coordinate and
the y coordinates to get the y
coordinate and the x coordinate so 1
plus 3 is 4 divided by 2 is 28 plus 10
is 18 divided by 2 is 9 so that is what
our midpoint equals so now we have a
negative right here but it and right
here too as well but if you remember we
add the two numbers together an addition
is commutative which means that you can
add in whatever order and you'll still
get the same answer so we have negative
1 plus 3 over 2 for our x-coordinate and
5 plus negative 3/2 for
our y-coordinate so negative 1 plus 3 is
positive 2 divided by 2 and then when we
subtract when we add a negative we're
really subtracting a positive so 5 minus
positive 3 is 2 over 2 and if you reduce
those you get one and one so we have one
more example here and it's the same
thing where you're going to add your
exes and add your wise so 6 plus two is
eight over two is four 4 plus 1 is 5 and
we're just going to leave it like that
so given the segment midpoint is
negative 32 so we're going to graph this
so we're going to go left three up
positive 2 just right there and I
actually let me get a different color so
it shows up on our graph better so 3 up
to and this is the midpoint remember and
then our end point is 3 negative 1 so
over to the right three down one so
about right there this is endpoint one
so our we're trying to find the other
end point of this segment and if you
think about it the other end point has
to be up here somewhere
because M has to be between and point 1
and point 2 and appoint one for it to be
a midpoint and the distance here needs
to be congruent to the distance there so
we're going to have to work backwards a
little bit so we're going to use the
same formula we just learned except
since we already know what the midpoint
is we're going to set the x coordinate
or the X midpoint equal to we're going
to call it x1 this point up here x1 plus
this end point right here divided by 2
and we're going to do the same for the Y
and set to equal to y1 minus 1 over 2 so
if you multiply both sides by two and
subtract 3 over you'll get x1 equal to
negative 9 and multiplied to over add 1
over you get y is equal to 5 so if we
were to plot this we'd have to go we'd
have to make this a little bit longer
we're going to call this negative 10 so
negative 9 is about here so we're going
to go over negative 9 and up five so
right about there and this is our entire
segment
so that's all for midpoint but in the
next lesson we're going to talk about
the slope of a line so make sure you
come back and watch that video too</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
