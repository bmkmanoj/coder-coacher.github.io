I'm going to be showing you guys some
really awesome stuff that you can do
with vectors definitely a lot more
interesting than the last video so let's
go ahead and get started now the first
thing I want to show you guys is your
shortcut and how to make specific
vectors so let's go ahead and make a
vector called slammer of course what
else are we going to name it now
whenever you want to create a simple
vector with a range of numbers say you
want to create a list of numbers one to
five what you can do is you can do it
before see one two three yada yada yada
but there's a shorter much easier way
type the first number in the list then
make the colon right next to the L on
your keyboard and then type the last
number now what you're going to do is
you're basically telling our make a
vector of numbers or a list of numbers 1
2 5 and that's it boom roasted so now
whenever we print it out check it out
and Schlemmer not found because I didn't
run it all as you can see 1 2 3 4 5 so
that is a much easier way especially
when you're creating you know a list
larger than 5 numbers so this is useful
like maybe you need to assign everyone a
user ID and maybe have 2,000 people well
all you do is do one to 2,000 and boom 1
easy line of code now aside from that
you can also use negative numbers so if
you have another vector called bacon you
can make a list of numbers let's say
negative 3 to negative 12 and now when
you run this
well there's that mm I forgot that so
anyways this is a good example make a
list of or make a vector 1/2 mm
definitely a lot easier than typing out
all those numbers and this example that
I'm showing you negative 3 to negative
12 works perfectly on negative numbers
as well so let's go ahead and clear that
console and also delete this as well and
now I want to show you guys something
that you're probably going to poop your
pants after seeing this whenever you
have vectors of equal length you can do
some really awesome stuff to them
together so let's go ahead and make a
vector called a and we'll just use the
numbers one two and three and this one
and now make another vector that also
has three numbers in it the numbers
don't really matter we'll just go from
like 7 to 9 so now a and B as you can
see they have one two three and seven
eight nine but here's the cool thing
what you can do is you can actually type
something like this a plus B now
whenever you run it check out what
happens
it adds the first item in the list
together then the second one and then
the third ones so how freaking cool is
that this saves you a bunch of code what
it can do essentially is loop through
each vector simultaneously and perform
mathematical operations to each item at
a time pretty freakin awesome
and another thing that I want to mention
is sometimes before you do these
operations you're going to want to check
the length of one or more vectors so
what you can do to do this actually let
me go ahead and delete all this and I'm
typing in the wrong space
you can use the length function and this
takes a vector is a parameter and what
this is going to return is the number of
items in that list so of course a has
three items in it the number is one two
three and the vector B has three items
in it the numbers
seven eight and nine so now if we wanted
to do something like make sure they
match and then go ahead and do something
like a times B then we can go ahead and
do that as well so that is some cool
stuff that you can do with vectors you
know it's more than just creating lists
it's you know what we can do with these
vectors that makes this such an awesome
programming language and eventually I'm
going to be showing you guys how to do
even better stuff like making cool
charts and graphs and a whole bunch of
awesome stuff like that but for now on
thank you guys for watching don't forget

website Bucky's room gorg
coolest web site on the Internet I'll
see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
