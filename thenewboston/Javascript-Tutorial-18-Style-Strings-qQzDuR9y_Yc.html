JavaScript tutorial and in this tutorial
I'm gonna be talking to you guys about
how to style strings if you remember we
did one style last time where we changed
our string hello Bob and we changed it
to uppercase as you can see over here it
took to the lower case and changed at
the upper case but this time I'm gonna
be teaching guys how to do some more
styling and I'm also also going to be
filling in this parameter last time I
said that were we had an empty parameter
and don't worry about it and this time
we're gonna fill that in with something
so as you can see to uppercase is not
the only built-in style that we have we
also have style such as a bolt what you
see if we save this it changes hello Bob
to book bold and we also have strike
if you save that and these are just some
quick examples to show you how you can
use JavaScript to style strings in
different ways and in all of these we
only did one thing and I'd only had one
thing that it could do since I strike
but uh let's say we wanted to do
something like change the font color
just like when font color right here and
this still is JavaScript we want to
change the font color of our string but
you're saying all right what color do
you want to change to and where to put
it
that's what this parameter is for
anytime you have an object and you want
to add a style to it that has multiple
values you put it in the parameter like
with bold
it can only do one thing make the string
bold and no strike you can do-- and do
one thing make a line through it well
font color you have many options so
here's what you do say we wanted to
change it to red oh you do let's type in
red and make sure since there's your
string in let's say in quotation marks
in your empty parameter save it and as
you can see
our string is now red so that's a quick
example of how you can style strings
with the JavaScript and study this and
learn this and of course we went over
three today but there are many many
others that you could find online so I
hope you enjoyed watching my video and
if you would go to my website I'll give
you a link on the right hand side and
join and I'll help me out a lot Thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
