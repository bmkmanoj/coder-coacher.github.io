YouTube but there are little lines on
this toolbar so these tools are pretty
much grouped into different sections so
this first section right here are all of
your capture icons so this one is what
we just saw all of your interfaces this
button is we already went over that -
these are your capture options or
settings this is start this is stop and
this is refresh or restart these are
grayed out because you know I can't stop
it if it's not even running right now
but there you go so all of your capture
settings are right here these are just
some of the file options that you can
use so if you want to open a capture
file
maybe you download one off the internet
this is to save if you want to save this
current file right here and you know you
can close and pretty much all of the
stuff that you can do from file you can
do right there now this little section
is how you can navigate and view your
packets so like I said the way that you
navigate to individual packets is either
by clicking on them and I use the
keyboard a lot - you can also navigate
through your history and this is kind of
like hitting the back button on your
browser so if you're saying all right
this packet look kind of important and
also this one right here what was that
last one I just went to you can head
back and boom there you are now if you
ever want to find an individual packet
then you can hit this right here
and I don't know let's say maybe you
wanted well I'll show you guys about the
different filter settings so that's
going to come into use later but just
remember if you want to find a specific
packet then you can use that this right
here if you know the packets number
which is essentially just the ID number
nothing you know really important then
say you want to go to packet 50 so just
like 50 right there jump to and boom
there you go now if you just ever want
to go to the top of the list the very
first packet you captured when you
started or the last one then that's what
those
Bunz do so just some really quick tools
for navigating through your packets now
this section right here is just four do
you want this colorized you see how the
different types of packets depending on
their protocol and some other settings
are colored differently well then you
can choose to just toggle those off if
it's distracting and this right here
says whenever you're capturing packets
live do you want to scroll I usually
leave these as they are default because
I just like the way it's set up but do
whatever the heck you want and this
section right here is just for zooming
so basically the font size and if you
ever sent okay I mess something up I
just want to go back to normal then you
can click this little one to one and it
will bring you back to the default now
in the next tutorial I'm going to be
going over this which is incredibly
important as well so as you guys can see
we got a lot of packets a lot of these
we really don't want to pay attention to
like a lot of the DNS stuff um you know
maybe we're just worried about these
HTTP packets because that's what
websites people are going to so all the
other stuff that happens behind the
scenes with their computer not really
worried about I just want to see what
websites you know my kids are going to
so what we can do is we can actually
build filters to filter out all the crap
that we don't need but we will say that
for the next tutorial that's a little
spoiler but I'll see you guys then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
