with a video tutorial for the new Boston
in this tutorial we go we are going to
be creating a simple countdown to
redirect so what I mean by a countdown
to redirect is if you've ever visited a
website that counts down a particular
amount of seconds using javascript and
doesn't actually refresh a page you'll
have seen it count down from obviously a
particular number when it reaches one it
will either say present you with a
downloadable file or it might go ahead
and redirect you to another page
altogether so in this tutorial we're
going to look at how we can do that
dynamically on a page obviously without
refreshing the page because we're going
to be using jQuery now first of all I
have obviously gone ahead and included
jQuery on this page on my index dot PHP
page and I've also included this counter
dot j/s external javascript file and
this is where we're going to be writing
the function and also the calling of
this particular function and what the
function is going to do is it's going to
set an interval of one second and every
one second we are going to set a
particular div on the page to the number
that we've specified when we called the
function so the first thing I'm gonna do
is go ahead and create a div area on the
page that's going to handle the number
for the countdown now if you wanted to
use this in line you're probably better
to go ahead and use span I guess a span
tag would be appropriate for this as
well so it doesn't really matter what
you use the important thing is the ID
that you give it and I'm just gonna call
this counter so we're gonna be popping a
number in here first of all for example
10 which have a number the user
specifies when they call the function
then it's going to show nine eight seven
all the way down to one and then the
whole page is going to redirect and
we're gonna specify the URL in the in
the function that we call as well we're
going to allow our function to take two
parameters the first one being the
number of seconds to count down from and
the second being the URL that we're
going to redirect the user to
so once we've got this span or div or
even paragraph set up on the page
wherever you'd like to place the number
that's going to be counting down we can
go ahead and start to define our
function now our function is going to be
called counter so we use the function
keyword and counter let me give that a
block inside counter we want to take two
parameters and the first one is time so
the amount of seconds we want to count
down from and the second is the URL that
we want to redirect to now this could
either be a file a web page anything
really as long as it's a valid URL so
underneath here we want to go ahead and
actually call this function before we
start to define it it's probably good
practice to go ahead and do and call a
function and then outline the function
contents so you can constantly come and
test it in your browser so we are going
to activate this all right when the
document is ready so we use the document
selector and then we use the ready event
handler inside of this we want to go
ahead and create a function and this
will just be everything that happens in
here when the document is ready and it's
loaded so we want to call this counter
function we want to go ahead and define
some parameters that we want to pass to
our function up here and then we know
how we can handle it so for example I
might want to count down from 10 seconds
and then I calm and separate this for
the next parameter which is the URL so
I'm gonna type in Google code at UK so
essentially what we're doing here is
when the document is loaded we are
calling our counter function which we've
just defined up here we are specifying a
countdown from 10 seconds and we are
redirecting to Google code at UK when
we've actually counted down and when the
counter is at 1 or yeah when is it 1 ok
so inside our counter function we need
to start to build this functionality now
you'll see that on the page
nothing's happening we've called this
counter function but obviously we
haven't written the code for it yeah so
nothing's going to happen so the first
thing we want to go ahead and do is set
an interval now usually you would set an
interval here
and inside of here you would create a
function like this
now this isn't jQuery code it's actually
just original javascript code so we're
not really using jQuery to set the
interval but it's there's no jQuery
alternative I believe delay is obviously
not a replacement for set interval and
then we define an amount of sec or
milliseconds were so a thousand being
one second okay so now what we want to
do is not just use this set interval
function or on its own we want to go
ahead and assign this to a variable so
once we have finished the amount of time
we want to redirect the user but clear
the interval as well so we just say var
interval equals set interval now this
interval variable here now holds this
interval function and what that means is
we can go ahead and clear the interval
by referencing the interval variable
it's extremely important if you're using
set interval on a page that you're not
redirecting a user in this case it
doesn't really matter because we're
redirecting the user to a different
website however if you are using
interval frequently it's important to
note that it's always good to set it in
a variable so you can use the clear
interval function a bit later on so now
we've set up a variable called interval
that holds an interval here that that
essentially works every second so all
the code inside here will run every
second and we can test this just by say
I don't know we could go ahead and pop a
value inside counter so let's go ahead
and just test the out interval is
working we're going to use a hash
selector to select our counter element
and then we're just going to go ahead
and I can say append
I for example so now what's going to
happen every one second
with this interval we are going to
append the value a to our counter span
so let's go ahead and test</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
