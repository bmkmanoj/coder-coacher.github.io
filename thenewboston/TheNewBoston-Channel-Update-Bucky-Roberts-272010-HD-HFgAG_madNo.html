is February 7th Super Bowl day a couple
hours before a Super Bowl and I just
wanted to make an update giving you guys
kind of an idea of what's going on with
my channel because I've been getting a
lot of questions and my messages and
also comments asking some pretty common
questions first of all most important
I finally got my screen recorder so I
can begin making like program tutorials
and stuff like that again so that's the
main thing that people were asking me I
finally got it after like a month it was
pain but I finally got it so that's it
and aside from that another big
announcement is beginning March it's the
first weekend in March I don't know the
date I'm gonna start hiring people to
help me make tutorials online on my
channel and this is because I have so
many comments and I have such a huge
demand of people asking for all
different kinds of tutorials and there's
no way that I can keep up with it with
myself and I want to give these
tutorials to you guys for free the best
quality tutorials I can so I'm getting a
couple people to help me out and trust
me these guys know as much if not more
about computers than I do so I mean
these guys know what they're talking
about they're gonna be good and I
wouldn't have them help me if they
weren't so so what I need from you guys
is what tutorials do you want to see
what do you want me to tell them to
teach you know you have 3d programming
or excuse me 3d modeling like Maya and
blender you can have adobe like a
dreamweaver after-effects program
tutorials and I'm probably gonna be
sticking with Java program tutorials but
and they're gonna be teaching other
stuff so I'm doing Java still myself or
program tutorials game reviews like Xbox
games and stuff like that so what I'm
asking you is why did you subscribe to
this channel what do you want to see cuz
this channel is for you guys that's why
I'm doing it if it wasn't for you I
wouldn't have a check
so I want to make sure that I'm teaching
videos that most people want to see and
again these are going to be complete
series awesome videos and I'll make sure
of it so that's pretty much it what I
want leave a comment on this video of
what videos you want to see the most in
that way I can prioritize and see
alright if everyone wants this why would
I be teaching this so that's why I want
to do and don't forget if you want like
say you want Adobe videos and most don't
forget to say what program like
Dreamweaver After Effects Photoshop or
if you want like program tutorials the
most don't forget to say what language
like C C++ Java and whatever has the
most votes that's what I'm gonna be
teaching so I look forward to your
responses I look forward to knowing well
you guys subscribe for what keeps the
interest in my channel and I promise
that I'm gonna have a ton of
high-quality awesome and most
importantly free tutorials for you guys
and I won't stop this channel is just
gonna keep on growing
and it's because of you guys so lastly
thank you guys for watching this video

forward to hearing your comments so I'll
see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
