Effects cs6 tutorial today I want to
show you how to take your vector images
and make them into a 3d image using only
After Effects now we're an After Effects
cs6 and this is the only version that
you can really do this nicely in so
we're gonna take this vector that I have
which is pretty much just a gear and I'm
gonna put it in my copier and I'm just
gonna move my pan behind tool on the
center of this gear so we can scale it
up I'm just gonna make it somewhat
bigger and move it to the middle and I'm
going to hit my collapse transformation
tool so it looks a little nice and I'll
come up to a hundred percent so
everything looks pretty crisp with this
and kind of more in the center now the
the way to do this is different than
making your text 3d so you have to pay a
little bit more pay a little bit of
tension and don't get it confused with
how you make your 3d text so I have my
3d scene already set up with a camera
and some lights now I'll come to the top
view so you can see how I have that set
up real quick but it's nothing special
you can just have a regular camera in
light so there's my light in the back a
light in the front and my camera is out
there nothing to nothing so just put a
camera and a light in there and then you
can start doing this so I'm gonna take
this gear and I'm gonna make it 3d
and I did that by clicking on the cube
and let's see I have my my preview and
adaptive resolution right now so it's at
full quality I need to twirl down and
usually when you have your text in 3d so
this is a text layer down here you're
going to have the bevel depth whole
depth and extrusion that's what we used
in a previous tutorial to make that text
3d when I scroll down in my geometry
options for my gear here that you don't
have that you have curvature and
segments which is different so the way
you want to make this 3d is you need to
right-click on the layer and come over
here to create shapes from vector layer
and it's gonna take some time to load
real quick but as you can see it created
masks shapes all around and made
basically the same vector but using
shapes in cs6 so now if we twirl down
this shapes layer as you can see the the
illustrator layer has been turned off
and it did that on its own and this is
already 3d twirl down your geometry
options and now you've got your bevel
styles so let's set it to angular I've
already done made this 3d and I found
out that one is good for the bevel depth
and if I do I think 20 on this it turns
out into a 3d point for it to render out
and there we go we've got a 3d object
now you can use this for if your client
gives you a logo or anything like that
you can use that to make a 3d logo for
your client without having to use a 3d
program so that's a pretty much that's
basically it if you need more
instruction about how to use the bevel
depth check out my other tutorial
so I'll go over the different geometry
options here with you in case you didn't
see the the tutorial on how to make 3d
text so the bevel Styles here are none
which is going to be flat which most
objects in real life aren't flat I'm
going to click on this here to turn off
my masks so if I as you can see it turns
off the masks I'm going to actually
change this the fast draft so we don't
have to wait for renders every time and
we've got angular which is kind of like
a straighter bevel you can see there
they're beveled in now we have concave
which gives you another bevel that is
like a curved and as you can see here on
this edge right here and then you get
convex which is a curved out bevel which
looks more realistic on this object your
bevel depth here is how much bevel is
going to be in there so if I set this
something like 5 you can see it's too
much because the holes in this are too
close together or too small you can see
the bevel depth though on the edge of
how it's a lot more rounder than before
so if I maybe set this to 2 you can even
see how even 2 is too much for this one
so I set it to 1 we can actually see
what's going on in this looking at
looking at it this way the whole bevel
depth here now we'll make it so that the
holes in the middle aren't so beveled
out then maybe you can add more to this
let's move the whole bubble depth down a
some even more but it's got this thing
in the middle so I mean it didn't work
so hot so you can see with the whole
bevel depth does if I scroll around
there and set this back to 1
worked well and then your extrusion
depth if I turn this a little more
sideways just determines how far out
this extrudes so if I put this at 10
it's going to cut the depth in half if I
turn it at 30 it's gonna make it even
farther out so that's how you make your
object 3d that was basic a basic
rudimentary quick tutorial on how to do
that if you're more interested in some
of the different aspects of the 3d check
out the making 3d text tutorial that I
had probably a couple tutorials back in
the New Boston channel so thanks for
watching this one and I hope you guys
use this all the time because this is
going to be the new fad in cs6 I mean
actually it already is it's so much
easier than having to create a 3d logo
in something like my or cinema 4d or 3ds
max or something like that and importing
in here it just saves you a whole lot of
time so you guys use this up it's going
to be awesome put it in some of your
cool projects and I thank you for
watching and I'll check you out check
you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
