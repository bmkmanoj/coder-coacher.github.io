tutorial that I'm making for the new
Boston and in this tutorial i'm gonna
continue showing you how to overload
operators so all you're gonna need for
this tutorial is a button and an item
class and in your item class just make
sure the of a publicly integer property
and all of these other operators that I
have in here you're not going to need
and all these are just operators that we
create to do previous tutorials alright
so the operator that we're going to be
overloading today are the Buchanan
operator and operators so while
basically going to be doing is just
adding one key items price and taking
one off the items price so subtracting
one price alright so all we're gonna do
here is really like public and static
because in order to overload an operator
you must make your operator both public
and static and we're going to be
returning an item this time instead of a
pool because we're basically going to be
returning a new item with a price either
one higher or one lower depending on
which up and we overload right here item
and then I'm just gonna type operator
because after all we're going to be
overloading an operator in the first
operator that we're going to be
overloading it applause applause
operators or is going to go right here
plus plus and what I mean you have to
call for one parameter here because
we're only gonna have one item now we're
in alright
and then you can't just do return item
price
lots of plus because item that price is
integers so we can't return an integer
so what we're gonna have to do is create
a new item let's call it I do a new and
they were just the state eyes drugs
equals the item that the user like
increments plus one all right so this
items price is equal to the items price
that we in community plus one and then
we're just going to return this item
creator all right so now if you go up
here and create a new item
I'll let's call it high and steady we're
doing new item I'll say eyes price
equals two and then we're just going to
say I plus plus and what I plus plus
will do is it will just increment this
items price by one all right so now if
we display in the message box this items
price we should get three you can first
sent to two men you increment it by 1 so
this will show I eyes price cheap drink
since price isn't integer so now I need
to bug here you should just get through
this box yeah and we can also overload
the deeper than operator but as you
notice we didn't have to overload both
of these so you can only go over the one
don't need to overlook both in the same
time like these up here all right so if
we wanted to overload the determine a
parade that's like static and
item because they're going to item
operator because they're going to be
overloading an operator and then we're
just going to take - - because the
operator that we're going to be
overloading and be through the operator
and then the users only never have to
pass one item through here okay they're
only going to eat them into one items
Friday series item I just call it item
Miska basically just because name code
will be increment item and then we're
gonna say eyes price equals item price
minus 1 instead of plus 1 since we
usually eat them an operator instead of
an increment operator and now we're just
gonna return this new item and we create
here a I returned hi all right so now if
we do - - it's a plus plus we should get
1 in a message box since the initial
price was - it's going to decrease that
by 1 and then display that in the
message box so we should get one yep
perfect so that's pretty much it for
this tutorial so
see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
