believe After Effects tutorial and in
this tutorial we're going to be going
over how to animate opacity or
transparency and also how to change the
size of objects our animation so before
I go over I just wanted to teach you
guys a nifty little trick real quick
before when we were editing keyframes we
had to click on the keyframe like this
or we had move the current time
indicator and that's how we edited the
keyframe but I didn't tell you guys
about this right here what this little
nifty little box does is automatically
go to the next keyframe so whenever
you're working with keyframes that are
very close to each other instead of
trying to click it then move a little
bit then click it a little bit more you
can just go ahead and move these little
arrows and will automatically go to the
next keyframe and whenever this little
um box is yellow and it means you're on
a keyframe but whenever it's gray like
this it means you're off of keyframe so
that's how you know when you're on and
off keyframes another thing that you can
do it's even easier than clicking these
arrows is pressing J and K on your
keyboard when you press K it
automatically hops to the next keyframe
and J automatically hops back again
that's J okay just get in that's how you
can remember it so now that we learned
how to navigate between our keyframes I
wanted to go over something fun and that
is how to make things fade in and out
with After Effects now when we clicked
when we wanted to edit the position of
our animation we highlighted our object
in the composition panel and we pressed
P well the shortcut for transparency is
T so go ahead and press T and as you can
see your little thing that used to say
position now change to opacity again
they didn't name it nevermind I'll just
confusing I was going to say that even
though you press T it was opacity that's
because the oh they're already using
that for something out so remember T is
transparency
don't press o for opacity since it won't
work so go ahead and press T and move
your current time indicator to the
beginning of your animation and remember
don't forget to do this it's very
important make sure you click this
little stopwatch this little stopwatch
will make sure that you can make
keyframes if you don't have a click and
you try to make keyframes it won't work
so make sure that there's a box around
the stopwatch the first thing that
you're going to want to do is a make
sure you're at home and make sure you're
on your first keyframe that's
automatically created now this little
thing right here shows how opaque your
object is zero being nothing at all and
100 being completely solid so since I
want to fade this from nothing to
something I'm going to go to my first
keyframe and I'm going to put zero and
this is going to make as you can see my
object disappeared this is because my
object is totally transparent so all you
can see is the background now to make
your next keyframe go and go to about
three seconds on your timeline and you
want to make another keyframe just by
clicking on this and changing the value
of it to something so I'm going to
change your mind to 100 since I want it
to fade in and as you can see when you
move our current time indicator Sammy
the sausage is now totally transparent
and he gradually fades in and as you if
you can look on here you can see it gets
gradually from 100 to 73 all the way
down to zero so let's watch Sam in
action as he fades in slowly so again to
recap one last time go to the beginning
change it to zero go to your next
keyframe change
to 100 and that is how you make objects
fade in and out in after-effects so
another thing I wanted to cover real
quick is um as you can see this little
um let me get on that keyframe when you
hover over this you can change the
values in two ways a as we did before
you can just click it and manually
change values like 80 100 but another
thing that you can do is as you can see
the little pointer pointer cursor
whatever has two arrows on it if you
want you can go ahead and click and drag
the arrows to left or right as you can
see once your pointer has two little
arrows on it looks like there's arrows
sticking through the finger actually you
can click and drag and this will
automatically change your value so if
you want to fine-tune it this is a quick
easy way and you don't have to type it
in manually then this is called
scrubbing on know if you need to know
that or not but it's called scrubbing
your values when you click it and change
the value of it you can either type it
in or scrub your value so I actually am
going to cover scale make things rink
and grow in my next tutorial so make
sure you learn how to UM make things
fade in and out and make sure that
you're using these keyframe shortcuts
and make sure that you know how to scrub
your values and once you learn all that
you can move onto my next tutorial where
I'm going to be teaching you guys how to
make things shrink and grow in After
Effects so thanks for watching make sure
to subscribe to my channel and I'll see
you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
