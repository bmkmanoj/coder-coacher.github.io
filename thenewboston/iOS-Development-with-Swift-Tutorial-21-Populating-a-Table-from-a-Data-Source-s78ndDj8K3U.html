video what I'm going to do is I'm going
to show you guys how to populate your
table from an actual data source instead
of just writing the word bacon in every
single row because I don't know maybe
you want to do that but it's probably
pretty useful if you got your data from
something like an array or a tuple or I
don't know maybe you're connecting to a
MySQL database whatever what I did
already before this is tutorial though
is I made some quick tuples I didn't
want to you know have you guys sit here
for like two minutes and watch me type
everything out so I made one called
people which is just a list of people
and what state they live in
and also if you want to use this one
here are just a list of some of my
videos and how many videos are in each
playlist so again just copy this down or
just make your own real quick whatever
but now that we have some kind of data
source the first thing that we need to
do is this instead of just returning
three saying okay I want to create three
rows no matter what what I actually want
to do is go to the data source and say
the number of rows that we create in
each table is actually dependent on how
many items are in your data source for
example if you're making a table of
people your table would have three rows
if you're making a table for videos it
would have five rows so it isn't just a
hard-coded number like this it's going
to be dynamic and this is actually
really easy so instead of returning just
a plain integer what I want to do in
this example I'll just use people why
not so what you do is you take your data
source whatever it is - called people
and you count the items or elements in
it so again this is returning three but
it's doing it smartly because if we were
to ever add one more then that would
return four so on and so forth and we
want to have to change the code right
here so now instead of just returning
the word bacon what I can do is this so
now since each of these items in the
tuple consists of two pieces of
information and name
and the location for each item let's go
ahead and extract that data into two
different variables you can actually do
all in one line if we just array
something like person name and we'll
just write person location and then we
take this and set it equal to people
which is the tupple and I'll show you
guys what I'm doing in just a second so
index path dot row all right so check
this out
actually let me tell you this up just a
bit alright so remember what this method
is going to do is it's going to be
called every single time we want to
create a new row now before what we did
is we just returned the cell with a word
bacon in it and that's why it stuck
bacon in every single one but what we're
doing here is we're saying okay go to
this tupple and the contents that we
want to return is dependent on where you
at you're at in your loop now how do we
do that well this index path row this is
a variable that gets passed into us
whenever it's creating our table so the
very first time it calls this method
index path is going to be 0 the next
time when it tries to create the next
row it's going to be 1 and the last time
since there are only 3 rows in this
table it's going to be 2 so 0 1 &amp;amp; 2 well
what we want to do for that is we just
want to say okay the data that we want
to return for 0 1 &amp;amp; 2 is plug that 0 is
your people tuples so the first time
it's going to return Bucky Roberts the
second time it's going to return Lisa
Tucker and third time it's going to
return Emma
hotpocket so again we can use that
number in conjunction with our tuple to
return the proper data pretty stinking
awesome but now all we did is we took
that data and we saved it in variables
we didn't actually use it in any kind of
like special way so we can do that right
now
so if we take that cell which is just
blank right now and we call text label
check if it's empty and access the
property text then we can set this equal
to I just had to equal to their name I
won't even worry about the location
right now so now what we're doing is
we're grabbing the information on each
loop we're extracting the name and we're
setting it equal to the text of that
cell so now let's go ahead and run this
and check it out all right look at that
so again it kind of did the same thing
it said okay I'm going to make you one
table how many rows am I going to have
well I have to go up here and count this
one two three all right so you want
table with 3 rows now what do you want
to let me show this again what do you
want the contents to be well every time
I create a row I'm going to call index
path 0
what's the 0 oh that's Bucky Roberts
what's 1 Lisa Tucker what's 2 I'm a hot
pocket now of course I'm going to take
each of their names and set equal to the
text for that cell and print it out so
pretty simple stuff and actually let me
go ahead right now and show you guys how
to create a table with more than one
