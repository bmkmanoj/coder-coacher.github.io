segment so if a is the midpoint of line
segment CTC 80 or CT a divide C 2 into
two equal parts
an equal also means congruent such that
C a is congruent to 80 and if it's
really a midpoint two because there's
two equal parts times the length of one
of these segments should give you the
length of the entire segment C T so in
trapezoid PA RK T is the midpoint of PA
so that means T divides PA into two
equal parts and D is the midpoint of our
K so that means those are congruent
therefore TD this segment right here is
the median of the trapezoid so when a
line goes from one median of one side of
a trapezoid to another median the other
side of the trapezoid or midpoint excuse
me is the median of the trapezoid and
when the median of a trapezoid is equal
to the sum of the bases divided by two
so now that we know that we're going to
do a couple examples so
we have this and if you remember we're
going to call this M the length of M is
equal to base one plus base two divided
by two so to find the length of X we're
gonna plug all this information into our
formula so M is the median of this
trapezoid because it it connects the two
medians of the sides so then we can plug
it into this formula so 25 is equal to
18 plus X which is what we're trying to
find divided by 2 when we solve for X we
have to divide I'm sorry multiply both
sides by 2 so we get 50 equals 18 plus X
so to solve for X we subtract 18 over
and you get X is equal to 32 and if you
want to plug that back in 32 plus 18
divided by 2 32 plus 18 is 52 50 divided
by 2 is 25 that's just another way to
double-check that your answer is right
okay so now we're trying to find the
length of X well since at this point
right here divides this leg into two
equal parts it's the midpoint same thing
for this one divides it into equal parts
so it is also the midpoint so that means
that X is the median
of the trapezoid so X is equal to the
sum of the bases over two so X is equal
to 75 divided by two and we'll just
leave that as our answer well that's all
we have fir midpoint but next time we're
gonna go into graphing so make sure you
can come watch that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
