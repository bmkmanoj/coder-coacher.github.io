Blackford here with another After
Effects tutorial I am going to teach you
about hold keyframes today and I'll I
made like a little animation right here
so I could explain what it was but
basically a hold keyframe is used if you
want to start and stop your animation
but not have a motion path in between so
you just want maybe this tuna can to
appear in the corner and then maybe
appear in the other corner without
moving so I made a quick preview so you
guys can see it and this is what I'm
talking about here so this is a what
hold keyframes can do so the way that
you can do that is basically by easily
by using hold keyframes it's pretty
simple so the whole keyframe can be
found in the animation keyframe
assistant or select the keyframe
animation tab a hold keyframe and the
hot key is ctrl H but I know better
hotkey you can hold ctrl + alt and click
on the keyframe and it will change it to
a hold keyframe so I'll just animate
this other tuna that I have here and we
can that way I can explain it and show
it to you guys at the same time so let's
start at 0 and we'll make put the tune
up here in the corner and P for position
click on my stopwatch I'll move to ahead
one second and I'll move down here and
go to the next second here and just move
it somewhere else ok now all I got to do
is select all the keyframes ctrl alt
click and there you go you can also
right click and there should be a type
of hold keyframe there also
so now if we look at the animation it's
starting starting and just appearing
around so something that some people do
that is actually kind of wrong and
produces a glitch in After Effects is a
doubling up keyframes so i'll show you
what i mean real quick so we'll take
that off and we're going to copy this
first keyframe here which is a selected
selecting the scale and everything i got
to get off and i'll hit you just to
bring up my position keyframes select
the keyframe hit edit copy or control
see now I'm going to hit K to get to the
next keyframe then I'm going to hit page
up to go back one frame and paste the
keyframe that I copied now you can see
how it's kind of like jacked up looking
and then we'll do the same thing with
this keyframe copy okay
paid come down in here I'll hit K to go
to the next keyframe page up to go back
edit did I not copy it edit yeah parent
I didn't copy it oh man
ctrl Z because I accidentally just
deleted that edit copy and edit paste
okay there we go so essentially it does
the same thing but when you go to render
it's going to produce a glitch and your
animation isn't going to look correct it
doesn't show it on this screen but it's
a so common mistake that happens and
you'll see in forums every once in a
while people asking why is this
happening
everything looks good so there's your
explanation there for that so don't do
this this is the way not to go so you
want to I'll delete them so we don't
have to see them anymore there we go and
you just want to do the hold keyframes
so if you get to the end here to the
last keyframe and say I want to make a
motion path that actually moves on the
next keyframe go here and then I'll move
this give you a preview real quick this
square is also a whole keyframe if the
keyframe before was linear it will turn
into the left arrow if if it wasn't it
will turn into this square which is the
same thing for a hold but as you can see
it didn't create let's change it to a
regular keyframe as you can see here it
doesn't do what we want it to do so what
you have to do is copy this keyframe
edit copy and we'll say we'll just put
the keyframe right here edit paste make
it a regular keyframe and now it'll move
see there you go
so that's how you continue out of a
whole keyframe you paste the hold
keyframe and change it into a normal
keyframe
that's it for holding keyframes they are
pretty useful nowadays you see a lot of
animations where stuff just pops in and
out all the time and that's how they do
it so hope you guys enjoyed the tutorial
we'll see you back on the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
