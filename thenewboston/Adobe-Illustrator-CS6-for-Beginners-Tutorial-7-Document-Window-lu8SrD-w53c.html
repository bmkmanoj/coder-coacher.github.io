illustration see a six tutorial today
we're going to learn how to work with
the document windows and by document
windows I mean basically this entire
area is the document window we've got
the tabs up here which allow us to
switch in between document windows so
you can switch between these by clicking
on them or you can use a time saver by
you can you hold down control and then
press tab and that will cycle through
and if you want to go backwards you hold
control shift and tab and I'll move
backwards between the it'll move to the
left so control tab moves to the right
among your tabs here and control shift
tab moves to the left now if you've got
too many open and you don't want them
open anymore
all you need to do is click on this
little X here and it'll X out of the tab
so if I click on that the tab is gone
now if you need if you open a file so I
open one that I just had the tab is
going to appear to the right and then
you can still search through or go
through your other tabs kind of if you
use Photoshop before it's like that so
if you're working on a file and you want
to have a couple of amount at the same
time you need to be able to work with
multiple documents so to do that you can
there's a couple different ways you can
click and drag and bring a document out
and now this document is separate it's
it's what is called undocked and you can
make this smaller if you want to as you
can see there and then you'll just have
to use these sliders to get to the area
that you want to and to bring it back
you just come back up here onto the top
and see where there a blue box is now
taking shape there you let go and drag
it there and you
and you can use the hand tools to Center
back to where you want to go back where
you want the document to be in the
center or wherever what you want it to
be you can rearrange these by clicking
and dragging and you can see though that
mustache is on the is on the left so
that's how you organized these a little
bit better there is another way we can
use our button up here arrange documents
and by doing this we can have several
documents on one screen that are not
undocked there are nice and neat so
we've got something like this we can
have three right next to each other in a
row and you can use these sliders down
here to figure out where your document
is or you can use the hand tool and I
like using the hand tool because the the
docket the sliders are a little erratic
especially when you're kind of more
zoomed in so this one's only zoomed in
16 points six percent because it's a
large document I'm easily able to go
through here but this one is zoomed in
at 154 percent well that's not that bad
if you try to like click and drag on the
sliders like that it's not that nice
this one is a little bit easier when
you're zoomed in really far like 400% or
something like that then it gets to be a
little crazy now if you want to go back
to what you had before just click on
this one that just has one and then
everything will be there in the in the
same area or up here at the top again
with the tabs and you can of course
again use your hand tool to get
everything to where you want them to be
now there is a quicker way to set to
your artboard so that you don't have to
use the hand tool or the sliders so
let's go ahead and go into another view
like something like this and if we click
on
one of the tabs you can tell that the
tab is selected because it turns bright
white the letters turn bright white so
I'll select a tab go to view and then
you go to fit artboard in window now the
whole thing is fit in the window if we
go to view fit all in window it does the
same thing and if you have other things
outside of your if you have everything
outside of your artboard like one of
these icons would be over here in the
grey area it would fit that in as well
so if I go ahead and click on another
one view fit our board in window and
view fit upper order window that way we
could Center things easily
now the hotkey for this is ctrl 0
so using that hotkey will be a lot
faster than just going up and doing what
I just did clicking on if you fit our
board and window every time let's try
that real quick move that around I'm
just going to off-center some of these
and I'm going to go ahead and ctrl 0 and
I just hit ctrl 0 for everyone and it
was way faster so there you go that's
you don't have to go up into any menus
and look forward and find it in
everything like that so that's a about
working with multiple document windows
and working with the different in a
single document window so hopefully you
guys got the hang of that now and we can
move on to the next subject so thanks a
lot everyone have a good day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
