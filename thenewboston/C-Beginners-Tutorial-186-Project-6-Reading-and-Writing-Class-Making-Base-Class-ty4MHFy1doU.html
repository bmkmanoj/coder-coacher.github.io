tutorial that I'm making for the new
Boston and in this tutorial we're going
to begin our sixth project and basically
what we're going to be doing is creating
two classes one to replace the binary
reader and another to replace the binary
writer and that's because the binary
reader in the binary writer when they're
reading integers they don't give you the
option to read in big endian byte order
just a poly Rican little on the end and
if you don't know what the difference is
between those two were just don't
remember those at all let me explain it
so little-endian is basically reading
from right to left so reading in the
wrong direction are different from how
we read so it would go right here if we
were trying to read this in 32 right
here it would start a FC which is the
right and then continue over to the left
so it would read FC FB f E and then F F
but we want it to read in big-endian
which is from left to right so it would
read F F @ e f d FC and that's
big-endian so like I said the binary
reader just doesn't allow us to read
bytes in a big-endian
and there are some instances where
you're going to want to read in
little-endian but you're more commonly
going to want to read in big endian so
we're gonna create a class that will
default set the byte order to big endian
but you will be able to change it to
little onion if you want to so the
person that we're gonna want to do right
here is just right click on our project
put on to add and click class so we're
just gonna want to add a new class file
and we're just gonna want to call this
class file on Adams IO and we're just
gonna call it IO because in the system
dot IO namespace is where all the
readers and writers exist so it's gonna
go ahead and click Add now we're just
gonna want to call the namespace Adams
IO and not the class we're actually
gonna want to call this class right here
base IO and that's because we're gonna
have our reader and writer classes be
derived from this base IO class because
there are a couple things that would be
in both of the classes so it's just a
much cleaner way to have a base class
and then derive those two classes from
this base class right here and we're
going to want to make this class
both public and abstract and we're gonna
want to make it abstract so that no one
will be able to initialize it so we
don't want someone to go base io B
equals a new base IO because what is of
a sigh oh it's just a base class for the
reader and writer and we're gonna want
to make it public because we want to
make both the reader and writer public
and you can't inherit from a class
that's more protected than the class
that's derived from the base class all
right so inside of this class right here
we're just going to want to have an
enumeration that's gonna hold the byte
order so you'll be able to choose from a
big-endian byte order or little-endian
byte order so we're just going to want
to make this enumeration public so we
can say public enum white border and I'm
going to obviously have two things in
here the big endian byte order or
little-endian byte order and be in and
little onion all right and we're just
going to want to give them a quick
summary of what the byte order is so I'm
just going to say the order of lights
both red and red all right and there's
one more thing that we're just going to
want to have right here we're just gonna
want to have a variable that will hold
the order of the bytes that the user
chose so if it shows big-endian it'll
hold the value big-endian and if it
shows little ND and it'll hold the value
of little evidence so we're just gonna
want to create a variable that is
protected so I'm going to say protected
byte order and I'm going to call it byte
order and we're actually going to want
to make it be protected so that you can
use it in both this class and in the
derived class which will be both the
reading class and the writing class all
right so that's pretty much it for this
tutorial in the next tutorial we're
actually going to be creating a reading
and writing classes instead of got
methods to read and write bytes all
right so see you guys
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
