chemistry toro and in this tutorial i'm
gonna be answering the question that i
left you guys with last time and that is
what do you get when you combine calcium
chloride with silver nitrate so for
those of you who didn't make it to the
end of the last tutorial i'll show you
guys the problem we have calcium
chloride which is c I don't know if
that's in my make sure that's in my
screen recorder cacl2 and we went ahead
and we combined it with silver nitrate
two molecules of it so we have two agno3
now I told you guys I gave you guys the
starting point already you end up with
calcium nitrate which is Rin like ca and
let me go ahead and write my parenthesis
in a different color
no.3 and go ahead and change the blue
real quick because when I write red
parenthesis they kind of look like a C
so we have two of these and I said okay
find out what else we get pretty much
find out what this thing is right here
so let me go ahead and talk you guys
through how to solve this and you guys
can see if the answer you got matched up
with my answer maybe I'm doing around
who knows so I'm gonna go ahead and
balance this equation like I have before
right all of my chemicals so we have
calcium we have chlorine we have silver
we have nitrogen and oxygen so now let's
go ahead and count these up for the
left-hand side okay I see one calcium I
see two chlorine atoms okay for silver I
have two for nitrogen I have two and for
oxygen I have six and that's because in
this there are three and again we have
two of them so that's how I get six so
now let's go ahead and figure it out for
this side so calcium chlorine silver
nitrogen and oxygen remember those are
the chemicals that we have the chemicals
aren't going to change
they only change in a nuclear reaction
so since we know don't know what this is
yet let's go ahead and figure out what
we do know so we have one calcium
we don't have any chlorine yet we have
no silver yet and we have let's see how
many nitrogen so we have no.3 and
there's one nitrogen here and since we
have two of them we're going to say we
have two nitrogens and since we have
three oxygens in this molecule and we
have two of those total we have six
oxygen so we're gonna say okay what do
we have that is missing well we have one
calcium over here and one over here so
they cancel out
we have two nitrogens so they cancel out
all of our oxygens cancel out so what do
we have left we have two chlorines and
two Silver's so what we can do is we can
write it like this AG 2 CL 2 however the
preferred way is to kind of what's it
called not cancel everything out but
like the lowest common denominator you
know whatever that whatever that's
called so typically how people are right
it is to a G CL so we pretty much have
two of this molecule right here so that
is the final answer so there you go
hopefully now you understand what these
parenthesis mean pretty much take
everything in here and times it by this
is how many of them you have and that is
how you find out the missing molecule
and how many of them you have whenever
you're trying to balance chemical
reactions so if you got that question
thumbs up if you didn't thumbs down
maybe I'm moving too fast maybe I'm not
so anyways that's how you do double
displacement reactions in balanced
chemical reactions using them so thank
you guys for watching don't forget to
subscribe and I'll see you guys in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
