name is buddy and today in Illustrator
cs6 we're gonna learn how to create
patterns for fills that we can use and
they're gonna end up looking kind of
like something like this I'm gonna teach
you how to use them make by or with
using objects so I'm just gonna go back
so I can start out with you guys and
I'll go to nothing go ahead and pick out
some objects maybe I'll use a star tool
and I'll just draw it out draw one out
and I'll put it somewhere I'll just put
it like that's good enough and I'm gonna
actually make this a little smaller and
then I'm gonna duplicate these hold down
alt and bring it across and I'm using my
smart guides to line these up now these
should be pretty good and then we're
just going to change the color on some
of these so we can get like a cool
looking some cool of compat and pink
that's good now what you're gonna do is
you're going to select all your objects
you're gonna go to object up here in the
menu and then you're gonna go to pattern
then you're gonna go to make this will
pop-up you can choose not to show it
again all it does is saying that your
pattern has been added to the swatches
and any changes made while in pattern
editing mode will be applied to the
swatch upon exit so any this is the
pattern options over here will fit will
show you okay okay and now it's gonna
create a pattern for us and it's showing
us what it's gonna look like when it's
applied over the whole entire thing
we can now mess around with these
pattern options so the first button that
we've got here is the pattern tile tool
I click that it's just gonna create
pretty much Oh
pattern tile so go ahead and click it
make sure it's clicked and then you can
drag a square and it creates like a kind
of new tile pattern I'm just going to
hit control Z to get back to where I am
now you can name your pattern and I'll
call this color stars or something like
that
we can change our tile type bricks and
then hex or hex by row sometimes they
don't sometimes some of these don't work
well with other ones like this one
doesn't work too well with this pattern
unless that's you want the overlapping
but brick is pretty cool or grid they're
out cold it's just changing the way that
they go about each other we've got our
width in our height that we can mess
around with then we've got a size tile
to art and when you select that it's
gonna size the pattern tile to the
applied object and it's gonna specify a
horizontal and vertical spacing so I
clicked this and now you're able to
change the horizontal and vertical
spacing I don't know yeah you can change
out the spacing here as you can see
between the pattern so this is the
original pattern so there's not going to
be any spacing in between each of these
stars that I have here as you can see
over here but it's gonna do the spacing
between the group that I made the group
of stars that I made so there's going to
be spacing here and then here now that
doesn't look good on this kind of thing
because I had everything together it
would be better if everything was just
together we've got overlap and when you
have these overlaps you can switch from
left the front or bottom in front I
don't have any overlap but let's go to X
here we can switch our overlaps I have
whatever ones you want overlapping go
back to
we've got copies 5x5 copies what do we
want that's a one by one here's three by
three you can just make it big as big as
you want okay the next one dim copies to
70% or you can just keep them at a
hundred percent and show tile edge
that's gonna if I click on that you can
see it see that the blue edge here comes
off and the last one here is show swatch
bounds and then we're not really seeing
that if we go up in here into our
swatches panel you can see that color
stars is now in there and all you got to
do is click on the X here when you're
done modifying or you can just click on
this done up here and it'll be all done
now we've got the pattern here ready to
use on something else so let's go ahead
and I'm just going to delete these out
and I'm gonna make us a let's try
rectangle and we have our color Stars
pattern already selected I'll just
change this to black so it looks a
little better for the stroke I'm just
gonna make this and then inside of it is
our color stars and there we go that's
how you create a pattern to use for your
projects now if you want to delete that
out all you got to do is click on it and
like a swatches panel and then click on
delete swatch over here so that's it for
this tutorial on how to create your own
patterns out of objects and these roll
patterns will be used for filling in
your object thanks a lot for watching
everyone you guys all have a great day
today</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
