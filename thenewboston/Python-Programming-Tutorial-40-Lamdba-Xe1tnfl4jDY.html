to another tutorial and in this video I
want to talk to you about lambda L AM BD
a that's how you spell it but what is it
now I'm guessing that if you programmed
Python for any sufficient amount of time
you probably saw these little lambda
expressions laying around your program
and you may have even been able to
figure out on what they are they kind of
act as a function but first of all how
exactly do you create them and when
would you use them well first let's go
ahead and actually make a really simple
example using lambda so what lambda is
is it's basically a small function that
has no name so you know here let me just
this is just an example on them type in
whenever you make a function you define
it and you call it like tuna or
something
well these small functions these lambda
functions they don't have any name and
that's because they're just one time use
small functions only so how do you
create one type the word lambda and then
after you know how you would pass stuff
in between those parentheses right here
like you pass in a variable called X
after the word lambda that's where you
put your variable name or your input so
I'm just going to pass in some simple
variable called X and we'll just perform
a simple calculation to it so we'll say
that in this small lambda function we're
just going to pass in a number and then
we're going to multiply it by 7 so this
is a syntax for right here your input
colon and then the expression of what do
you want it to do so again this is a
small simple function that only takes
one parameter so let's go ahead and use
it right now now by default we didn't
print anything out we just calculated it
so we need to throw inside a print
function and of course this is called
answer so answer and what number are we
going to pass in we'll just say we'll
pass in five four right now so whenever
you run this check it out
it prints out 35 now obviously what we
did is we created a small lamb
function and take know it's a small
quick and nameless function so even
though we said equal to a variable right
here the function itself doesn't
actually have a name so that's important
to take away so now that we understand
exactly what it is and how we can use
them when would we ever use these things
well we could in this case senario just
go ahead and make a normal function
called like I'll multiply something by
seven but sometimes whenever you're
using like other libraries like kinter
uses this lot or TK and Tara now that's
how you pronounce it but you're going to
come across code like this whenever you
make a button if you didn't watch my
Kinser tutorials this is the basic
syntax of how you create it now of
course you need to import the Kenter
library but this is just an example you
would set the text of the button
something equal to like click me and
then you would obviously want this
button to do something to perform some
action so the built in an attribute for
that is command and you set this equal
to a name of a function however there
are going to be times where you just
want custom button functionality
something to just occur specific for
this button so you don't want to build a
function because functions are really
built whenever you need to use a bit of
code over and over and over again so
instead what you're going to see
something like this you're going to see
lambda and then of course you type you
know your custom button functionality
right here but what this achieves is
you're able to set functionality for
this button without having to build a
separate function that you're only going
to use once so you can again this
attribute right here or requires being
set to a function so that is why
whenever you need to pass in a function
you can just use lambda and you'll be
good to go so again if this is kind of
confusing then watch my kid through
toriel's and I'll explain in like a
practical real-world example how you use
this but that is one case scenario of
what lambda is when you would use it
boom roasted then guys for watching I'll
see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
