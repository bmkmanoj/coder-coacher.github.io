to another awesome tutorial in our in
this video I want to teach you guys
about data frames now data frames are
actually one of the most important and
one of the most widely used reasons to
even start using this our language
basically what a data frame is is a
spreadsheet they have rows and columns
and actually each column can be a
different vector so you don't need to
have a data frame all of numbers you can
have you know numbers characters text a
whole bunch of stuff so actually for
this example and for this tutorial what
I did is I made three vectors so you can
follow along so if you go to this and
I'll put a link below in the description
but it's a Bucky's room org slash forum
topic ID is 661 then just go ahead and
grab all this data and copy it and then
paste it right in your our studio right
here so what this is is basically three
let me minimize that it's confusing me
three individual vectors you have ID and
I don't know maybe this is like a
database for a company or something so
you have their ID numbers 1 through 15
15 different ages which you know some of
these are like three so I doubt any
three-year-old is going to be working
for a company but then you have their
names as well so you have three
individual but equal length vectors one
of them are actually two of them are
numerical and one of them is character
or text so how do we turn this into a
spreadsheet or a data frame well it's
actually really easy the first thing you
want to do is you want to give your data
frame a variable name I'm just going to
name mine X now just go ahead and do
that arrow because we're going to pretty
much make a data frame and then assign
it to the variable X and to actually
create this data frame play data dot
frame and as parameters inside those
parentheses you give it the vectors that
you want to include in your data frame
so of course
want to include the vectors ID age and
name and now if we just go ahead and
print X check it out whenever X prints
it says that this right here is our data
frame and as you can see it looks just
like a spreadsheet and I you know
Microsoft Excel and actually the cool
thing is what we can do is if we have a
spreadsheet in Microsoft Excel we can
import it in R and turn it right into a
data frame that we can do cool you know
different functions on cool calculations
I'm going to be showing you guys that
later but for now this is how you create
a data frame so as you can see it has
rows columns pretty freakin sweet now
another thing that you guys are want to
be going to want to do just go ahead and
clear my console and go back up here
another thing that we can do is
sometimes we're going to want to check
to see the number of rows and columns
because remember whenever you printed
that out this one only has 15 rows but
some data frames are going to have tons
of rows and tons of columns more than we
can count manually so what we're going
to want to do is in order to calculate
the number of rows type in row and if
you throw this in there it's going to
return the number of rows so our data
frame has 15 rows and also the number of
columns in our data frame let's see what
that is is 3 of course ID age and name
each vector is a different column so
another cool thing I probably should
teach you real quick is if you want to
do this both at the same time actually
let me just clear this and print all
this out
if you want to do all at the same time
then you can use the function di M and
what this does is it returns the number
of rows and the number of columns as
well pretty freakin sweet so alright
since I got a few more minutes I'll
teach you a couple other things before
we get into like the real um you know
confusing or hard stuff and data frames
so let me go ahead and delete this right
here clear my console and the next thing
I want to mention is sometimes you're
just going to want to return the name of
a certain column so what you can do
there is type names function and the
first thing you need to input is what do
you want to get the names of well some a
column in our data frame which is X now
after of course you say okay we want to
call them but what column well let's
just go ahead and get the name of the
second column which is age so I press 2
and basically what you're telling are is
give me the name of a column in our data
frame which column the second one so
print that out and that's why it gives
you age pretty freakin sweet and all
right got a few more minutes so the last
thing I can teach you guys is this so
whenever we print this out okay
so we have 15 rows and three columns not
that bad to see on this little console
down here but sometimes again with
really big pieces of information or
maybe if you're importing a database
from a website you're going to have a
ton of crap of crap maybe like 10,000
rows so it's sometimes useful to just
see the very top or just the very bottom
few rows so what we can do in that case
is use the head function now whenever we
do this we say just show us the head or
the first few rows of this data frame
and we run it and it shows us only the
first six rows you know it just helps
if you have too much information just
show you a little bit of it and also the
opposite of that is tail sometimes you
only want to see maybe it's the most
recent entries in your database so you
can run that and it shows you the last
six pieces of information so again if
you have a lot of data and you only and
you don't need to see it all maybe you
only need to see the beginning or the
end to verify something you can use head
or tail to see a little piece of your
molt spreadsheet basically so that is
your intro to data frame and guys we're
going to be using data frames a ton
pretty much to import data do some
awesome calculations to it and we can do
stuff like make graphs and charts it's
going to be freaking sweet so thank you
guys for watching and don't forget to
grab this on my forum so I don't have to
type all this crap out so again thanks
for watching and I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
