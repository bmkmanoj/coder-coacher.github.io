now in this case we could then force
this to be two so just sort of
recreating a login system but doing it
within one line
now if we were to go back and refresh
and I was to type in Billy Garrett and
click save settings have been updated
you saw the loading you should have seen
the loading text to come up a bit just
slightly then so you can you could see
that this is obviously just depending on
the service you know how it's running if
I click browse now you can see that
Billy Garrett has been changed to Billy
Billy has been changed to Billy Guerra
so obviously this variable here is
dependent on the user that's currently
logged in you know the system that
you've have in place on your site
however you can now start to see how
effective this is with updating values
depending on the which user has logged
in now if you wanted to go ahead and say
create a few of these fields I'm just
going to go ahead and show you how easy
this would be so we have name and then
want to copy this and paste it down here
and I'm gonna go ahead and type in let's
say email now we won't again create any
validation we'll just go ahead and
update this value so we've got this
email value here this email field here
let's go ahead and press Enter
you can see we've now got a name and
email now I'm gonna go ahead and update
my database table accordingly I'm gonna
add a new field on the end called email
the type we can set as 255 as a variable
character we now have an email field on
so at the moment Alex G and Billy
Garrett don't have an email now we're
currently logged in as Billy in
quotation marks because we're not
actually logged in so we're logged in as
Billy Garrett currently we've set this
to two so now we can go ahead and make
the appropriate changes elsewhere to
update these values as well so let's say
you've added this email input field in
here
over in Ajax Jas all you'd need to do is
go ahead and create a new variable here
grabbing the email as well as the name
so via email is now equal to e mail dot
Val remember we renamed this here email
as opposed to name what we then do is we
would pass the email value as well as
name so we we would create a comma here
an email email so we're sending another
variable called email was sent well
we're sending two variables name and
email the value of name is name from
here and the value of email is email
from here so now that we've done that
we've successfully updated Ajax to j/s
we come over to settings dot PHP and we
need to also check if the email fit or
post data is set so we create a comma
because the it'ss is set in is set
function in PHP takes multiple values so
if the name and email are set we can go
ahead and again it copy and paste this
down and email email here so it's
literally a matter of just duplicating
for each field now we need to go ahead
and update our query so we can go ahead
and update users' set name equals name
we've done that now we also want to
update where I'm sorry set email equals
email so now we have updated our users
table we've set the name is equal to the
name we've specified and the email is
equal to the email we've specified where
user ID blah blah blah like we've
already discussed so now what's going to
happen is we can not only update one at
a time but update multiple fields at a
time so at the moment we're logged in as
Billy Garrett and we're logged in as the
user ID - so the name is Billy Garrett
and the
is nothing let's go ahead and test this
out I'm gonna put the name as Billy and
I'm going to set the email as Billy at
PHP academy' the org when I click save
settings have been updated so the query
it successfully ran here this query ran
successfully when we browse again you
can see that the email has been updated
and the names changed back to Billy so
now I'm going to log back in as Alex log
back in again in quotation marks because
we're not actually logged in I'm gonna
change the user ID to one and I'm gonna
set the name to Alex and the email
address accordingly so we change this
here back to one assuming we've now
logged in as a different person Alex and
Alex are PHP academy' dog click Save you
saw that it loading text now you've seen
settings have been updated back to the
database table and you can see that the
name and email now correspond to the two
values that we put into these fields
here so using this system is extremely
easy and quick and it's also easy to
change or update for the fields that you
want to you know add into the initial
form here so you can add as many fields
as you like with as much data clicking
save will show your loading button and
then will tell you if your settings have
been updated or not just one quick thing
before we leave if I was to for example
try and mess up this query so I'll just
put up DTE instead of update when we now
go ahead to try and save it says there
was an error updating your settings so
we are rich you know we're receiving
this error message appropriately because
our query has failed
so that's updating database table values
based on a form using jQuery</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
