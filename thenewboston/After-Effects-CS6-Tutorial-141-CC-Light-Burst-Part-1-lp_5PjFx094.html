Effects cs6 tutorial and my name is
buddy Blackbird in this tutorial I want
to show you how to create an intense
lighting effect that simulates like when
your eyes are like almost like blinded
by light and everything kind of looks
blurry but still like very lit up so the
way we're gonna do that is by using an
effect called CC light burst 2.5 and
this is an After Effects cs6 and we're
gonna apply it as an adjustment layer
and I'm gonna go over how it works as on
just any old there and how it works as
an adjustment layer because it works
differently so let's get started and
what I what I am going to do is just
delete out my layer that I have here
actually I want to show you what what it
kind of looks like and what you can do
with it I just made a simple animation
with it
so let's check it out it's kind of
simulates when someone like maybe like
wakes up in the morning and they're
looking up at the sky and maybe they see
this logo in their face somehow and you
can keyframe how intense it is and how
intense it isn't so this is what you can
kind of do with it and this is what
we're gonna show you how to do so let's
I'm gonna delete out my adjustment layer
that I have here and we're just gonna
start out with a solid background
because I want to show you how it works
actually we'll just start out like this
and I'm gonna show you how it works in
like a picture like this so I've picked
out a picture that has a realistic
looking light source coming from the
back that would possibly be pretty
bright so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
add an adjustment layer and I go to
layer new adjustment layer I'm going to
cut come up on to the effects panel but
I'm gonna right click on this and go to
effect generate cc light burst 2.5
and this is the default settings that it
comes out with now this doesn't look too
realistic because because of the way we
are looking at things so the light
source should be coming up from here but
instead it looks like it's coming from
straight behind so what we need to do is
move this Center right here and if I
click on this little crosshairs it
brings up the cursor where I can set the
light source from wherever I want so I
click from here and now it looks more
like I'm looking down at the logo and
the light source is coming from the
middle here and you can see the Rays
that are coming out now we've got our
intensity here and we've got our ray
lengths these are your main things that
you want to use so if we lower the
intensity just watch what happens to the
scene it doesn't it you can see where
from the center it lowers the light
source and everything like that so if I
just increase it a little that was a
little change and if I increase it a lot
you can see how much it blows out and
everything got to else onto the scene
now we've got our ray length here which
is going to change how long these rays
are on like the logo and on the
background and everything basically how
long it's blurred out kinda so if I put
this down to something like 10 the Ray
length is way less I put it to something
like 30 the Ray length is half of almost
half of what it was last time and I
thought there's something like hundred
it's gonna be away like blurred out
which is fine sometimes
so I keep it on 50 right now now we've
got our burst here which is a drop-down
menu that has three different sections
so we've got fade which is one that you
most likely usually want to use you got
straight which the in the fade the fade
you your light rays fade out into pretty
much like fade out into like nothing and
in this straight here
the light rays don't fade out you can
see the word delicious spa again and the
it kind of like extends like a blurry
version of the logo and then you also
have Center which pretty much comes just
brings everything from the center and
everything like that and you can see
what these do better on the I'm just
like a solid background but there's the
idea of that then you got halo alpha and
our background doesn't have an alpha so
it's gonna just do nothing and we've got
a set color which is kind of useless and
does this you can end up picking a color
and I mean pretty much just like it just
does something like that where you can
lower the passive if you want it just
pretty much pays a huge color and there
is intensity in the background so if I
turn this up maybe you can see how it
gets intensified you there's like a
light source looking thing there that
you can use so that's how that works
usually I don't use set color it's not
that great so that's how it works as an
adjustment layer now we can keyframe
things in here so let me change this
back to fade because that's most natural
and I'll just come into in like one
second
and then we can keyframe the ray length
and the intensity and then over time we
can just lower those lower to zero and
like zero again let's see what that
looks like and if I do a ram preview
it's gonna do that thing that I do the
animation that I had last time
now I'm Ram preview net right now so we
can see what's going on</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
