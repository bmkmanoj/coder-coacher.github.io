go ahead and start writing some code
shall we so redux how the heck does this
thing work all right what is the first
thing that we need to make well my guess
is this big store right here so what
does this say this is pretty much as one
big JavaScript object that stores all of
the data for your entire application
simple enough so how do we go ahead and
actually make this thing well what we do
is we need to import a function called
create store big surprise there from the
redux modules so imports create store
and this is in the module burritos so we
already installed that should be in your
node modules and there you go
now one other thing that I probably just
want to mention real quick you see
whenever we import this and this then
this was kind of generic but then we
imported create store and we surrounded
it with curly braces why the heck did we
do that
well you know how whenever you import a
module you can use things from those
modules well if you just want to use
like one variable or one function from
it and you can wrap it in curly braces
and what this saves you from doing is
instead of writing bar great store
equals redux great store since this is
such a common technique instead of
having to make a separate variable and
transfer it over and then you had the
ability to use it whenever you wrap it
in these curly braces you're pretty much
doing that in one big Spang so right now
already we can just use create store and
just use the like a function so let's
actually go ahead and do that
so I'm going to make this a constant and
anytime you're pretty much using a
variable and you're only going to be
making it one time in not changing its
value at all you probably want to make
it a constant in the reason for this is
because first of all if you try to
change it later on then you're going to
throw air so it ensures that you don't
accidentally change
value and also it helps with performance
so Const store is going to be equal to
create story now again the store is all
of the data for your entire application
now this is actually going to be
changing but we are not changing in code
we're not going to say something like
store equals something new or else that
will throw an error if you guys want to
see how that works then just stick
around it's actually pretty interesting
now the store is all the data for your
application but how does it know what
data it's supposed to store I think
that's what it stands for a data storage
by the way just between me new alright
let's look at this handy diagram so the
data that gets saved in the store is
determined by things called reducers so
a reducer is pretty much just like I
said it's a function that says what data
were supposed to save in our store now
whenever we make our application we're
going to have a bunch of different parts
of data we're going to need to save a
bunch of users we're going to need to
save a bunch of videos a bunch of songs
or ages of people who knows whatever the
heck we want to save on our website now
instead of just making one big function
to kind of manage all this what we do is
we break it up into separate reducers so
we're going to have a movies reducer
users reducer users reducer users
reducer can make a rap song out of that
so since we're going to have all these
reducers let's just go ahead and make a
new directory so we can kind of organize
everything so this directory is just
going to be named reducers and by the
way this application that I'm making is
going to be really easy arm all I'm
going to have is a bunch of users names
at the top and then whenever you click
one it displays your profile or details
below so again it's a really kind of
dumb application you're probably not
going to make millions of dollars from
it but to explain redux it's perfect and
I can print my
to explain all the concepts so that's
why I decided to go with this anyways
moving on inside this reducers directory
I'm going to go ahead and make a new
javascript file and I'm just going to
name it reducer users so again inside
here what I'm going to have is a
function that returns the part of
application responsible for storing the
users so later on whenever we delete
users whenever we add new users whenever
we change a user's name this function is
going to be used so that's all we're
doing and again since we're going to
want to include this in another part of
our application we actually need to
export it so export default function so
all this function is going to do is
return an array of users that's it how
easy is that so I'm going to hit return
an array and now I just have to type in
a bunch of users and let me actually
pause the video because I don't think
you guys want to see me take 10 minutes
typing in users</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
