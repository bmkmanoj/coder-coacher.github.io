gun kit in the van that's beautiful I
think I'm going to send that to my
girlfriend oh sorry guys I didn't even
notice that I was recording right now
that's embarrassing
but anyways welcome to your second
Photoshop tutorial and in this lesson I
want to start going over the tools in
Photoshop different from a tool that you
meet like at a bar or something because
these tools aren't douchebags so that's
probably why you know schools aren't
allowed to watch my tutorials because I
say things like douchebags I'm trying to
make a professional video here many ways
you can see all the tools in Photoshop
on the left hand side all these little
buttons icons right here are photo shops
tools now each tool does a different job
much like tools in real life for example
you have tools for selecting images or
items the most common one is the move
tool the one at the top that looks like
a arrow
and uh you know four different arrows I
guess you also have tools like paint
brushes where you can obviously paint
something like lines whatever there's
some tools for adding text the text tool
or right here a bunch of different tools
to do different things that you commonly
what are used to alter your image in
some way now before I go into detail of
what each of these tools does because
that would take forever there are
actually over 70 tools in Photoshop and
every tool probably needs an individual
tutorial to fully explain the
capabilities of each what I'm going to
do in this video is I'm just going to
show you around the basic overview of
how to use and navigate your tools panel
so you see that there are about 20 tools
visible right now
but I said that Photoshop has over 70 so
was i lying well no I wasn't a bunch of
tools are grouped under the same button
and you can tell if the tool has more
tools under the same button because some
tools you see this move tool right here
there's not an arrow on the bottom right
hand corner but other tools like this
they have these arrows on the bottom
right hand corner if you look closely so
in order to access other tools that are
grouped with
just go ahead and click that and you can
see that once you do a submenu pops up
so this tool actually has a rectangle
elliptical single row and single column
tool all under the same button so why
does Photoshop do this well it just
helps organize similar tools and you
know just helps you know less clutter I
guess so that's how you access similar
tools in a cool way that you can change
from tool to tool if you're really lazy
is you can use obviously to select the
tool you can click it and then you're
working with that tool but each tool
also has a hotkey as well now what is a
hotkey well if you hover over the tool
it tells you the tool name for example
this is the move tool this is the single
column magnetic lasso tool so say that
we're working with this Spot Healing
Brush tool and we want to switch to the
magnetic lasso tool but we are Whaley
lazy we're eating you know a big burrito
with our right hand so what we can do is
we can see that it says magnetic lasso L
in the parenthesis so we can just go
ahead and hit L on our keyboard and now
we're on ethically working with the
magnetic lasso tool so to select a tool
you can either click it with your mouse
or use the hotkey and how do you figure
out the hotkey if you hover over it it's
in parentheses so move tool is V you
want to remember that one because this
is a common one now aside from you know
selecting tools and seeing all the sub
tools tools also have options so what I
mean by that probably the easiest one I
can explain right now is the paintbrush
tool now the paintbrush tool is of
course the one that looks like a
paintbrush right here right under your
Spot Healing Brush and its hotkey B so
whenever you click it you can see that
these buttons at the top change now
these options are going to change
depending on which tool you select for
your brush tool you select things like
size of the brush how big do you want
your brush should be the shape of your
breasts do you want to be skinny or big
and thick now all of the settings are
right here for example the opacity
is pretty much how much you can see
through so each of these options pretty
much you can select in different ways
some have drop-down menus some have
sliders like this so if I only wanted it
50% opacity change that to 50% now it
would be lighter and you can also change
this by using another shortcut slider
where a lot of people don't know about
this but if you hover over the name
opacity you can see that your icon or
your cursor rather it changes to a
little finger with two arrows on each
side just go ahead and click and drag
left and right in again I don't know why
Photoshop did this because you know
whoever is too lazy like okay I want to
change the opacity but I'm not clicking
this and then sliding it I'm just going
to you know I just want to click one
thing and then drag you know I guess you
can do it this way but I like using the
slider you know in case anyone wants to
know so you know all of these tools have
different shapes and different options
and again if you're working with the
tool and then you see a different list
of options that probably means that you
have the wrong tool selected so that's
all I wanted to mention on tools and
before I let you guys go I guess I have
time to show you guys how to do one more
thing actually you know what that's
really for another tutorial because it's
a whole separate subject because now
that you know how to work with tools and
know all about panels I think it's time
do you say you know what it's time to
create our own new document so in the
next tutorial we're going to be showing
you or I'm going to be showing you how
to create a new document it's going to
be awesome it's probably going to be the
best video that you guys ever saw on
YouTube so I think guys for watching
don't forget to subscribe and I'll see
you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
