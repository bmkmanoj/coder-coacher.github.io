up our actual website now I'm going to
be using the lamp stack in the lamp
stands for Linux Apache MySQL and PHP
it's really popular and since we already
have Linux installed remember whenever
we first set up the server Ubuntu which
is a flavor of Linux it came installed
by default the only thing we need to
install is Apache MySQL in PHP now if
you're wondering what the heck is Apache
Apache is a web server so right now our
server that we're looking at right here
is just a computer and the only thing
though he can do to it is connect to it
and disconnect to it not all that
exciting
so what Apache is like I said it's a web
server it's going to turn the server
give it the ability to serve web files
and right now if we go to our IP address
actually if we just click go to check it
out this is what happens whenever we try
to connect to the server right now the
web page is not available could actually
refused arm I'm just like a regular role
playing computer so I don't know if
you're trying to look at a web site but
I don't have those capabilities yet so
let's change that right now now what
we're going to be using is a tool called
apt and this is a package manager that's
already built into Linux it's
essentially a way that we can really
really easily install things on our
server that's all it is so anytime we
ever want to install anything we have to
use a sudo command since it's a root
privilege and apt-get means I want to
install something and you usually just
type something like install like PHP or
whatever but before we do any of that I
actually just want to update this tool
so we're going to update it hit enter
and your password and it's going to say
ok get the most you know the latest
version of this tool so now app is
updated actually let me just clear this
so we can run sudo apt-get
install apache2 now hit enter is going
to go ahead and download it from
wherever it is install it on the server
make sure you hit Y and it's going to
configure everything again this tool is
incredibly awesome it pretty much does
everything for you so it said okay
everything was good let me just clear
this out and check it out so now
whenever user connects our site we can
serve them web files so that's great and
all but unless we just want to be
serving them regular old boring HTML you
know we probably should set a MySQL in
PHP so we can make some you know cool
interactive websites so before you
install PHP it's always a good idea to
install MySQL so you got the backend wit
so sudo apt-get this is just a tool
install MySQL - server now if you just
run this it's going to work but you also
want to install another code of PHP 5 -
MySQL so this is your plain old MySQL
that you can use for any language and
this additional one right here is
helpful later on whenever try to
integrate MySQL with PHP so we might as
well just do it all in once your bank
hit Enter you want to continue yes and
this is just saying ok
whenever I install this is going to take
up this much space on your hard drive
are you sure you want to use it well yes
we do and let it do its thing so now
it's just asking us to enter a password
for MySQL root user whenever we try to
administrate MySQL so type any thing
that you want and hit enter alright so
after about a minute we now have the
MySQL server installed on our main
server now what we have to do after this
is if I clean this up alright we want to
run a command called sudo my SQL I could
type write MySQL underscore install
underscore DB so we have the main server
setup
but now what this command does is it
installs and sets up the directory
structure in other words the location
that we're actually going to store all
of the databases so hit enter and look
at that it took like half a second now
one last command that we need is just
for security purposes
the default installation of MySQL has a
lot of common vulnerabilities so if you
run sudo my SQL underscore secure
underscore installation then it says
current paths root enter it and you want
to change the root password no I do not
and for the rest of this you can just
hit enter you keep all the default
settings enter enter enter enter and
boom so we set up the MySQL server we
set up the directory structure where
we're going to stick all of our
databases and also we ran that secure
script to remove all of the common
vulnerabilities my SQL is now set up
Apache is now set up the last thing we
have to do is install PHP is pretty easy
so I'll see you guys next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
