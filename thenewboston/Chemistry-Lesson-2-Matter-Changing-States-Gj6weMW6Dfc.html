second chemistry tutorial and in this
tutorial since we already covered what
matter is we can begin discussing how
matter can change States and I'm not
talking about matter getting up and
moving to California because it got in a
fight with its brother I'm saying that
matter can change states between solids
liquids gases and there's something
called plasma but we don't worry about
that until like the thirtieth tutorial
so anyways a solid isn't always stuck as
a solid it can become a liquid or even a
gas so that's why I said solids whenever
they convert to liquids you guys
probably already know this it's called
melting easiest example is an ice cube
turning into water whenever that happens
the process is called
melting my ice cubes melted and
someone's unhappy about it now my drinks
warm so the temperature that this it's
different for every substance but the
temperature that a substance can melt or
will melt is called the melting point
for that substance so furthermore
whenever you have a piece of ice and you
heat it up the particles in that piece
of ice let's go ahead and say this is a
piece of ice right here the particles
and that piece of ice are jam-packed
together but when you go ahead and heat
it up those particles are going to gain
energy and they're going to start
shaking and going crazy and eventually
they're going to get so much energy
they're going to start breaking apart
from each other and whenever they break
apart they're kind of doing their own
thing flowing freely and they might be a
little bit clumped together but they
aren't stuck together like to solve it
anymore so that's what happens whenever
you add energy and we'll talk about
energy later on but whenever you add
energy to a solid the particles shake
and once they shake enough they break
apart until they become a liquid so
that's the process of melting and if you
want some fun facts I guess the melting
point for ice is 32 degrees Fahrenheit
or zero degrees Celsius pretty
interesting huh so now let's go ahead
and talk about the boiling point and you
guys may understand this but there's
probably going to be a couple things
that I need to touch on so whenever you
have a liquid and it goes to a gas
this process is called boiling for
example if you had a pot of water and
you heated it up until it became steam
that would be called boiling the water
you guys probably already know about
this for making macaroni and cheese when
you're a kid you just then have these
cool arrows and stuff so typically and I
say typically because there are some
exceptions which we're going to be
talking about later on typically the
process is solid to liquid to gas in
this example I took a piece of ice it
you would heat it up and it would become
water and if you heat it up that water
it would become steam but check it out
all of this is all water so it's just in
different states ice is technically
water waters of course water and steam
is technically water it's just a gas
form of it so how do scientists and
chemists distinguish between these three
whenever they're writing it on paper
well what they do is if they have a
substance in they want to determine what
state it's in they just write s L or G
in parenthesis so this would be h2o
solid which would be ice h2o liquid
which would be water or I say water it's
all technically water but an h2o G which
would mean gas and this would be the
steam of ice in another fun fact the
boiling point for water is 212 degrees
Fahrenheit or 100 degrees Celsius so if
we went ahead and looked at whenever you
heated up water sea waters all kind of
clump together sliding around the
particles right now and you heated it up
enough and gave it enough energy these
particles would just go effing crazy
they would be bouncing all over the
place kind of all doing their own random
thing so this is what happens whenever
you give energy drinks to kids and also
apply energy to water so remember that
parenting tips and chemistry lessons all
in one for free the New Boston com
so now there's only one other thing whoa
actually two other things but I won't
spoil the surprise to the end the
freezing point is whenever you take a
gas and convert it to a liquid so now
we're going in the other direction we
have that something that has a lot of
energy and we're taking some energy away
so whenever we have
gasps and we turn it back into a liquid
it's called condensation and whenever we
have a liquid and we turn it into a
solid
it's called freezing so basically
whenever you cool down water it's going
to eventually become a solid ice so
whenever you take the energy way the
particles are going to get closer and
closer together until they're tightly
packed together again so whenever you
apply energy to something the particles
are going to go crazy
whenever you take energy away the
particles are going to get closer
together again we'll talk about energy
later on but uh yeah just want to say
that and by the way I'm not going to
give you the freezing temperature in the
boiling temperature because they're the
same is pretty much what I'm saying is
the freezing points and the condensation
points are the same as the melting and
boiling points you know what I'm saying
at 100 degrees all the same stuff
happens except in Reverse so you may be
thinking okay I see what's going on here
solid to liquid to gas done with this
tutorial but hold on you know said
there's some time left on this YouTube
video and that's for this little baby
right here BAM sublimation my favorite
thing this is when substances go
directly from solids to gases pretty
weird huh
so an example of this that you guys can
probably picture is dry ice if you ever
went to a magic show when you're a
little kid or maybe you know recently I
guess they have this like block of dry
ice and it's like this white block and
it just emits steam from it well that
steam is actually a gas in that what's
happening is that matter is going
through something called sublimation
that solid is turning directly into a
gas skipping the metal liquid state
right here so it pretty much skips this
thing right here and converts straight
to a gas another example of this that
you might see more often is if you ever
had a house that was really smelly and
you bought one of those air fresheners
that it was like kind of like a gel and
you open it a little bit and it smelled
if you open it more it made your whole
room smell
next time you're like at the grocery
store look for those those gels they
don't convert to a
liquid before turning into a gas they
pretty much go directly from a solid a
gel to a gas which makes your room smell
nice hopefully if your rooms like really
smell it and you have like dirty baloney
sandwiches on your bed then there's no
use you got to clean it but if you know
it's just a little smelly then you can
go ahead and get them that's what I do
so anyways um nice little fun factoid
there are reverse of this whenever gases
go directly to solid is called
deposition but we don't really talk
about that because you know sublimation
is just such a more fun word to say in
sublime is one my favorite bands so
anyways that's all I'm going to ramble
about for this tutorial so thank you
guys for watching don't forget subscribe
and I will see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
