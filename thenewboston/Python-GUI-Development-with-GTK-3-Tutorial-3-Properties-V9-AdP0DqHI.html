to talk to you a little bit more about
properties so basically what we're gonna
be doing is we already know that we can
create a window and once we have a
window we can add widgets to it now
wedges are just any item or thing that
you add to it like a button like a
slider or progress bar a menu you know
basically anything that people want to
add to their windows now once you have a
widget on there you can adjust it using
its properties so properties of items
are different depending on the item but
they're like it's color
the text that's on it you know the size
of it the angle whatever so we have a
window widgets the widgets have
properties and not only can you set
different properties for different
widgets but you can also get the
properties of them so say that you have
some label and you want to you know get
the text of it or get the angle from it
you can do that as well so instead of me
just blabbering I'll show you guys an
example so let me just make a real quick
widget and I'm just gonna make a label
which is essentially just text on the
screen and I'll just call it label and
set it equal to g TK dot label alright
so we have a label this is just a blank
label um you know there's this is text
but right now it's just blank so let's
just actually set some text for it so
label set label and I'll just read yeah
like OMG I think the new Boston is
awesome alright so this label has a
property of label which is kind of weird
I probably should start with something
else but there you go let's go ahead and
set another properties so set I'll just
angle it as well so you know most text
that appears in your gooeys just you
know exactly horizontal left and right
you can also angle it if you want and
let me angle this by 30 degrees so the
text that appears is going to be kind of
crooked so I don't know maybe if you
wanted some cool kind of effect like
you're going uphill or some
all this craps popping into my brain
right now and uh yeah that might as well
set one more so set hate your line now
we'll talk more about layouts and how
things are lined but for this i'll just
want to make sure that it looks all
right so I'll just write a line and all
right so I saw that you can create an
item in items or widgets can have
properties now once you're done
adjusting your item exactly how you want
it how you want it to appear then you
always need to add it to the screen so
in order to add things just right window
so what do you want to do tier one no
well I want to add something all right
what do you want to add to it well we
only have one thing to add and that is
the label so now if we run this check it
out we got this awesome window that has
a label in it and how does your label
appear well we just set all those
properties essentially just you know
angled nothing that great now like I
said we can set properties or tell the
label how to look and behave but we can
also get properties so what if we're
making this program that I don't know
allowed users to make text in funny ways
and we wanted to see what angle they had
set well what we can do is we can call
label and see before we were setting
properties set set set well anytime we
want to get the value of property just
right get properties right there what
properties do you want to get angle so
this is gonna get the angle get the
value of it which is 30 and check it out
so says 30 right there so now we can use
that and this pops up like before so now
we can use that in incorporate a newer
program however we want but now we know
a little bit more about how the overall
basic you know programs are set up and
the different things that we can do a
and items to him and we also know how to
set and get properties so now that we
got that of late in the upcoming
tutorials we're gonna be going over more
widgets and I'll show you guys some
really cool properties that you can add
or you know change on them too so
looking forward to that I'll see you
guys next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
