tutorial and I'm making forth New Boston
and in this tutorial I'm gonna be
showing you how to get text off of a web
page and for this tutorial it won't seem
to have a button a text box and a label
the web page that we're going to be
getting text off of is basically the web
page on kanji net that displays all the
progress and information for below reach
and you can obviously use the method
that we're going to be using on any web
page this web page is a great example of
it so and that's why we have a text of
the label saying last played because
we're going to be getting a steroid here
the last time you play the game so once
you have your form looking similar to
this just go ahead and double click on
your get stats button the first thing
we're going to want to do is create a
web browser so that we can actually get
the information off of age do a new web
browser and when the user clicks on the
button one I have them navigate to this
web page right here so what's going to
say aw you got to navigate that web page
and then we're just gonna pass through
the URL of this web page right here and
right here where it says player equals
that's the person's gamertag that you're
viewing so it's my gamertag an
experiment 5x is spirit of 5x right
there so if you wanted a view like major
Nelson's information you just type Major
Nelson in right there so we're gonna
make it so that this will work for any
curses of information not just your own
so we're gonna have the user enter in
the purses gamertag that they want to
view the information about so what some
have it instead of percent Spearman
right here we're just been having add
whatever textures in the text box going
on flex now we'll go to the web page of
whatever gamertag the user inputs in
this text box so now we're actually
going to be going for this label you're
looking for this little
however before we can do that we have to
wait until video what they'd is loaded
or infer the document uploaded so we're
going to using the document completed
event so we're just going to create a
new event handler for that person plus
equals and then a tab toys to create a
method so now whenever when the web page
is completely loaded then it will do
this method and whatever code is in here
will be executed and now that we let
people is loaded we can actually look
for this label right here so normally
look for that we're going to using WB
document document document property and
then get to use the get element by ID
method and basically an element is just
anything on this web page and this is an
element right here so in order to get
the ID of this element we're just gonna
want to right click on it and click
inspect element and you can only do that
if you're on Google Chrome and I suggest
you download it anyways visit the very
program but anyways if you're on Google
Chrome you can right click on it and
just put the inspect element and then
right here it'll just jump you right to
the spa and the web pages source where
that is so the code for this is right
here and as you can see the text of this
label is the third of Mar or the 27th of
March 2011 so in order to get this text
we're going to be searching for it by
its ie so the idea right here at 7
equals whatever Texas is so in order to
get this text we're just gonna double
click on it and copy it so now we get
element by I mean there's much I've been
the idea here and now it will just go
right to this element earlier this later
now in order to get the text of the
label we're just gonna say not enter
text the inter type of property and that
will just get to the text right inside
of these things right here so now we're
going to set label ones just equal to
that
but we're also gonna have the latest
text to say like last blade and then
we'll add this to it so now I'm gonna
bug here and type in someone's name or
tag and click get stats we should see
last flavor here and we should see the
27th of March and 2011 yep perfect and
this will obviously work for any other
stat as well for example if we wanted to
get like the armory completion repeat
the process right click on it click
inspect element copy the idea right here
it is double click on it obvious it and
here when I pass it through the
parameter who get element by ID method
and then the inner text property to get
the text of that label or the text
inside of these two things right here so
we should get 16% and let's actually say
you want instead of last play and we
shouldn't see 16% armory completion 16%
perfect so that's it for this tutorial
so see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
