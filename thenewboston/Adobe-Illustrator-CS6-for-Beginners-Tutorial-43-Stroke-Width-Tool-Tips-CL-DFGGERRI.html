this Illustrator cs6 tutorial we're
gonna learn how to create variable
stroke widths and we're gonna use the
width tool what I mean by creating
variable stroke widths is that I'm gonna
be able to change different parts of the
stroke width in my line here so I just
made a line segment and it has a stroke
of nine points on it and then I can
start creating things like this and
making the stroke widths different at
different parts of the of the line
segment so let's go ahead and get
started draw a line with the line
segment tool and if you hold shift you
can draw a straight line it's up to you
and then you can adjust the stroke
weight here by clicking on the arrow
buttons or just typing in a stroke
weight that you want to use I already
have mine so I'm just going to delete
that one and I'm gonna click on the
stroke width here or the width tool here
I mean and if you click and hold there's
a couple other tools but the width to
little should be on top so there's some
other tools if it's hidden behind that
and the first thing you want to do is
see you can see that there is like a
little dot on your path line and that's
how you know that you're on the tool you
can click and you can it will put a
point down for you you click and drag up
or down and it'll create a variable
width for you now you can click on the
point and drag it to move it along the
path if you want to you can click on the
outside edges to increase the size or
decrease the size so you can do
something like that where it's super
small or you can make a bigger another
thing that you could do is double click
on the middle point you bring up the
width point edit this way you can adjust
the each side individually with a more
of a fine-tune so if I start increasing
size side one it's going to
make it taller on just the one side by
do side to it's going to make it taller
on the bottom side here's the constraint
proportions button click that to link
them together and if I start upgrading
size one it's gonna do the same to size
to side too you can also do the same
thing with the total width here this
will bring them both up as well if you
click on this adjust the joining with
points it's going to adjust these sides
as well that are next to it that joined
this one right here okay another thing
that you can do is if you hold down alt
and drag on one of the sides you can
just adjust that side if you hold down
alt and drag on the middle point it'll
create another point for you and then if
you want to add some more points I'm
gonna add a few more points too so for
the sake of adding more points and then
if I hold shift and click I'm gonna be
able to select multiple points and then
adjust all those points at once by shift
click on one that I already had selected
it'll come off and then I won't be
adjusting that point as you can see
there so this way you can create
different shapes with your stroke let's
get back to a regular line all right
there we go we just have a regular line
now so if you want to start creating
your own profiles if you two like save
for later or anything like that you can
do that in the stroke menu or you can
check up here at the top we've got a
there's a couple profiles that are
already be there and you can click on
these make sure you have your stroke or
your stroke selected if I click on this
one it's going to change it to that and
all types of things like this you can
mess with your kit end caps you want to
and all that we've
so got the profiles over here in the
stroke menu which are these three lines
we can pick from those as well and just
to get back to the normal one you want
to go to uniform now if you have a
profile that you created such as
something like this and you actually
want this fat part to be on the left
side all you got to do is click this
button and it will flip it along the
side if you need to do that in there
opposite on the across going across from
each other so if they're different like
this one you can flip across using this
button here if you need to if you add a
point and you want to delete it all you
got to do is select the point when you
have the widt tool selected like this
one I can select and if I hit delete
it's just gonna delete it for me let me
go back to uniform this has brought the
let me go to the selection tool this has
brought the stroke way down bring it
back up there we go go back to uniform
and there now I got a regular stroke
here but that's how you use the width
tool shift W is the hockey and that's
all about I need to tell you on that so
go ahead and mess around with it the
more you mess around with it the better
feel you can get for it and instead of
just watching the video and then go and
hope to do it later you might forget
some things so and get a feel for how
this works so thanks a lot for watching
you guys and I look for you seeing you
guys in the next tutorial see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
