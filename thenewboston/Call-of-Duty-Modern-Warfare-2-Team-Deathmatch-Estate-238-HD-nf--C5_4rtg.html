welcome to another gaming video and this
game of course is modern warfare and
we're playing this on xbox and actually
in this video is not me playing it is
one my friends Kyle and Kyle is one of
my friends like I said and he's gonna be
helping out and he's going to be doing
all my video game tutorials for now but
he's not here right now so I'm gonna
have to do the narration for this video
and again like I said this is him
playing not me you guys are just so
lucky thing at me to do the narration
next time I mean this time so here is
right here I just got stabbed in the
back very honorable I didn't like that
at all but what he's doing is he's in
the ump45 for most of this and
unfortunately he has to use my account
he's a level 70 of course and on my
account I'm a noob so I'm only like a
level thirty something so you know that
kind of slowed him down but he is still
that good anyways where it doesn't
really bother him so like I said in this
game he's using UMP 45 and of course if
he couldn't so we're playing a team
deathmatch Express and he's at the
estate right now in the secondary weapon
is the spas-12
and i think it has a red dot on it i
actually think he switches up classes
throughout the game but uh yeah that's
pretty much it so yeah
yeah in the face right there the guy
never even had a chance
so you see he's just pretty much not
sniping although told me he does like
snipe in a direction and there's another
thing that reminded me yes - actually
he's my killstreaks so even if he gets a
32 Shrieker 25 he can't get the nuke
anyways because he's like he's on my
account and I pretty much sucked in
modern warfare as I do every other game
and that's actually why I got him to do
my game gaming tutorials for me and I'm
gonna be sticking with a you know
computer program because that's my thing
I mean just looking like and this is
actually um one of the this isn't even
one of the better videos that he
recorded for me so even though he's
going to phone everyone in this game
this is pretty much not even average for
him so let's take a look and see what
he's doing
yeah this guy has changed I don't think
so payback and double kill game time so
as you see like I said he's not doing a
lot of sniping here although he does
sometimes I pretty much this se says
running and gunning and like this pretty
much dominating everyone I can't even
move as fast is making me dizzy just
look at it but he no problem for him so
you see in the lead already good job
Kyle and hopefully we keep the quality
up on these tutorials and I know a lot
of other modern warfare sort of quality
isn't that good so that's what I'm
trying to bring you guys the best
quality and another thing if you want to
get I know
by default this quality is yeah that
guy's not going to make it the qualities
are right on this but if you guys want
to watch it in even better high def then
at the bottom of this video where it
says 360 go ahead and change that the
720 and even though this is clear it's
comes amazingly clear if I only do that
if you have like a really good internet
connection or it's going to suck so go
ahead and take out that a flamer right
there and then you can go ahead and walk
in here and whoever is up here is not
going to have a chance so let's go ahead
and watch him run around some and come
out down there good you better not be
down there and anyone down here yeah
smart very smart or else you're good
bullet to the head if you work so let's
go ahead and let's watch him run around
out by the car and this is where I was
just like but he seems to be doing a lot
better than I can and yeah for kill
shrieks air drop a little too easy
psycho Street predator missle too easy
and I pretty much I can't even get the
UAV so and I have whatever the perk is
to get one less my I think my biggest
kill streak I ever gotten playing in
like a year sick three so you know that
is exactly why I'm not doing as good as
it is so this is just like taking candy
from a baby
taking a bottle from baby taking
everything from baby just ponen everyone
so yeah this is what you guys get to
look forward to a bunch of other videos
of watching him play and fortunately not
me and trust me we saw me play one of
these
you throw see how I would never do that
I never even got that predator missle
and so let's see who else he kills now
yeah this guy's done guaranteed and
payback so game time so let's see what
it a CR bling right here come out from
distance and now we got another airdrop
have no idea
totally impressive and like I said
you're going to be doing a modern
warfare videos probably a lot of these
and also we're going to be finishing up
our Mass Effect videos show us what you
wanted and if you guys have any other
gaming videos that you want to see any
other game for the Xbox 360 whether it's
like new bold anything in-between this
guy Kyle he pretty much can put a game
in and be expert at it in like two
seconds so one of the best gamers I've
ever seen
so if you have any requests just give us
a comment or don't send me a message
because I probably won't read it to be
honest
leave a comment on this video saying
what um what game you want to see and
I'll buy it and he'll do it and that's
the deadly combination right there so in
another thing we're going to be putting
out a ton of these videos and it's for
you guys as a striker so anyways let's
get back to the game watching want some
more noobs this guy looking to running
away doesn't know Gina look he's just
like felling ground he's like I give up
no I'm gonna shoot you in the head
anyways no giving up here in this riot
shield yeah I hate people the riot
shields by the way why just because they
walk up to me like this
and oh that what Jeep shot they pretty
much just walk up to me and then the
slice me I'm like WTF man what's up with
that and I pretty much can't do I think
I just take out my little pistol my
pop-pop but you know it doesn't work and
I also used the new two lot of time
which people pay in oh come on
they have to like shoot them in the head
like eight times before he dies that's
bull and you know I even with those two
desk recently I bet he's still winning
this right here so yeah that's payback
Jenna three back maybe god I'm gonna
come up around here and pretty good play
just disappear what's that glitch no I
don't think so
he's probably just a ran away because
Kyle was about to bone them dams gonna
run up here and I wonder if we're going
to run like this in real life I mean
this guys have been sprinting for like
ten minutes so anyways let's run out
here see if anyone's back here oh you
yeah I'll just shoot you in the chest
and by me I mean Kyle of course I just
like to talk smack because doing this
video really is the only kind of smack
I'm ever gonna get the you know just for
a little bit pretending that I'm this
guy I'm as good as Kyle but you know I'm
really not so go ahead and yeah there
better not be anyone up there
girl see phone yeah and go ahead and run
up here someone shot me from back and
let's see what else I think I think he
totally cleared out every single person
in this map oh no is that another one
yeah he's got a shotgun you to the back
very nice very name and let's see let's
see what else so go ahead and let's see
what gun is using spas he's using spots
too over right now run up these stairs
and now when he's making these videos
I'll tell him to give you guys like tips
and stuff but you guys really don't want
me giving you tips because it will only
make you a worse
Modern Warfare player than you were
before so I'm not going to do that to
you guys I'm really just here for the
entertainment and pretty much just
testing out the video quality so yeah
you think this guy has a chance I don't
think so
where'd he go here we go Oh fine down
there huh yeah can't hide for too long
let's go payback anything else and the
best sickness is online my doctor that's
embarrassing the preparation named
himself the vasectomy secretly try to
disguise it Amy in too easy so that's
after this video I hope you guys enjoyed
