be starting to talk about some cool math
functions however before I do I want to
show you guys what someone posted on
Bucky's room real quick for some reason
I thought this was a property more funny
than actually is probably because it has
a cheeseburger in it and I think
cheeseburgers are hilarious what I said
as for a MacBook Air for my birthday and
they posted a picture of a Big Mac a
book and a bag of chips which is mostly
air as you know oh cheese burgers gets
me every time
so like I said and this is Toro I'm
going to show you guys how to round up
and down numbers and the built-in
functions for this are in this math
header file so if you didn't include it
before make sure you're including it now
so whenever you're rounding up and down
numbers you always want to use floats
because if you use intz it's going to be
worthless because they don't need any
rounding they're whole numbers so make a
flow and call it bacon 1 or else it
won't work
I'm skidding it'll it'll work if your
name something else but who doesn't love
bacon actually let's set this equal to
like some stupid like that so we'll make
a float bacon 1 and we'll also get a
number that we can round down like I
don't know make this one a little easier
3.3 so now we have two slices of bacon
and the first thing I'd like you guys
about is floor so we'll just print out
the final number right now so we'll put
bacon one arm is and we'll just print
out to two decimal places why the heck
not just an F 0.2 and of course right
here we want to put in bacon 1 actually
not just yet so the function that we
need for this is called floor and the
only parameter it takes is that float
that you want around now now matter what
this number is it's going to round it
down to the nearest whole number and you
guys were like okay well in math class
whenever I was rounding numbers I said I
looked at the decimal place and if it
was 5 or above I rounded it up and if it
was anything less
and five I rounded it down well your
computer isn't as smart as you
it even says okay am I going to gonna
round this number up or down and you
have to tell it explicitly what to do so
no matter what it is floor is going to
round it down so I'll demonstrate that
by putting bacon - bacon - and I also
want to copy this to show you guys the
other function which is seal make sure
you don't spelt like this Co because
that will not do anything now seal what
this is going to do is it's going to
take whatever flow you pass it in and
round it up to the next highest number
so check this out and actually should
include a new line or else might be a
little bit difficult to see what's going
on so again bacon one was nine point six
something now whenever we have floor I
ran it down to nine and whenever we hit
seal rounded up to ten bacon - same
thing even though it was less than five
or three point five and in your head you
might be thinking always round it down
floor rounds it down to the next whole
number and seal rounds it up to the next
highest number so again rounding and see
works a little bit differently than
rounding in real life you need to tell
it explicitly whether to round up or
round down so now that we understand
that concept we can now move on to some
little more advanced math functions and
that includes absolute value and I want
to show you guys also how to use
something like power square root and a
random function to generate random
numbers something you're going to use a
lot whenever you make computer games but
for now thank you guys for watching and
well smell you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
