fifth Photoshop tutorial and in this
lesson I'm going to teach you guys how
to change the images size so we have
this image right here of me feeding a
deer just go ahead and open up any image
doesn't really matter and this photo is
pretty big right now it's almost taking
out my entire computer screen and if I
wanted to post this image on a website
or I don't know maybe Google+ or
something where it's generally better to
have images that are a little bit
smaller what I want to do is I want to
change the overall size of this image so
in order to change the size we need to
edit the image size properties so in
order to access that go ahead and select
image image size now what this allows
you to do is change the images size now
if you don't have all these options
available then what you need to do is
you need to make sure that resample
image checkbox is checked this pretty
much allows you to change the size of
the image that's all it means
resize image now another thing that you
probably wanted to do is you want to
make sure that you have constrain
proportions check and this just helps
you because whenever you arm decrease
the size as I'm about to do it keeps it
proportional because if you just changed
the width or only change the height then
your image would be distorted or skewed
so it's better to have this constrain
proportions checkbox checked checkbox
checked kind of a tongue-twister there
so say we wanted the width to be 600
instead of over a thousand so go ahead
and type in 600 right here and whenever
you do that notice that the height
automatically changes as well why does
it do that because that's the height it
needs it calculates all this
automatically to make it proportional to
the original image so that's really all
you need to do the only other thing is
you have these options right here at the
bottom on the stripped down list it says
like nearest-neighbor bi-linear bicubic
what you generally want to choose is
bicubic automatic
this I won't get in all this right now
some are best for different types of
images but bicubic automatic is the best
for all-around high quality results
whenever you're resizing images so just
go ahead and make sure you have that
selected and once you get your sizes
resize hit OK and check it out our image
is now smaller still awesome amazing
quality pretty freakin cool huh so that
is how you resize an image but what if
you want to resize the canvas now um
excuse me so say that you wanted to make
a border around this image what you need
to do then is you need to resize the
working area or the canvas of this
document so in order to do that just go
to image and then you go to canvas size
and then this is where you resize the
canvas so enter a new canvas size in of
course since we're working in pixels
let's go ahead and change this to pixels
and the original canvas is just the
original size of the image which is 600
by 454 now let's say we want to I don't
know put a border of 100 pixels around
each one so this is going to be 800 and
this is going to be 654 now with this
relative checkbox means is if you click
it relative pretty much means how much
more so instead of saying okay what do
you want the size of the new canvas to
be you can hit relative and this means
200 more for the width and 200 more for
the height but I always like to leave
that unchecked because I don't know it's
just personal preference
now what confuses a lot of people is
this anchor right here generally
probably I don't know 90 percent of the
time you want to keep your anchor in the
middle right there and the ankle anchor
is this circle little button icon
whatever you want to call it but what
anchor means is where do you want to
anchor your original image because
whenever you make canvas it makes pretty
much a border around the image so if we
anchor this in the top middle or it'd
probably be better if I anchor in the
top left then
and what this means is it's going to
draw the canvas on the right-hand side
the bottom it's pretty much going to
draw the canvas on the right and the
bottom well yeah I just said that so the
only other thing that we need to do is
we need to put a canvas extension color
it's a pretty big name for what color do
you want the canvas to be so if you
double-click this you can go ahead and
choose a color I'll make mine
I don't know right or something looks
pretty good hit okay so what we pretty
much said is the current size of this
image is 600 by 454 we want to change
the canvas size we're not stretching or
shrinking the image at all what we're
just doing is changing the canvas size
to 800 by 654 so we have more space to
work with but the image isn't going to
change now the canvas size or excuse me
the canvas color is going to be red and
it's going to be in the image is going
to be anchored in the top left now
remember this right here because
whenever I click OK this gives you a
better idea of what that anchor means
you can see that the anchor or the
original image as they should have
called it is in the top left in the
canvas is now on the right hand side and
on the bottom so again that's why I said
that most of the time it's better to put
your anchor in the middle because that
gives you a nice even canvas all around
your picture but just for demonstration
purposes I think that more clearly
demonstrates what an anchor is used for
but generally put it in the middle but
anyways that's the pretty much the
basics of this tutorial thank you guys
for watching and we get subscribe and
I'll see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
