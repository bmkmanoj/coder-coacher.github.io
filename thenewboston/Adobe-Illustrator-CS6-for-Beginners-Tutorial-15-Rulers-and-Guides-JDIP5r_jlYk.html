illustration cs6 tutorial my name is
buddy Blackford today we're gonna be
using rulers and we're gonna learn how
to use them and view them correctly so
rulers are located on the horizontal and
vertical sides of the document so you
can see them here and then the way that
you put the rulers on you go to view
rulers and then you either click hide
rulers if they're on if you would want
them off or show rulers if you want them
on and as you can see the high key was
ctrl R right there and we are able to
change the units and everything for the
rulers but let's get talking about what
they are used for so they serve several
purposes first of all they'll let you
measure the width and height of the
active image they let you place guides
on this screen to control the placement
of other image elements so I can bring
this guy down here and now there's a
guide let me get this out of the way I
don't know why but every time I put a
guide down it kind of annoys me
sometimes when I don't when I'm not
using it and I have to get rid of it and
they also create markers that follow
your screen as you move so if you look
on the top right now right directly
above my mouse you can see that there's
a line there and if I move to the left
you can see that there's also a line
there and this shows you where your your
cursor is so you can put things at
direct points now one thing that we're
gonna need to know is where the ruler
origin is and that starts where our
boards and it finished right here 0 and
0 that's where they are and you can see
this 4 it says intersect that's where
the ruler origin is and it doesn't say
intersect that just the ruler origin it
says at any intersection intersecting
points but that's where the ruler origin
is it's good to know that term
so the origin usually appears up in the
upper left corner where the rulers
intersect to say enough so another thing
that we need to do is be able to use
these points or use the ruler in a way
that we can understand the measurements
so let's go to edit and then go to our
preferences and let's go to units now
what we want to change here is the
general and we want to have on whatever
you're using to measure out your
illustrator project if you're making
some type of blueprint and you need to
everything to be in inches then go ahead
and use that and if you need it to be in
pixels use that too I like to use pixels
because most of the things I work and
use pixels so that's what I like to use
alright now let's get a little bit into
what we've got to use to work with
rulers so this is called the horizontal
ruler bar on the top and on the left is
the vertical ruler bar if I ever start
mentioning those you'll just remember
those and remember that control R turns
on and off your rulers all right if you
want to change your artboard rulers to a
global ruler then we can go up here to
view rulers and change the global rulers
and then go back where's the rulers
again rulers change the artboard rulers
if that makes sense to you you see how
the zero are the zero was different in a
different area so let me move around
this image with the hand tool here and
you can see that the ruler is moving
around with the artboard let me change
this to view and then rulers change the
global rulers and now I'll move this
around and you can see that the
horizontal one is sticking with the
artboard
the vertical is a lot different you can
see down here zero is down here so
that's a little bit different it still
moves around with it but there are
different places now let's go to let's
change it back to our board ruler the
next thing that I want to go over is the
video rulers let's go to view rulers and
video rulers and no they're not rulers
that are animated or anything like that
there's just rulers that are along this
side that help you with your video so if
you're doing something for video and you
need these rulers that's what's it's
going to be for and that's how it's
going to help you out The Closer easier
to use and they start at 0 0 here and
just go to the end now if you want to
change where your ruler origin is come
up here to this corner where there is
this square here where the two rulers
intersect and click and drag click and
drag you'll get this plus sign and then
you can see you can set the ruler origin
at any point that you really want you
can see that the zeros here and here now
if you want to reset that just double
click on it and go back to where the
ruler origin is so that's how you do
that and now you've got now you know how
to do that let me show you that guides
real quick if you're over on top of a
ruler just click and drag out and you'll
be able to bring out a guide so there's
how you use the guides if you click on a
guide you can also move it around again
and that's helpful and to hide guides
just right click on the guide and hit
hard guides now they're gone now let's
go ahead and bring those guides back
let's go to a few guides show guides and
bring them back down so you can see them
a little better my guide doesn't want to
oh it's a look that's why because it's
locked
ok
go to guides view guides and it's locked
guides you can make them so you're not
able to move them which helps when
you're start moving stuff around and you
don't want to accidentally grab your
guide and move it around when you had it
in the perfect position so that's what
lock guides for that's what I was just
going to show you then we have clear
guides here click that and now that
guides are gone for good so that's how
you use your guides use those to line up
objects perfectly using your ruler and
you can use your mouse these guides that
are up here these icons or markers I
mean and they'll help you figure out
where you need to put points as well so
thanks for watching this tutorial that's
all I have for you on rulers and guides
so I'm thankful that you watched and
keep on watching more and thumbs out the
video if you liked it so have a good one
