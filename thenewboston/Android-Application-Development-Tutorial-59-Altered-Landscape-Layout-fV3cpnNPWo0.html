ninth Android tutorial for the new boss
and again with me Travis and what we're
going to do in this tutorial is
basically let me go back here again you
can switch your landscape and portrait
view by 7 or 9 on your numpad and make
sure the num lock is disabled if you're
in Windows and basically we're going to
do is we're going to be able to redefine
where this layout whether it's in
landscape or portrait mode and I didn't
want to create a whole new layout just
for this example so we're going to use
this first little activity that we
created so as you can see here it won't
really matter when we turn it to
landscape mode but let's say we had like
five buttons or something like that and
then we switch over in the landscape
mode some of those buttons would run off
the screen and then you'd have to scroll
down to see them and that just wouldn't
be that cool so what we're going to do
is set these two buttons to be side by
side instead of vertical so a horizontal
layout there and basically that's all
this tutorial is going to be pretty
simple pretty easy but basically I just
wanted to show you guys the concept of
you can rearrange how it looks in
landscape and in portrait separately so
that's what we're going to do in this
tutorial noth-nothing suite for the most
part but it's useful you know you can
set again the orientation in the
manifest like we've done before I
believe so it won't rotate but let's say
you do want to allow it to rotate and
you just want to switch up the basically
basically the way it looks so we're
going to open up was that activity
called or that layout called main was it
okay so we open up our main XML and
basically we're just going to grab
everything that's in here and copy it
because you know we kind of wanted to be
the same we're just going to change up
some stuff so now what we need to do is
right here we created a folder
previously right when you're setting up
this application we haven't got to it
yet but basically this layout land it's
where we're going to define what it
looks like in the landscape view
so we're going to do is just right click
on this folder and go to new Android XML
file and we need to call it the exact
same name so we're going to say main.xml
again it's a layout but it has to be the
same name as your you know your portrait
landscape or whatever your portrait XML
so there we go we have that set up now
what we're going to do is basically
let's see here
paste everything and you know check it
out that's what it's going to look like
as of now just like I showed you on the
emulator but now we're just going to
change up something so we're just going
to copy a linear layout and paste it
here like I said it's not too complex of
a tutorial but we're just going to
change this to horizontal you know and
then check it out it's a little bit
different a little bit nicer not really
but you know it works and then we can
also do something like new textview just
that appears in the landscape view like
textview Android text
nothing awesome but we're going to go
with it
Android layout width is going to wrap
text
and you guys are pretty familiar with
the whole XML thing by now I hope Lisi
understand how to do it and you can mess
around and get rap oh wait rap contact
content not rap text what am I thinking
so there we go
um now we have this magic magic thing
after we kind of narrow down this other
linear layout because it's not appearing
right now so we're going to say for the
height rap content and shibam there we
go we have our new layout that's just
going to peer in the landscape view but
again a central thing you guys need to
know before this tutorial is basically
when you define two different you know
the portrait view in the landscape view
differently instead of letting the
Android program do itself if you want a
different layout you need to label them
the same exact name and then the other
thing is you also want to have all of
your references the exact same in the
landscape view as well as your portrait
view otherwise when you click on it
because again we defined all our buttons
and everything in Java you want to have
that reference bridge into the XML the
same whether it's in landscape mode mode
or in portrait mode so there we go
let's just test it out real quick save
it and run it and hopefully it works I
mean that's all pretty much the only
thing you're going to use this layout
land for we probably aren't going to
even use it again I just want to show
you guys you have the availability to do
so if you choose so you know it's kind
of nice if you're developing some kind
of game that you know the menu you want
all those items or all those buttons
laid out a certain way generally I just
set the landscape or set the portrait
view in the Android manifest if I wanted
to do something like a game but just
giving you guys the option or the
choices to do so like I said I just keep
talking to kind of delay some time
here because I'm kind of sick I don't
know what that's about but there we go
and let's start up our starting point
activity everything works in portrait
view now let's switch over landscape
view again we get this magical text that
only appears in that view and goes away
once we go over there and again our
references are the exact same so we're
going to click this as well and as you
can see if we you know if we add one
here it's at six right now and if we
switch it over it kind of restarts
everything so that's something you guys
kind of want to take note of as well
because right now our total is zero
again we know it's six and then we tilt
our phone and you're like crap but you
know four menus and stuff it's going to
work for you so hopefully you guys
enjoyed that tutorial even though it's
kind of lame but I'll catch you guys in
the next one have a good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
