Roberts and in these videos I'm going to
be teaching you guys how to click and
frame now I'm going to be getting some
help from my little friend here little
and she's a 8 week old border collie and
she actually has never been trained
before she doesn't know any tricks so
what I'm going to be doing is I'm going
to be teaching you guys the basics of
clicker training and then hopefully
teaching her a bunch of new tricks
you're ready little in now in order to
start clicker training what we want to
do is we first want to build an
association between the click and the
tree or the reward
basically we want the dog to know that
whenever we click the clicker and it
makes a clicking noise then something
good happens in this case they get
reward and this is just chicken right
here so before you even you know start
making it sit or lay down or teach a
good behavior this is what we want to do
just build a simple Association so call
your dog over call Italy are you doing
you eat in my tripod and click and treat
and right now at first your dog has no
you know knowledge that these two things
are related so that's why we need to
repeat the behavior so grab another
piece click and treat right away and
eventually instead of thinking you know
okay there was a click and I get some
chicken none of the two are related I
guess they're just an act of God your
dog is going to begin to realize that
okay whenever I hear that click I get a
treat
so click equals reward so do this about
ten times I would say now your dog is
building interest they want to hear that
click before she was just running around
eating my tripod now she's actively
interested in what I'm doing and she
likes this game right now she's doing
nothing click get chicken pretty cool
for her so now go ahead and let her play
around a little bit when she comes back
click treat and now she's starting to
know that there is an association
between the noise or the action of me
clicking and getting chicken which is
good so once we're done with that and
the dog knows now that there's an
association between the clicker and the
reward or the chicken what we want to do
now is we want to start getting out the
desired behavior and in this tutorial
I'm just going to teach you guys how to
make your dog sit but I'm going to be
teaching you guys how to make it lay
down and some other cool tricks later on
but this is just the basics so there are
two different ways that we can do this
the first thing that we can do is we can
just sit and wait for our dog to sit
down and whenever it does click or if we
have a dog that's moving around a lot
what we can do is we can actually lure
the dog into the sitting position so let
me go ahead and get a piece of chicken
now the easiest way to get your dog to
sit is just to take the treat and put it
up over their head now I was kind of
late on that click but that's one way a
lot of other people like to take the
collar and like slide their tail under
their butt and then they sit naturally
but what I like to do whenever I'm lower
you take the chicken and slowly put it
over the dog's head and as the head goes
up the buck goes down it's very natural
so let me go ahead and lure again want
discipline all you got tree wait what
are you doing over the head buck goes
down as soon as the butt touches the
ground that's when you click and what we
want the dog to think is that eventually
they realize that these two events the
click in the tree they aren't just
happening randomly the dog is going to
become aware of that they are making the
click happen and essentially they
determine when they get the tree so here
you go good girl good girl a little in
and another thing you want to watch out
for is you don't want to click too late
or too early you want the dog to know
that as soon as their butt hits the
ground then they get to click if you
make it too late then the doc can think
that ok maybe the act of getting up gets
the reward and we want the dog to know
that as soon as their butt hits the
ground that's the action that we're
looking for with this girl and another
thing if you accidentally click the
clicker or maybe you sit on it or I
don't know you click it when your dog
doesn't sit then what you want to do is
you want to give your dog a treat
anyways because you want to make sure
that you keep that association even if
it's an accident the association between
the click and also the treat is one of
the most important things and clicker
training so anytime you click it and you
don't treat your dog then it's going to
destroy that association and have a
dummy full of chicken
oh girl so now she knows that whenever
she sits the act of sitting she gets a
piece of chicken so what we want to do
now is we actually want to throw in some
verbal commands let me get some chicken
ready and I'll show you guys how to do
this whenever you start the verbal
command aka the word sit what you want
to do is you want to say it right before
her butt hits the ground because that
way she starts to get the muscle
reaction or muscle memory of you saying
sit but hit the ground I get rewarded
sit good girl sit girl
sit good girl little you sit you also
want to do this when there are no
distractions around that's why I removed
all the toys from the area my other dog
is in the garage so when you do that
enough times your dogs gonna build an
association between the word sit me
saying sit in her butt hitting the
ground it's going to be good for her and
she likes it she likes thinking the
mental stimulation is good sit sit good
girl
sit good girl
sit good girl are you falling yet sit
good girl sit good girl they dough in
you got that once it's too easy for you
isn't it so again don't get frustrated
if your dog doesn't get it exactly at
first or gets it as fast as other dogs
some dog breeds are just smarter than
other dog breeds for example my
bloodhound in my garage he took a long
time to get this hounds are not the
smartest but um don't get discouraged
practice makes perfect
in eventually with enough time your dog
no matter how dumb it is it's going to
build an association between you saying
sit in the act of their butt hitting the
ground and eventually also you're not
going to need to clicker you're not
going to need a tree your dog is just
going to want to please you and once it
understands that whenever you say sit it
sits and then you're happy then that's
all that matters dogs naturally love to
please their owners so anyways thank you
little ant for helping me out and she
now is working on set and we'll see you
guys in the next video maybe I'll be
teaching lay down Oh
oh my god oh my god oh my god</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
