tutorial and in this tutorial I will be
showing you how to apply a map to an
object so let's go ahead and create an
object like a sphere or something
it's very good-looking sphere right
there let me just move up BAM look at
that now let's go ahead and bring up our
materials editor by pressing m and what
we're going to be doing is applying a
picture instead of this color right here
so I'm finally going to tell you how to
apply a map to this and here's how you
do it under your Maps our rollout right
here press the plus button and this is
going to bring up all the different
places you can add a map for example the
the diffuse color is the main object the
ambient color like the shadow the
specular color is the highlights or
brightness of it so what we're going to
be one we're going to be doing first is
anytime we want to apply an image
instead of just a color click the
diffuse color and as you can see the map
it has no map right here none so instead
of none go ahead and click that and this
brings up all the different types of
maps you can add to it now what we're
going to want to do is add a bitmap this
is the most common a bitmap is the same
thing as an image so we're going to want
to add an image to the main color so go
ahead and double click bitmap and it
brings up my default images go ahead and
select something like what's a good one
forest this will be going to on this
forest right here and you can either
double click that or click open and as
you can see in my little preview right
here we have a preview of this forest so
now if we go ahead and either select
this and hit sign material over again or
we can just drag it on you can see that
my object changes from blue to gray
never saying alright why did it turn
gray and it doesn't have a picture of a
forest on it WTF
well that is because it isn't rendered
out if we go ahead and render it we can
see that now our sphere has a picture of
that for
it's on it looks like a nice little
shiny marble now so go ahead and click X
2 X out of this and the reason why that
um you have to render it out to get the
image because if you're working with and
showed an image you use a whole bunch of
memory so you don't really want to do
that now let's go over once you apply to
map what you just did we have all these
new settings coordinates noise bitmap
let me go over what each one of these
means the coordinates rollout pretty
much lets you position the map on the
object how you want it pretty much the x
y&amp;amp;z so say you want to put a picture on
here but you're saying all right and set
this tree on the left side I want to on
the right side well you can adjust these
to get your tree on the right side just
like that right there but let's go ahead
and leave that at the fall zero and I
just want to tell you guys what does you
can figure out what all these Lou later
or if we need to work on back so
minimize that and now let's go to the
next one the noise what the noise does
is pretty much add randomization to your
map so for example it can like add
static and if you have like a grainy
texture you can add some noise to make
it more grainy or gritty so that's what
the noise those I'm not going to be
messing with that for now the time will
skip this bit map parameters for right
now the time if you expand this this has
to do with animation so when we get in
animation we'll be coming back to that
but we're going to touch it for now and
the output does some weird stuff like
you can invert all your colors and now
if we go apply that and render it every
color is inverted but for now we're just
going to leave it blank and we won't be
messing with the output for now since
we're just sticking with the basics here
so I already tie you guys how to add a
diffuse map using a diffuse color and
when you add this it takes whatever map
or whatever image you selected and
replaces your main color with that so
now I'm going to make a new material and
we're going to make a new map aside from
replacing your main color I'm going to
teach you guys something called a bump
map well bump man
does is if we go ahead and select bump
where we have none go ahead and click
bitmap and select any image like these
frangipani flowers what the heck
frangipani flowers then go ahead and
open that you can see that when we apply
this this bump map right here and we
render it out that our image or our
object is indented where the whites and
blacks meet so I don't know if anytime
it's white it um indents or anytime it's
black and dents but it's one of the two
doesn't really matter so that's what a
bump map does it uses the colors in your
image to provide a texture in your map
so while a diffuse just pretty much is
all looks a bump map uses the colors or
different shades of gray to provide
texture so now we know a diffuse map is
change the appearance and a bump map
change the texture what if we wanted to
do both so let's go in our third one
right here the first ones on the diffuse
the second ones the bump this is a third
one we're going to be working with now
this can be kind of confusing so right
now we have no Maps applied if we expand
this so let's go ahead and add something
for the diffuse color we'll go ahead and
add this dock or something right there
apply it and now we have our dock right
here it looks like a marble so now what
if we want to add a bump tete a bump map
bump tap top CF is a bum tap anyways
what if we not only want to add on the
diffuse but we also want to add a
texture to this well what we can do is
anytime we want to add two maps on the
same thing you need to click this little
pump button go to parent and this brings
you back to the main object or which is
actually the parent it's called the same
thing and now you can add different Maps
so if you're looking around that um
you're like oh I can't find maps
anywhere that's because you need
go to parent and this will bring you
back to your main objects so from now we
can go ahead and add any bump map we
want bitmap and find something with like
couple whites in it and now if we apply
it again render it out we now get that
overall diffuse color which changes the
main appearance of our object and we
also get a bump map which has different
textures on our object so how cool is
that we can apply several Maps the same
object to create and is it this is it
this is a desired effect there we go I
got out eventually so you guys play
around with maps and remember you can
anytime you want to use a map just go
down to this map drop down and those are
all the different maps you can apply so
just double click on the button and
select your map and again bitmap is the
most common one and that's where we're
going to be working with so that's why I
showed it to you guys but that's all the
basics you get for now thank you guys
for watching
you saw a learner in 3ds max and I'm
going to go to food line and get some
toasty toes in dip and when I come back
I'll make the next tutorial so thank you
guys for watching and I'll see you next
time oh yeah don't forget subscribe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
