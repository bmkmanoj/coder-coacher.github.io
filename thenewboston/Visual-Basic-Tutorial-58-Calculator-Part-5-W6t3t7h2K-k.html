slash on live gamer for the new Boston
and in this tutorial we're going to be
talking more about the calculator and
I'm going to do a brief description of
each of the button click handlers for
all the buttons here so let's go again
go ahead and get started it and if you
don't know we're talking about then move
back a couple couple of tutorials and
you'll see what it is now in the last
tutorial before we left I told you to do
the it's button subtract sub for
yourself now if you did it that's great
and if not I'm going to do a little
brief description of what it is now it's
very similar to the ad in fact almost
identical but instead of using is adding
we created a new global boolean called
is subtracting and we set that equal to
false we did this for each one of them
two is subtracting is multiplying is
dividing and is modulus but we didn't do
it for pie so then we'll just declare
answer and then we'll call our subtract
function and we will convert these to
our data types that we need and then we
just set the text and we check to read
only and we change is subtracting and
then we did else if is subtracting then
and we did all this right in here now we
did the same thing for each of the other
ones for button divide we just use the
divide function instead and created a
new boolean called is dividing same
thing for a multiply and modulus button
pie we do this a little bit different we
they only need one number when they're
doing it by PI so all we need is if text
someone text at length does not equal 0
then we're going to call the PI function
and we'll just send it text someone text
and we set the answer - the answer to
string and we set text time to text to
PI so we did string dot format 0 and 3
math PI so what this is going to do is
it's going to give us a decimal number
that is three decimal places long
and we sex we set text time to not read
only equal to true now here's all of our
functions that do our math for us and
down in the revert bool sub I just went
ahead and set all the other boolean's
equal to false and this is called when
they click the Clear button now let's go
ahead and add one more thing before we
finish the program so let's go ahead and
make this spin a little bit better we're
going to come over here to our tool box
and we will add a tool tip so we will
set the name of this to TL tip pi and so
now what we're going to do is we're
going to come over to form one VB and we
will find our PI sub or the sub that
handles the button pi click now what we
could do is show that tooltip when they
click it but instead we want to do it
when they hover their mouse over it so
come over here and find pi will click
the lightning bolt and we'll come over
here to Mouse hover so whenever they
hover their mouse over it what do we
want to do so we'll do a tooltip pi and
then we'll add dot so tooltip PI dot set
tooltip now this takes two arguments our
control and our caption so what our
control is going to be is button PI
so our tooltip is going to be connected
to button pi and we'll set the caption
to only one value is needed in the first
value field okay so now that we've set
our tooltip we've connected it to our
button and set the caption for we can go
ahead and run this and you can see when
they hover their mouse over pi he's
going to say only one value is needed in
the first value field and if we type 23
and Dupuy it gives us it fills it in
with 3.14 - which is the value of pi and
it gives us our answer now let's just go
ahead and format that answer so we'll
come up here we will find pi so button
PI and we will set this to string dot
format and we will format it to three
decimal places so 0 colon n3 close that
off and instead of converting answer to
a string we'll just go ahead and get rid
of the dot - string so now if we run
this we're going to add first number and
it will say only one value is needed in
the first value field we click it and it
gives us second numbers 3.14 - and the
answer is the answer and it's been
formatted to three decimal places so you
can go ahead and add other stuff to this
calculator if you want make it better
give it more functionality if you want
to challenge and if you do go ahead and
leave a video response and I'll check it
out and see what it's like so thanks for
watching guys and stay tuned for the
next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
