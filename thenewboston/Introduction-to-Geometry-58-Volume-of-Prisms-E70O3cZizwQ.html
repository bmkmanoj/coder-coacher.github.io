finding the volume of a prism so the
volume of a rectangular prism is length
times width times height so length times
width times our perpendicular height or
altitude so volume is equal to 14 x 15 x
5 so since those are kind of big numbers
i'm going to put this in a calculator 14
x 15 x 5 10 50 centimeters cubed because
we're taking centimeters times 7
centimeters times centimeters bringing
the eight centimeters cubed volume
because it's a measure of
three-dimensional it measures how much
space something takes up and since space
is a three-dimensional measure we have
to have centimeters cubed a volume of a
non rectangular prism is its base area
times its height so for this triangle it
would be one-half base times height
because that would be the area of the
space right here times the height of the
prism so this triangle it's going to be
one-half base which is this five right
here
x height which is which has been drawn
in for us and it's perpendicular to the
base and it's measures three times three
so first what we're going to do is find
the area of the base which we're just
going to call BA so one-half five times
three okay so one-half of 5 times 3 1
have 5 times 3 is 15 so our base area is
15 halves so now we're going to take 15
half's and times it by 3 15 times 3 is
45 over 2 and pretend that they gave us
that this is millimeters so g
millimeters cubed and i'm just going to
leave it like that because there's no
point in getting a not pretty decimal
this is more accurate so now we're going
to do an example find the volume so this
is a trapezoidal prism because its bases
are a trapezoid so first for the volume
its base area times height so let's find
our base area if you remember the area
of a trapezoid is one-half base one
which is four plus base 2 which is eight
times the perpendicular height which is
three so make sure you add these
together before you multiply it by two
or one half I mean so 4 plus 8 is 12
one-half of 12 is 6 times 3 is 18 so the
area of our base is fish is 18
centimeters squared so now we're going
to take our base area and multiply it by
the height of this prism
which is three so our volume is 54
centimeters cubed well that's actually
all we're going to do for volume but
make sure you come back and watch the
next lesson where we're going to talk
about the surface area of a cylinder</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
