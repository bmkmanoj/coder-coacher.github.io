pygame tutorial video this video we're
gonna be passing through the strength of
our shot through the tank firing
function so right now we have this
awesome awesome game we got this awesome
tank they have this awesome ability to
adjust the power of our tanks cannon but
no matter what we set this power to the
tanks cannon shoots the exact same way
not good so what we want to do is it's
fixed that so what I want to have us do
first is you can see here in the fire
shell we want to add another parameter
and that is going to be the actual tanks
power so you can see right here fire
underscore power is what we're calling
that so let's go ahead and do comma fire
underscore power easy enough so then we
go up to our fire shell function here
and then we're just going to add in
another parameter and we're going to
call this gun power easy enough and for
now let's do nothing in this one and
let's go ahead and just copy this
function here having the entire thing
all the way including the definition
enter enter and then let's paste and
then let's have a fire shell to function
this show we're going to fire this one
and it's going to be green and this one
will modify to be gun power so the gun
power or intention it's not quite the
case yet but we'll make it the case our
intention is to be anywhere from 1 to
100 so what's the middle of that 50 so
we want 50 to be like no change and then
we want one to be very weak and then we
want a 100 to be pretty strong so we
come here fire shell let's go down to
our Y definition we're gonna leave X now
X doesn't have to be modified anymore
and instead Y needs to be modified and
if you recall we have this right here
right this multiplied all well multiply
it basically this x 0.015
as I was telling you guys before when we
change this number this is the only
thing in our entire algorithm that we
have to change to make the shot like go
further or less or be stronger or less
strong the larger we make this number
the weaker our shot is and the smaller
we make this number the stronger our
shot is so how might we actually have
this work well you're gonna divide this
number by power by some form of the
power I suggest what we do is divide it
by and let's put this in parentheses gun
POW underscore power and then divided by
50 so we divide that by gun power
divided by 50 so what's that do for us
well if gun power is 50 it makes no
change at all right it divides it by 50
over 50 which is 1 so we divide by 1 no
problem so only when it's you know if
it's larger it's gonna divide it by more
make the number smaller thus shoot
harder and then if it's smaller it's
gonna divide it by a lot less it will
actually end up it'll be a fraction and
then it will basically make this number
larger thus making the shot weaker so
let's go ahead we've got we've got the
definition of fire shell 2 but we have
nothing that actually calls fire shell 2
into action let's go ahead and write
something real quick that we'll call
fire shell 2 into action so we'll come
down here and let's just call literally
fire shell we're just gonna copy this
and let's just paste it one more time
and then just do fire shell 2 so every
time I press the space the first wall
run then the second one will run so we
can so we can visualize the difference
here so let's save that and run that
move this over and this up shoot once
and shoot twice so power level 50 there
is no change right so we just kind of
basically retraced
but now let's make power level 60 shoot
one school shoot twice and we can see
there was a significant difference there
now we can make power level 90 89 and
again we see a significant difference
there
conversely we can drop this below 50 and
we should see another difference again
you can see that we made that difference
and then of course we can go really low
and shoot really close like 20% so so
that's how we can allow the user to pass
through the power so since we're content
with that let's go ahead and modify this
to now be the main function so first of
all let us let's just delete this will
keep fire show but you'll see that we're
ostriches rename fire shell too too far
show so fire shell too now becomes just
fire shell and then this fire shell the
original fire shell function will just
delete now it'd be wise to go ahead and
run it one more time and make sure that
you've made the proper change should be
the new one will be green of course
we'll change that back to red though
don't worry
cool so we'll close out of this okay and
yeah let's change that to red you may
whatever color you want though of course
and and that's basically it for the
strength we don't have to really change
that anymore so now we've got firing
strength all of that so that's pretty
cool
and now we're ready to start building
the impact right so right now this is
cool we're happy about our arc and it's
shooting and we're proud
but the problem is nothing really
happens on impact so it hits the ground
and we start you know over that's fine
or maybe we hit the barrier and I watch
so we can't hit the barrier so that's
not in effect yet but we should be able
to hit the barrier and instead of just
nothing we kind of want first of all I
hit to register so we need to know
whether or not we hit the barrier
another tank or the ground and then if
so well when the shell hits whatever it
hits there's like an explosion right
and so we want to be at will to include
that into our games so that's what we're
gonna be doing in the next video in the
next few videos really so stay tuned for
that hopefully you guys are enjoying as
always thanks for watching and until
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
