your eight PHP stock analysis yeah yeah
whatever let's just go ahead and start
coding so we have an array called pieces
so this pieces array is made up of
several different elements they open
high low close volume and adjusted close
so let's go ahead and separate those
pieces and store them in variables that
we can work with so we have date and in
the date variable excuse me and you're
saying okay why you're naming this one
date because remember the first one is
the date the second one is open the next
one is the high then low so on and so
forth so what day is is its equal to P
let me go ahead and make sure I have
this copy correctly pieces and remember
in turn array the very first element is
the 0 with element so now let me just go
ahead and save it just like that so
whatever was the first item that got
exploded out of that string which
happened to be the date that's what is
stored in third and first element or
item in the array and we're going to
store in variable called date so this
array like I said has several different
pieces so let me just go ahead and we're
going to be doing this for let's see one
two three four five six so one two three
four five six so the first one was the
date the second one was the open price
the third one was the high the fourth
one was low clothes and the last one was
volume now if you notice the last one
was actually adjusted close but like i
said the clothes in the adjusted clothes
are basically the exact same 99% time so
instead of having another item that
we're never used i'm just going to go
ahead and use the close high low close
yadda yadda so now we need to change its
1 2 3 4 and 5 now each of these
individual items are stored in variables
so this is a lot easier to work with
than this you can if you want to just go
ahead and use the array and ref
the item but I like variables they
actually have a name that means
something so that's what I'm doing that
so we have all the information however I
don't want to go on and insert this
information into our table just yet
because i want to calculate a few other
things the first thing i want to
calculate is whenever you have a stock
it opens at a certain price at the
beginning of the day and it closes at a
certain price it changes by a certain
amount if i have a stock in the New
Boston greatest company on earth it is
an even company but the stock can open
for five dollars at the beginning of the
day and then I make some awesome
tutorials on I don't know how to wash my
car then my stock price shoots up to
fifty dollars so the amount change is
$45 however if it goes down from five to
0 then the amount changes negative five
this is information that's going to be
important whenever we're now analyzing
stocks so I'm just going to go ahead and
make variable called amount change and
we're going to be storing this in the
variable too so remember in order to
figure out the amount of stock change
through the day you take the clothes
price which is the ending price and you
subtract it from the open price so
hopefully this is positive if your
company did well it's going to be
negative if the stock price went down so
now after this this is the amount change
the dollar amount so for you know let's
see let's see what this it started out
at 628 and it ended at 621 so this one
went down eight dollars however that
isn't really useful whenever you're just
looking at a company that you don't even
know the value of you say eight dollars
maybe that's good for a company you know
if it's like Ford that's like half the
price but for this company which is
google it's like only you know one
percent so it is eight dollars one
percent or fifty percent it's really
hard to tell so also aside from the
amount of money it changes you also want
to get the percentage of the change
since this is kind of more important if
your stock goes up
% or fifty percent it's a lot more
important of if it went up like you know
three dollars or five dollars so in
order to figure out the percents
underscore change here's the formula for
that what you do is you take the amount
change what's a is eight let's just
let's just go ahead and use 10 let's see
it changed 10 and you divide it over the
open and that is going to give you a
decimal and then what you need to do is
times it by 100 and this is going to
give you a percentage like 78 15 it's
usually somewhere between like zero in
five percent stocks usually don't change
more than five percent unless there's
really big news in the company so that's
what I'm doing actually that's pretty
much all that time I have for for this
story I'm now going to take this
information and insert it into a table
on our database so again like I said
what we did in this tutorial is we
grabbed all the information line by line
and we saved it inside variables we also
made two additional variables to
calculate the amount change of the stock
the daily amount change in the daily
percent change because amount change is
just a number that means nothing however
a percent change is really good
indicator of how well that stock did so
in the next story like I said we're
going to be taking all of these
variables all of these values and
throwing them into a table finally
putting them into our database so for
now thank you guys for watching don't
forget subscribe yadda yadda I'll see
you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
