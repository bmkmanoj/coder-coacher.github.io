thirty second Android tutorial we're
again we're going to play use this or
play with this text play for the most
part activity no it's kind of boring
because you know text is no fun for the
most part but we're going to work within
this where's the fridge checking
statement and we're going to set up
something called a switching case now
this is going to be pretty important for
pretty a lot of things that we're going
to do basically what a switching case is
is we're going to say hey this is what
I'm looking for that's called the switch
that question for the most part and then
we're going to have a lot of answers and
those are called cases so if we have a
case of a certain answer we can do
something within that method for the
most part it's kind of hard to explain
without showing you guys so let's just
set it up we're going to say switch and
within the switch we're going to give it
three choices so we're going to say you
know either 0 1 2 basically those could
be our answers so the question is for
the most part what number are you and
now we're going to do that is we're
going to again use our random variable
that we set up so we're going to say
crazy dot next int and then we're going
to say 3 so that's going to give us
three choices and then we just need to
set up a new pair of brackets hit enter
and now we can set up our cases but
again this is just going to give us a
random number for the most part and the
number is going to have three or
basically three choices or you have
three things that it can choose from but
the number is actually that it's going
to display is 0 1 &amp;amp; 2 so as you can see
those are three numbers and that's what
we're going to set up our cases two
cases the B so basically we're giving it
a random number and now we can set up a
case so we're going to say case 0
because if we get a random and equal to
0 we can do whatever is within here and
then we're gonna hit a break statement
and then we can say case
one and then a colon and then a break
statement and then we can also have
lastly case two and again a break
statement now basically it's going to
give us a random number and if we get
the answer of zero we can do whatever's
in here and then it's going to break our
case and it's not even going to look at
anything else because it already found
zero that's basically what the break is
and you know if it's one it's also going
to do whatsoever with in here and two
it's going to do with it's going to do
what ever is within here sorry and so
now what we're going to do is basically
have this crazy just set our gravity so
we're just going to copy and paste some
of these such as the set the gravity
left in the case zero and then set the
gravity to the center as for case one
and set the gravity to the right for
case three or case - I'm sorry oops
what's going on all right and so
basically that's why I wanted to show
you guys in this tutorials basically we
can set up a switch where it's give us
give us some you know choices to choose
from and it looks for the answer and we
can define a method within there and
also the other thing that's important in
this tutorial is this crazy or I'm sorry
our random variable we put three here
we're still going to have three choices
for the most part but those choices
aren't going to be one two three for
example they're going to always start at
zero so it's going to be zero one two so
now let's just save it and run our
application see what what happens for
the most part and also maybe one last
thing that we're going to do is set
display dot set color here too
see I don't know white I believe is the
default not positive so there we go
we're gonna resave this Oh set text
color I'm sorry and then we're going to
save this and run it again and there we
go here's our text play and we can just
say you know Travis we're gonna get
invalid and let's just check some other
things we're going to say blue and it's
going to change your text to blue and
also have it be become blue I'm and then
again if we say something else it's
going to go back to the invalid that's
basically that the last else in our
if/else clause and let's try our new
method where's the fridge and if we just
keep clicking our try it's going to kind
of set it up in a random place random
color random size and random gravity for
the most part so hopefully you guys kind
of understand the random and basically
what this app application can do and
everything that we've done with it I
think it's a pretty good kind of
introduction to the Java for the most
part and working with the textview and
how to use some of those methods so
again thanks guys for watching and so
and I'll catch you guys in the next
tutorial a good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
