follow in order to be considered of
course living things is that they must
maintain order inside their cells and
inside their bodies so I'm just going to
write order right here and what the heck
do I mean by maintain order like I don't
know line up in a line like the you know
army or something well whenever I say
maintain order
I mean maintain some sort of
organization so remember the first rule
said that living things are made up of
cells which contain something inside
them called DNA so say you have a group
of cells just laying on the ground and
each one of them has some DNA in it like
that well this would be a living finger
right well no why is that because they
don't have any order unlike your body
which is a very organized living thing
believe it or not I know you may not
think that because I don't know you're
looking around your room and everything
is kind of a mess but you have very much
order in organization in your body what
do I mean by that well whenever you get
cut and you bleed or you break a bone in
needs to heal your body heals itself to
kind of put yourself back in the pieces
that you were before so that is why you
need very you know you need to be
ordered and organized instead of just a
big hunk of cells sitting on the ground
so that's why a big hunk of cells would
not be considered a living things in
scientific terms and your body which is
very ordered organized would now the
third rule organisms must follow is that
they must regulate their systems so let
me just go ahead and write regulation
believe it or not it's kind of hard to
talk and write at the same time so what
I mean by living things regulate their
systems well say you go outside and it's
snowing we dress some beautiful
snowflakes right here it's pretty
good-looking believe it or not and
whenever you go outside like I said your
body is going through a process of
regulation well what the heck do I mean
by that well a couple things happen
whether you are aware of it or not first
of all your body starts to shiver shiver
and blood starts getting pumped through
your body to your arms legs and head and
this
happens because your body goes through
regulation each cell is kind of focused
on maintaining that internal temperature
so the reason that your body wants to
maintain a internal temperature is
because if it got too cold then it would
freeze and die so of course you shiver
and you move to generate more body heat
and what this kind of does is even
though the environment is not suited for
you your body's going to regulate itself
and make itself better able to survive
so whenever I talk about regulation
that's what I'm talking about
maintaining an internal it doesn't have
to be temperature but any internal
conditions that make this organism more
able to survive now the fourth rule that
an organism must follow in order to be
considered of course a living thing is
that living things must respond to
signals in the environment so I'm going
to write respond to signals in
environment I won't write that but you
guys know what I mean so what the heck
do I mean by responding to signals
well I respond to a traffic signal when
I'm driving but that's not exactly what
I'm talking about
what I'm talking about is say that we
have something that's clearly nonliving
like a rock well if we go ahead and we
kick this rock well what's it going to
do it's going to do nothing that's
because it's just chilling there it's
like oh I'm a dumb rock of course I
wouldn't say that
but it's not going to do anything
because it's a non living thing well
let's go ahead and compare this to an
organism or something that's living like
I don't know maybe your grandma so let
me drive some beautiful hair on her and
I don't know maybe she has a cane what
happens when you go up and you hit her
with a stick or you kick her whoa unlike
the rock she's gonna get mad she's gonna
beg oh my Bucky
you're the worst grandson ever and and I
don't know maybe she's gonna yell you
maybe she's gonna throw her cane at you
she's going to respond to signals from
the environment in a couple of different
ways so that's what I mean to responding
to signals from the environment non
living things
don't at all living things do now
typically with animals we'll talk about
plants more later on but animals have
these five senses that we'll cover later
on but those are the senses that allow
them to become aware of environmental
changes and respond appropriately now if
you're thinking okay that makes sense
with you know maybe your grandma in
animals but what about things like I
don't know plants because plants don't
yell at you when you kick it well
believe it or not
plants do respond to signals from the
environment and the easiest explanation
is if you ever looked at a plant that
was actually growing towards the Sun you
can see that this is indeed responding
to a signal from the environment the
environment as simple as it is would be
the sunlight in the action of growing
towards the plants is a signal excuse me
is a response to that signal and we'll
talk about why plants do this and we'll
talk about you know photosynthesis and
it's kind of a tongue twister
photosynthesis there we go
later on but just remember that rule
number four is all living things no
exception
respond to signals from their
environment</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
