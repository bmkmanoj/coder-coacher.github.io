my friend Joe B right now and we are
from Adams New York and tomorrow morning
Joe B is going to drive me up to the
Adirondacks and drop me off in the
middle of the wilderness now it sounds
weird but this is actually something
that I wanted to do for a very long time
my friend did a long time ago probably a
few years ago and he survived eight days
so I want to see how long I can survive
for and I'm going to be equipped with a
few supplies and I'm going to let you if
you go over those right now this so yeah
rope some rope what she would I can do
that I don't really know gonna do that a
knife pretty much cut down a blade of
grass it's a good knife I think maybe
Flint if I can figure out how to start a
fire what this is I don't know it is
Frankie J started fire yeah oh I'll take
care o it in the foyer and a call girl
maybe for some witchcraft okay boiling
water I call it a pop but he calls it
college room for some reason but anyways
those are the only supplies that I'm
going to be equipped with to a wall see
how long I can survive
and aside from now of course I'm going
to have all my camera gear with me I
have tons of memory cards and tons of
batteries enough for like a couple
months so I'm going to be recording the
entire experience so we'll see how it
goes
all right it's a little after six
o'clock guys can see that oh it's got
the Bucky's house and it's time for me
to go wake them up so I'm going to go
find them first
Oh kind of dark down here don't worry
about it though any signs of life in
here interesting still asleep
please he's getting ready maybe I should
probably throw something at them hold on
a second this would be good still no
signs of life
really weird I'll play this card today
oh that six o'clock and understand oh
there he is
currently he's half naked too I want to
put some clothes on too while you're at
it
tip I didn't have like some beer mace or
something nothing to wake up today so I
just dragged you out of bed visit will
you're telling me to do and you better
be up we got a lot to do today
oh sorry that family my Frankie for a
while I hope so you're not the needle
after you you're done two questions are
needed when you're out in the wild only
on one honey you can go be good enough
probably not really fine though tomorrow
night
yeah you'll fight fire you'll find out
if not get cozy with a bear cuz I don't
even have hiking boots and just ever
like work steel toe work boots I was
going to take tea where we're going
that's a mystery it's for me to know and
you to find out
no you're on your own alright good
that's one good thing I don't pack much
occasion hold it
crap my trusty tripod ready</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
