to show you how to create your very
first app and what the heck an app even
is but before we do that we just need to
make sure that we have our server up and
running and by the way if you are using
PyCharm then all you have to do is click
this button in the top right and that's
going to kick it off but for everyone
else then again just go ahead and
navigate to that directory and from here
just write Python or pseudo Python if
you guys are using Linux or Mac and then
just write manage to I run server and
this is done tada
and there you go so refresh this and
this page should work and by the way if
you ever want to stop your server then
just go ahead and hold ctrl C and
whenever you refresh it then you can see
that it is stopped well let's go ahead
and clear and boot this up again and
alright so refreshing and it's working
in by the way just like a regular web
server
you always want this running and a cool
thing about Django is whenever you're
working with your source code in you
know adding new apps in like websites
and web pages and stuff like that you
don't have to reboot your server every
time you can just leave this running and
refresh your page and your going to see
your changes so it's like one of the
coolest things ever
so actually what I'm going to do is I'm
going to take this just move it off on
the other screen so I don't even worry
about it so what you need to do whenever
we need to use the command line again is
we just need to open up another one so
I'm going to open up a brand new one a
separate one and again this is your
server so just go ahead and keep it
running in the background somewhere so
let me just go ahead and this top web
site
clear and our a so make sure I have that
as needed all right so what the heck
were we supposed to be learning in this
video how to create our very first app
now before I even explain what the heck
an app is in Django I need to go on a
little rant and that is I hate how every
single possible thing is called an app
right now in software development you
know what an app is it's those things on
your mobile devices those androids and
your tablets and your iPhone
those are apps Photoshop is not an app
Skype is not nap those are just computer
programs and I know and no those are
desktop apps guys quit calling things
apps especially everything Jesus and
whenever anyone makes a website now
they're like do you want to check out my
web app I'm like dude that's a website
you don't need to call it a web app
that's a website all right so I say that
because Django there's these things
called apps in it and they're actually
pretty important so I need a you know
okay I just need to calm down a bit so
that's what I'm going to be showing you
guys how to do in this video so
basically your website in Django is
going to be composed of all of these
little parts in every single part is
called an app now I'll give you guys a
quick example so again like I said an
app is just part of your website so on
my website my website isn't made using
Django but I'll just you know give you
guys a quick overview if this was made
using Django then this popular section
this would be an app the forum the forum
would be another app the video player
section this would be another app so
again any like main part of your website
that is called an app so again in Django
you have a website your main project and
it's composed of all these little apps
now it's actually pretty cool how Django
works with apps because they help you
organize all the different parts of your
website and every bit of code is
contained and they all work together
really cool and the rule that you have
to remember is each app
should do one thing so whenever you're
developing these apps if you can't
explain what it does in one sentence
then you need to break it up more so if
anyone asked me what is the new Boston
comm I'll say all right it's a website
you can go to and you know has like a
social network and it's a forum and it's
also like a video all right that's too
many sentences already so I know that I
have to break it up in apps so what is
the forum oh you can go and ask
questions all right simple enough that
can be an app what is this part oh you
can go and watch all my tutorials
alright so that can be an app too so
again remember you have a website it's
broken up into individual different
parts called apps if you can't explain
what a app does in one sentence without
people getting confused then you need to
take the app and break it up further
now another random thing I want to talk
to you guys about before you get started
is this way back when I actually had a
pretty cool idea for program and I'll
give you guys a little you know summary
of what it was basically everyone in the
world like you could set up your own
personal web server and once you had a
set up you could upload all your songs
in all your movie files and don't have a
really cool interface and that way you
can like download them from anywhere in
the world and also anyone else in the
world such as your friends they could do
the same now this is where it gets
interesting
if you and one your friends were
connected or I'm doing the little quote
things in my with my fingers friends
with one another then what you could do
is you could browse their library and
download their songs to your server so
it would be all these separate servers
working peer-to-peer instead of a
centralized website and of course once
you're connected they could view your
server and download your movies and I
just think it would be really cool and
what would make it even cooler if it was
open source and again like I said these
would be public web servers so you can
connect to it from anywhere in the world
from any device whether it's your
desktop your laptop your mobile phone
the
matter and again like I said since it
wouldn't be one central website it would
be server peer-to-peer architecture it
would be almost impossible to shut down
now again I'm not talking about like
pirating I'm talking about using these
for your personal songs maybe you play
the guitar or your personal home videos
or something like what I do like I make
tutorials if I want to share them with
the world then it would be a pretty cool
idea now of course this would probably
take a lot of work and I'm Way too lazy
to actually make something like this but
if we want it to then how do we do that
well the Django we need to think about
it so each of the different parts would
need to be an app so that means you
would probably want like the music files
to be a separate app maybe you wanted
the videos to be a separate app and
maybe you had like a profile section so
they knew like so whenever someone tried
connecting to your server they could be
like oh there's your profile photo
his name's bucky Roberts that's who owns
this server so each of those different
sections would be their own app so that
would be an example so if we wanted to
make something like that in our program
then what we would do is this so go
ahead and open up PowerShell and again
make sure you're in your root directory
so if you're right LS you should get
this again this idea file that's just
for PyCharm so make sure that you can
see managed up UI and that's it so how
do we make one of these apps well it's
easy type Python manage py again this is
a tool that came with it that I said
never edit we already use the before so
again it's kind of like a multi-purpose
tool pretty awesome and right the start
app so after this you just give your app
name so say that we wanted to develop
that music section first so we can
upload our you know of music files our
mp3s whatever so I'm just going to go
ahead and name it music and hit enter so
if we take a look back in our project we
can
see that we now have another directory
so this should be right next to your
main website directory and if we expand
this we can see that it came with a
bunch of files</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
