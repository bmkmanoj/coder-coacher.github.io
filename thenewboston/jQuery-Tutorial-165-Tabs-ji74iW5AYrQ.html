put four sortable append on this find
here and what we want to find is a
particular class and that class is UI
tabs enough so UI tabs nav is these
little buttons here the actual tabs
themselves so now when we refresh you
can see that we can actually move the
particular tab itself rather the entire
set of tabs so I could move that there
move that there put that at the start if
I wanted to so now that we've actually
found the particular tab that we want to
make sortable or the particular element
that we want to make sortable by this
class we can do so so if you're just
using sortable and its own is just going
to pick out the actual tabs itself
rather than the individual tabs so
that's how we go ahead and make it
sortable now the last thing I'm going to
talk about let's just make sure that's
working the last thing I'm going to talk
about is the cookie option now we can
supply a cookie option just after here
and this will take one option and that's
suppose that's the expiry time of the
cookie now before I go ahead and
actually demonstrate this let me just
tell you what it's for let's just say a
user was to click we'll get rid of this
for now just so nothing no errors occur
let's just say the user has clicked on
contact
now when the page is refreshed this will
go back to the default option which is
about me so if I click on loop and then
press f5 to refresh the page we go
straight back to the about me tab now
the cookie option is going to allow the
cookie to be stored and it will hold
which tab is currently open so when the
user refreshes their page in this case
the contact would stay open I've clicked
on contacts I've refreshed the page but
I want the contact details or the
contact area and the tab to still be
selected so how do we go about doing
this well we need to supply the cookie
option and inside here we set an expiry
time so we just say expires and this is
in days so we can select say
one day two day three days the amount of
days that we want to keep the cookie
active for so if we would say for two
days we wanted to keep these cookies
tabs you know we want to keep memory on
these tabs for now you've noticed I've
implemented this correctly however when
now now the problem is that when I click
on tabs nothing's actually working and
the reason for this is we need to
include the cookie plugin to be able to
use this so this is a still download as
long as you've gone ahead and downloaded
the entire jQuery UI and you've selected
the whole package this will be available
so let's go ahead and browse over to
development bundle folder and external
just show all files now jQuery cookie is
is the file that we need to include onto
our page to allow us to use this cookie
functionality so let's go ahead and just
include that now so we'll come down here
and we create a new script include so
the type is obviously a text slash
JavaScript and the source this time is
development bundle forward slash
external forward slash jQuery cookie is
so you feel free to obviously change
around these directory names it doesn't
really look nice when you're including
it in development bundle I've just done
it from the standard package to make it
easier for you to see in your directory
structure however now that we've
included the cookie plugin let's go
ahead and refresh we can select tabs as
normal when I select say the contact tab
and then refresh the page open that's
just
let's just go ahead and get rid of that
okay so now I select the contact tab
when i refresh the page you'll see that
the contact tab is left open because
what we view what we've done by using
this let's just get rid of that what we
we've done by using this cookie and
expires - we've now created a cookie
that expires in two days and holds the
tab that's currently open so however
much we refresh the cookie is now
telling us that this is the tab we want
to keep open with the relevant details
so we can then select say portfolio
I'm going to go ahead and hit f5 to
refresh the page and the portfolio has
stayed open so no matter how many how
much we refresh this cookie that we've
created has stored our tab preference or
the one that we've kept open last so
this is extremely useful if you want
users well let's go into a scenario if
your user comes into your website and
clicks on your portfolio and leaves out
your portfolio
when they come back into that you know
your website they'll still be able to
see your portfolio so it will leave your
op your user with the last option that
they clicked so this isn't extremely
useful just extremely useful for
functionality it's also extremely useful
for people that want to come directly
back from your website in one session
for example they might close their
browser and then go oh I want to go back
to the same page they might go back to
the same page and they'll have this tab
open I'm ready for them to continue
viewing as well as things like browser
crashes and if they accidentally close a
page for example so the last option
we've just taken a look at is the cookie
option however it's completely and
definitely not least because I think
it's a really good option and extremely
easy to implement as well so that's tabs
in jQuery UI remember you're going to go
ahead and create this as an outline and
you just really need tabs to be able to
actually use tabs again we've gone ahead
and changed some of these styling in
style dot CSS so this suits the sides of
the page and makes it look a bit nicer
but go ahead and play around with it
play around with the styles and play
around with some of the options that are
available to you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
