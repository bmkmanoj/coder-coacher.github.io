tutorial that I'm making for the new
Boston and in this tutorial I'm gonna be
showing you how to use the web browser
control so for this tutorial we're going
to clean it have button a text box and a
web browser control so just go over to
toolbox and drag a web browser control
over to your fill and I'm just going to
resize it back so once you have
everything on your form let's go ahead
and double click on your body right here
so when the user puts the button we're
going to have the web browser navigate
to whatever URL the user puts in a text
box right here and we're going to be
using you navigate method inside the web
browser class to do that we're going to
say web browser one navigate and this is
calls for parameter a string parameter
that will be the URL that you want the
web browser to go to so we're going to
say at X Box 1 5 X so we debug here and
type google.com in right here oh the web
browser should go there when we put this
bug yep perfect exactly what we want to
appreciate something different YouTube
go there as well
yup Yukie perfect alright so if one of
the web browser or this text box can
update as user puts around and display
the actual URL that the user is on we're
going to have to use an event to tell us
one web browsers page changes so there's
going to be events here and click
navigated so once it's navigated a
different location we're going to say
Xbox one dot text equals and then we're
going to use the URL property instead of
the web browser class this will just get
the current URL of the user on and we're
going after you the to string method to
convert that URL into a strip so now I
need a bug here we type in google.com we
were to type something in on Google
hello search you can see updates or the
actual URL that we are on there are also
basic methods such as go back or forward
and fresh so I'm just going to add some
buttons here to do those so we'll have
this one go back this one regress and
this one go forward and I might as well
during so I'll say this one will be
going back
this one will be Russian and this one
will be go forward all right so then go
back we're just going to use the go back
method go back and go Bart refresh first
needed fresh method this is pretty
self-explanatory and or obviously it's
going to use the billboard method to go
forward all right so now when we type in
Lord here click refresh it'll refresh
the page and take something in just
below search now we go back just take us
back to google.com
yep we go forward as you take us to that
search for the hello perfect and the
last method that I'm going to be showing
you is we go home method and go home
back that we'll just go to the home page
that you have set for Internet Explorer
go to movies whether or not
and the reason that it goes to whatever
homepage you have set or Internet
Explorer is because this web browser is
built off of Internet Explorer so just
keep that in mind so that's pretty much
it for this tutorial on using the web
browser control so see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
