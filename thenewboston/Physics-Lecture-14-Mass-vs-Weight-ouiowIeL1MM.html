fourteenth physics tutorial and in this
surah I want to explain you guys the
difference between mass and weight and
that is supposed to be an A right there
even though my handwriting is not that
great so a lot of people use the terms
mass and weight interchangeably but the
truth is these two terms are very very
different so let me go ahead and first
explain you guys what mass is mass is
defined as the amount of stuff inside an
object so all objects your car your
computer the pencil you might be holding
they have stuff inside it a bunch of
atoms particles a bunch of scientific
crap so technically when I say how much
stuff is inside an object whenever I say
stuff it's technically called matter now
why scientists named it matter instead
of stuff well I don't think they thought
that stuff was a very technical term so
basically the amount of stuff or matter
inside an object makes up an object's
mass so if you guys are saying you know
what that sounds an awful lot like
weight to me well it's easy to get too
confused so let me go ahead and swing
you guys what weight is now and how
scientists use it whenever you are
referring to weight now I'm going to go
ahead and talk about earth right now but
it's really any body that has gravity
you can have gravity on the moon on Mars
on Earth but I'm going to go ahead and
talk about the gravity of Earth right
now so here is the core of the earth and
of course since we live on earth we have
something called gravity that's always
pulling us towards the center of the
earth
now what weight is is that force how
strong is that pull that is pulling you
your body towards the center of the
earth the stronger it is the more that
object is going to weigh so again
whenever scientists talk about weight
they're talking about the force that's
pulling an object toward the center of
any body then typically in my examples
I'm going to be talking about the earth
but again you can have weight on the
moon you can have weight on
Mars so on and so forth so if you guys
are still saying you know what mass and
weight it's going to be really easy to
confuse the two well let me go ahead and
talk to you guys a little bit more about
weight and hopefully this should clear
something up so say we were standing on
earth
here's my beautiful earth right now and
there's the core of the earth now say we
had two people that were identical
clones of another one was standing just
on a flat plane and another was standing
on a mountain hey I'm up here so pretty
much the exact same person well if you
know how gravity works the force of
gravity is stronger the closer you are
to the center of the earth so this
person right here is going to be pulled
towards the center of the Earth's earth
with a stronger force than this person
right here so this person even though
they were the exact same person same
size same everything this person would
weigh more because they are closer to
the earth and that's another fun fact
did you know that if you stood on top of
a mountain then you actually weigh less
then if you were standing on the bottom
of the mountain or on a flat plane like
this guy right here so the further away
you get from the center of the earth the
less you weigh so you know if you don't
want to go on a diet or something you
know just move to like Denver Colorado
and your weight lipid list so you know
or you can you know exercise but who
wants to do that another thing is people
always ask why don't physicists use
weight all the time why do they love
using mass let's go ahead and think
about it here is beautiful earth that
must be like Australia and this is you
know Canada yada yada yada whenever you
have an object such as actually I don't
want to draw a person anymore say you
had a big chunk of wood and this is your
chunk of wood right now that wood would
have a certain amount of weight however
if that chunk of wood was on the moon
then since the moon is smaller its pull
of gravity is weaker so this block of
wood would weigh less that's why people
are able to hop around on the moon and
it looks like they're swimming because
the force of gravity on the moon
really weak so you only weigh a fraction
of what you were worth away on earth if
you went to the moon so obviously we can
see that even though this object and
this object are the exact same whenever
we try to take its way in different
places in the universe its weight can
change easy however its mass on the
other hand is consistent the same amount
of stuff in this block is going to be
there whenever we put it on the earth on
the moon on Mars the amount of matter
inside that object or the amount of mass
is going to be consistent no matter
where you are so that's why physicists
prefer mass instead of weight because if
you took an object and move it from
earth to the moon to Mars its weight is
going to fluctuate so you can never
really get a good understanding however
it's mass is a better I don't know it's
just a better way to measure things
because it's more consistent no matter
if you're on a mountain on the ground on
the moon on Mars mass is going to stay
the same so again on earth because
gravity is usually the same mass and
weight are indeed related but for the
purposes of physics and the rest of
these tutorials I'm going to be using
mass because it's basically better than
weight no one ever complains that they
need to lose mass for the new years and
that's another reason that just right
wait wait right there that's
embarrassing
so anyways I've been talking for way too
long so I'm going to go get a drink of
juicy juice maybe grab a juice box or
something and I will see you guys in the
next lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
