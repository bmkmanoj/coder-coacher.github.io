to your 15th Ajax tutorial and in this
video what I want to do is I want to
talk to you guys about a really cool
technique that you can do with
JavaScript and XML specifically I want
to talk to you guys about nodes a node
first of all what the heck is a node I
better explain that well in XML if
you're unfamiliar and I want to talk
about this because I know at the
beginning of this series I said if
you're not you know super familiar with
XML I'll give you guys a little brief
description as we go along so we won't
get lost so for those of you you know
who know about that that's fine but for
those of you who haven't worked with a
lot before basically whenever you're
working with the XML document everything
is a node the people who develop XML
were really lazy so they pretty much
called everything a node so let me go
ahead and write some crap real quick
also make a simple paragraph and I'll be
like Bucky a text text whatever all
right so even though we're looking at an
HTML document let's just go ahead and
pretend this was an XML document because
you know they're pretty similar actually
so basically if this was an XML document
then this entire document everything
would be called a document node and
let's go ahead and take a look at this
paragraph right here every single
element in this paragraph this body this
head the script we'll just go ahead and
cause it straight on the paragraph right
here this paragraph element is called an
element node pretty creative you know
and this text right here can you guess
what they called the text it's called a
text node so basically every single
thing in an XML document is called a
node pretty creative but why did I go
ahead and waste the minute of your life
explaining that well the reason I did
that was because I just felt like
wasting a minute of your life now I'm
just kidding but it's basically because
we can work with these individual nodes
in JavaScript and we can do some really
awesome in useful things with them so
the first thing I want to do is explain
to you guys that I'm not going to waste
your time coding this entire HTML
document I basically have a script or a
little piece of code that
links to this file right here and also
on mode it calls game time and of course
we need to code that function right now
so of course my div is called the D for
the div of course you know what else
would that stand for it so now let's go
ahead and code the one function that I
want to talk to you guys about game time
so remember that this is the function
that whenever this HTML document loads
that this is the very first function
that's going to be called in guys this
is the only function in this tutorial so
you know don't worry now the first thing
I want to do is I basically want to
create a program like we did last time
but instead of listing you know like my
favorite movies which were maybe
inappropriate movies what I want to do
is I want to do that in a different way
I want to do that through the use of
nodes so I don't want to do movies again
because you know that's boring so let's
just go ahead and create like a list of
my favorite things or something so the
first thing we need is that title
because you know how it said you know
like here's a list of my favorite movies
I'll just go ahead and generate that
title through JavaScript this time so
document and this is how you create an
individual node in JavaScript so before
you just go ahead and write it in your
HTML document but for this you would put
create text node and this pretty much
means create text simple enough probably
didn't even need to explain that so
let's go ahead and write um here are
some things Wow how do you spell things
let me look that up in urban dictionary
all right so this is basically just text
so now what I want to do is now that we
got the text node created I want to go
ahead and create that list so how do you
create a pretty much in element and this
goes the same for any XML arm if you're
working with HTML you can go ahead and
create you know paragraphs and unordered
lists and I'll go ahead and show you
guys in they'll make sense so in order
to create an unordered list kind of a
tongue-twister this is what you need to
do document dot
create elements because remember that I
said that the paragraph that we took
away that paragraph was called an
element node so this is basically how
you create that create element and then
as the parameter you write the name of
your element so I want to create an
unordered list and of course the element
name for that is ul simple enough we
already know that from HTML so now what
we basically did is we created a piece
of text and this is kind of going to be
like the header and we also created an
unordered list now what we need to do is
we actually need to add items to that
list so let's go ahead and see how to do
that item 1 equals</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
