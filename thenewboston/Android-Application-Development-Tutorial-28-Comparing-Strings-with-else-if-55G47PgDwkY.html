Android tutorial for the new boston
again we're going to be working with
this text play class or this text fit
play activity that we set up we're just
going to set up our actual button we've
set up and pretty much finished our
toggle button but now we want to set up
our check command button so again just
go down below this line of where we
closed off our setting up our
onclicklistener for a toggle button
should be two brackets below we're still
within the oncreate method and we're
just going to quickly set up our button
called check command so we're going to
type out the variable name check command
or you know chk CMD and then hit dot set
onclicklistener guy should be getting
pretty familiar with this we're just
going to finish off the statement so we
don't forget later and then we're gonna
you know hit new view dot
onclicklistener enter and it will set it
up for us
now what we're going to do it with in
here is basically we're going to see
what text is in our edit our edit view
and it's going to compare it to some
commands that we're going to set up so
what we're going to do first is set up a
new string variable we're going to call
this check what we're going to do is
we're going to pull from the edit text
called input that we set up we're going
to say input we're going to say dot and
we're going to say get text it's a
method that we can use that's editable
from the edit text class and this is
just going to give us what text is
within that edit text and then what
we're going to do is set it to a string
or convert it into a string variable so
we just hit dot and use the method to
string and you guys can always read over
here to get a little information if you
guys want but there we go now every time
we click this check command button it's
going to change this check variable that
we just set up to whatever is in our
edit box and again here's our edit text
it's going to get the text from the box
for the most part and then convert it to
a string
so those are some methods you guys might
want to use for you know your edit text
when you're working with those and then
what we're going to do is we're going to
say if and then you guys are kind of
familiar with the if statement hopefully
we're going to say if check and we're
going to compare it to a text that we
want or command for the most part so
we're going to use a method
I mean you you'd expect say you might
think of something like this if you know
our Edit box for the most part equals
Travis we can do something but you can't
compare two strings like that because
again this is a string for the most part
and this is a string you can't compare
them with the equal sign which is pretty
lame but we have to use a method so
we're going to say if dot and it says
content equals and it's going to compare
it to a character sequence so basically
that means it's going to be case
sensitive for the most part and it's a
boolean so it's going to be true or
false so if if our check or whatever is
in our edit box equals you know whatever
string we set up here so we're going to
say something like left if I can type
left and then we're going to set up a
pair of brackets right here and so now
if F our edit box if someone typed in
left
although excuse me all lowercase and hit
enter or hit the button called check
command it's going to set up this
variable pull the text from it turn it
into a string and then basically so our
check would equal left right now for the
most part and then it's going to compare
it to this command left that we set up
so if you know our string equals left
and it's going to basically do whatever
is within this statement and then we're
going to say else just like we did
before but now we can say if so it's
basically going to check through this
statement as well and we can just kind
of copy and paste our little R
basically our what we're checking here
we're going to say if equals center and
you guys can put another bracket here
and then we can also say else if and
then copy and paste and this time we're
going to say right so there we go I know
we're getting a lot of brackets so
hopefully you guys are falling along
perfectly and you aren't getting errors
or anything but sup and that's also why
we closed off that statement early
because you know looking through all
these brackets you're like dangit where
am I supposed to close that off for the
most part I mean I don't know if that's
confusing or not but hopefully you guys
follow along and then we're going to set
up what these are going to do with in
the next tutorial as well as set up some
more commands and just have some fun
with this text but that's just kind of
the introduction to the else if
statements we did the if-else the last
tutorial for the most part or two
tutorials ago I'm not sure but this is
the if-else and we also converted edit
text into a string so that's what we've
done and then we compare basically two
strings together by using this method
content equals and then whatever we want
to compare it to so hopefully that made
some sense and hopefully you guys are
getting familiar with how to set up
these buttons so you can you know tell
your friends hey man if you have a
button you need setup I'm your man but
besides that thanks again for watching
we'll hope to see in the next tutorial
have a good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
