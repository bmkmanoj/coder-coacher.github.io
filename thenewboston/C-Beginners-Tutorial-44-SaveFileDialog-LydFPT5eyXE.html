c-sharp tutorial that I'm making for the
new Boston and in this tutorial I'm
going to be showing you how to use the
save file dialog so all you're going to
need for this tutorial is a button and
this code right here and basically what
this code does is it creates a new
binary writer and instead of overriding
an existing file it creates a whole new
file because you do file create and then
this path right here is this path up
here to string path and it's equal to an
empty string right now so if we were to
try and write this we get an error
because the path doesn't exist so we're
going to get into this later setting
path and then it just write the contents
of the text file which will be this
example text file and then dispose of
the binary writer alright so since we
since the string path appear is an equal
to an empty string we have to change
that we have to change it to something
that um as a valid path now we could
actually type in the path or here if you
like see and then and then like users
and all that stuff but now let's think
that we want the user to be able to
choose um where they want to write the
text file to so in order to do that
we're going to use the save file dialog
so in order to do that just create a new
instance of the save file dialog just
you save file dialog sfd or you can name
it anything you'd like but I usually
call it s FD or save file dialog and
then set it equal to a new save file
dialog and just like the Open File
dialog we're going to make sure that the
user actually chooses a location and
they don't just exit out of a dialog so
we're just going to create an F
statement here and say if the result of
the show dialog is okay then continue
and actually write the file and now that
we have the user choose location we're
going to want to use that location to
write the file too so we're just going
to do SFTP file name
and now it should show the or create a
new instance of the open file or the
save file dialog check to make sure that
the user chooses location and then it
will set the path equal to whatever the
user chooses of the location so now we
debug here click write file it should
first ask ask for a location it's going
to name our file right here let's call
combined text file dot txt click Save
should have written the file to my
desktop yep example text file exactly
what we're looking for so there are a
few different things that you can do to
your save file dialog say you want to
like change the title of it or something
or only allow them to be able to write
text files which is what we're going to
be looking at first so just like the
Open File dialog you can create a filter
and just with an open file dialog it
only allows you to open files with a
certain extension well with the save
file dialog it only allows you to save
files with a certain extension so if we
do like sfd filter we can do we can set
up a filter just like we did for the
Open File dialog so it's me Paula I just
named it a txt file
put a line star period and then we can
put on the extension and we only want
them to be able to save txt files so now
we're to go up here debug the right file
save save as type is only a text file we
can only save a txt file right now so
for this caller atom it will default Li
save it with the extension dot txt or a
txt file
yep we've got Adam dot tex dot txt
exactly what we're looking for
now you can also set the file name for
example when you when they will open the
save file dialog if you want the name of
the file to be folly be something you
can do that so if we're going to do SPD
dot file name we can just set it equal
to my text file so now when we open up
the save file dialog it says right there
file name is my text file and we didn't
even have to type in the extension right
there like save or the file name right
there we didn't type in txt it just
automatically added it because we add
the filter and the last thing I'm going
to show you the save file dialog you can
change the title the title of it so if
you just want to make it like save X
file
you can do that so now the title of the
save file dialog will be save text file
yep save text file right there so that's
pretty much it for this tutorial on save
file dialog there's really not that much
to it and it's very similar to the Open
File dialog so see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
