welcome to your 21st iphone development
door oh and look at the time for 21
coincidence i think not so anyways we're
going to be building a program that has
multiple views and in case you don't
remember what a view is is pretty much
the screen or window so before I mean we
changed some things around on the same
view like added button switch labels but
in this example we're going to be
changing through multiple views so
here's our application here's a toolbar
at the bottom and this hbu is actually
its own separate class so when you click
change your views it changed to a whole
entirely different view and I know it
just looked like the background change
but actually this is how you change
through like multiple views you can have
a whole new window if you want the
easiest thing in this story's just have
a button at the bottom is switched
between one view and another so i know
that this looks really simple in we
could actually build this application
using one window but i mean how would i
teach you to manage multiple views if i
just did that now i can so that's why we
need to build a simple program to switch
between views using a button so go ahead
and quit out of your iPhone simulator
and go ahead and open Xcode and we'll go
ahead and start a brand new project and
go ahead in yeah we're going to change
thing up instead of a view based which
is pretty much just one view we're going
to be making a window based application
so go ahead window based application
choose that and I'm getting in mind
beans too since my old one was named
beans that I just showed you guys that
example of so go ahead and save this is
beans too and now go ahead and expand
your classes and resource folder and as
you can see we don't really have any
classes made up so far except just the
app delegates and those are these are
basically the built in classes about how
do you want your application to run as
soon as your program opens pretty much
as housekeeping stuff like a
you know application make sure finish
launching even though we don't have
anything in there yet and pretty much
like I said just the housekeeping stuff
make sure you have a window nothing
exciting so what we're going to do is
we're going to need build a bunch of
different classes all the classes that
we need our program and also all those
nip files which is pretty much the
windows or the views themselves so
before I even go on let me tell you guys
what classes we're going to need we're
going to need three classes we're going
to need a switch class and thus which
class is basically the class that's
going to be responsible from switching
back the blue and red the two different
views now in this switch class we're
going to be building pretty much the
toolbar on the bottom and that's it
that's the class that's going to stay
there now in our blue class is just the
blue background in the red class just a
red background but again these are all
different views they aren't just
backgrounds so we also are going to need
an ad to interface files a blue window
in a red window so let's go ahead and
have me quit talking and do all that
right now so classes right click add new
file and you get a bunch of options that
pop up what we want is a cocoa touch
class in a UI view controller subclass
so this actually is a controller class
to control your viewer window so go
ahead and click Next and name this
switch class because this is the main
class the first class that you see when
you're pregnant pops up this is going to
be it so go ahead and finish this and
now let's go ahead and oh by the way
make sure you have em selected go ahead
and do that two more times new file next
and name this one blue class-m finish
and classes and new file next
read class-m and now if you see in Xcode
you should not only have your delegates
which is pretty much on your program
files should also have the switch files
or switch class which is responsible for
pretty much doing everything we're going
to do in our program switching between
the blue class and the red class serve
saying all right now I know I have these
classes made up which is pretty much the
code but now i need the nib files and
check it out if you say all right there
down in resources they got though
automatically since it isn't a view
based application we actually need to
build the NIP files separately so go
ahead read clear resources add new file
and you actually go to user interfaces
and from here go to view x ib and click
next and these are going to be the views
or the windows or the screen either one
that represents each class so we need
one for blue so name this blue window or
blue screen and it blew one knows how
have the same thing as me and now right
click resources ginn add new file view
of course next and we'll name this red
window and this will be responsible for
displaying that red screen let's go
ahead and finish that all we're going to
do is pretty much click the interface
builder and make the background read
along with some other stuff so now let's
go ahead and begin coding our program
now go ahead into app delegate h and
from here what we want to do is as soon
as our program opens we want to show
that switch class and what the switch
class is going to do is is either gonna
say alright if you press the button i'm
going to show the red class or you're
pressed another button i'm going to show
the boot cuffs the switch class is
basically the class that handles the
other classes and that way no matter how
many views we have we can handle them
all from one class super easy to the
easiest way to do things and we're
owning on the handling two classes but
anyways it's still easy so what we need
to do is of course
in our app delegate are um interface
file go ahead and aunt switch class and
actually a new go class switch class
yeah that's a lot better so now we
imported the switch class server saying
all right now we might as well switch
class make it object so we can access
the things switch class and by the way
remember don't name your class just
switch because switch is something
that's built into a it's a built-in not
a function I guess well it's just
something that is billing the
objective-c so don't name anything
switch name a switch class switch views
which the hot dog if you want it doesn't
matter so anyways the last thing we need
to do now that we got object to access
things from the switch class is go ahead
and make outlet to that class so add
property of course non-atomic retain ib
outlet switch class and of course the
object switch class there we go I never
say in all right why do you need to
outlet well in order to access that
switch class we want to access its view
and add it to the main window the main
window that first pops up when you start
your program so in order to take this
view and add it to the main window we
need be able to access it via an outlet
so that's why we're doing this and of
course don't forget that this is the
class that's responsible for managing
all the other views so that's why we
want this one to be on the main window
and it's pretty much the main view so
that's all the time I have for astoria I
thought I was going to get through some
more but I did so in our next tutorial
we're well it doesn't matter i'm at a
time you'll see in the next tutorial so
thanks for watching don't forget
subscribe this source code is in the
link below if you want it so yeah thanks
for watching don't forget subscribe and
I'll see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
