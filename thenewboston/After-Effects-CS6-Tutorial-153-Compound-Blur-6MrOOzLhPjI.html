Blackford here with another After
Effects cs6 tutorial and today I wanted
to talk to you about compound effects
and now I've been getting more and more
into different effects lately in our
tutorials so we can figure out how to
use them and so you can know what you
might want to use when you're using when
you're trying to figure out actually how
to create a certain look and all that
stuff so now I want to get into compound
effects because they're a little bit
different than just normal effects in
the fact that you need another layer to
have them work properly so for example
I've got this compound effect on here
called compound blur and they don't all
say compound in the name just this one
does so we have to create a map or use
like an alpha channel or something like
that another layer to be able to get
this blur to work so if I have none on
it nothing's going is gonna work but I
created this map here that I'll show you
later where we can select that and use
it as like another blur or I can use
something else if I would like to and
it'll blur out depending on of what
you've got going on so this tutorial
might last a couple videos because
there's a few effects that I want to
show you that are pretty cool and/or
I'll just put it into like a little
series here and we'll see what happens
so I guess the first one I'm just gonna
show you is compound blur so I'm just
gonna delete out everything I have
except for this text and take off this
logo so all I did was just take took
some text and wrote compound blur a
bunch of times and stretched it out and
let me just I'll just stretch it out
even further so it's like going across
the whole screen let's go
there we go so now it's stretching
across the whole entire thing and the
reason why I want to do that is because
the map that I'm gonna be making is the
same size as my composition so what I'm
gonna do is let's uh go into our project
panel here and we're gonna figure out
what our composition sizes so let's go
into composition composition settings
and we've got a 1280 by 720 size
composition frame rate twenty-four and
square pixels so that's fine and just
remember that so when you're making your
new pre comps that we're gonna have to
make and everything like that that
everything looks and is the same size
because it'll be a little weird if it
isn't so let's uh we're gonna create a
new layer and the compound blur effect
is created by using alpha Channel colors
so a grayscale image to
determine what's going to be blurred and
what isn't so we're gonna create a white
solid here and we'll just name this blur
white and make sure it's the correct
composition size and if you want to do
it quickly just click on this make comp
size button right here and hit OK now
we've got this going on here we're gonna
take a couple we're gonna take this
rectangle tool and we're gonna draw a
couple boxes so if you click on the
rectangle tool and make sure you're not
clicked on your white layer you'll get
this fill button here and you can make
that black and let's just draw a couple
black boxes going across
like this that's good so we've got that
going on we've got this now we have a
shape layer and this a white layer we
want these both in the same like actual
one layer so that we can use the so we
can select the one layer in the comp or
in the compound effect called compound
blur because you can only select one
layer so what we're gonna do to do that
is pre-compose these into one layer so
we're gonna double click on both of them
right click on it and go to pre-compose
now I talked about pre comps in a
earlier tutorial which was only a couple
back so check that out if you're not
familiar with pre composing so I'm gonna
name this blur map and hit OK
blur map is a good kind of name for this
so it describes your effect that you're
using it for and what it is and this is
a map that we're gonna use it's gonna
map the black and white images for the
blur so hit okay now we've got blur map
in here now we can turn that turn the
eye for that off so we can see what's
going on we're gonna come to our text
layer and we're gonna put on our
compound blur so I'm going to type it in
over here on the right
compound there we go let's drag it on to
our actual text and now we've got the
compound blur here now what we need to
do is select this blur layer here and
put it on to our blur map and now you
can see that the blur map has been
affected on here so it's taking the
white and it's using that to blur out
well what we have on our text layer
so it is pretty pretty sweet there so
let's go to our maximum blur here and
that'll did that a lot just like that's
your blur slider value there so it
decreases and increases the blur you can
see it's not like really precise so
you're gonna have to probably like type
in your values and stuff like that so I
don't know like five point three or
something like that you're gonna have to
type that stuff in to get more precise
so we've got a stretch map to fit and
since this is a whole calm down then
we've got our invert here if you want to
use the blacks for the blur and the
white for the non blur area so that's
how you invert now this works this blur
map if we go back into it also works
with the gray value so if I go to make a
couple more shape layers in here and
make them gray and just throw them in
here somewhere in between just remember
that this one right here in the middle a
couple one two three four over that's a
great value
if we go into our effects what's going
to our compound blur effect
we've got the gray value right here
that's it's not as strong as the black
so that's good let me turn that on as
you can see there you turn the opacity
is down we can kind of see how they're
like lining up as you guys can see there
so that's how you use that effect and
that's how you use compound effects
there there's a couple other that I'm
probably going to show you once distort
and I made a cool video with water drop
droplets where the actual when the water
moved it distorted the words so I had to
use the water video footage as the
distortion and then I there's a couple
other ones that I'm gonna go over I
haven't decided which of them then I'm
gonna go over yet but then I mean I'll
just make the video I hate when I do
that sometimes when you click on it this
happens like all the time to me and then
you just drag it back up to where it's
supposed to be that happens if that ever
happens to you just swear and then grab
it and put it back up there cuz it'll
make you feel better if you swear at it
so that's all I'm gonna say for this
tutorial thanks for watching this one
and keep watching to check out the next
other compound effects that I'm going to
bring up and subscribe if you want some
more After Effects videos and that's
pretty much it
thanks for watching everybody have a
good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
