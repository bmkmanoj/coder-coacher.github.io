introduce you to the terminal so if you
click this button in the top left this
allows you to search your computer for
programs and if you click ter or type it
in then it's going to pop up and just
click this right here so this ladies and
gentlemen is the terminal this is your
new home and just so you don't have to
type you know go into here and type ter
and find the terminal every time what
I'm going to do is I'm just going to
right click it and hit lock to launcher
so then whenever we close out of it we
can just click it again and boom there
you go so like I said this is your new
home this terminal is pretty much a
command prompt which gives you complete
control over your entire operating
system so from here we can navigate
around our computer we can create files
we can read files we can create new
directories a whole bunch of stuff
and if you're thinking you know what why
am I using this thing when I can just
use you know like I've always used with
Windows just you know open up some
program a text editor or something
typing it with my keyboard and mouse so
why do I need this weird old-school look
in terminal or shell window whatever you
want to call it well the reason you need
to be familiar with this is because
let's say that you're on some kind of
systems administrator and you have
servers all around the world maybe one
in Montana maybe one over in China well
you just can't fly over there and sit it
you know a computer and pop-up windows
and start you know typing in all your
commands to manage that server you need
to connect to it remotely through your
own computer wherever you are so
whenever you connect to it you don't
have this interface that you're looking
at right here you have something that
looks like this and from here you can
remotely access that server and run all
of your commands also let's say that
you're making some kind of cool new
robotic well if you just have a little
you know handheld robot you obviously
just can't you know like shove a monitor
into the back of it somewhere and expect
to see this interface right here in
instead of what you do is you plug in or
you access it you know maybe through a
little USB port and you got a terminal
where you can type in all the commands
manage all the files and everything like
that and the most important reason we
want to use this is because it looks
cool and it looks like we're hacker so
that's actually not the most important
reason but you know it is pretty cool so
what I'm going to do just so this is I
don't know a little bit more comfortable
is and this is just my personal
preference you don't have to do this but
I'm going to right click here and hit
profile profile preferences now you see
how here let me show you guys you see
how this little cursor right now is like
a block well grown up I never use this
block I always had like a little eye
beam so I'm just gonna switch this to I
beam hold on my Alexa stop all right I
got that um Amazon echo it's like this
voice-activated thingy from I don't know
that I just said the timer because I'm
making pizza and it's pretty cool
because I don't have to get out of my
chair and just yell to it to stop so
pretty lazy but anyways
whenever I switch my cursor to an i-beam
you guys can see that the cursor is now
a blinking i-beam in I don't know I'm
just a little bit more comfortable with
that then that big blocky looking cursor
now another thing I want to do is I just
want to change the default font and this
is just so it's a little bit easier to
see in my videos so let me select this
all right that'll be pretty good so I'm
going to close this looking good so
hopefully you guys can see that on
YouTube if it's too small then I'll bump
it up again just let me know alright so
I didn't even type anything and I'm
already confused because I don't know
what all of these weird symbols mean
well I'll explain this real quick the
format of this little syntax right here
is first it's the username so remember I
am logged in as Bucky so that's why it
says Bucky now after the username comes
in
sign and after this is your host in
other word it's just you the name of
your computer and mine is a boo - now
after this is the path now this little
squiggly this means my home directory so
if you ever want to see more information
about what directory you are currently
in right now you can just press PWD and
hit enter
this means print working directory so
what we're going to do is we're going to
navigate through our computer just like
let me show you so basically you know
with Windows what you can do is you can
navigate with this little it's called
Windows Explorer go to your downloads
and then maybe go to your desktop and
everything is visual well that's
essentially all we're going to do but we
are doing it through our command prompt
got like a singing my throat alright so
right now we are in home slash Bucky and
for this demo it might actually be a
little bit better if you guys can see
what's visually going on so I'm going to
create a sample file right on my desktop
so I'm going to hit right and I'll just
hit new document empty document and I'll
just name this up I'll just name it like
story so story and hit enter now let me
double click this and I'm just going to
add some text to it again you guys don't
need to do this if you want but I just
want a sample file so I can like edit it
delete it show you guys all the simple
commands so I'll just write like uh my
name is Bucky and I love pizza so if I
just hit save alright so we now have a
file so let's hop back into the terminal
and let's let me show you guys how to
just read the contents of that file
first so anytime you want to display the
contents of a file if you hit CAT it
allows you to do that so now you have to
write what file are you trying to read
well it's on my desktop and the file
name is story so pretty much the path
to that file now hit enter and check it
out it says my name is Bucky and I love
pizza well how did I know that this
desktop slash Shirley was the proper
path and it wasn't home slash Bucky
slash desktop slash story well I kind of
jumped ahead but now I'm going to show
you guys how what the heck is going on
but on my antivirus thing is popping up
on my host computer alright any hoots
alright so we already know if we want to
find out what directory we are currently
in you hit PWD so we're in Bucky right
now now if I ever want to know all the
files that are inside Bucky I can just
hit LS so this lists all the files and
directories that are inside Bucky so
from here I can go into my desktop
downloads music all that fun stuff
now there's also some other commands
that you can do and one of them is LS -
L now this - L option
I'll show you guys what this does it
gives you more details about these
directories so for example desktop and
I'll show you guys what all these
permissions and other stuff means later
on but if you ever want more information
or a detailed list of all the contents
then use - L another thing that you can
do is LS - a now this - a parameter you
know in Windows you have hidden on
folders or hidden directories that's
what this - a does it shows you not only
the regular folders and files but also
the hidden ones and in Linux hidden
files are sometimes called dot files now
usually like this one right here dot
config dot cache armed dot local these
are all the files that are usually
hidden to a user
now as I saying you typically don't want
to edit these files because they're
hidden for a reason
they're usually configuration files or
they're needed by some other program and
they're just the settings so don't edit
any
figuration or dot file unless you really
need to and you see how my screen is
getting kind of messy right now kind of
you know there's just a lot of text on
it if you just type clear and hit enter
then it's just going to give you a nice
blank screen and you don't have to close
out and open your terminal again now the
last thing I want to show you guys in
this video is one other command so if I
ever want to list the files then I go to
LS that's going to list all the files
and we already learned about L which is
the detailed version in an a which gives
you the hidden files as well you can
also combine them into L a so LS space
minus L a so what this does is it gives
you the best of both worlds it not only
shows all of the hidden files but also
the details of each so that's how you
find out what directory you are
currently in how you display the
contents of file and also how to view
all of the files and folders in whatever
directory you are currently in so there
you go if it sounds kind of overwhelming
right now I promise just stick with it
it's going to become natural after like
I don't know probably like two more
tutorials all these commands are going
to come second nature so anyways thank
guys for watching
let me get subscribe see you next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
