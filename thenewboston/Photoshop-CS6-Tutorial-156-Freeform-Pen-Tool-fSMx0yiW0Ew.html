Photoshop cs6 tutorial my name is buddy
Blackford today we're going to go over
how to create a path using the free form
pen tool it's pretty easy and it's got
some cool features that I wanted to show
you so let's go ahead and get started
so open up a new document just a blank
document and I have a like a background
layer if you want it could be anything
just a plain background layer is the
easiest to follow go ahead and go to
over here to your pen tools over here
and select freeform pen tool and you can
see P is the shortcut come up here and
make sure you're set to path and we can
go ahead and get started
so all you need to do to start using
this is click and drag and you can go
ahead and draw any shape that you want
and just like the other pen tool the
regular pen tool you can close up your
shape when the cursor comes to a circle
and you have created a path now if you
look over here in our path section
that's where your work path is going to
be now you can see that this doesn't
look really like what I just made it's
got some jagged edges and if I click on
it with my path selection tool you can
see that there's a bunch of different
points that it has made well we have
some control over this where we can make
this smoother if we want and let's move
that if we want as well so let's go back
to our free form pen tool and I'm going
to go back to where I don't have
anything going on here let's go into our
options here and we see this called
curve fit and if you watch the tutorial
about making a selection into a path
this is just kind of like the tolerance
and this controls the complexity of your
path so the values can be set from 0.5
to 10 where the higher value the less
complex the path
aka less anchor points and the lower
value has a more precise but more
complex path so let's go ahead and
change this up to 10
and let's go ahead and draw again and
close it up and you can see it tries to
make the path let's click on it and we
see what we've got going on here now
we've got some of these edges here that
aren't very aren't like what we've
wanted they're a little too uh there's
they're a little too what do you call it
sharp and we can change that if we go to
our direct selection tool select them
we've got some handles here and we can
make the edges a little bit nicer if you
click on it again you can get two
handles and now if I look the edge is a
lot smoother but what uh the main thing
I was trying to show you is that now we
have less points we put the curve up to
ten and less points here for a less
complex path well let's go ahead and
make a path whether it's at the point
five so let's go back to make layer
alright let's go to our free form pen
tool set this to 0.5 see if that worked
yep point five start drawing things I
think this might have been kind of like
what I made last time and I didn't make
that right I didn't close it and you can
see what's going on here if I click on
the tool you can see there's a lot more
points now and it gives us a nicer
curvier at edges because there's more
points involved um one thing when you're
working with vector shapes if you feel
like you're going to have to edit your
shape later and mess with it a little
more you don't want to have as many
points because you have less control
over it when you have more points so if
I try to mess with like this section
right here it's going to be hard let me
go to my direct selection tool and I
wanted to maybe move this around so it
looks nicer direct selection my bed
select again now I got to move every
single one of these points and you can
see I'm getting some jagged ease and
it's really annoying if I only had just
a couple of points so lose my bed if I
go to here and delete Anchor Point tool
to delete some of these anchor points
out of here go to my selection tool this
is getting a little more advanced than I
was thinking of in the tutorial now I
can move that section a lot easier
there's no but there's not a lot of
jagged edges and it's just easier to
edit when you have less points so that's
a what I wanted to show you about the
free form pen tool in the next tutorial
we're going to use the freeform pen tool
as well but let's go to it real quick
there's this magnetic box right here and
I'm going to show you how to use that
because it kind of makes it into a whole
new tool almost so let's do that in the
next tutorial so stay tuned and check it
out and you'll learn some more cool tips
so see you guys later in the next
tutorial I look forward to seeing you
there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
