second physics lesson and in this lesson
I first want to start off by talking a
little bit more about velocity and then
if we have time I want to hop into
something called acceleration so
basically we know from the last tutorial
that velocity equals distance over time
now the cool thing about this formula in
a lot of different formulas in physics
is this not only is the formula for
velocity but we can also use this
formula to find the distance in time so
say we have a problem where we have the
velocity and time but we need to figure
out the distance when would this be well
say I dropped my sister off at the movie
theater and I was a jerk and I didn't
feel like picking her up so she had to
walk home now it took her three hours to
walk home so we know that three hours
would be the time it takes to walk home
so then we said when she got home
hey how fast were you going and she said
well I was walking at a rate of four
miles per hour although she would
probably say something like shut up
don't talk to me I'm gonna freakin cut
your head off but you know she was nice
and said actually I was walking at a
rate of 4 miles per hour so we know that
4 miles per hour is the velocity or
speed well now we want to calculate how
far did she walk well the first thing we
need to do is we need to get distance on
its own side of the equation so how do
we get distance alone well we times this
by T so those cancel out and we end up
with this distance equals velocity times
time so now let's go ahead and plug in
what we have distance equals velocity
and I'm going to leave out miles per
hour an hour
vil us or excuse me yeah a velocity of 4
and a time of 3 so now what happens when
you take 4 miles per hour and times it
by 3 hours that must mean that you
walked a distance of 12 miles or sheeted
sucks to be her so that is basically how
you calculate
it's using this equation now if you guys
are wondering what if I had the distance
and velocity already but I needed to
figure out the formula for time well
time is equal to distance over velocity
so if you ever need to figure out time
then use this formula so again you can
calculate the different variables of
this formula by breaking it apart into
different pieces
pretty cool huh so now let me go ahead
and talk to you guys about something
else
and that is acceleration now a lot of
people get acceleration and velocity and
speed mixed up in their head but I'm
going to try to give you guys a really
easy example of how they're different
say you were driving your car and you
put your car on cruise control at 45
miles per hour now your car would be
going a constant speed of 45 miles per
hour and not be changing speeds
therefore since you aren't changing
speeds you are not accelerating
acceleration is basically changing
speeds okay so when would you accelerate
well let's say you were at a red light
and then that red light turned green
well you would then go from zero to 30
miles per hour as you would accelerate
so therefore since your speed would be
changing your car would be accelerating
pretty interesting huh so let's go ahead
and take a look at the formula for
acceleration whenever we try to find out
acceleration to physics we use the small
letter A now the formula is change in
speed and whenever we need to symbolize
change in physics we use a triangle so
change in speed or change in velocity
same thing for now even though they are
different over change in time and I'm
going to make I think I'm going to make
my teas like this from now on they're a
little easier to see so let's go ahead
and take a look at that example let's
say that we started out at 0 miles per
hour I say miles per hour really were
miles per hour tongue twister condom and
we ended up going 30 miles per hour
and it took us I don't know six seconds
give me a break guys I only got a cobalt
in a neon embarrassing so now let's go
ahead and figure out this baby so
acceleration equals the change in
velocity which is 30 minus zero over the
change in time which is six seconds so
now if we simplify this that would be 30
over six and again like I said well I
might as well go ahead and throw these
in 30 miles per hour over six seconds
and we would end up with an acceleration
of five miles per hour per second so
this right here is our final
acceleration and again whenever we talk
about acceleration like I said in the
last tutorial just like velocity we
typically don't use miles hours we
typically use meters and seconds but for
this example this is how you would write
it five miles per hour per second I know
it's confusing at first but uh well
that's just the way it is so in other
words you start out at zero miles per
hour and your speed increases by five
miles per hour every second so that's
why after six seconds you're traveling
at a speed of 30 miles per hour so
that's what acceleration means and
that's how you calculate average
acceleration over six seconds so anyways
that's all I have for you guys for this
story thank you guys for watching don't
forget to subscribe and I'll see you
guys in the next lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
