C++ tutorial and I know in the last
tutorial I told you guys I was going to
be building a program using the this
keyword but I was building it and I
noticed that there was a lot of concepts
I didn't teach you guys so we're going
to have to come back that after I taught
you guys a couple new concepts so we'll
get back to that but for now I want to
talk to you guys about something called
operator overloading
now operator overloading is a weird
feature with C++
well operator overloading is is it
allows you to use C++ operators like you
know plus and multiply and it allows you
to take these operators and change the
way that they're used so for example
maybe you have a class and you want to
add two objects together well how the
heck does C++ know how to add your two
custom objects together well that way
you can use operator overloading to
specify what you want this operator to
do so what I did already is I made a new
class called Sally and I also include
the Sally header in here and I included
an IO Sriman namespace in here so now my
dot CPP files look the same just to save
this tutorial some time so now let's go
ahead and get into the coding so let's
go ahead in the sadi sally header file
and notice that i took out both private
and protected because we're just going
to make everything in public it's going
to make everything a whole lot easier
so the Sally class is going to have a
couple things in it the first thing it's
going to have is a variable called num
and this is the only variable it's going
to have um it just needs a variable
pretend this is like Sally's age or
something I just named it num because
it's easier to work with now let's go
ahead and create two constructors the
first constructor is pretty much just
going to be empty constructor we're
going to be building a sally object and
whenever we don't pass any parameters to
it it's just going to create a blank
sally object and we're also going to be
creating another constructor
and whenever we create a Sally object
and we pass an integer into it what I
want to do is well let me go ahead I
guess can code this right now whenever
we create a Sally object and we pass an
integer into it called like integer a or
something what this is going to do is I
like it right up there what this is
going to do is take that number T and
set it equal to a so we're going to
create Sally objects in two ways a blank
Sally object or a Sally object that
already has a number simple enough so
now let's get to the last thing in the
Sally class and that is you know what
I've been talking to you guys about this
thing called operator overloading now
again like I said operator overloading
allows you to use C++ operators in a
special way inside your classes so in
order to use an overloaded operator you
need to make a function and you need to
give it a special name so whenever you
build a function in C++ you need to
first give it a return type now this
function is actually going to return a
sally object so go ahead and type a
sally right there and now you have to
name your function and you have to name
it this whenever you're using an
overloaded operator you have to start it
with the named operator and then right
after it
you write what operator do you want to
overload and this can be multiplied
divided but we're going to be
overloading the addition operator and
what this is going to do is take two of
these number properties and add them
together so let's go ahead and write
operator plus this is the name of our
function now
and this is also going to take a
parameter what this function is going to
do is it's going to take one Sally
objects number and add another Sally
objects number to it so we're going to
need to pass it in another Sally object
to add to it so let's go ahead and call
it like um Sally well all we have to put
is that Sally so now let's go ahead and
build the function itself so let's go
hop over to Sally dot CPP and let me
make sure it I forget any semicolon
looks good so now let's go ahead over to
Sally about CPP and start building this
function again the very first thing you
write is their return type this is like
void and well we're returning a Sally
object so go ahead and write Sally right
there and now we have to go ahead and
write what class are we working with
Sally what's the name of our function
and remember that's operator plus since
we're overloading the plus sign and what
parameter does it takes well it takes a
Sally parameter and just name this
variable like ASO for another Sally
object so now what we want to do is this
we're going to be returning a brand-new
Sally object so let's go ahead and make
a new Sally object right now Sally and
name this object brand-new simple enough
so now let's go ahead and add the number
property to this brand-new object
because we created a brand new object
but it doesn't have anything for its
number property right here so let's go
ahead and put brand-new dot num and what
do we want to set this equal to well
what we want to set equal to is the
current objects number value plus
another Sally objects number value</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
