we understand the basics of SEO what I
want to do now is I want to show you
guys a bunch of tools that I use to
pretty much automate a bunch of stuff
help you find problems and a bunch of
cool software that will help you with
SEO and the first one I want to talk to
you guys about is site analyzer now if
you go to site analyzer com
go ahead and make a quick profile and a
lot of these tools they have free plans
and paid plans so what you can do is you
can actually watch these videos and if
it looks like something you would you
know ever use then you can sign up for
it but yeah I'll give you guys a quick
little demo of it so essentially what
this is site analyzer com you can
probably guess by the name but you put
in your website and it scans it and it
tells you all of the problems with it in
gives you a bunch of tips of how you can
improve your search engine optimization
results so well let me just go ahead and
give you guys a quick demo so this is
the dashboard right here and whenever
you first log in this is what you get
and you probably aren't gonna be
spending too much time here this is kind
of just a brief overview of you know
your account what you really want to do
is you want to hop down to this right
here page analysis so this page analysis
is for analyzing one single webpage so
say that you just want to analyze the
homepage you can go ahead and run that
now this crawls right here I'll talk to
you guys more about this page analysis
in just a second but this crawl right
here
this is whenever you want to curl your
entire website so every single page on
it so even though you of course want to
improve every single webpage on your
website
whenever you just first get started
using this tool I always recommend just
scanning the homepage first now the
reason for that is even though you want
to improve a bunch of pages a lot of the
problems that you're going to find on
your homepage they're gonna be the same
problems on all your web pages so let's
say that whenever we scan this home page
so again just type in the URL right here
and hit analyze and it's going to take a
bit of time what it's going to do is
let's say your returns um hey you
titles are too long well I don't need to
scan 500 webpages on my website in you
know it says titles too long since I was
too long so that's why like I said I
always recommend just doing one in time
so let's see what we got for my home
page alright so you see that whenever we
analyze a page it takes a couple seconds
and then it gives us our results the
first one is just an overall score and
this is just site analyzer score from 0
to 100
so my website not very good fifty nine
point two it actually used to be a lot
worse but we're working on it slowly you
know there's a bunch of other crap I got
to fix on at first but whenever it scans
that like I said it gives you the score
it also gives you a quick summary and
problems or issues that you can work on
so here are all the problems right here
um it needs a H one title a heading two
some micro data
yadda yadda it needs a sitemap we're in
the process of making that right now so
if you just want some real quick
overviews or tips on how you can improve
then go ahead and check that out but a
cool thing about this is it actually
breaks it down into individual
categories as well so this is your
summary if you click on SEO what this is
is pretty much a section of think about
how Google views your site so this is
pretty much what the search engine is
going to see and if you start scrolling
down its gonna look at all the different
factors relating to SEO so it's going to
look at the page title it's going to
look at the Meta Description robots.txt
we already talked about a lot of these
things now if there's ever something
that you aren't really sure what it
means then what you can do is you can
just click right in there now whenever
you click it this yellow pop-up is going
to appear it's just going to give you
some more information so you're like all
right I know what sitemaps are I know
that was this alternative text not sure
if that is oh I forgot the alt tags in
the images and all that so there you go
and another cool thing is you're like
all right I know that I need alt tags in
my M
but uh what images are they talking
about this one my face or you know these
icons at the top if you just click see
images they'll say hey you need to add
alt tags to these images right here
those are the ones we scanned so it's
pretty much just telling you you know
every single thing you need to know
which is pretty sweet so that's what the
SEO tab is now the content tab content
is essentially as you know it's pretty
much the information about the text and
the keywords on your page so I already
told you guys that Google likes pages
with lots of content on it so a site
like Wikipedia where you know there's a
bunch of text on it a bunch of good
information those are awesome pages now
my home page you can see we really don't
cut that much text we got this little
chunk right here you know a couple of
these little snippets but again this is
the home page not that much text so I
really don't got you know that great of
a score I don't know maybe like some of
the forum pages would better but again
whenever you're making web pages that
you want Google to index in ranked high
make sure that you have a large amount
of text rather than you know just like a
little slideshow type site I hate those
everyone probably hates them and Google
doesn't like them either
so again that's what content is pretty
much the actual content keywords you
know all that stuff pretty
self-explanatory now let's hop over to
design so this says design but it's kind
of like design slash development this is
more of the technical aspect of your
site so you can see things so basically
this is what you would show your web
designer or web developer but hey you
need to fix these things so stuff like
doctype charset basically making sure
that your website follows all the proper
guidelines and also make sure that your
site is safe and secure if Google finds
a vulnerability or something like a big
security issue with your site that's
actually a ranking factor so you aren't
going to be ranked as high in the search
results so it says hey these things are
going
you know you don't have any public
emails you use HTTP so you have a secure
connection rather than just plain old
plain text HTTP and some other things
that I should probably work on so there
you go
and another tab is performance so
performance is important for your
website for a lot of problems first of
all if your website is really slow then
no one's going to go to it anyway so
don't even worry about SEO because even
if they could find it they're just gonna
leave because everything loads are
really slow and second of all Google and
search engines they actually punish
sites with slow loading times and pretty
much a bad performance so again it's not
only a bad user experience but Google
will hate you too
now I actually read something online a
while ago it said that Yahoo increases
our traffic 9% for every half a second
of loading time so if if you can just
decrease your loading time by um half a
second that's like a 10% increase in
your users now I don't know if that's
true or not but I read it online so it's
very cool I also read another thing it
says for every tenth of a second um
Amazon booster load time they get 1% in
revenue 1% more revenue so I mean just
you know optimize some scripts and hey
your revenues gone through the roof I
don't know again I don't know if those
are true or not but they're online so I
believe them I believe anything I read
online all right let's go ahead and take
a look what's here so we got a nice
little overview and down here is where
all the good stuff as it says our
execution time page caching if you don't
know what caching is is pretty much
saving stuff like images and other
resources so you don't have to connect
to the server and load them every time
for example like whenever I went to this
home page right here I saw my image you
see my beautiful face right there well
now let me go ahead and click on that
and go to my profile page and you see my
faces right here I got the icon down
here
um you know my icon down here now any
time I want to see this icon you know
clicking back and forth going to
different pages that means it has to
connect the the New Boston server and
load that image again well it's kind of
the painting but I'm loading the same
resource over and over again so why do
our just cash it okay save it in my
browser's memory so then whenever you
know the New Boston says hey display
this image right here I don't have to
connect to the server again so again
that's what caching is inline CSS I'm
sure you guys know what that is
script location it does make a
difference if you if your pages waiting
to load the JavaScript or not and you
can also do some cool things with
loading em but yeah that's what this tab
is go ahead and click on any of those
for details and this last one is
accessibility so this has to do a lot
with the user experience and also it's a
huge boost to make sure that your site
is responsive make sure that your site
looks good on every single device
whether it's tablets whether it's you
know just phones of course desktops and
laptops so again Google actually started
punishing sites that weren't responsive
a little bit ago so it says hey this is
what it looks like on different devices
and some other things as well again a
lot of this is user experience and you
know some social little indicators
Facebook Twitter Google+ so yeah there
you go so that's a real quick overview
of site analyzer the dashboard in the
page analysis and in the next video I'll
show you guys the crawls and how you can
actually generate reports if you're you
know doing this for a customer so pretty
cool see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
