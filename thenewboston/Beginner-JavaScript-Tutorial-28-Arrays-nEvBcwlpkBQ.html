welcome to your 28th JavaScript tutorial
now before we continue talking about
objects I need to talk to you guys about
something called an array and the reason
I need to do this is because objects use
very often this thing called an array so
before I start talking to you about how
to use an array with your objects I need
to actually teach you guys what an array
is why it's useful how to create them
and all that fun stuff so basically I'm
going to put it as simple as possible an
array is basically a way to store
multiple values in a single variable or
in other words a single object so before
we had one variable and one value well
now we can have more than one value in
the same variable server saying all
right Bucky that just seems confusing
complex why on earth would you want to
do that well believe it or not whenever
you're working with long lists of like
people's names or ages or maybe a long
list of Social Security numbers it's a
lot easier and faster to create an array
and it's a lot more easier to manage
whenever you're working with a long list
there you go so let me show you guys a
quick example of something you would
need to create an array with so for
example if you had to list on like a
bunch of people's names you might do
this far person 1 equals Bucky far
person 2 equals Tommy and you do this
800 times well that's going to take 800
lines of code and then if you had print
them all out we'll take another 800
lines of code and it just gets all
jumbled so an easier way we can do this
is to create something called an array
and then whenever you had to list them
all and print them out and my only take
10 lines of code so now you can begin
seeing the advantages so let's go ahead
and learn how to first create an array
creating an array is similar to creating
a new object in
by that I mean you go ahead and type a
variable and then you type the name of
your array so let's go ahead and make an
array with a bunch of people's names so
I'm going to name my array people make
sense so now what you have to do just
like when you're creating a new instance
a new but instead of your object name
you go ahead and write the name over ray
and this is built-in this is always
going to be named array in this type of
JavaScript we're about to create a new
array plain and simple now as your
parameters you go ahead and type all of
the values you want to store in that
people array so the first value I want
to store is Bucky the second one is
Tommy the third one is Sarah um the
fourth one is Hannah with one end who
cares and the fifth one is um
monkey my kitty who the heck cares so
now you can see instead of creating five
different lines with five different
variables and five different values
we've made this all on one mine how easy
and compact is that starting area saying
all right that kind of makes sense so
you have five different values and one
variable it looks like so whenever I'm
trying to use this later on like
documents if I spell all right documents
dots right okay bulky what how am I
supposed to print out like the name
Buckey or something well if I go ahead
and type people I know that's the name
of the array but how does it know what
one I'm supposed to be talking about
right here well we have an array created
right here and whenever we want to
access one of the values of it we have
to add something called an array index
now an array index is basically this
each of these values in here is numbered
and remember whenever you teach a kid to
count you probably tell them to start at
1 1 2 3 4 5
but with computers computers talk in all
zeros and ones and just remember anytime
you're working with computers computers
learn to start counting is you
rrrow people learn to start counting the
1 so this computer is going to say 0 1 2
3 4 so whenever you want to access this
one it wouldn't be 3 it would be 0 1 2
RA so now we know that each of these
values is labeled with a number called
in index 0 1 2 3 4 so how do we access
that well you go ahead and you write the
name of your array and then in between
square brackets you write the number of
that index so Bucky would be 0 so now if
we go ahead and save this and print it
out check it out
Bucky right there so now let's go ahead
and access like something like Hana 0 1
2 3 so people 3 should be Hana save that
and print it out Hana simple enough so
the only thing that you have to remember
is this in order to create an array just
go ahead and write the name of your
array and then go ahead and write new
array and then write as many values as
you want inside your array and anytime
you want to access it you just write the
name of your array and in between square
brackets go ahead and write that index
and remember unlike whenever people
count computers going to start with 1
they start with 0 so 0 1 2 3 4 so you
can access any of these elements by
using the index 0 through 4 and look
what happens whenever you try to access
something outside like 5 it's going to
give you something called undefined
because your computer's not going to
know where you're talking about so go
ahead and save this and refresh and it
says undefined this is pretty much
JavaScript's way of saying you got an
error
you did something wrong go fix it so
basically that is how you create an
array and in the future tutorials I'm
going to be showing you why these are
useful and why it's a lot easier than
creating just multiple variables but for
now that's all I got for you guys so
