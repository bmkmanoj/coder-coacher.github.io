triangle trigonometry and we are gonna
use these six trig functions to talk
about the angles of a triangle so say we
have this triangle ABC and we have this
angle right here which we're just gonna
call theta theta theta is just a Greek
symbol that we use to represent an angle
so just like we'll use X to represent a
side we use theta to represent an angle
so we have six trig functions sine
cosine tangent cosecant secant and
cotangent and I know it sounds kind of
crazy but it's really it's just talking
about the sides of the triangle and
their ratio to one another so sine is
equal to where and we're talking about
this angle right here opposite which is
the side opposite this angle which is a
over the hypotenuse and this is the
hypotenuse of the triangle so when we
talk about sine of this angle it's equal
to a over C cosine is we're talking
about this angle the adjacent side which
is the side right next to it adjacent
which is B over the hypotenuse which is
still this side so this is B over C
tangent talks about this angles opposite
side which is still a over it's adjacent
side the side next to it side B so a
over B cosecant is the inverse of sine
in the inverse is just 1 over something
so cosecant is 1 over sine
so if we took one over a oversee and we
used our little keep change flip rules
where we keep the top of the fraction
change the sign to multiplication and
flip the fraction to C over a multiply
that we get C over a that's why this is
equal to C over a you can also think of
it as see how this flips the fraction
well if you just flip this and say that
this is hypotenuse over opposite that's
another way to remember it
secant is the same thing it's just 1
over cosine instead of 1 over sine but
the same rule applies so that's why this
ends up being the opposite of cosine
because this is cosines inverse for
secant it's that's what I just talked
about for cotangent it's just the same
as 1 over tangent tangent is B over a so
this or tangent is a over B so the same
rule applies where we just flip them and
this becomes B over a which is the same
thing as adjacent over opposite and
we're gonna use these little formulas to
talk about the angles of a triangle so
we have this triangle right here and
we're gonna find the six trigonometric
functions of this so all we're gonna do
is fill in what what all these equal the
first thing we need to know is what x
equals so using our Pythagorean theorem
that we learned about last time we're
gonna take 3 squared plus 4 squared
equals x squared so 9 plus 16 equals x
squared x squared equals 25
square root both sides x equals 5
so now we can talk about the triangle
because we know every set one of its
sides so we're talking about this angle
right here so sine of this angle is
equal to opposite over the hypotenuse so
we're gonna put four over five side four
is a cross from this angle and X which
is five is the hypotenuse of this
triangle and the hypotenuse is always
across from this right angle so cosine
is adjacent over hypotenuse so next to
it is three over the hypotenuse stays
the same because this is still the
hypotenuse of this triangle tangent is
opposite which is four over adjacent
which is three cosecant is one over four
over five because this is what sine is
so one times five over four so cosecant
is five over four or you can think of it
as hypotenuse over opposite so the same
rule applies for secant
except we do this with cosine so one
times we're gonna keep this change the
sign flip the fraction and get five
thirds or hypotenuse over adjacent we do
the same thing with cotangent so one
over tangent keep the top change the
sign to multiplication flip the fraction
and get three fourths or adjacent over
opposite
so those are the six trig functions of
right triangles now these functions only
apply to right triangles so you can't
use these rules unless you know that
there is a 90 degree angle in that
triangle so now that we know how the
angles relate to one another we're gonna
go on to talk about transformations of
triangles so we can describe how
triangles relate to one another</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
