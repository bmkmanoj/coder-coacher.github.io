fourth
aftereffect tutorial and in this
tutorial we're going to be covering some
basic animation so go ahead and get a
new project open by clicking file new
new project already got mine open so I'm
ready to go and go ahead and click this
little button right here that says
create new composition and this is going
to obviously create a new composition
now to animate an object we obviously
need an object so I went ahead and
before this tutorial created a Photoshop
file real quick so I'm going to go ahead
and import that you can go ahead and
create like a circle or a square or any
shape you want really um I created this
little guy right here and once you open
them he's going to be under your project
panel just go ahead and drag it out in
your composition panel and this guy this
is Samuel sausage I named them and we're
going to be working with him today to
teach you guys how to animate so let me
make him a little smaller so he's going
to be moving around the screen today so
the first thing that you're going to
want to do is go over here to your
current time indicator and make sure
you're at the very beginning and any
time here's a shortcut any time you want
to make sure you're at the beginning you
can go ahead and press home home brings
you to the beginning on your keyboard
end on your keyboard brings you to the
end so go ahead and press home and move
your shape I'm going to move Sammy to
the bottom left because this is the
first position that I want a placement
now the way you need to animate is you
need to make something called keyframes
in keyframes are pretty much the main
locations where you're going to move
your object and to do this there are two
different ways you can go ahead and
click this triangle right here click
transform and go to position this is
going to let you change the position of
your object on the screen or you can
just highlight
your object on your composition panel
and press P this is a shortcut and it's
a lot faster so do that and before you
can get started moving this position
around make sure that this little time
watch make sure you click it so there is
a square around it if there's not a
square around it you can't edit any of
the keyframes
once you have armed the square around it
your first keyframe and indicated by
this little yellow sideways square thing
diamond I guess is going to
automatically pop up a keyframe means
that in this point in time this is where
this object is going to be so we want to
animate this so what we're going to want
to do is move our current time indicator
to another point in time I'm going to
move my into one second now once this is
at one second or another point in time
we can go ahead and take Sammy and move
him around as you can see After Effects
automatically created another point in
time from the first keyframe to the
second keyframe so now if we go back to
home and press spacebar
in in case you don't know spacebar plays
your animation we can see that Sammy
now moves from the first keyframe to the
second keyframe again um let's uh go
ahead and move our current time
indicator go ahead and move Sammy to the
position that we want hit home spacebar
and play so now that we learned how to
do one keyframe let's uh add one more
just for fun go ahead and put your
current time indicator to about two
minutes two seconds or something and
move Sammy
again as you can see let me just show
you guys what this does real quick
because I know you guys are itching to
know press home space Sammy does a nice
a little bunny hop so let's go friend
Chris home
and as you can see this motion path has
now had have kind of a curve to it and
this is because it's what After Effects
is automatically set at if you want to
have Sami have nice straight lines what
you need to do is hold down the control
I mean control alt tab on your keyboard
and as you can see your cursor changed
from arrow to a little arm Flying V
whatever that is and go ahead and click
it and this now gives you nice straight
lines and again if you want to undo that
again its control all on your keyboard
click it and this will give you a nice
curvy line so to toggle in between
straight lines and curvy lines go ahead
and hold down control alt on the
keyboard and click a keyframe another
thing that you might want to do is
change the path of Sami the sausage so
to do that what you need to do is click
on a keyframe and drag it it's very easy
to do so for example if you want to move
this keyframe make Sam you go a little
higher and a little more to the right go
ahead and just click and drag those
around as you can see it automatically
changes the path of Sammy the sausage so
again to move keyframes just click and
drag any one other thing I just want to
cover real quick actually in the next
tutorial I'm going to be covering how to
use the pen tool and how to move what
these little things mean right here but
that's for the next tutorial I'm getting
kind of long in this tutorial so I hope
you enjoyed watching it I hope you
learned something I hope you enjoyed
watching Sammy and Sammy's the sausage
