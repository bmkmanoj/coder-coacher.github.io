and forty first Android tutorial for the
new boss and what we're gonna do in this
tutorial well we're basically gonna
finish up you know our first button
where we can draw to the screen draw our
icon to a certain location on our map so
what we're gonna first do is we have
this list overview overlay type list and
we want to create that so we can
reference it within our you know our ad
pinpoint alert button so let's just cut
this out and we're gonna paste it above
and then we're also gonna whoa we're
also gonna you know copy that set that
equal to our map overlays right here so
again that's just gonna get our overlays
from our map view and then we're gonna
add you know are touchy that we have set
up down here touching class so now that
we have that set up we can kind of
reference it within this on click method
of place a pinpoint we also have you
know this geo point that is getting the
projection from our pixels and according
to where we touch on the screen so we're
gonna reference that as well first thing
that we need to do is create an overlay
item so we're just gonna say overlay
item and we're just gonna call this
overlay item something like that and
we're going to set this equal to a new
overlay item and we're gonna refer to
our point our geo point called touch
point so we're gonna say touch point and
then we're also gonna add some you know
some string references which I'll show
you guys what that does at the end of
this tutorial so we're just gonna say
what's up it's up and then also another
one is just maybe a second string so you
guys know what which parameters do what
nothing too complex here but we just
create a new overlay item now what we
want to do is we want to refer to our
custom variable and we want to add
this overlay item so we're just gonna
say custom and we have that method
within our custom class which we created
called insert pinpoint and we're gonna
insert our overlay item that we just
created so all that's gonna do is add it
to our ArrayList that we set up because
again it takes an overlay item which is
what we created here and now what we're
gonna do is we're just going to say our
overlay list which we created or which
we modified at the beginning of this
tutorial that gets all of our overlays
we call it overlay list and we're just
gonna add now our custom overlay so
we're just gonna say custom here and
we're pretty much done with this
tutorial again all that we're doing is
we're creating an overlay item that is
going to be our touch point reference
then we're creating a custom pinpoint
object which is gonna pass in the
context or I'm sorry a drawable and then
the context what that's gonna do is call
this constructor custom pinpoint the
drawable in the context then we're
passing our drawable into this
constructor because again we're just
passing it drawable so it's going to
shoot it up to this constructor we're
going to bound the center of that
drawable and it's also going to set the
context here and then we're gonna go
back to this class where we refer to
that and we use the insert pinpoint
where we just add an overlay to let me
go back here we insert a pinpoint which
just adds that overlay item that's being
passed in to our pinpoint ArrayList and
then all we do is we use our overlay
list from the top of this activity that
grabs all of our overlays and we add
this new one called custom that we just
set up so let's run our application make
sure it works and kind of show you guys
what it does so now what we can do is we
can hold and click click and hold and we
can say place pinpoint and it places a
pinpoint right at the center location
where we clicked now even when we you
know
zoom in it's always gonna be there at
that location and that's again our
custom overlay that we created and
basically what we could do which I
probably won't do in this tutorial or in
this series is we could click on it and
refer to these string references that we
set up here called what's up and second
string you know that's why we added
those string references but you know for
the most part we aren't going to worry
about that but again we can place as
many pin points as we want place pin
point takes a little bit to place it but
there we go and again we can zoom in and
see where we actually place that pin
point but that's pretty much it for our
Maps tutorial we still might be working
with this application to get like
location see where the phone is and all
that stuff and and all that good stuff
but as for Google Maps and I mean pretty
much that's all we're gonna do now we're
gonna work with location and I'll catch
you guys in the next tutorial what we're
gonna do that so have a good one and
I'll see you guys later peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
