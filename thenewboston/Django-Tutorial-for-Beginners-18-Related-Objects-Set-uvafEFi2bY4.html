to an album is this a much quicker way
in cooler way in my opinion so if you
take a look at our model what Jenko
already knows is that this song class is
associated with this album class using a
foreign key in other words because we
related these two objects in this kind
of way it already knows that this album
is going to have a whole set of songs
associated with it
so what jingo did is it allows you to
access the songs through a set so I'll
show you guys what I'm talking about in
it's going to become a lot more clear so
if you just reference any album that
object it has a set name the class name
underscore set but the class name is
actually lower case so song underscore
set so that's how you access this
album's songs now if you just wanted to
display them all just call the function
all and check it out so right now we
only have one song on this album so
there we go so before we learn how to
create a song and add it to the album in
this way you pretty much create a song
add all the attributes and then save it
well there's also another way and that's
through the create function so the creat
function kind of takes all of those
things all those separate steps and
allows you to do in one show bang so it
allows you to create a new object save
it and automatically put that object in
the album's set sounds awesome
how do we do it well just go ahead and
reference your album object
now after that reference the set and now
call a function call great now whenever
we create this we need to pass in every
attribute except this one so why don't
we need to specify the album attribute
well it already knows because we
reference album one that whenever we
create a song
obviously got to belong to album one so
where's my cursor all right so first
thing it song needs is a song title and
I'll say oh oh it's another one I love
bacon in the file type we'll just make
these all mp3's mp3 so again this is
where we're actually creating the song
object and it's album is going to be
album 1 and inside this create function
it's also going to save it to the
database so I'm just going to go ahead
and hit enter and check it out now if i
refresh this it already has that bad boy
saved right in there now if you just hit
up then it's going to get your history
so that's kind of a quicker way all
right what's another song I'll say um
Bucky is lucky that we cool name for
song and I'll say like ice cream maybe
Taylor Swift would have song about ice
cream I'm actually just kind of hungry
now but anyways refresh this and check
it out boo boo boo boo boo toasted now
the last couple things I want to point
out is whenever you use something like
this this create method it does all
those things that I told you but it also
returns a reference to that song so the
reason I want to say that is because if
you ever need to actually take that
object and use it in your program what
you can do is set it equal to a variable
so you just set equal to song like this
and now when you press Enter press Enter
Lulu this object is equal to the
variable sung so how do we know that
well if you just write something like
song album then it prints out the album
we can write song a song title and it
prints out the song's title and of
course if you want to do something like
look at all of this album songs the way
you can do is just like before printout
of the items in the song set now another
cool function that you guys may need is
if you just want to find out how many
songs are on that album then what you
can do is song set and what was that
album won and there's another function
called count so what this is going to do
is this going to count how many objects
or songs there are and just display
right there so a bunch of cool stuff and
yeah I think that's enough for this
video so thank you guys for watching
don't forget subscribe I will see you
guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
