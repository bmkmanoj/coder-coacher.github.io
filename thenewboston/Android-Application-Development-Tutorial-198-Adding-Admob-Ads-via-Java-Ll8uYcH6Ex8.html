Android tutorial and yeah I just waited
a while it's been like an hour so and if
we go to our AdMob account down here
where we see all of our activities that
we applied for you can see it turned
green it's still not showing ads yet
might take you know probably I don't
know throughout a few more hours before
I actually displays the ads that we
request but it is accepting a request so
but you know also if you guys apply with
Adsense through this it'll help your
fill rate so you'll display ads more
often but I believe it still should show
up eventually they just kind of need to
figure out how you know the data that
we're sending them and all that stuff I
believe that's my guess and it will
appear eventually and then what we're
going to do is so again if you guys
don't have this green highlighted button
within you know a few hours that's
probably some sort of a problem but you
know give it a while it says two minutes
just give it a few minutes I mean
another thing we can do is we can open
up our starting point class and again we
gave that added reference as well and
we're just going to set up a reference
in you know refresh it or send a refresh
so we get a fresh new ad within our
application on our on create method even
though we set it up in XML to be true
within our on create I just wanted to
show you guys how to like refresh an ad
if you want so again we're just going to
set up an ad view type instance we're
going to call this ad and again we just
have to set up a reference bridge so
we're just going to say add view find
view by d re ID dot add and then all
we're going to do is say add dot load ad
and we're going to send a request to
load a new ad and since we don't have an
ad request we're just going to create a
new one we're just going to say new ad
request that's going to send a new new
request for us so if you have like a
button that gets pressed often and you
guys want to update your ad or something
you could set that up within a button or
something like that
and also just a quick note again the
starting-point activity oh we had two
layouts one for the horizontal layout or
I'm sorry the landscape layout and one
for the portrait so again you guys want
to set up your ad within here otherwise
when it tries to look for this ad view
within the Java or in the layout or the
landscape mode it's not going to be able
to find that and it's going to crash
your application so again just make sure
you guys open that up and add this
reference here and then set up your ad
within there have the same ID as well so
your ad can find it or your java class
can find that ad and now I'm just going
to show you guys how to add and add
through strictly Java alone so I'm going
to do that within our data class forgot
exactly which what this was anyway so we
have our data class and we have this
layout as git so I'm just going to open
that up as well and it looks something
like this
so we're going to do is we're going to
go into our linear layout or actually
it's a relative layout that we use for
this and we're going to set that
relative layout to have an ID as well so
we're just going to say Android ID
equals you know at plus ID forward slash
relative or rel layout I don't think we
have an ID like that and there we go we
just basically added a reference to our
layout that controls our entire you know
XML file so now what we're going to do
is we're going to go into the Java and
we're just going to set that linear
layout up here a relative layout I
should say
we're just going to call this our L and
add our imports and actually I'm just
going to set it up with with an on
create method as well so I'm just going
to say our l equals relative relative
layout find view by d r dot ID dot rel
layout and the reason I did that is
because we're going to add in a we're
going to add to this relative layout and
all we're going to do is we're just
going to say set up another add view and
we're going to call this ad as well and
all we're going to do is we're going to
use a the method to create the add view
for us and I'm just going to say new add
view and then within parameters we refer
to the context of the class we're just
going to say data dot this and then for
a second parameter we're going to set up
the ad size so we're going to say add
size dot banner you guys have a few
different choices you guys mess around
with see the different sizes that you
can work with we're just going to say
banner and and then we have to enter our
ad ID which I'm just making up here and
that creates again the ad for us and now
what we can do is it has perhaps put
that in quotations as well so now what
we can do is we can just add to a
relative layout which we call called RL
and just say add view and then what view
are we going to add
well we're going to add this this add
view here so we're just going to call
add because that's what we called our
add view and then all we're going to do
is we're going to say our ad and then
again just load dot load add a new ad
request as well just like I showed you
guys a second ago
you know we have to add all our imports
but that's how we can add to a relative
layout or any other kind of layout just
using this add view method on the layout
itself and it's just going to add that
view to our layout</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
