another app review and this app is
called scoops and let's see if I can
find out me there it is right there and
what it is is pretty much it's not that
complex of a game so let's go ahead and
turn sounds on and it starts out just
welcome screw just go ahead it play you
see you got a little cone right here
your goal is to get as much ice cream as
you can without getting any vegetables
on it so and what you have to do is you
have to tote it left and right and a
couple key things that rainbow thing the
gold is is pretty much stack the same
color ice cream on the same on like that
one's blue so get another blue and you
can see your bonus at the top so right
now I'm at 6 my bonus and Ford and you
see if you get a vegetable on it one of
your lives gets taken away so you can
get more lives later on but you see I
just wasted on my legs because I got
three vegetables and whenever you get
three vegetables you are your game ends
so my name on here is ham because pretty
much whenever I have to enter my initial
I just name everything ham so I see I
got third best of all so that's that
terrible I am and the cool thing about
this game is that pretty much can last
forever and I mean as long as you if
you're good you can pretty much keep
playing it as long as you want and
another cool thing is that it's only a
dollar ninety-nine and it's actually not
one of the more popular games in the App
Store I don't know why because I mean
there are a lot more worst games than
this that are more popular event so you
know I think it deserves to be a little
more popular just cuz you know it's
pretty easy game pretty addicting and
it's awfully fun so that's that for this
tutorial I'm gonna go ahead and read
this a 7 out of 10 and for the price I
mean it's iffy whether to buy or not
there are better games for $1.99 but
then again there are more games for
cheaper that are even more
so well you see their review and now you
can make your own judgment whether by it
or not so thank you guys for watching
don't forget subscribe and I'll see you
next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
