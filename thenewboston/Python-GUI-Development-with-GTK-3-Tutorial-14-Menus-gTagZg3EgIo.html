video I am gonna show you how to create
a menu for your program so we're gonna
be creating a menu bar and then I'll
show you how to create all these menus
that can also have drop-down menus with
other items and you know all of that
stuff so that's what we're gonna be
learning but before I hop into that I
need to go on a little rant and that is
this I love a boo - don't get me wrong
but one of the things I absolutely hate
about it is the default way that it
displays your software's menus so right
now you can see that like this menu
right here let me open up terminal so
you see that I have my window set up
where okay this is my window I got my
you know clothes buttons and then in my
menus well this isn't how its set up by
default by default this menu right here
is disconnected from here and it's way
up you know in the top left of Ubuntu
and also these buttons are up there as
well and to make things even worse to
make things even more confusing what
they did is they also have it where
unless you are hovering over the menu
these items don't even pop up I mean who
decided that but hey maybe the user
wants to hover over the bar but oh look
at that I got some menu items this is
the dumbest design ever so come on a
booth dude like get on it so what you
can do to fix that is first you can get
the unity tweak tool and again this is
nothing to do with gtk this is just
something that annoys me and I want to
show you and if you go to Windows
controls then what you can do is this
button right here show menu button this
will show the Windows menu in the title
bar in other words it'll show whenever
you have a program open it will show the
menu right here instead of you know
being up at the top disconnected from it
so that takes care of that problem now
another thing is that instead of having
to hover over it to display your menu if
you run this command in the terminal and
I'll put this code on github so he can
just copy and plop it in what this is
gonna do is it's all
he's gonna show your menus so you know
they don't just display when you hover
over them they're always right there so
this is the behavior that I love I mean
it just makes it easier when everything
is connected to your window then you
aren't like okay what's this menu for is
it for something else this I don't know
so there's not a little rant let's get
on with the program so in order to make
a menu for our software what we're going
to do first is we're going to make a
menu bar so the menu bar is the main
container this main area that's left and
right that's going to store all of your
menus in the main menu bar is actually
the item that we're going to be plopping
directly into the layout so I just write
main menu bar it set this equal to menu
bar all right and we can just leave that
blank for right now and actually let me
comment these so it's a little bit
easier see main container that we were
stick inside our layout all right so now
we're gonna start adding menus to the
menu bar so in order to do that all
right drop down menu what we do first is
we just create whatever menu we want so
this is the file menu this is the edit
menu this is the view menu so on and so
forth so I'll just write like file menu
since almost every program has one of
those set this equal to Tk menu now
here's the thing this file menu this is
not the drop-down area this is kind of
just this bun you can think of it as now
inside here you can have a drop-down so
I know it's kind of weird but hey that's
how it is so in order to get that
drop-down you go file menu drop-down or
name it whatever you want
this is gtk menu item so from here what
we can do is we can just give it a word
like file and again I know that this is
kind of weird but I don't know that's
just how you do it so now we have a
drop-down area which is essentially this
main area and we can start adding adding
items to it like new project new
open whatever so just write like um menu
items and the way I like to name my
items is I just write whatever the file
or whatever the menu is called so either
file edit view whatever and then
whatever the item inside is called so
I'll make file a new file open file save
or whatever phone new equals 2k menu
item and then just write new so this is
the text that's gonna appear right here
and I'll just copy this so dot dot dot
now I just copy this NR a so we have new
what else we got up here I was very open
and save as let me do the open and exit
because I'll show you guys something
else cool openin exit and right now
these are menu items whenever we click
them they're not going to do anything
because we didn't hook up any callbacks
but I'll show you guys said do that
later on and exit I'm gonna get rid of
these two alright so we pretty much have
our main menu bar which is the container
for everything we created this file menu
and then we created some items that we
can stick inside it so now what we
actually have to do is this if we go
file menu drop-down we can set the
submenu to the file menu so basically
this drop-down area is now inside this
and again I know it's kind of weird but
whatever and probably easier if I do
this the other way well you guys are
gonna see it's irrelevant so now with
file menu we can start sticking those
items in
so just Adam however we want so if I
open and file exit so what we did right
here again is we're pretty much is
creating a reference to these items
right here in right here we're actually
sticking them inside the menu now
another cool thing that I want to show
you is how to add these separators so
you know whenever you're looking at a
drop-down menu these are kind of grouped
into sections and these sections are
separated by this little horizontal line
now this is called a separator and if
you ever want to create one of those a
pen all you have to do is write gtk set
petty Spode separator they are a
separator menu item so this is going to
give you the horizontal line so now
whenever we look at our menu it's going
to have new open and then it's going to
have that separator and then it's going
to have exit so now everything is
looking good all we have to do is
remember we have to add this menu to the
main menu bar since that's our main
container for everything so append menu
drop down and then add our menu bar to
the layout so layouts pack starts main
menu bar true true zero alright looking
good may so now let's run this bad boy
and check it out so this entire thing is
our main menu bar and now we have our
file menu and it has new open and I
don't know if you guys can even see this
on YouTube but between new and open
there's a little horizontal line and
that is that gtk separator and look at
that so looking good that is how you get
a real basic menu if you want another
one then it's the same structure just do
it with something else and yeah so you
can hook callbacks to them like you
would any other item a button and pretty
simple so there you go that is how you
create a menu
