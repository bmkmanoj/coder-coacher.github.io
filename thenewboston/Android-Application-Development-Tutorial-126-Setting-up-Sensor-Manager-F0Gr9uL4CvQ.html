Android tutorial for the new boss in
what we're going to do in this tutorial
I'm basically going to talk about these
two classes or these two methods and
also set up our accelerometer so we have
two methods that get implemented when we
implement the sensor event listener the
on accuracy changed and also the on
sensor change now for example we're just
going to have our ball move around on
the screen when our sensor changes so
we're basically going to only work with
this on sensor changed this gets called
when we have a new sensor event when our
accelerometer changes directions or
whatever it's going to call this method
this accuracy change that's just going
to kind of test the accuracy of the
changed event for the most part we
aren't really going to deal with that
like I said but now what we need to do
is we need to set up our sensor manager
basically we're going to check if the
device has a accelerometer and as of now
I believe most most of the Android
phones have the accelerometer but just
to make sure we're going to check for it
and how we do that is we do sensor
manager within our oncreate method
sensor manager and we're just going to
call this sensor manager sm and we're
going to set equal to after we import
we're going to set it equal to sensor
manager and then we're going to say get
the system service which we've used
before
well can't spell and then we're going to
say the context dot and we have an
option called sensor service now that we
have our manager set up we're going to
refer to the manager to basically check
if the accelerometer exists so now we're
going to do is we're going to say SM dot
get sensor list as you can see use this
method to get a list of available
sensors of a certain type so we're going
to click that and then we're going to
refer to the sensor class to tell what
kind of sensor we're looking for so we
say dot and then we have these options
type accelerometer light pressure
temperature all different types of
sensors that might be available so we're
going to hit that and then after that
we're going to say dot size when we use
this size method if this statement is
equal to zero that means there's no
sensor available so what we're going to
do is we're going to create an if
statement and then we're going to say as
long as this is not equal to zero
we're going to do what's ever within
these brackets and then we just have to
finish off our if statement like that so
make sure all our brackets are set in
there all right just formatted it so now
basically we've checked from our system
manager if the accelerometer exists and
if it does what we're going to do is
we're going to set up a sensor so we set
up our sensor and we're going to call
this sensor like s something like that
we're going to set this equal to is
refer to our manager that we set up so
SM dot again get sensor list and within
the type again we're just going to say
sensor dot type accelerometer again and
this time instead of saying the size
we're just going to say get and as you
can see it takes an int location so
we're just going to say zero here and
that's fine
I'm kind of setting up our initial or
initial spot so now we're going to kind
of register our sensor and our manager
and all that stuff so we're going to
refer to our sensor manager
now we're just going to say register
listener and we're going to choose this
third or the second option here where we
take a sensor event listener a sensor
and an int for the rate so for our
listener what we're going to do is we're
going to say set this equal to R the
context of this and for our sensor we're
going to refer to the sensor we just set
up as s and for a rate we can refer to
our sensor manager or sensor manager
class and we can pull different rates
that is going to update our sensor
because sometimes we don't want to
update as fast as possible and you know
they have different rates of how quickly
your sensor is going to try and update
or process the information so if you
have an application you want to update
as fast as you can you can choose like
this fastest what you probably don't
need we're just going to choose sensor
delay normal you know because this
application is going to be somewhat
normal and then we're just going to hit
finish and we are pretty much done with
this tutorial guys and also this just
let you guys know this can be this is a
boolean value type statement so you can
set up like a checking whether this
returns true or false if you want but uh
there we go we're pretty much done with
this tutorial guys and I'll catch you in
the next one have a good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
