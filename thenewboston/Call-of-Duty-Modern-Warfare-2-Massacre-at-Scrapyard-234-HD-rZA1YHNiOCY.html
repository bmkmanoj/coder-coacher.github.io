is not Bucky here and this is kyle here
okay as Duque probably told you before I
am the person who does all this gameplay
all video games and stuff like that as
in mass effect 2 call of duty etc etc
okay here i'm playing call of duty on
scrapyard team deathmatch and i joined
in the game after was about third all
the way done and i get a really pretty
pretty good game um think I go
good I oh I setup is
his care package predator harrier
because he didn't have the chopper down
or anything like that and said my area
right there
was yet another kill from like oh that
get a couple more kills from my harrier
and we you don't steal
and right off the back in about 30
seconds of minutes I get over a tank oh
sweet as you probably believe if you
didn't realize yet i'm using the scar-h
i think look at Scott yeah scar-h blue
tiger and a silencer my parts are
scavenger stopping power and I believe
either commando or a niche out um just
let you know this isn't right real name
on xbox live my real name I think my
mother I think i mighta been playing
with my brother on here that might have
been that's my first out of this game I
don't have many in this game Oh
something to note um I absolutely love
silencers oh that's why I wasn't doing
very good oh yeah as you probably just
realized i changed my sensitivity i
don't know why i was using three and
guess I just forgot changes or something
and that's my back to what I was going
to silencer silencer is very useful tool
if you can't be only as you can deal
with the iron sights though that's
pretty much the only problem usually
they're not bad though I have to say
that you
thing would probably be bad with a
silencer would probably be a shotgun or
a sniper rifle oh and another lutely
love sniping it is my passion in this
game like it is literally my probably my
passion in this game fair city hell smj
there's nothing wrong with that and I
get my 520 and he has cold-blooded on ok
I don't know why let's see no why do
people wanted to get my packages I just
don't get ya people will learn hopefully
eventually a reason for it both happened
anyway um running around running around
the game is very close to anything just
equipment there's a very quick game less
than five minutes along and you can go
down and running around running around
and then the game ends very fast game 23
in fours Mike KD with joint almost got
almost got a third of the team skills
but i already had the team already had
less than or about a third of the way
through and i got MVP anyway Oh 23 and
for Kyle out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
