video I am gonna show you how to get the
top level domain for a website now if
you don't know what the top-level domain
is it's basically this part of the URL
right here so not the protocol not WW
not this little directory right here
it's this piece and at first I thought
okay so we're gonna have the user post a
new URL and then we're just gonna rip
out this but what if it's a HTTP and
HTTPS and what if they didn't include
that ww-well then we get kind of complex
so instead there's actually a module
that allows us to do this really easy
and if you guys are like why don't we
even care about the top-level domain we
already got the URL can't we just use
that for all the tools we'll check this
out whenever you run a who is scan which
basically tells you information about
who bought the domain name look what
happens when we try to do on the full
URL it says uh we can't really handle
this full URL in order to run it who is
actually let me clear this out so you
guys can see in order to run the Whois
you need the top-level domain the New
Boston com
and then as you can see that is the
piece you need to give you all of this
sweet info so that's why we need it and
now let's get to work so domain name
since that's what we're trying to get
the p/y alright so how the heck do we
get this well you need to go ahead and
import TLD and then from here what we
can do is we can write get underscore
TLD and if you don't know how to import
this it's you can go ahead and use pip
or you can do a manually or if you're
using pycharm and if you go to file
settings and I was messing with my font
so you guys could read it easier on
YouTube and right here alright so under
your project whatever your project is
name go to project interpreter
and click this little plus button and if
you just write TLD then it's gonna be
right here on the left hand side now
just select it and right ton o if you
guys can see this and then click install
packages or package the button down here
I already have it installed so I'm not
going to do it again but that's how you
install whatever you need to do and also
in the upcoming videos if you ever see a
package that you don't have installed
then just do that whatever but this is
all you need to do after that I'm just
gonna make it a function called get
domain name and what we're gonna do is
we're gonna pass in the URL
so essentially what the user is gonna
pass in is this right here and it can
you know not have this it can have HTTP
it doesn't matter and it just makes it a
lot easier for the user if they don't
have to worry about what format the URL
is in so now what we're gonna do is
we're gonna hit domain name and get
underscore TLD now the only parameter
that this needs is the URL and then
we're just gonna return the domain name
so again this function right here let me
format this so it's alright
it's tweaking out if I don't format it
according to the standards so anyways
what this function right here is it's a
built-in function from this package and
all it does is you pass in the URL and
it gives you the plain top-level domain
name and just so we can verify that if
we just run print Oval's get domain name
all right so let's run this real quick
and check it out so we just passed in
this the full URL and it returned this
the new boston.com and of course it
doesn't matter if the WWE they're not
let's run this boom roasted look at that
so looking sweet we can now allow the
user the end user that is which will
probably be us to pass in any URL and we
extract the top-level domain
looking good see you guys in the next
