it's a ninth Premiere Pro tutorial and
in this tutorial we're going to be going
over probably the rest of the panels try
to go through them a little quicker
since all these are really the basics
and then we can get in some of the more
awesome advanced stuff but uh for now
just sit back and hold tight so the
first panel we're going to go over in
this tutorial is one of the monitor
panels and pretty much all the monitor
panels are the same they each have a
place where you can view the video and
do simple stuff like play it and stuff
like that it's pretty much just to view
on your work so any any time you can
view your work it's called one of the
monitor panels pretty much is a preview
or display so again like I said you can
play your main movie in this main
monitor panel I'll keep my face frozen
there it looks like I'm sneezing or
coughing or something another way you
can go through is to slide this and you
can also toggle this little thing this
is called jogging through your or
jogging through your footage i guess
it's called the tread area i really
don't like to use it but i usually just
use this but if you want to use it go
ahead and i know we didn't talk about in
and out points yet but an in and out
point is pretty much the points that
determine which part of your clip is
going to be in your main movie or
project so anytime I talk about in an
eye out points firm here on you know
that they're right here you set them by
clicking them and then go into another
spot and clicking them again I'm aside
from this monitor panel which is pretty
much just like if you know how to work a
VCR you pretty much know how to work
this play and that turns into stop when
you want to stop it pretty much basics
you also have the audio mixer panel and
what this allows you to do is mix the
different audio tracks on your movie so
for example just go to a point and you
can use these little knobs right here
and go left or right to adjust the
volume and different stuff like that
you can also on the three main buttons
you want to use are probably here this
is the mute track and that's the master
mute for that track you can also solo a
track which means you only want to work
with this track or we're learning about
recording later on but whenever we go
over that's for recording but now let's
get to some fun stuff actually and that
is the effects panel and the effects
controls panel the effects panel is down
here and this is how you add kind of
special effects to your video so say we
see this video right now and we see it's
all and kind of blend we can spruce it
up a bit well our effects panel not only
has audio effects but also video effects
and video transitions audio effects are
cool things you can do with audio will
learn about that later on but we're
mostly going to be working with video
effects video effects are things like um
just like the color the brightness the
store and this will this like makes it
kind of like if you're an asset or
something don't make your image look
kind of weird um what else we got video
transitions under this folder this these
are different like fades and dissolves
from go to one clip to another so if
you're saying all right how do I apply
one of these effects to my video well in
order to apply one of these effects your
video just go ahead down here and go to
something like um where was it oh go to
like color correction this is should be
easy to see over YouTube and all of
these things right here are effects make
sure you aren't grabbing a folder then
say you want to adjust the brightness
and contrast and mess with that effect
all you have to do is grab it and I'm
holding down my left mouse button and
drag it over to your clip and release
and as you can see in my effects control
panel at top this little brightness and
contrast thing pops up right here and
now if we toggle down this little arrow
we can now adjust the brightness and
contrast
of our image let me find a good one of
me and not bad oh yeah right now give me
a stink eye all right so in order to
change brightness or contrast and every
effect is a little bit different some
have like little arm bars like this some
have like little graphs but each time
you apply in effect then it pops up to
the effect control and you can adjust
the settings of that effect up here so
if you want to adjust the brightness
just go ahead and scroll this over and
as you can see my entire video brains up
and if you want to adjust the contrast
just go ahead and scroll this over and
lights get lighter and the darks get
darker so if you make it contrasts and
bright and get a little 300 uh what's
that movie with Will Smith seven pounds
that's it they use this effect a lot in
that movie and if you want to toggle the
master effect on and off we need to do
is press this little button right here
toggle the effect on and off and look
what happens when I toggle it when you
turn off you can see the total effect is
gone and when you turn on you can see
the effect is back again and this is how
it would render it isn't only for
viewing purposes so um again whenever
you apply in effect click it and drag it
over your main thing and then it's going
to pop up in your effects controls panel
at the top and then you can adjust the
settings of that effect this way and
again if you want to get rid of the
effect you can either highlight it and
press delete or press this little main
effects toggle on and off but this is a
cool little way to show what you did
with your effects sometimes when you're
just in brightness you can't see a lot
of difference from the main thing so
just take note of that so let's go ahead
and delete this by highlighting it and
press Delete and on that note we are
done with this tutorial I promise there
is only going to be like one more going
over the workspace tutorial left and
then we'll get into the real fun stuff
and awesome stuff for you do with
premier
Perrault and what makes it such an
awesome video editing program but for
now I know you gotta stick learning
basics because if I don't everyone's
going to complain and have a heart
attack that I didn't teach them the
basics and I'm going to pass so anyways
enough of me Ram Lamont thank you guys
