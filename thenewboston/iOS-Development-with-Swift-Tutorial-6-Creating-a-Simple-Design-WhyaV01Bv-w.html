like to second tour the real quick
overview of the interface let's go ahead
and learn how to make a really basic
design this is probably going to be the
dumbest design ever but you're going to
be familiar with using the tools and
learning how to build a really simple
user interface so make sure that you
have this main storyboard file open
right here this is pretty much the
interface or the design the part that
the user sees and you can just click it
once and it will pop up in the main area
and if you don't see this little file
navigation then you probably
accidentally toggle this panel so make
sure that you are in the standard editor
and you have this unchecked and also if
your main area looks a little bit
different than mine then that is
probably because this little button is
kind of like a toggle within toggle so
if you go to the bottom left and click
this other panel then that's going to
toggle that section on and off and I'll
show you guys what this is later on it's
going to make a lot more sense once we
start adding views into here or items so
we're just toggle that right now and of
course we can scroll left right up down
and as you can see this kind of
resembles I don't know starting to kind
of look like a phone or I mean I
remember this little battery thing
that's usually on my smart phone but I
know it looks kind of weird well first
of all let me explain this if you notice
this layout we're looking at right here
it's square Burak okay that's kind of
dumb because shouldn't it be in a shape
of like an iPhone or at least the iPad
because I mean those are kind of like
rectangular and this interface that I'm
supposed to be designing on is square so
that's kind of stupid well actually
Apple made your interface builder square
very deliberately for a very specific
reason and that is because whenever
you're developing these apps what you
really want to do is you want to design
it in a way that it's adaptive to every
screen so an iPhone is of course a
different size than the iPad and how's
the user going to be holding it is it
going to be horizontal
vertical so whenever you're designing it
you really don't know what size or what
orientation the user is going to be
holding it so what they did is they said
okay we're going to give you a square
that's it a plain generic square and
later on I'm going to be showing you
guys how to make adaptive layouts that
pretty much like you would think adapt
to every screen and you guys are going
to see okay actually that square is a
really good idea so that's a I don't
know the story of the square so you can
tell your grandkids about it so now
let's actually add something to the
screen so on the right hand side if you
scroll down you can see the object
library and if you don't see this then
make sure you click this little icon
right here it's the circle with a square
in the middle of it so click that and
you're going to see the object library
and you can actually if right now click
on this handle right here and drag it up
and that's going to give you a little
bit more space to see what's going on
and of course these are all the objects
or views or items that you can add to
your interface now what you can do is
you can scroll down and look for the one
you want but I'm going to do like 90
percent of the time is just use this
little search area right here it saves
you a whole bunch of time so for right
now we can just add some really basic
text and then basic text is called a
label so go to this search and start
typing in LA and of course label is one
of the first one that pops up so of
course this like I says is just static
text plain old text nothing new and if
you grab this you can click and drag it
on to the screen so you can just drag it
and as you can see as you're dragging it
it's going to give you these guidelines
up and down side to side and this is of
course the orientation or the
positioning st. okay now that we
positioned it with that blue line and
make sure that it appears in the dead
center of the screen pretty cool pretty
cool that was easy enough so now let me
go ahead and double click this item
and whenever you double-click it you can
actually change the text on it so I'm
going to change this to I don't know
like bacon or something like that
now obviously you have some little
controls that you can change the size of
it whatever and you can also move it
around simple enough you guys probably
could have figured that out but go ahead
and take it in position it right in the
middle of your screen again and look at
that
our very first interface is designed
let's go ahead and test this baby out so
what I'm going to do is make sure that
you have one of these iPhone selected
I'm going to select like the iPhone 5 so
this is essentially your simulator and
once you have a simulator selected you
can click on this button and it's going
to kick off and run your app so here is
mine right there and if yours is not the
same size as mine or maybe you want it
bigger or smaller then what you can do
is you can go to window scale and I have
mine of 50% because if I have it a
hundred percent of course it's kind of
hard to see in these tutorials so I like
my window scale 50 percent and there you
go so huh look at that I mean okay let
me move this out a little okay in our
interface builder we put that thing
right in the middle but in our simulator
it's not appearing and well so what the
heck is going on here well let me
explain why we have this issue you see
like I said right now whenever we design
this interface we're not designing it
specifically for iPhone or iPod or an
iPad what we're doing is we're designing
a generic interface that's supposed to
be adaptive to every screen now whenever
we take these items right here and we
start dragging them on what they're
going to do is they're going to position
themselves relative to the top-left
corner so if you see I don't know the
exact number of pixels but say that it's
a hundred pixels down in 300 pixels
across from the top-left corner now
maybe this looks really good on an iPad
and maybe it's dead center
over on iphone 300 pixels across is
right at the edge of the screen which
isn't good so how do we fix that well
there are a couple different ways that
we can fix it so for right now just to
UM
kind of show you guys the quick and
dirty way this is kind of like the
cheating way I'm going to show you guys
in detail whenever I cover interface
like details and interfaces later on but
for right now what we can do is this
make sure that you have just click
somewhere in your empty view in your
empty interface right here and uncheck
this button right here use size classes
now uncheck this and we can check
disable size classes and what it's going
to do is it's going to take that square
and it's going to turn your interface
builder into the shape of an iPhone so
now what we can do is actually let me
close my smell later so quit this and
back in Xcode take that item again and
drag it right in the middle of your
screen and ah right so now whenever we
build and run this again check out what
happens build succeeded oh look at that
it now looks as expected whenever we
were designing it so again that is one
quick and dirty way to do it and for
right now whenever you're just following
along with these next couple examples
that is how you can follow along and get
the same results that I'm seeing but
later on what I'm going to show you guys
how to do is I'm going to show you guys
a better way to do that arm that's going
to be adaptable to every single device
but for now one other thing that I want
to show you guys since I have a little
bit of time is how to change attributes
really quick so if you say okay this
obviously is the greatest design that
I've ever seen just the word just just
the word bacon on the screen I would how
much money would I pay for this app
probably like a thousand dollars but uh
what we can do is I think we can make
this even better so select this view
right here
and once you have that selected what you
can do is you can go in this right panel
and you can select this icon at the top
that looks like it kind of looks like an
arrow with a bar behind it it's supposed
to resemble a slider and clicking this
will show the attributes inspector these
are pretty much all the properties or
settings that you can apply to this item
so of course all this is really
intuitive you can change the size of it
or you can just change the color of it
the color of the text to something like
red for baking and of course since I
change that font size we need to resize
this so it appears properly and there
you go
so now if you want to run this again
this is saying okay whenever you try to
run it and you already have your
simulator open then it gives you this
little warning so what you can do is you
can just hit stop or you can go and hit
simulator close and just run it again
whatever but that's what that little
warning says so here you go this is our
brand-new bacon app bacon 2.0 it's the
next big hit so if you guys were
learning iOS development so you can
learn how to make a bacon app then thank
you for watching I will see you in a
couple years but if you want to learn a
little bit more about iOS development
and learn how to do some other cool
things then well stick around because
this series is going to get a whole lot
better and well I'll see you guys next
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
