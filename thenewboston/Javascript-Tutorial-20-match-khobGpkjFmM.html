tutorial in JavaScript so I hope you
learned something by now and uh I'm
gonna be talking guys today about
another object another feature in
objects and this is called the match and
what this does is it allows you to tell
JavaScript alright we're looking for
something and if it is included in here
or if it's matched in here we want you
to output it on the screen as you can
see the index of just gave us the
placement of it now we want to say all
right
if we have a word and we and it matches
then tell us that it matches and this
might not seem useful right now but once
we get into programming which is
probably in a couple tutorials then I'll
show you how it's really useful with
verifying forms and stuff like that so
as you can see the last time hopefully
you watch my last tutorials instead of
index of after our string a set of index
of we want to type the word match and
what this is going to do is search for
this word my key in our string of text
which is the variable word so let's go
ahead and save this and as you can see
monkey is nowhere in hello Bob my name
is Suzy so let's let me show you what it
does it says null and this is JavaScript
way of saying that all right the word my
key is nowhere in your variable well
let's say we do have something in here
that says name and as you can see name
matches this right here so they are the
same so when we save this in refresh all
javascript does is output the word name
and this is JavaScript way of telling
that all right you do have a match in a
string and real quick-like say something
say you want to verify someone's form
and you know that they might spell
something wrong like this
and if they do that as you can see they
spelled name wrong in searching through
this JavaScript won't be able to find it
anywhere so when we save this again
it says null and this is a way where you
can shut off your program and set or you
can warn the user all right
you spell something wrong or you messed
up cuz whatever we're trying to do it
didn't match in here so that's one way
of programming just real quick how you
can validate form so we'll be talking
more about this later and now actually
useful and make a lot more sense than
just trying to do it single-handedly but
right now I'm just trying to teach you
guys the basics before we include this
in any bigger program so thanks for
watching I hope you learned a little
something at least and go to my website
Auto land chat comm I'll give you a link
and you can register Thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
