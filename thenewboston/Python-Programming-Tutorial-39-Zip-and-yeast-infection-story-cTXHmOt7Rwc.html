and in this tutorial I want to show you
guys about the zip function Z IP now my
guess is that if you've been programming
Python for like any decent amount of
time you probably saw this a lot and
it's kind of confusing to know exactly
what it does just by looking at it the
very first time so I'll go ahead and
show you guys a real basic example now
basically what we're going to do is
we're going to have two lists of equal
lengths and we're going to zip them
together or time together so we're going
to return a final list of tuples so I'll
make a really simple demonstration this
won't be anything useful but it'll be
really easy to see what's going on so
say that we have two lists of names
Bucky and these are all first names Tom
and Taylor now we have another list of
equal lengths and this can be the last
names so Bucky my last name is Roberts
we'll say it's Tom Hanks and Taylor oh
my oh my pumpkin pie alright so I have
two lists right here and obviously it
would be really nice if we could tie
these together somehow because in our
program basically we're always going to
be using these together the first and
last name you always see them together
in pretty much every computer program
say we're making a social network or
something so what you can do instead of
iterating through the entire thing in
some kind of for loop with a counter and
calling um like 0 1 2 every time that
can get kind of messy so instead what
you can do is zip them together so call
the function zip and inside here is the
parameters you toss in whatever list you
want to zip together so this is pretty
much saying ok take the first list which
is this and the last one and tie them
together and store that in a final list
of tuples called names so let's go ahead
and take a look at names just so we can
visually see what exactly is going on so
again I know that I just tied together
listen I'm just
loop through them right now so it's kind
of pointless but again this is just a
demonstration so for a be and names
print a B so let me just run through
this and check this out
Bucky Roberts Tom Hanks and Taylor Swift
now like I said what this is actually
doing is making a list of tuples so it
actually looks something like this
Bucky Roberts um let's copy this so it's
going to look something like this
Bucky Roberts Tom Hanks and Taylor Swift
so again whenever we loop the room it's
going to break them apart and you can
access each individual element if you
need to or keep them together in a nice
zip list so again this example not very
good but now that we understand the
basics of what a zip is what does it
function is and basically how it's
constructed we're going to be seeing
this a lot whenever you want to actually
do something with these items like
comparing numbers say that these were
two numbers you can say okay if a is
greater than B then safe a or maybe I
don't know multiply the two numbers
together and you're looking for the
result something you know a little more
practical like that in a weird
real-world application so uh yeah there
we go and it's videos only like four
minutes long so I went a little faster
than actually that's it that's all the
Python for this video but I do have a
sort he tells since this video so short
and again totally unrelated Python um so
you can move on to next soro but for
those who want a little entertainment
this is something kind of funny that
Avenue I went to my mom's house last
night because there's a hockey game and
my little cousin was over there and his
mom is super strict like she only lets
him eat organic food and he's not
allowed to drink soda or anything like
that so me and my sister in the silicon
my little cousin were sent around the
dinner table and I always like to be
like kind of goofy around kids just see
how they react so my mom went to the UM
it was like it's it wasn't the regular
stores like this Amish store we can get
baked goods is she bought this little
loaf of bread it's like a little bit
bigger than the size of a cell phone so
I picked it up and I started I started
talking to like I was talking to someone
and I'm like Hello
completely serious and my sister she
just was like playing along with it
exactly she didn't even smile or
anything so now my little cousin is like
looking at me like he's thinking about
laughing but then he's like looking
around he's like how come no one else is
smiling is this guy like really talking
to someone on this bread phone so uh so
I'm like hello and I asked them to be
quiet because I can't hear very good on
my bread phone so I'm like oh it's my
doctor and I go oh the test results are
in
Oh what is it it's a yeast infection and
then and then my sister just busts out
laughing because she couldn't keep her I
don't know she couldn't keep a straight
face anymore and then his mom she comes
over if she starts flipping out because
like I said he's like she's like so
straight-edged and I did she said you
can't talk to him about yeast infections
and yeah yeah yeah but uh I don't know
like the story doesn't have a punch line
or anything so that's as good as it gets
but I thought it was pretty funny and
she was even more mad that me and my
sister were laughs and when she was like
trying to scold us or whatever but that
is my yeast infection story so oh well
thank you guys for watching now you know
about syphilis and I will see you next
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
