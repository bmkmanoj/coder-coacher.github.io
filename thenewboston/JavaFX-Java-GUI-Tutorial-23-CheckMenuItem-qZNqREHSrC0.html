video I want to talk to you about a
really cool type of menu item that is
included in JavaFX and that is called
check menu item
essentially what it allows you to do is
have a menu item and whenever you click
it you could pretty much toggle a
checkbox on and off and it's really good
for options if you want to like um set
show line numbers to on or for set
autosave to on or off so it's pretty
much just like a checkbox but in a
drop-down menu so I'm gonna make another
menu called a help menu so right now we
just have file Oh show you guys so right
now we just have file at it I'll make
another one called help or options and
I'll have two menu items in it one will
be I'll say show line numbers and the
other will be autosave so the user can
either check these on or off depending
on you know how they want their programs
run so just say help menu in menu help
menu scroll up a little bit alright new
menu help alright so the first thing I
wanted to do is just go check menu item
and the first item is gonna be show I'll
just say show lines so set equal to new
check menu item in the title will just
be show line numbers so eventually we'll
say we're making some you know text
editor IDE in the user can either click
this on or off to decide whether they
want to show their line numbers so how
do we actually implement that logic
because it's a little bit different it's
a menu item that can have two different
events see typically whenever we have
something like this right here you click
the menu item and only one thing can
happen all right that's simple enough
but with this right here they can either
turn them on or off so that's actually
two separate well it's not two separate
events but I'll show you guys exactly
what's going on
so if you call show lines which is the
menu item you can call set on action so
again the user can only ever do one
thing to a menu item they can click it
so alright that's interesting because we
can't have two of these E's in here so
how do we kind of handle the logic
behind that well your menu item has a
property associated with it and that is
called the selected property so for the
menu item you can either test is that
option selected in other words does it
have a checkbox next to it if it does
then we can just you know do whatever
system.out.print line so I'll say a
program will now display line numbers so
again what's gonna happen is the user is
gonna click this and then it's gonna say
okay did they check it or did they
uncheck it if they selected a take a
they checked it then we'll just show the
line numbers just gonna print something
down on the screen now buts you know you
really should actually do something with
the program and if they uncheck it and
I'm gonna be lazy and I'll say I'll be
like adding line numbers not guiding
guiding the line numbers into my farm
why did I say that
I don't know all right so the last thing
that we need to do is actually add the
help menu to the screen and you know we
have to hold help menu get items at all
add this menu item to the help menu so
check this out
all right we now have a help menu and by
default is unchecked so we can either
click show line numbers and it's going
to print out program one now what
display line numbers and check out what
happens whenever I click the help menu
again and now
a little check next to it indicating
okay the user does want to select this
item and if I click it again
and it's pretty much gonna uncheck it
just like that so again you can only
ever do one thing to it the user can
either click it that's is so that's why
we only have that one event however this
property selected property is pretty
much asking do you want to select it or
unselect it that low checkmark or no
checkmark and we can implement our logic
that way now another thing I want to
show you guys real quick is this you see
how whenever I run this program by
default the behavior that's given to us
is all of these check items are
unchecked no checkbox but what if you
say I don't know you wanted to save the
user settings from the last time they
ran the program well what we can
actually do is we can pretty much enable
a default selected option or not so we
pretty much say what options do we want
selected by default so if I make a new
menu item I'll just call it Auto shave
new check menu item you know just enable
auto save so we'll say that if the user
selects this then um you know the
programs automatically gonna save the
work for them if they uncheck it then
they have to save it manually but you
know I'm not actually gonna write that
logic but I'll show you guys something
cool you can do auto save set selected
equal to true now this is just gonna
select it by default at first it's not
gonna keep it selected through the
entirety of the program that was
embarrassing okay um my face is red
right now in the middle of authorial
alright check this out so I started off
the program this first one of course we
didn't do anything to that but this last
one enable autosave is checked by
default now of course we can uncheck it
if we want check it show line numbers do
to do to do do this all day
anyways this or as well start with the
top this is how you use check menu items
this is how you implement the checked or
not check logic and this is how you set
an item that is checked by default so
boom roasted good to go
I'm gonna go eat some peanut butter
cookies and I will yeah see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
