52nd udk tutorial and in this tutorial
I'm going to be kind of taking things up
a notch because if we remember in the
last story I tell you guys had to shoot
this control panel box and whenever you
did it made a nice little announcement
appear on the screen and that was cool
and all but to tell you the truth I'm
getting kind of bored with these
announcement they're kind of bland
aren't very exciting so let me teach you
guys had to do something a little more
exciting so the very first thing I
wanted you guys had to do is I want to
teach you guys about something called
interp actors so go ahead and find a
static mesh yet you want to work with
I'm going to go ahead and search static
meshes and I actually have one in mind
statue and the very first thing you need
to do is we're going to be adding the
static mesh as an interp actor so let me
explain you guys what the heck and Inter
vector is an interp actor is a dynamic
static mesh it's a static mesh but you
know how we like made building out of
static mesh in the walls and floor and
windows and we'll never play our game it
would just you know stay there stay a
wall stay building well a dynamic static
mesh is a static mesh that can move
around it can grow shrink rotate it can
appear and disappear like I said it's a
dynamic static mesh so we can't just go
ahead and drag and drop this right in
our perspective view or it's just going
to be a static mesh so in order to add
this is a special dynamic static mesh we
first need to make sure that this static
mesh is fully loaded and i'm not talking
about like when you drink a bunch of
beer you're fully loaded make sure it's
fully loaded in the UDK and mine already
is because I was playing around with it
and whenever it is go ahead and select
it in your content browser and now X out
of your content browser and now go ahead
somewhere near your control panel or
whatever target you have go ahead and
right-click and you're going to see add
interp actor this pretty much means add
dynamic static mesh so now we add the
static mesh is a dynamic static mesh
instead of just a regular static mesh
because whatever we do to these static
meshes or
here they won't change but we can kind
of mess around with this one since its
dynamic now an inter Pachter like i said
we can grow it shrink it rotate it move
it around blow it up and do a bunch of
cool stuff with it so even though it
looks the same right now trust me it's
not so now let me go ahead and hop on
over to kismet and as you can see i
already deleted my nice little play
announcement because again play
announcements are kind of boring we're
going to be doing something a lot more
interesting I don't even know if I told
you guys this already but what we're
going to be doing is I'm going to be
teaching you guys how to shoot this
control panel box and whenever you do
we're going to make the static mesh
which I shouldn't even say static mesh
this interp actor disappear pretty cool
huh so you guys probably thought that
david blaine and david copperfield were
the only people that can make things
disappear I don't think so add Bucky
Roberts to that list because I'm about
to do it so the very first thing we need
to do is we need to represent this
object in some way in kismet so go ahead
and select this enter pachter and go
ahead and right click and hit new object
variable using interp actor too and it'd
probably be easier for you guys to see
if i added a comment i'm just going to
add statue right above this and now
whenever you do that this statue is
represented by this object in kismet
pretty cool huh so now you're saying
alright well how do I make this up here
in uh nuh pier AKA make it visible and
invisible well in order to do that we
need to add a toggle switch but not just
any toggle switch if we go hover new
action and toggle remember toggle is
what we use to make our light switch or
a light bulb switch on and off what we
want to do is select toggle hidden this
is a special kind of toggle where you
can hide and unhide and by the way
unhide pretty much just means make
visible objects so if you were to go
ahead and first thing we wanted to do is
saying alright we had this switch we're
supposed to hide and unhide something
but would we want to hide and unhide
well let me go ahead and just plug the
target into the statue and then
way whenever we use this toggle switch
it knows we want to hide and unhide the
statue right here so all we're going to
do now is saying all right whenever we
take damage or whenever we shoot that
control panel box if we hook it up to
this it's going to hide that statue or
make it disappear whenever we hook it up
to this it's going to make up here which
you're already already has appeared of
course because we can already see it
because so that's not going to do
anything but we want to go ahead and hit
toggle now toggle is a little bit
different since this is visible by
default it's going to toggle this to off
or make it invisible if we start at the
level and it was invisible and whenever
we hit the box it would make it visible
so it pretty much looks at what it is
currently and toggles it to the opposite
so basically whenever we're playing our
game and let me show you guys I'm going
to go ahead and hit play from here since
this statue is already visible and
whenever I shoot this box it's going to
toggle it to invisible don't believe me
we'll watch closely watch this interp
actor right here whenever I shoot it
shoot it and it toggles to in visible
pretty cool home so now let me talk you
guys through one last time what we did
let me go ahead and give you guys a nice
little angle to look at what we did is
we first added an interp actor remember
this is different than a static mesh
because a static mesh in your game they
aren't going to change you're going to
be there forever however an inter
pachter is like a static mesh that's
dynamic that we can move around make
appear disappear to off all kinds of fun
things with the next thing we did is we
took that inter pachter and we added it
as an object in kismet that way we can
reference this in kismet and right after
that we added a special toggle switch
called toggle hidden and what this
toggle action does is it hides and
unhide interp actors or in this case a
statue so we can go ahead and hide it or
unhide it but what we wanted to do is
toggle it which pretty much means look
at the current state and if it's visible
turn invisible if it's invisible turn
invisible
and you could do this all day long so
you're on and off on and off so that's
all I wanted to teach you guys what to
do in this story again I'm just putting
the pieces together in this tutorial and
in the next Sora I'm going to be
building a really cool i don't know if
it's going to be the next sorrel but in
the upcoming sorrows i'm going to be
teaching guys how to build a really cool
system I'm not going to give it away now
but trust me it's gonna be awesome
though so thank you guys for watching
don't forget subscribe enough she guys
