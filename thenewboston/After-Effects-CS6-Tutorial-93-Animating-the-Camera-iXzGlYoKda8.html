Effects cs6 tutorial
I'm your host buddy Blackford and today
I want to show you how to animate your
camera and explain to you the different
types of camera moves and these camera
moves are based on real-life actual
camera moves that film producers and
videographers and and all those guys
that work on movies and stuff actually
use so there's about seven of them I
would say I think there's seven and I'm
gonna go over each one with you and let
you let you know a little bit about each
one so the first one I want to start out
with is actually called a zoom and I'm
sure everybody knows what a zoom is but
how do you do it correctly in After
Effects so on your camera here if you
click on it and twirl down these options
you'll get this section called camera
options here now twirl that down and the
first thing you can see is zoom now just
move that back and forth and then you'll
get your zoom option there now you might
be thinking to yourself why can't I just
use this track Z camera tool if you've
used this tool before and move in like
this well that's different
if you look at the camera when I'm doing
the track Z here you can see in the in
the custom view over here you can see
that the camera is moving back and forth
now that is called a track and not a
zoom now watch when i zoom now you can
see that the actual field of view is
changing and not where the camera
position is so that's different that way
you can actually move your move your
move how zoomed in your scene is without
actually moving in your camera which is
should have been self-explanatory the
next step I want to show you is what a
track is now this is physically moving
the
amaura from either left to right up or
down or in so it's based off of when if
you've ever seen like a
behind-the-scenes video companies will
though our filmers will lay a track an
actual like railroad looking track down
and put it so put a camera on like a
tripod on wheels on the track and move
it in for a nice smooth view so if i
just use these track XY or track Z
camera tools like this you can see in
the left view there in the custom view
that the camera moves from left to right
if you hold shift
it'll constrain from left to right or if
you hold shift and are moving up and
down and the y axis well it'll move up
and down in the y axis as long as you're
still at the starting point so if I'm
over if I move over here and I try to
move up and down it's not going to work
so I have to go back to where the camera
was originally originally in the
beginning which was somewhere around
here right here and now I'll be able to
move up and down using shift same thing
with the X and y axis so I'm gonna hit
control Z so I can get back to where I
was and those are called tracks the next
camera moves I want to show you are
called tilts and pans and these deal
with the orientation or rotation
properties here so I'm gonna press open
up my transform here and we're going to
animate what a pan looks like we're
going to animate the orientation here we
go on my selection tool and that's going
to be on the y-axis and this is called a
pan now you can think of the
the camera as being on top of a tripod
where you can't actually move it so this
is left to right this is a pan now if
you go on the x-axis here this is called
a tilt and this is up-and-down so this
is a tilt this type of camera move here
where you use the Z access to it kind of
rotates that's not a very popular camera
move and it's only used in specific
situations and nobody really has a name
for it at least I mean I don't know the
name for it because no one ever wants to
use it it's visually jarring and does
not look very good no you may hear other
people call some of these different
names so in after-effects the TREC XY
camera tool and the track Z camera tool
may have different names depending on
who you're working with so if you have
someone that's not familiar with After
Effects that's familiar with filming
they'll call
a left and right camera move it would be
called a truck so that's this and that's
what we call track X in After Effects
and when you move the camera up and down
like this that would be called a
pedestal so that is a pedestal camera
move up and down on the y-axis and I'll
put it back in the middle and then if we
go to the track Z camera here this is a
usually also mostly called a track but
other people might call it a truck so
this is a track or a truck
now actually animating any of these
properties is just like animating
position or rotation in in like a solid
like an image layer or anything like
that so you just need to keyframe the
the value that you want to move so I'll
go position here and then move a couple
seconds and and then just use my track Z
tool to track in and we've got a track
there so that's easy enough for moving
your camera around you can use the graph
editor to edit your camera moves you can
use Easy's keyframes I press f9 to get
the easy keep keyframe and all the other
types of key framing abilities are
available on your cameras now you may
notice that some camera properties here
are different so point of interest here
is basically the anchor point now I'm
gonna use my unified camera tool in my
custom view over here so if you move
around in the custom view it doesn't
mess around with your actual camera view
and right here in the middle I can zoom
in as much as I want but it'll stay the
same size but right here where my mouse
is that is your point of interest and if
I move that around you can also do
different camera moves like the tilt
right here as I'm moving the X and y but
normally you want to keep your point of
interest in the same so it'll always be
in that area unless you're trying to use
the same type of camera move to view
something else somewhere else in the
scene the hotkey for a point of interest
is a actually and it just switches out
the the
anchor point now if I back down and to
our other transform properties you'll
notice that scale isn't on here
you cannot scale a camera so you might
have thought that it would have been the
zoom feature but remember that zoom is
in the camera options so that's uh
that's all I could need to say for
animating your camera it's the same way
you can animate a like animate anything
else pretty much if you want to animate
a shape or a vector or anything like
that it's the same so thanks for
watching the tutorial I look forward to
seeing you guys in the next tutorial and
I thank you for supporting all the
videos I've done so far have a good one
