slash on live gamer for the new Boston
and in this tutorial we're going to be
using some of the things that you've
learned in the last tutorials to make a
simple calculator program so let's go
ahead and get started we're going to go
ahead and give some space down here in
our main sub and we're going to prompt
the user to input a value so we'll use
console dot write line please enter the
first number now what we're going to do
is we're going to declare a variable and
we're going to use console dot readline
to store the information in that
variable so we'll use the dim keyword so
dim num1 as double and we'll just set it
equal to console dot read line so if you
want to read a value from the line or if
you want to get the input that the user
is putting in you can declare the
variable and assign it to console dot
readline at the same time you can do all
this in one line which saves you some
coding time so now that we have our
first number we're going to use console
dot write line and we're just going to
tell the user what their first number is
so that they know that the program
received it correctly so I'll do first
number and we'll just use the + sign and
we'll print out num1 now what we're
going to do is we're going to prompt
them to enter a second number so we will
use console dot write line please enter
the second number
now we're going to create another
variable so we will use the dim keyword
will do dim num2 as double and we'll set
it equal to console dot readline so this
does the same thing that we did up here
in declaring num1 and we use console dot
readline and instead of number one down
here we're going to want num2
okay so now we're going to print out the
answer but first we're going to tell
them that we receive their first number
correctly so console dot write line
second number and now we're going to
create a third variable with we will dim
it and we'll type answer as the name and
we want to make it a double and we'll
set it equal to num 1 times num2 so now
we're just going to print that out so
console dot write line answer and we'll
set that equal to answer or will add
answer to that and we need to use the +
sign right here so now if we run this
program it will say please enter the
first number so if I type 32 and press
ENTER it's going to tell me the first
number is 32 and it's going to ask me
for the second number so let's do 45 and
you can see closed on us right there so
we need to add console dot read line
okay so we'll enter the first number 34
it says first number 34 and we'll enter
the second number 45 and when we press
ENTER it will tell us the second number
and it'll tell us to answer so now let's
go down here and let's just specify what
the calculator did so we'll do the
numbers multiplied is and it's going to
give us the answer now what we can do to
save time is we can get rid of answer
all by itself and instead of printing up
printing out the answer we can do num1
times
num2 so what this does is it takes on
number one and multiplies it by num2 and
it only does that in the arguments of
console dot write line so it's not
sorted as a variable it's just going to
print out that number and then it's not
going to save it anywhere now you can
choose which one you want to do if you
want to use answer later on then I would
suggest declaring that variable and
storing it in there because if you want
the answer later on and you didn't
declare a variable for it you won't be
able to get the answer because the only
time that you have the answer printed
out on the screen
or stored anywhere is when it writes
this line and it multiplies them
together so you can go ahead and play
around with it you can make it multiply
you can make a divide you can make it
add whatever you want and then once
you've got that nailed down move on to
the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
