tutorial we're gonna be picking out an
optical drive and everything and what's
the optical drive it is the CD or DVD
drive in your bitter this thing Rory but
see these are DVDs so everything in all
right won't one do I pick out a CD or a
DVD drive I got one answer for you DVD
Drive and this is really simple a DVD
drive can read and write DVDs and CDs
but a CD drive can only read and write
CDs so if you want to see these or CDs
and DVDs pretty much buying a CD drive
is pretty much like buying a piece of
garbage you can do it but why would you
so always pick out a DVD drive please
I'm begging you
the next thing I want to talk to you
guys about is what kind of interface to
pick out now
also like we did in our hard drive we
had an option a SATA SATA or IDE
interface now in our hard drive remember
I kept stressing you by the Santa but in
this tutorial unexpectedly I'm gonna
recommend go with the IDE
because SATA for your optical drive just
sucks because all the operating systems
and all the computers stopped
recognizing Santa optical drives so
always go with the IDE interface when
choosing an optical drive which is
hopefully a DVD drive as I stated so
again right now we want a DVD drive and
we want it to be i ve not Santa next
once you picked out a DVD in IDE you're
gonna come across a couple numbers when
you're looking at drives there it's
going to be something like X 16 or 24 X
20 X 16 whenever you got a number of
standing alone
with an X in front of it this is your
read this is how fast that your computer
can read that drive or get data off of
it whenever you got three numbers like
24 times 20 times 16 these are
respectively there right how fast you
can put that on to the CP your rewrite
how fast once that is already on there
you can put it on again
and your read if your last one is your
read how fast you can take information
off of it so again once you go if you
got one number and you only got a DVD
drive that you can read data that's your
reading number if you've got three
numbers there respectively always your
write speed your rewrite speed in your
read speed</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
