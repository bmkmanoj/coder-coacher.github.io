Effects tutorial and in this tutorial
we're gonna be learning how to edit edit
multiple properties on the same screen
now in the last tutorial we learned how
to use the graph editor to edit one of
these value such as rotation or if we
had something like position we could
edit that one too but the only problem
with this is when we want to try to
coordinate two or more properties it's
kind of hard to toggle back and forth
and see what one we can edit and one on
what one we can't so do that here's what
we need to do if you want to get more
than one value on the graph at the same
time didn't you need to right-click and
you need to click show animated
properties this is going to show all of
your properties that you animated and
this is going to let you coordinate one
or more animations on the same screen
now After Effects automatically color
coats them so that you can tell right
here in your composition panel and right
here in your graph editor what each line
means now there's one problem with this
a lot of the time you're gonna have
properties that have a huge range for
example you might have a a position
chain that's only like 100 pixels or
something and you might have a rotation
that's like 6000 so one lines gonna be
like only like this on your screen that
you can barely even tell what it is and
the other lines gonna be way shooting
off the graph and your scales gonna go
from like 0 to 2000 so one way that you
can isolate some of these lines or
actually the way that you should do it
is if you only want to work with a
couple properties at the time and not
show all of them you need to go down to
this little eye and make sure that
everything is selected except show
animation properties once you click that
you're going to be able to choose what
animation properties you
wanna see and you do that by using this
little button right here when you click
one of these buttons it shows you it can
isolate just what properties you want if
the box is selected it means include
this on the graph editor as you can see
we now have rotation selected and we now
have only rotation on the graph editor
if we select position two then we have
rotation and position and of course if
we deselect rotation then we only have
position so this is pretty helpful if
you're working with a bunch of different
properties that you animated but they
have a wide range of values if you only
want to like coordinate two of them or
three of them then you can get rid of
the other ones get them out of the way
and concentrate on the ones you're
working on so this is a very useful tool
when you're trying to coordinate images
or animations so let's go ahead and just
do that right now since we wanted to
coordinate this animation let's go let's
make Charlie rotate that is we'll make
sure we changes a rotation one that gets
the the peak of his positioning so go
ahead and move this position over to the
middle of this this is the change of
position and as you can see this is a
lot easier than trying to move your
keyframes in your non and graphical
editor mode and another thing I want to
do is bring down his positioning I mean
his rotation whenever as he's
approaching the end so as you can see
now Charlie if you watch him he's
rotating and at the top he's gonna
change his rotation so that's a useful
way and again if we want to apply easy
ease select the keyframes and do them
one by one
ease in and ease out and now as you can
see this is very useful way to
coordinate our end
Asians very useful tool in trying to
coordinate keyframes and if you want to
achieve the desired effect then you can
do by doing this so learn how to use the
graph and edit multiple animations at
the same time and as you can see it's a
lot easier way to coordinate your
animations among keyframes so thank you
guys for watching study this tutorial
and I hope to see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
