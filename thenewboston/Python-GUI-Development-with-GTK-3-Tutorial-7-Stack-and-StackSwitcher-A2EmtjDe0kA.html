video I'm going to show you how to make
another type of layout called a stack
switcher now a stack switcher is a type
of layout that is essentially just tabs
so you know whenever you have a tab
layout you have one or more tabs at the
top and then you can click them and
switch between different areas or
different sections of your program so
with a stacks which are the top part or
the tabs this is actually called the
stack switcher and the main area where
content is this is called the stack but
I'm probably just going to refer to it
is the tabs in the main area but
remember if you're taking on a test or
something you this is called the stack
switcher and this is called the stack so
the first thing I'm gonna do before you
start is just add a little bit of
padding around all of my content in the
main window
so set border width I'll just set it to
10 like before thought that was pretty
good and now what I'm gonna do is this
I'm actually gonna make another box
because if I don't add this box then
your main content is gonna be butted
right up against the tabs and it's gonna
look a little bit goofy in this example
so I just want to add a little bit of
spacing between the main area in the tab
so this is how you do that so make box
and just set this equal to d TK box and
we need to change Y doesn't worry the
Taoiseach pop-up that's kind of weird we
need to change your orientation of gtk
dot orientation dots vertical because by
default boxes are horizontal
left and right however we want our tabs
on top of our main area so if we don't
do this then the tabs are really gonna
be weird and on the left so I also want
to change the spacing to ten all right
so now inside this box what we can do is
add our crap and everything is going to
be nice-looking Purdy so this is just
for looks we didn't even get to the main
tutorial yes so let me
all righty mates I've got some more
space to work in boom so the first thing
I'm actually going to do is I'm gonna
make the stack in other words the main
area now after I have the main area I'm
gonna make two different pages I guess
if you will and then we'll make the
switcher to control them all so main
area that's what I'm gonna name mine and
this is just the gtk stack so again
technically whenever you're looking up
documentation and stuff for rember it's
called the stack but in this tutorial
main area my tutorial my rules alright
so one cool thing you can do is you can
actually set the transition type now
there are a bunch of different
transitions and this is whenever you
switch to a new tab you can either will
show you guys one cool example right now
stack transition type and you can see
all the different ones I'm just going to
hit slide it left to right so normally
whenever you have tabs boom you click in
the contents there boom look at that but
you can also have it transition in like
have the content in here slide in from
the left
I'm sure if you ever seen a PowerPoint
demonstration then a lot of people
always go overboard and have crap flying
in from all different angles well you
can do that I don't like it but you know
I figure I'll show you guys right now
and another thing I want to do is in the
main area whenever you have a transition
like this you usually want to set the
transition where are you're right here
duration so if stuff is flinging in from
the left this is gonna Fink fleeing fast
slow and I'll just put 2000 right there
so whenever it transitions in it's gonna
take two seconds if it's too slow then
we can speed it up to one second but
trying to demonstrate the point so there
you go so now we got you know how we
want to switch between tabs now let's
actually add some stuff in our tabs and
I'm just gonna make this real simple
just add a quick checkbox and I'm just
gonna name like check button
equals GT check fun and I'll just write
what am I gonna write on this alright do
not f in check me you can check it if
you want but I just thought it'd be
funny art now for the main area we need
to add that check button so a main area
and play told check behind so we're
gonna add the check button to the main
area and this second parameter right
here is just whenever you're actually
using it in an actual program you need
to give a name I'll just name it like a
check name you can name it whatever you
want you can name it egg salad whatevs
and check a box alright looking good for
that and now for the second thing and
again so the first tab all its gonna
have is a check button in it in the
second tab I'll just add some text in it
you know keeping things real simple and
for the label again this is just gonna
be basic text just gonna make a basic
label and then I'll actually show you
guys this for the label you can actually
set its popping up here sets mark up
Jesus come on huh I'm trying to type
here all right so gtk has a special type
of markup do I keep calling it gtx
that's embarrassing if I do but gtk has
a special type of markup and it's kind
of like HTML but it has weird a couple
of rules one tag that you can use is big
and then whatever text you right here of
course it's gonna be huge so oMG this
text is huge
geez why can I not type that's
embarrassing alright so now in the main
area now that we got a label what we can
do is we can add
label and this needs a name - I'll just
straight like a label name and this is
nothing that the user is going to see
it's just for later on whenever you're
actually programming it and I'm just
really big label and like you want to
get the value of a checkbox to see
fillers checked or not tomato tomahto
but whatever all right so now check it
out we created our main area we added
two things inside it so the check box is
gonna be in tap one and then when you
click over its tab - then it's going to
show your label but we actually need to
build the switcher or the tabs
themselves so the user can switch
between them and this is the stack
switcher and that's what this is going
to be and it's really easy I'm just
gonna name my stack switcher why not in
this is equal width gtk stack switcher
right there so the first function you
have to call on it is for kennyman type
all right so for the sec stack switcher
you need to give a stack in other words
what is the area that it's going to
control well that's just the main area
of course that's the only one we have in
this program and now what we need to do
after this is remember we created this
box a couple minutes ago and this box we
created it so we can have some spacing
between the tabs at the top in the main
area so now we just have to add the
switcher in the main area to that box
and that's it so for the box text arts
and remember the first parameter is what
do you want to add stack switcher so
that's the thing that's going to appear
on top true-true zero copy this paste
that change the name and we got
ourselves a computer program in the main
area so there you go now in our box we
added the switcher a cave of tabs then
we add the main area now whenever you
run this baby we're yeah we're yeah all
right there you go
so again these two tabs are here check
box
in big label this is the stack switcher
and this right here is the stack the
main area and you can have whatever you
want in there and again I know I was
calling them tabs and I kind of hate
doing that because something else in gtk
is called tabs and I don't want to you
know I don't I just thought it was
easier to explain that way but there you
go and look at those slow transitions
and again they don't have to transition
from the right in the left you can
transition them in other kinds of ways
you don't have to have any transition at
all but if you do then you can just that
maybe change the duration of it if it's
too slow but whatever so there ladies
and gentlemen is a tab to layout IKS
stacks which are hopefully you guys
enjoyed if not well I'll give you your
money back just Kim this tutorial is
free um see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
