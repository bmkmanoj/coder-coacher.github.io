and in this video I'm gonna be talking
to you guys about one of the most
important concepts in C and that is of
course variables actually not even in C
but entire computer programming as a
whole
so let's actually clean this up because
we're done with this and what a variable
is
is it's just a placeholder for something
else whenever people teach us they try
to make it sound so confusing but that's
all a variable is just a placeholder so
you probably use these all the time in
math class and let me go ahead and give
you guys an example now also I want to
point out that what I'm about to type is
not computer code I'm just showing you
guys this is is an example so if you set
x equal to meatball and then you say I
love X obviously you can see the basics
of what a variable is this doesn't mean
I love X it says I love meatball because
this X you said equal to meatball so
again this isn't you know computer code
but that's basically what a variable is
a placeholder for something else
simple enough so now let's go ahead and
learn how to use them you know how to
write actual computer code that makes
variables now every variable you have
you're gonna have to give it a name and
there are a couple rules that you're not
allowed to do whenever you're making a
variable and if you break these rules
you're gonna get an error because it's
gonna mess up your computer the first
thing is you can't start with a number
or an underscore so you can't have a
variable called like um 69 hot dogs or
however you spell it you have to start
with a letter from the alphabet either
lowercase or uppercase but it's a common
usage to start with a lowercase one now
another thing is that you can't have
spaces in your variables so you can't
have a variable named Bucky Roberts
because that has a space in it so again
no spaces um don't start with numbers
and also you can't have any weird
symbols other than underscores so you
can't have like Bucky a six dollar signs
and Astro
in that and then robbers so basically
start with a letter no spaces and well
just those basics I just told you so now
that we know how to name variables and
we're not what we're not allowed to do
oh another thing I want to mention and
this is this probably common sense too
but make sure you don't name your
variables any name is a function so
don't name your variables main don't
name a variable printf or anything like
that or else it's gonna get confused
it's gonna look at the variable bike
whoa are you like trying to run now
function or what the heck are you doing
idiot so that's where your computer's
gonna say to you trust me
I heard it before and well now we can
now we can actually start typing them so
whenever we want to use a variable the
first thing we need to do is tell C that
we're going to be using it and this is
called defining your variable so how do
we tell C well the first thing we need
to do is tell it what type of data we're
gonna store in it are you gonna use this
variable to store a word a number what
are you gonna do so let's go ahead and
say that we wanted to store an integer a
whole number so type int that's the key
word for int and now type your variable
name and I'll say I'll put my age in
there so of course at a semicolon at the
end and it's basically saying hey C
we're creating a variable we're gonna
call it age and it's going to store a
whole number aka an integer so now
whenever C runs across it later in your
program it's not going to get confused
it knows that age is a variable and it
stores some value so now we have a
variable how do we store a value in it
well all we do is it's actually really
easy type the name of your variable and
in this case age and put equal sign and
set it equal to some integer such as my
age is 27 so basically we created a
variable and we stored the value of 27
inside the variable age now whenever our
computer sees this word age it's just
going to treat it as the number 27
so let's go ahead and do one more thing
printf on the screen
and we can say Bucky is percent d
remember this is an integer percent D
and we'll say years old
now for the conversion character we can
just put H we don't need to put the
number 27 itself because this H is
pretty much a feud as that value so run
this bad boy and it says Bucky is 27
years old pretty sweet and of course we
can change this later on so when I'm old
what I can change this program to say 65
Bucky is 65 years old boom shebang
pretty stinkin sweet now another thing
that I want to teach you guys is that
you can also use simple mathematical
operations with variables instead of
just putting on a basic number in there
so instead of just writing 65 you can
have your computer figure it out so you
can say Bucky is 2014 - 1987 so if I run
this it's gonna say Bucky is 27 years
old because what it did is it said OK
for the value of this variable perform
this calculation so 2014 - 1987 equals
27 so store that answer in the variable
age and then print it out on the screen
so if we wanted to get really cool what
we could do is something like this we
could say ok let's have a variable for
age um we'll have a variable for current
year and we'll have a variable for birth
year so if you had no idea how old you
were you could run a program like this
to figure it out so basically we have
three variables age current year and
birth year now for current year we could
set that equal to 2014 for birth year
set this equal to 1987
and for the Aged what we can do is this
take the current year and subtract the
birth year so basically what it's going
to do is since this already has a value
of 2014 and this is pretty much 1987
it's gonna take this variable subtract
it from this variable and store the
answer in the variable age so pretty
sweet now whenever we run it check it
out
27 years old if you're running alright
what if I was born in 1963 well then I
would be 51 years old I always wonder
that and now I know so that is basically
um a real quick introduction into
variables again all they are this
placeholders for something else and in
the next tutorials I'm gonna be showing
you guys how to use different types of
variables and some other awesome things
that you can do with them so thank guys
for watching don't forget to subscribe
and again remember if you want any of
this source code I'm gonna go ahead and
post it on my forum so you can get it
then so thanks for watching and I'll see
you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
