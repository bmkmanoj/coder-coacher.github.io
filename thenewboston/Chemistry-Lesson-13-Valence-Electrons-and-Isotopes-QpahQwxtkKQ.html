welcome to your 13th chemistry tutorial
and in a story I'm going to be talking
to you guys about valence electrons and
also isotopes maybe something else if I
have time I really don't know yet so the
first thing I want to talk to you guys
about is valence electrons now
valence electrons are electrons on the
outermost energy level so why do we even
need to know about valence electrons it
seems kind of useless to give you know
kind of them a random name well whenever
you have a chemical reaction that takes
place elements usually lose or gain
electrons so let me go ahead and draw a
simple element I'll draw carbon now
carbon has six protons and it has six
electrons most of the time so let me go
ahead and we'll just go ahead and assume
that six protons are in that nucleus now
the electrons are two on the first
energy level and four on the second
energy level now these electrons out
here on the outermost energy level are
called valence electrons now remember
these are all negatively charged
particles in the nucleus is positively
charged there's a bunch of protons in
there so there's always an attraction
between these electrons and the nucleus
however the farther away you go the less
attraction there is or the less force so
whenever you have a chemical reaction
that takes place the farthest ones away
are the first to go because they have
less of an attraction than these ones
right here and again that is basically
what valence electrons are the electrons
on outer most energy level that's all
you need to know so now that we
understand what valence electrons are in
how they are either lost or gained in
chemical reactions we can now move on to
the next topic which is isotopes now you
might have heard of isotopes before but
if you haven't I'll go ahead and give
you a quick review so before I even
start I guess I might as well mention
this I know we didn't go over the
periodic table yet but you probably
gathered by now the elements are defined
the number of protons in them for
example if an element has one proton we
call it hydrogen any element with two
protons we call helium and they each
have a designated symbol and whenever
we're looking at the periodic table
we're going to see all about this so
basically just remember this elements
are defined by the number of protons
they possess however sometimes you can
have elements with the same number of
protons but different amounts of
neutrons whenever this happens we call
these elements isotopes so for example
whenever we're looking at carbon we take
the entire mass number which is 12 and
how many protons it has carbon always
has six protons so that's why we write
it like this now if we subtract the
entire mass or excuse me the number of
protons from the entire mass we get 6 so
carbon-12 has six neutrons because
protons plus neutrons equal mass however
you also have something like carbon-14
now carbon-14 is the entire mass 14
however like I said carbon always has
six protons so if you take 14 minus 6
you get 8 so carbon-14 has eight
neutrons six protons for an entire mass
of 14 so carbon-12 and carbon-14 would
be called isotopes the definition is
different forms of a single element
basically whenever you have an element
with the same number of protons but
different number of neutrons they're
called isotopes again one last time
different forms of the same element so
both of these have six protons but one
has six neutrons and the other has eight
neutrons in the nucleus so there you go
you now know about isotopes and also
valence electrons in the next tutorial
we're going to be covering ions and then
beginning into the periodic table and it
is going to be a blast
thank you guys for watching don't forget
subscribe and I'll see you guys in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
