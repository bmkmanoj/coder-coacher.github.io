we need to do is we need to override one
last method and this is going to kind of
piece everything together we need to go
ahead and I'm just going to stick this
at the end of the gestures give yourself
some space in hit alt insert and then we
are going to override a method and make
sure that you're sorting alphabetically
actually you don't need to do that but
it just saves some time and actually
remember this is our direct parent our
superclass fragment activity is its
parent so it's like our grandparent now
activity in here there's a method called
lalala where you at we're on touch event
so click on touch touch event and then
hit OK and that says ok so what you want
to do is you want to override this
method called on touch event now on
touch event is the default functionality
that gets called whenever a user touches
the screen now by default again this is
what occurs it pretty much just checks
for comment touches but what we want to
do is we want to say ok actually I want
you to detect if that touch was a
gesture first and if so handle it
appropriately which we already did so in
order to do that above this right here
type the keyword this touch gesture
detector dot on touch event in what we
do is we actually just pass in that
event that got passed in through here so
again instead of just detecting whatever
it was like normal on what it's going to
do is it's going to take that touch
event that gets passed in the finger
hits the screen and it's first going to
detect if it was a special type of
gesture like a scroll or a fling or
anything like that and if not then you
know continue as you were so now all we
have to do is run this bad boy which I
can make sure
have any warnings and let's see if it
worked
all right so everything is looking good
right now let me just go ahead and click
down and as you can see the longer I
click at first it said on single tap one
single tap confirm and if I hold it down
it says on long press now let me scroll
up and as you can see no matter if it
Scrolls up or down we get on scroll and
if I fling
for example I'm clicking down then when
I get to the top I'm letting go fling
fling fling fling fling pretty stinking
and sweet this app is awesome as always
the Swiper diaper - Swiper - all right
enough of me saying I should just like
teach something for two minutes then
just sing for like eight minutes ten
minute video pure gold alright guys so
now we know how to detect gestures so
your next homework assignment if you can
complete it now
enough with these like little wimpy
assignments so this is your assignment
for now what I want you to do is I want
you to create an interface and have some
text actually have some text at the top
and have a button on the screen in the
middle now I want you to be able to tap
that button and have the text change - I
got tapped or I just got tapped that's
better and also I want you to have the
ability to swipe on the side and that
text changes that way as well
so again text at the top button changes
it and swiping changes it as well and if
you want to add for bonus points a nice
subtle blue background you can do that
as well but there you go that is how you
use gestures and that is your next
challenge so let's see if you can
complete it when you do post it on my
forum thank you guys for watching don't
forget to subscribe and I will smell you
suckas later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
