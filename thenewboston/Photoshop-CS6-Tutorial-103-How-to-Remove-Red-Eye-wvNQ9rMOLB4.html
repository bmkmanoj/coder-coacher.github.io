Photoshop cs6 tutorial and my name is
buddy Blackford today is going to be a
really quick tutorial but really useful
one and we're gonna learn how to remove
redeye from an image so when an image is
taken with some of these old cameras for
some reason they had red eye on them and
I really remember why they had it but it
always looks stupid to me so I'm not
really sure it just made everybody look
like the devil really but there is a
quick and easy way in Photoshop cs6
where you can get rid of the red eye now
all we need to do is go into our our
correction our tool panel over here and
select the red eye tool now you're gonna
select the pupil size and the pupil size
in is uh pretty much the size of the
pupil in relation to the amount of
redeye and then there's the darken
amount which is how much you want to
darken the pupil yeah that's what it is
darken the people so all you need to do
is go ahead and click on the red ie part
and Photoshop will calculate and you can
see it took it away I'm just do it over
on this one and you can see it took it
away again it's really really easy and
that's how you get rid of redeye this is
also useful for getting rid of a green
and white reflections you get in like
your when you take a picture of your dog
or your cat and they look like the devil
cat or whatever you can use that on
those types of pictures as well now if
you just want to if you're taking images
by yourself and you keep on getting red
eye and you're in your pictures that is
because you are using your camera's
onboard flash and that's probably like
90% of the reason why there's a red eye
appearing in your images that you're
taking so if you want to prevent that
without having to come into Photoshop
and edit it just switch that or turn it
off or whatever so that's all I need to
show you about this it's
really easy tool and very helpful and
quick so it's one of my favorite tools
because it's just so fast so thanks for
watching this one everybody and check
out bookies room org for more tutorials
on photoshop and other Adobe programs
such as After Effects so see you guys
later have a good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
