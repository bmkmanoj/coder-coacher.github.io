welcome to 71st Java tutorial and in
this tutorial we're going to be adding
some functionality to this list we just
made on the screen so let's go ahead and
inside our constructor so let's go ahead
down a couple lines and what we want to
do is add a selection listener to this
list so what we want to do is put list
dot add list well look at that already
has a for us add list selection listener
and then go ahead delete this because
we're not going to need it and we're
going to make just like less sort of if
you saw another anonymous inner class so
go ahead and in your first line of the
parameters for add list selection
listener what we want to do is make a
new anonymous class and remember this is
just an easier way of handing it
handling it so put new list then see
list selection listener just like that
it's going to take no parameters and we
should say must implement yep must
implement method value changed so this
is pretty much says whatever class you
made implements list selection listener
it's just a easier way of bypassing it
the thing is we need to make a method in
here called value change that's what
it's telling us right now so in like
order to fulfill our duties of
implementing it so let's go ahead and
make public void value changed in all
this is pretty much what you need every
time you make a J list so let's go ahead
and fir the parameters for this is list
selection event and go ahead and type
event and now we can go ahead and start
doing the stuff that we want to do so
pretty much aside from this all of this
stuff is pretty much built in Java and
you need this every time it's none of
your own custom stuff so it's just the
easier way of adding some event handlers
to your program so now that we got all
this housekeeping stuff done let's get
into the good stuff what do we want to
do when a user
clicks one of the colors well what we do
want to do in people language is select
that color and change the background to
that color so actually there's three
different layers on our window
the first there's a background there's a
content pane and there's something
called I think it's called a glass pane
now the content pane is on top of the
background so they have it set up really
weird you need to actually access the
background through the content pane in
order to change background so the first
thing you need to do is get content pane
like that and the second thing you need
to do is finally we get to our
background so let's go ahead and set
background just like that and I spout
that around background that's a little
bit better and there we go my air goes
away and so what do we want to set the
background to well in our parameters for
here let me just end this statement and
our parameters for here we want to set
it to one of these colors from the color
list color black color blue color red
color right so the first thing we're
going to new you need to do is add color
and empty square brackets and now what
we want to appear in here is one of the
numbers one through four so how can we
get the numbers one through four
depending on what they selected remember
in our list was the array or excuse me
was the array color names and our list
was named list so let's go ahead and put
list dot get selected index so it's
automatically going to know whenever we
do not want to put that there let's see
so it's automatically going to know that
in our list that we just created and why
am I getting aligned under color because
it actually colors there we go
so when whenever it clicks our list in
by it I mean we it's automatically gonna
know if we click the first second third
or fourth item in our list
it's going to get that number and it's
going to say alright if you click the
third item in our list I'm going to pass
three in four here so color is three
equals let's see colors zero actually
one two three so it's going to be red so
that is how it happens like that and
remember to set the background you need
to get the content pane and get set
background I don't know why they did it
this way instead of just you know set
the background but they did it this way
and don't forget there's actually three
layers the content pane background and I
think it's called like a glass pane or
something something weird so that's that
for this story and let's actually run
this program and see if it works
so I see by default it's nothing because
we didn't send it to default value now
when you click black blue white red blue
red black white and any order then
that's pretty much just what happens so
one more time let me walk you guys
through that the first thing we did is
import all our stuff make sure you have
those it's key trust me and let's see
let's get to the important stuff we made
a list which is a variable further list
we made the color names which is what we
saw on the screen and we had a
correspond to the colors so that Java
can understand it using the special
colored black next we made a constructor
with a title layout yada yada yada we
made a list and we set it equal to J
list color names which were the options
that the user can see set the visible
row count which was four options by
default then we made a single selection
so you can only select one of the time
and we made a J scroll pane which gave
us a scroll window if necessary next we
added all this stuff which is pretty
much the default stuff you have to add
in Java and finally we added this little
line right here we went to content pane
so we could get to the background and
then depending on what index they
clicked we corresponding it to list of
colors that we made up here so one is
black two is blue three is red for is
why
so that is how we did that and that is
how we made an awesome little program
and look at this how awesome is that it
seriously red white and blue didn't even
notice that black where does that come
in but anyways thank you guys for
watching don't forget subscribe and I
will see you next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
