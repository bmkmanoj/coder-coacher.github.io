gonna show you how to reuse components
and also how to use properties so right
now we only have one component it's a
boring component says my name is Bucky
and we only have one place on our
website to put it but what if we wanted
to take this component and let's say
display it three more times so for some
reason we wanted three headings that
said my name is Bucky why would we ever
want that I don't know but let's say we
wanted it well what you may think is you
might want to try something like this so
remember this render function takes two
pieces of information the first one is
what are you trying to display and the
second one is where do you want to
display it so if we want to display this
a couple times let's just try copying
this and pasting it like that so we're
gonna display four of these and hmm that
didn't work out and if I look at my IDE
it's a tweaking out giving me a whole
bunch of trouble and this is because
whenever you display components or use
this render function it says okay I can
only render one thing so if we ever want
to reuse these and for example display
four of these we need to stick them
inside a div so div div and put them all
inside there so right now we can have a
bunch of child elements we're still
rendering one div what's inside it
doesn't really matter so now when i
refresh this check it out it renders
fine so just remember that whenever you
have a component and you want to display
it or use it multiple times then make
sure that you wrap it inside a div so
react doesn't freak out now another
thing I want to show you guys is how to
use properties so let's say instead of
just saying my name is Bucky let's say
um we wanted this component say I like
to eat and then some kind of food so
like bacon and then we reuse it again we
say I want I like to eat
tuna I like to eat ham I like the hot
pockets well what we need to do then is
we need to pass in some additional
information and that is called a
property whenever we're talking about
react components so how do we do this
well whenever you're rendering your
component instead of just rendering it
plain without any additional attributes
you can pass in an additional attribute
and let's say let's just name it food so
for this one we'll set the attribute
food equal to the value bacon and let me
just do this for all the components so
for this first one it'll be bacon the
second one will be tuna this third one
would be like beef whatever and this
fourth one will be like a ham how come
all the food I think of as always meat I
don't know but whatever all right so now
what we're doing is whenever we're
making this component we passed it in
another piece of information and these
are called properties so how do we use
these properties well instead of just
you know typing a word right there
anytime you want to use a property use
those curly braces and then to access it
like this dot props which stands for
properties and then the name of the
property so food so what this is gonna
do is it's gonna say I like to eat what
property was passed in for food bacon
what about for the next one tuna so on
and so forth so I like to eat bacon tuna
beef and ham you can also um let's say
let's pass in another one as well so
we'll say user so we'll say something
like Bucky likes to eat bacon
so we'll say what user it is as well so
Bucky likes to eat bacon Sally likes to
eat tuna it's just sounding kind of
weird but whatever Emily likes to eat
Emily likes to eat beef that's that just
sounds weird to me for some reason and
let's say Tony likes to eat ham well
then
we can just say this
props user so for each component this
gets the user property which is the name
and then say they'd like to eat whatever
their food property was so let's refresh
this and check it out like he likes the
bacon da da da da da da da da da
so that's another way that you can
customize these components and give them
custom attributes or properties remember
that's what these are called if you ever
want to use additional information so
there you go
hopefully you guys enjoyed and now you
know how to use components multiple
times and also how to pass in properties
pretty sweet see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
