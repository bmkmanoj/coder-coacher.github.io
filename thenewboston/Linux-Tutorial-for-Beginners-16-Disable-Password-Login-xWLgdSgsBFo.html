server set up and now that we can use
SSH keys the last thing we want to do
ssh related is we want to disable that
default password log in because like i
said this was the whole reason we were
learning this because password
authentication kind of sucks so to
connect to the server ssh route at there
all right so we're connected to the
server let me just clear the screen all
right
so we're in the server and all we're
going to do now is we're going to edit
one little line in the ssh configuration
file so i know i didn't talk to you guys
about these little editors in your
terminal but what you can do is if
you're on sudo since we want to be
tweaking a configuration file we need
the right permissions and actually i
forgot since i'm logged in as root right
now i don't even need sudo so if you
just write nano and nano is the program
that allows you to edit like multiple
lines of text at once because just in
your terminal you're like working with a
one line at a time so we want to open
the following file in the text editor so
etc' remember that's where most of our
configuration files were SSH SSH D
underscore config so I'll run this
command and then we see that we can like
move up and down and just work with
multiple lines so it's a lot easier than
just you know using one line at a time
but the line that we're looking for is
permit route login and if I scroll down
and here it is right here
so permit route login yes so this is
saying do you want route to be able to
login and right now it's just sent to
yes which is the default in whenever we
do that they can log in any way they
want password SSH key whatever but we
only change that to is delete the yes
and right without password so now
they're still allowed to log in but they
can't do it with a password they need to
use the key now in order to
leave this hold down control and hit X
and that's going to close out of it and
then if you hit Y then it's going to
save it before so hit Y to save and
enter so again whenever you make changes
using nano control X Y and then enter
simple enough so whenever we make
changes to configuration file we usually
need to reload it or restart the service
so reload SSH this just means restart it
so the new changes that we just made
take into effect so just close out and
you're good to go you can just now log
in and again whenever you log in now
it's just going to look at your SSH key
I can paste that in alright so there we
are allowed to log in and the cool thing
about that is if anyone else tries log
in even if they see your root password
it's still going to say access to nine
because you need to have that key and we
are the only ones that have it it's only
on our computer pretty cool
safe secure awesome see you guys next
