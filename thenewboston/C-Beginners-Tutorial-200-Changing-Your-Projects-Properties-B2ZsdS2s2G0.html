tutorial that I'm making for the New
Boston and in this tutorial we're going
to be looking at editing our projects
properties and by doing so you can do
things like change the icon version the
description add a company name and stuff
like that
alright so to access those properties
you're just going to want to go to
project up here and go down to my
project properties and it should say
your project name not my project I just
called my project my project but anyways
just click this right here and it should
take you to a page similar to this and
make sure you assign the application pad
right here and right here is just all
the information about your application
you have your assembly name your default
namespace and visages whatever you
called your project and also change the
assembly information where you can
change the version and stuff and the
icon and the default icon for your
application is just a boring window so
if you want to change it just go ahead
and flip this little Browse button right
here and the thing about changing your
icon is you need to have it in ICO
format so a dot ICO and a great place to
find icons is icon finder com
it's typing that everyone you can just
download it in either PNG or ICO format
alright and I already have some
downloaded so I'm going to go to my
desktop and select I guess this tornado
one and yeah so right now my
applications icon is just this tornado
but at any point if you want to change
the fact that the fault icon you can do
so just by clicking down in this arrow
right here and selecting default icon
but I'm going to keep it as a tornado
alright to actually see the changes take
effect we're going to have to both save
and debug so that our new application
will be built alright so as you can see
when we debug right here didn't actually
change this icon or this icon it changes
the icon of our app with actual
applications so on the exe file so in
order to get to that we're going to want
to go into our documents Visual Studio
2010 folder the projects folder then
whatever you name your project mine just
called my
object then go to the mic Rajic folder
or whatever you called your project then
the bin folder and the debug folder and
inside of here should be your Exe and as
you can see right there it just has my V
icon that we made and it's just called
my project and it's the executable or
whatever alright so that's how you
change the icon now to change the
assembly information you're just going
to want to go ahead and put this
assembly information button right here
and right here is just basically a whole
bunch of information about your assembly
so to see this information you actually
have to hover over your Exe file for a
little bit and SPG's comes up right
there it's a file description my project
company is Microsoft and the file
version is one and you can change all
that right inside of here
so if you want to change the title to
something else like I'm going to say
atom make the description be like my
group project change the company to like
whatever your company is or if you don't
work at a company just guess your name
or company after it doesn't really
matter or you can just leave this blank
altogether but I'm just gonna make it
Adams company the product obviously is
my project if you have a copier h-pipe
that they're a trademark and then for
the assembly version in the file version
you can change that and you should
probably make those the same but
basically what all these zeros right
here mean is just like how much you
edited your project so if you were to
like update it to something just very
minor you fix the very minor frog or
something then you're just going to want
to change this last number right here we
changed something a little bit bigger
than this but you're yet change that
number but if you made a huge change
then just change this number like a huge
update or something and the default
version select if you were to create a
brand new application just make it one
point zero one zero point zero all right
and then once you're satisfied with
everything just go ahead and click OK
but I'm actually going to change the
file version to 2.0 and just click OK
now just the chain just take a fact or a
save and debug right here and now we go
back to our
to application and hover over it we see
the file description atom company at
accompanying the file version is 2.0 and
0.0 all right so that's pretty much it
for this tutorial on editing pretty much
everything about your application your
icon and stuff like that alright so see
you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
