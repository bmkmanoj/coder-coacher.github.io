installed on our computer everything is
going to go what I want to do now is I
want to show you guys how to set up a
project to use gulp so the very first
thing I want you guys to do is just go
ahead and create an empty directory and
create it anywhere on your computer
doesn't really matter and this is just a
folder that we're going to be putting in
all of our source code in all of our
HTML files our CSS our pictures
basically the start of a website or some
web app so again I just made this I call
it sample and there's nothing inside
here whatsoever so that's going to be
our starting point and from here I'm
just going to go ahead in from Paris
shell just navigate to that location so
C D curly fur I don't even know what
this thing is called a tilde I guess to
navigate to home and mine is in my
desktop and I believe it's in a folder
called projects and sample so again this
sample directory is the one I created
nothing inside it whatsoever no HTML
files nothing at all so the very first
thing that you should always do whenever
you're starting a project is type NPM in
it this means you want to initialize or
start a new project now all this command
is going to do is is basically going to
create a package JSON file and this is
just a single JSON file and it's nothing
special really all it has is information
about your website or whatever project
you're working on so you usually want to
take the time and actually fill this out
properly but right now I'm just going to
kind of skim through it what's the name
of your project uh you know usually
it'll be something like the new Boston
I'm just going to name the sample and
all the rest of these you can kind of
just hit enter version one looks good
description nor really have time this is
going to be something like a website
about programming or something like that
enter enter just hit enter for the rest
of these and yadda yadda yadda Ari so is
this okay
just go ahead and hit yes
in boom roasted so now let me go ahead
and hop back into my IDE and I want to
show you guys this so what it did is it
created this file right here actually
let me go ahead and pause and bump up
this font a little bit alright guys so
hopefully you can see that a little bit
better and as you can see all this file
is if you're unfamiliar with it is just
some basic information about your
website or your project so nothing
really gulp related so what we want to
do now is we want to actually add gulp
to our project so how do we do that well
go ahead back in your terminal let me
clear this out now in order to install
gulp on your project it's really easy
type NPM install gulp and again make
sure that you are in this directory
right here because it's going to set up
a gulp project from wherever you are so
make sure you're not like on your you
know root hard drive or anything like
that so NPM I want to install gulp and
you also want to put - - save - dev so
go ahead and hit enter and it's going to
go ahead and take some time then to dump
and you're gonna get some warnings and
these aren't anything to worry about
they aren't like error messages or
anything like that they're just a few
warnings saying hey um you know you kind
of skimmed over all this whether you're
filling out your information you didn't
set up a proper repository or anything
like that but again they aren't errors
so don't freak out
no big deal so what you see now is your
package adjacent file it was kind of
thin before now what it has is this line
of code this is one of your most
important ones so it has depth
dependencies gulp and then the version
number so again whenever you just ran
that command let me clear this out show
you guys a little bit better what you
did is you said hey in this directory I
want to install gulp and I also want to
save it as a development dependency so
what these are are basically things that
you need in order to work on this
website
so the reason that you have them is
because if you ever share this with
someone else
or if you're ever working on this
project as a team then they can just say
hey in order to work on this website
this is a list of things that I need and
our list is pretty thin right now just
gulp but that's basically what it is now
another thing that it did is as you can
see it downloaded and created this right
here node modules so usually whenever
you're making a website you're going to
have a bunch of these modules and the
one that we can see is gulp and again a
node module is just like a new kind of
tool that you can use to help you
develop websites so we can see been
which is pretty much this information
and gulp which is what we're going to
learn in this is for real series so
again we created a basic file and then
we installed gulp which added is the
dependency in our information file and
actually installed all of the source
code for gulp as we can see it right
there so now that all the hard stuff is
taken care of let's go ahead and
actually set up our website since I mean
we are web developers that's kind of the
point of what we're trying to do so you
can set up your website however you want
gulp doesn't require you have a certain
structure but just for this tutorial
series I'm going to set up a really
basic structure so I'm going to click on
my root directory and I'm going to make
a new folder called app and I'm also
going to make another directory called
dist for distribution so the way I'm
going to do this is I'm gonna make a
bunch of files like I'll show you guys a
bunch of examples like how to convert s
CSS or less to plain old CSS and how you
can I don't know maybe have JavaScript
and how you can minimize it or minify it
so it makes your website load a little
bit faster basically any of the source
code that I write in the story of series
is going to go an app now whenever I run
it through gulp or any special tool the
results or the final
they are going to go in dist so all of
these files right here are going to be
automatically generated and we are going
to be writing the files inside app so
that's how I'm going to set it up now
just so I can organize this a little bit
better
inside app I just want to make a new
directory called CSS and while I
probably need a home page so index.html
always a good idea to have a home page
and one other thing I want to do is I
want to create a new directory called s
CSS so again the s CSS is if you guys
aren't really familiar with s CSS or
sass then don't really worry about it um
you guys are going to be able to follow
along anyways but I'm going to be
writing it in here it's going to be
converted into CSS here and then we'll
go ahead and minify it don't do that and
put it in dist so again I'm just setting
up a basic website now that we got my
structure taken care of I want to do one
more thing and that is right-click your
root directory and hit new javascript
file now this is actually really
important name this one gulp file is and
it already has that J's extension and AH
right so in order to use gulp what you
do is you actually need to give it a
bunch of commands or instructions so all
of the instructions that we give it are
going to be inside this file right here
so that's what we're going to be doing
in the next video actually learning
finally how to tell gulp what to do it's
going to be awesome I'll see you guys
then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
