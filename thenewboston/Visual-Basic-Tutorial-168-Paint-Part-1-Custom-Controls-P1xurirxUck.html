slash on live camera for the New Boston
and in this tutorial we're gonna start
working on a paint program similar to
paint that comes on Windows where you
can draw and start painting stuff out on
the screen now this project is directly
taken from a book called beginning
Microsoft Visual Basic 2008 by Thea Ron
I think that's right Willis and Brian
Newsome I just wanted to give them
credit for this because it's a very good
program to learn from and it's very
object oriented so you can create this
whole program without even adding a
single line of code to your form one
class it's all done by using custom user
controls and other classes so just keep
in mind that I didn't make this project
myself but I'm gonna be explaining it to
you guys and teaching you guys how to do
it so we'll create a new project will
select a windows forms application and
we'll just call it paint and also
combine paint YouTube
cuz I'm pretty sure I've got another
copy of a paint program similar so go
ahead and click OK and wait for that to
load so here's our form 1 and what we
want to do is we'll right-click on paint
YouTube and let's add a user control now
what our user control is is it's pretty
much a way for you to build your own
user control so you can take a part of a
window and you can add buttons and
anything you'd like to it and it's
pre-made for you so you can add that to
your different forms so let's say you
want to have something that's used a lot
throughout your program and you don't
have to copy and paste those buttons and
rename them every time you can create a
custom user control and add the stuff
you need and then just put that control
into it so the name for this one is
going to be paint canvas so this is
gonna be our paint canvas control that
we're going to be painting to
so let's go ahead and come over here and
let's set the back color to white
because when you're painting you want to
be painting on something white so now
all we need to do is we need to add this
control to our form 1 dot V B now in
order for us to do that first we're
gonna have to come over here to paint
YouTube right click and build it so now
that it's built let's come over here to
form 1 dot V B so now we can use our
paint canvas control we'll come over
here to our tool box and it will
minimize how two common controls and you
can see here that we got paint you tube
components and we've created this paint
canvas item right here so we can go
ahead and drag this on to our form 1 and
you can see that's a little big and it
doesn't fit inside so what we can do is
we can change the dock of this so we'll
come over here to dock and it will click
the middle button to fill the whole form
so now our whole form will be filled
with the paint canvas and we can resize
the form all we want and the paint
canvas canvas will still cover the whole
thing so it will set the text form 1 to
paint VB so that I'll just make it look
a little bit better ok so now that we've
created our custom paint canvas control
and our and we've added it to our form 1
let's come over here to paint YouTube
and let's add another class so let me
shrink this down some here we'll select
a class and we'll just call it graphics
item so we'll wait for graphics item to
load and let's go ahead and zoom in ok
so we want to make this class must
inherit so we'll use the public key word
I only use public and then the keyword
must inherit so that means that
basically when a developer wants to use
this graphics item class they cannot
directly make an object of graphics
item it forces them to use a different
class that inherits from graphics item
so let's say we've got graphics circled
like what we're going to use later on
graphics Urkel inherits from graphics
item so we can create a graphic circle
object but not a graphics item object
because it cannot be used unless it is
inherited by another class so now we
need to add some variables that we can
use in our graphics items class so we'll
just do color so we'll just type public
color as and we'll just do it of type
color and it's an a RGB color which is
alpha red green and blue and Visual
Basic has a whole bunch of colors built
into it that you can use now we'll just
do public is filled as bulan and then
we'll create one more so public
rectangle as rectangle so is filled is
basically basically gonna let us know
later on if the circle is going to be
filled because we're going to be drawing
on our form or our paint canvas with a
whole bunch of circles so we want to
know if those circles are filled or if
they aren't but we can easily change is
filled equal to true or false
to fill in circles or not later on and
public rectangle is just going to be of
type rectangle which has a width and a
height now whenever you draw circles you
have to have a rectangle object so
basically what it does is it takes that
rectangle and then it draws a circle
inside of that rectangle so where all
the edges of the circle are touching the
sides of the square now or rectangle now
this might be a little confusing but you
know start to understand it later on so
let's go ahead and comment this so let's
just do public variables okay so now
that we've started creating the graphics
item class I know I have crammed a lot
into this tutorial custom user controls
we've started creating our graphics item
class with the
Sen Harry keyword so you may don't watch
this over again if you're not quite
grasping everything but if you do and
you're familiar with custom controls or
must inherit or if you just understand
it right off the bat then go ahead and
move on to the next tutorial I'm going
to continue working on this program</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
