in another thing a lot of people look
for when buying a month board is the
features that come with a motherboard
for example as you can see this one has
two USB ports I don't know if you can
see it but just take my word for it it
does another thing people like is it to
come with a firewire port which some
other boards do some don't in they also
look for built-in audio and video now
how can you tell if your motherboard is
comes with these things all you have to
do is look for a plug that's built in it
on your motherboard if it has a firewire
look then it comes with it if it has a
place where you can plug in headphones
or a place where you can put your
monitor in then that means it has built
built-in audio or video so the benefits
of having all these features built-in if
you don't have something built in and
you want then you have to add kind of an
expansion pack well we'll get into that
later but it's just more work than you
don't really need so some people just
want to write with your motherboard and
the last major thing that we need to
make sure when we're buying the
motherboard is the form factor now what
the form factor is is pretty much the
shape of the motherboard this has
nothing to do it all with a like a
performance or anything we just have to
remember what form is because when we
buy a case when we buy our cases we have
to make sure it fits in we can't buy a
motherboard that's three feet wide in
the case that's only six inches wide so
um what I went with today for my boat is
we went with a PCI chips which is the
brand name we went with a micro ATX for
a four-vector our frontside bus is
thousand megahertz which is a pretty
sweet frontside bus and I also got
onboard audio and video which means we
don't need any expansion our audio and
video is built right in so that's very
handy so now that we got our motherboard
picked out and we learn the basics of
choosing
on the board now one point I want to
stress is the main thing where the
motherboard is the compatibility with
other parts therefore what kind of
motherboard to choose is kind of
dependent on the other kind of parts
that you want so make sure that when
choosing the motherboard all your parts
are compatible so now we learn the
basics of choosing the motherboard and
what to look for when buying the
motherboard so I hope you enjoyed this
tutorial I hope you learned something
and again make sure you're watching
these tutorials in hi-def make sure to
subscribe to my channel and I'll see you
next tutorial thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
