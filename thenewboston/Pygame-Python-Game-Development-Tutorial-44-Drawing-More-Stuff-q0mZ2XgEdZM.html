the 44th pygame tutorial video from
centex for the new boston where we left
off we were shown how to just draw
pixels and now I want to show you guys
how you can draw all kinds of other
things so we've got a pixel I'll leave
it there for now and now we can do other
things so we can do lines so to do a
line it will be PI game dot draw dot and
what do we want to draw we want to draw
a line so draw a line and a lot of stuff
kind of works very similarly to each
other so hopefully you can get to the
point where you don't need to like check
the documentation anymore for like what
order things going but I understand it
can get confusing but for the most part
it's always pi gonna draw outline where
do we want to draw it well we want to
draw it to game display and then what
color do we want that line will make
that line red and then you specify the
start point so that's a tuple the end
point another tuple and then you can
specify with so we've got game display
red and then now let's just make up a
start point so our start point could be
200 300 so X 200 y 300 and then our end
point another tuple could be 500 700 and
then finally width how many pixels why
do we want it well we can make a 5
pixels wide so let's go ahead and save
and run that see what we got so here we
have our line okay nice red line
beautiful beautiful close that ok and
what did we do by the way we specify a
number that was bigger than our screen
so let's do this 500 500 one more time
beautiful beautiful so nice nice line
can you imagine drawing that like one
pixel at a time no okay so we've got a
line now
we're gonna draw a circle so pretty
similar again PI n dot draw dot circle
and this one is a slightly different but
the first to start the same where do we
want to draw it game display what color
do we want to draw it red when do we
want it now okay so here this one's a
little different
you're going to specify basically the
where do you want the center of the
circle to be then you've got the radius
of the circle and then you've got um
with so and that's like of the line so
anyway let's just go ahead and draw real
quick so circle and then we're going to
say 5050 and then we'll say the wit um
five okay so let's go ahead and run that
real quick so there's our little circle
okay so fifteen fifty now uh what if we
said um a hundred so it's a hundred wide
so now you've got basically a big son
okay so again 5050 is just the center of
our circle so we could say instead two
hundred two hundred now hopefully fit on
the screen
nice so now we've got a big ball here
and looks like it's gonna roll that our
line so we've got that um so that's a
circle now there's a couple other things
that we can do and we're going to do a
rectangle next we've already done
rectangles but it's good for a refresher
pie game got draw rect
and then again where we want it game
display what color do we want it marine
and this one is the top left and then
width and height so green comma and then
we want this to be 150 a 150 200 and 100
so 150 150 top-left 200 wide 100 tall
and that's basically all we're going to
put in there and it's green so let's go
ahead and save and run that there she is
right on top nice
now finally uh let's draw a polygon so
polygon is a slightly more complex but
you can draw any polygon so how do we do
that so first of all uh the starting is
as usual very similar you've got high
gain draw dot palms polygons
and then where do we want to draw it
game display I make some space here game
display what color do we want oh okay
I'm what we done yeah we've got green
I'll do a white white um
game is play white and then basically
you specify all of the points and then
it's going to connect them all so for
example we could do in it's all points
in a tuple of tuples okay
so let's just do a we'll say one forty
and five and then what have I done here
hold on hold on I'll have it all right
whatever we put too many tuples is just
it's just confusing so we have something
like this it can be confusing pretty
quick but it's a tuple full of tuples
and I think our parentheses are just
fine but you can always check your
parentheses by holding shift then you
know close the parentheses and make sure
everything is highlighted that should be
highlighted and then you know you're
you're off to a good start
so one forty-five and then we'll do two
hundred sixteen and then we'll do a
eighty eight 3d 333 so let's go ahead
and run that real quick and see if we
got that okay so again we only put we
put three coordinates so it made the
three coordinates and then connected
them all and filled them so we can close
out of this close close close um and
then let's add some more here let's do a
602 to two and then five five five two
two two somehow that I'm trying to make
it over there we go
so depending on the order that you put
things in it'll basically connects the
dots all the time so as you can see this
is all one object but we've got a few
like this is a complete like overlap as
it was drawn like I almost like it got
folded over so keep that in mind that
you can actually you can do that
depending on the order that you draw
things in so we've covered up all of our
other stuff but you can see here that we
now we understand we can draw pixel
circles rectangles lines and then just
any
polygons we can think of we can try so
um while it's useful to draw sprites or
use sprites it's also extremely useful
to not have to have a sprite and you
can't really accelerate sprites like you
can accelerate graphics wise drawing
onto the screen so anyway that's gonna
be it for drawing all this stuff and
then basically in this tutorial this
coming up game we're going to be using
drawing a lot more than we use sprites
and you know to an extent sprites are
really useful and you can easily convert
the game that we're about to make and
use some sprites so the game we're gonna
make is gonna be like a tank game so you
can have a tank sprite you can have you
know bullet sprite or whatever a shell
sprite you can have sort of an explosion
sprite someone can make that animation
you can bring it in
but we're not going to do that we're
going to try to use a lot of drawing
there are some things that we might use
a sprite for as we go but for the most
part we're going to try and draw all
this stuff so you can get kind of
comfortable with drawing multiple
objects over them and moving them as one
so anyways that's what you have to look
forward to again please make sure that
you have the old snake script that's
basically what we're going to start with
in the next video it's going to be the
old script that we left off with we're
going to cut a lot of stuff out of it
but then we're going to use it so we
don't have to waste a lot of time
rebuilding basically the same sort of
logic that goes around the game so
anyway with that that's it for this stay
tuned to the next video and thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
