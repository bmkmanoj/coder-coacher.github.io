48th you decades oral and in this turtle
all I'm going to be doing is I'm going
to be going through some of the more
common actions in kismet because check
it out if we go ahead and right click
and try to add a new action let me just
scroll through one of these assign
controller actor factory IX mitv
activate what the heck is set scout
control see a lot of those can get kind
of confusing and you really don't have
any idea because they aren't really
described very well just from the title
of them so what I want to do is I want
to go over some of the more basic ones
and give you guys a really good
foundation of working with kismet and
then whenever you're looking for
something really specific you can get
kind of a better idea of where to look
and how it works but for now I'm not
going to be going every over every
single action and event why I'm going to
be giving you guys a really nice
foundation to work with so let me go
ahead and tell you guys what's going on
I moved back to this map remember this
old map where you just go ahead and hit
that switch and turn on the light well
that's the map i'm going to be working
with because it's a really simple system
a trigger and something that happens
it's a really simple example where i can
demonstrate some of the more basic
features of kismet so first of all let
me clean this up by deleting the sound
and might as well just go ahead and
delete these by holding alt and clicking
and now if i hold ctrl and alt and then
control to move that around so now what
we have is a trigger that light switch
and the lights that can turn on whenever
I hit this and off whenever I hit this
so the very first action I'm going to be
adding is something called a delay now
use this a ton whenever you're making
games so are in order to use this just
go ahead and right-click new action and
it's actually under miscellaneous and
it's called a delay now delay works
exactly like you would think but there's
a couple weird tricks that I got these
you guys about first of all whenever you
have a delay I guess might as well tell
you guys what the delay is for those of
you guys who just need a definition
delay is
much a pause or a time period where you
have to wait in your game so by default
if you just go ahead and touch that
trigger and start your delay it's going
to wait one second by default it already
has a second plug in there but we can
change it if we want and whenever it's
finished waiting a second it's going to
go ahead and turn your lights on now
like I said by default it's at one
second but whenever you're watching this
video one second may be hard to kind of
determine so let's go ahead and change
it to three seconds so let me go ahead
and X out of this and I'm just going to
hit play from here and now check it out
whenever I hit my switch it's going to
count one two three and then my lights
are going to come on so that's all a
delay is so we're saying are a weird of
those weird things that you need to
teach me well first of all it has some
other settings here besides start and
finish you also have a stop now whenever
you want something to happen for you
know a period of three seconds you can
also program something to interrupt that
for example if you ever played a
world-walker after something and you
know you had the skin animal and it took
like three seconds or if you wrkn during
a spell before you use that you know
getting all that power together and it
took three seconds but when you're in
the middle of it some monster came in
you know through apple at you you're
spelled cancel out well whenever
whatever you were doing is stopped then
it would it not go to finish because the
delay never finish that would actually
go to aborted so you say alright if you
back away from the light switch then
this would stop and you know this would
abort so you could do whatever you want
then pause is of course positively you
know that means so you already know what
finishing the border means finish means
the delay and it's successfully or
boarded means something happen where
ended early in this duration right here
like I said you have the option of
adding a delay right in the properties
window right here but you also have the
option of adding a variable now remember
anything on the bottom of these actions
are variables and what blue means you
see that this one's a pink triangle this
one's blue this one
pink and these are red blue means float
now you just kind of got to memorize
these but if you go ahead and add a new
variable and a float a flow is pretty
much a number with decimal points on it
so we can go ahead and give a duration
this way by just adding you know
five-point oh and now your delay is five
points so again you can do this either
in the properties window or by adding a
variable and by the way a variable is
just extra information that your action
needs so I was actually planning on
covering something called a gate in this
tutorial but I don't even know if I'm
going to have time for that now so now
that you guys are pro with the delay
pretty much a timer in the UDK you're
ready to move on to my next tutorial so
thank you guys for watching and I'll see
you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
