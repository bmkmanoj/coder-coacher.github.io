have a game for you people on a rundown
using my you could probably guess it
Barrett 50 cal and i'm using my basic
setup of slut sleight of hand stopping
power and steady aim in this video i am
going to be talking about rundown and
something and something else that when i
actually get to it i am just going to
talk about it for probably about 20
seconds and until then ah let's talk
about rundown rundown is actually is
probably my second favorite map to is my
second fit is probably my second overall
favorite map it's only second to favela
which favela i'd say is probably the
best map for every game type at least
all the ones that i play at being
searched domination demolition team
deathmatch just because it's such a
likeable map and of the only problem
that this map has is that when you're
playing on domination usually if your
team doesn't have if you're on the
seaside or you're on this seaside if
you're not if you're on the sea side of
the map usually it's usually not going
to do very good or usually you have in a
disadvantage only because the map or
just your that side is so much bigger
and open and the side has haha this size
just has a big building on it which is
actually an incredible it's actually
probably one of my favorite
just points that you can get to just on
this map okay and remember that thing I
said that I was going to talk about once
I got into it I'm going to talk about it
now um as anybody besides me ever
noticed that if you pick up a gun if
somebody else is gone you do better with
it then if you were just trying to use
it yourself like you see right here with
me I picked up this dude's tar-21 with
FMJ it's a great gun absolutely amazing
gun uh but when i try to use it myself I
either suck or don't do this at all
don't do anything anywhere near this
great or not great but really good with
it at all is there any particular reason
with that if anybody repeat
excuse me I'm smoke um if anybody has
any experience like uh if that's ever
happened to them if if anybody's else
actually ever realized it leave a
comment because i'm actually pretty
curious to see what happens or if this
is just me there's something that I've
noticed or if it's just something that
in general happens to people i play the
call of duty bad company whatever
shooting game you guys want to play or
what you would play and um okay I'm
gonna go back to talking about run down
now run down is as I said before my
second favorite map in the game the only
problem with it is if you're on the sea
side of it you're either gonna get
sniped a lot or you're either using a
submachine club class too rough so you
could run around and crap like that um
and this or on this map luckily for me
I'm on the a side which I have an entire
view of where B would be which is that
bridge right where I'm killing where I
just killed this guy wow I just killed
that guy and in this game or no not in
this game on this map um that would be
the only good thing or that be one of
the better things if you are on the a
side and on the beat if you're on the
seaside you better hope that nobody's
sniping or if they just snapping that
sniper sucks unfortunately for these
people I am NOT a second
I know what I'm doing 25 kills with the
the tar-21 so I want to talk about
tar-21 tar-21 so wait out that what is
it just me or did I just go right
through that guy trying the knife in
whatever anyway tar-21 I'd say is
probably is most likely okay trying to
figure out a way so I don't get a bunch
of hate comments what I'm saying is one
of the best sniper or one of the best
assault rifles until the ACR but i'd say
the ACRs probably is definitely the best
until is either the best or one of our
the best until the ak-47 tar-21 has
little little too almost no recoil most
of the time what happens is like unless
it has a silencer that it's got a lot of
recoil and I mean a lot a lot of recoil
that is the only gun in this entire game
or only assault rifle that I would not
use a silencer on just for the sake that
you can't shoot accurately at all with
it I just don't know why it's probably
the most inaccurate assault rifle but it
does a lot of damage bullet to bullet
and if you don't know what that means
that means uh it takes more bullets /
takes less bullets per kill than most of
the other assault rifles to kill like it
probably takes three or five or
something something like that if not
more less if you have FM and less f yet
if you have FMJ no excuse me sorry
coughed spray you saw rifles in this
game um local air thankfully are pretty
balanced except for probably the f2000
maybe the FAL a FAL kind of sucks I
don't even know what I was trying to you
right there submachine guns UMP is
definitely the best or Uzi or mp5k all
the rest of them suck except for the p90
pinay ed unfortunately new weapon at
least in Call of Duty for it was a new
one
and in m16 probably the best wet is
probably the best burst fire gun in
eville for the call of duty games okay
wait I just want to show you guys this
excellent watch this retarded pneus just
watch just watch this RPG right here I'm
not mad because it was actually a really
good RPG kill but I'm still mad because
I died okay um f2000 is too much recoil
the FAL that trigger-happy is a
trigger-happy weapon um but I probably
say that most of the other assault
rifles are at least are pretty good and
here's the game would he kill right
there nice drag scope to for the win for
the win
and slow motion no sorry I do that Kyle</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
