and in this tutorial I'm going to be
talking to you guys about PHP and forms
now this is one of the most important
parts of PHP and its backbone for a lot
of applications so if you watch any
tutorial this is going to be one of the
main ones that you want to do now there
are two types of different ways PHP can
use to get information from your forms
one of the ways is called git and the
other is called post in this tutorial
I'm going to be teaching you how to use
the post so to do this we're just going
to have to first make a simple website
because of course if you want to output
our forms on the screen then we're going
to need the simple HTML code so let's go
ahead and create our body we don't
really need a header right now and just
a simple basic website now inside the
body the first the first thing we want
to create is a form
now the first value we're going to give
it is the action value now what this
does is it tells the website alright
whatever we type into the action value
is a script that we want to test and our
script is going to be in tester page dot
PHP as you can see we are already got to
test or page PHP but we didn't write
anything in it yet we're just telling
page P all right when it comes time to
submit the form we want you to run the
script on tester page and if you don't
put anything in here then it will look
for the script on the same page but for
now we want to do it on tester page and
the next is the method we want to use
remember when I told you about getting
post right now we want to say all right
we want to use the method that it post
and I'll tell you about it later
but that's not important for now and I
like just uh in my form right now
actually
I forgot to end my
having typed HTML in a while but let's
just end my forum right now so I won't
have to worry about it later
so now we have a forum saying our a
whatever we type in here we want you to
type in tester page and we want to use
the method post which is the only one
we're learning right now now we got to
give this some kind of input so let's
first of all make an area where we can
write our name and if you're not
familiar with XHTML then pay attention
to do this you write the word input and
what this does is give it one of those
blank empty text boxes we'll actually to
do that type type text this means a
blank empty box that you can type stuff
in there's also check boxes buttons
drop-down lists but text means blank
empty boxes you'll see later
next we want to give this a name and
what the name is is the variable name
that we're going to be testing later so
to make this simple I'm just going to
name mine name
so right now we have a form with an
empty text box in it that we're going to
be able just submit stuff in so let me
go ahead and just show you guys what
this is going to look like oh that must
be because I voted in earlier but what
this does is a name which is right here
and our input which is this just let you
guys know
next once we submit all our information
right here we don't have any way of
submitting it so what we're going to
need to do is add a submit button and to
do that it's simple enough just type in
input type equals submit and this will
give you a submit button for your form
right there now once you see once you
type in a name and submit it nothing
happens why because on our tester page
we just have a blank page that doesn't
give any actions or directions or
anything so just to recap right here
here's what we did we made a form and
our in a website and we said all right
whenever we submit it go to tester page
and perform the task we tell you to
as you see tester page has no task yet
so that's why it's blank right here
we're going to use the variables post
and we gave you one variable so far so
whenever you submit this it's going to
make a variable called name and it's
going to go to tester page and that's
what we're going to be doing in the next
tutorial just didn't want to make this
one too long so thank you for watching
and if you want to find out how to use
our tester page and you better watch my
next tutorial thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
