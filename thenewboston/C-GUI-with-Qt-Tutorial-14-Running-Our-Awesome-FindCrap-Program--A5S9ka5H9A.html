video or at least I think it's the 14th
video who freaking cares what number it
is the important part is in this
tutorial what we're going to do is we're
going to learn how to create that text
file and also how to load it into our
program because it's a little tricky
loading in so the first thing that we
actually need to do is create a text
file so go to my website the New Boston
org and won't work with any other
website go ahead and you know what some
my videos you know maybe follow me on
Twitter
and once you're done with that go ahead
and hop over to my About section and
there's a bunch of useless boring text
on here please don't read it it's
incredibly boring what we are interested
in doing is selecting a couple
paragraphs just steal all this content
for my website and now once we have a
bunch of content copied go ahead and
open notepad plus plus and paste it in
now I actually forgot what was the name
of that text file so in CPP crap about
Bucky dot text what a freaking beautiful
name so now if I go ahead and save this
as it might as well just save it on your
desktop it's probably the easiest
location crap about Bucky text save
check it out easy enough we now have a
very simple text file stored on our
desktop they say desktop like a freaking
Boston Koch aaja but anyways we now can
verify that because we have a little
text document on our desktop looking
pretty good so now that we have that
what we need to do is of course load it
into our project so we can do something
useful with it so open up Q again and in
order to load files into your project so
that you can use them go ahead and
select file new file oh got freaking
phlegm in my throat new file or project
cute-cute resource file and choose this
now it says just get a name of it and
guys this doesn't need to be the name of
your file that's not what it's asking
for just go ahead and type fine crap or
you can actually type anything you want
in there hit next and the rest of
everything should be set up by default
the correct path in what project do we
want to add it to make sure you're
adding it to the project that you want
to add it to of course and select finish
and it says oh because I added it before
in my freakin
second let me do this yes to all the
reason that it's saying that it
shouldn't say to you is because I
actually added this before and I
recorded this tutorial and then I found
out that my microphone was on mute so
now I have to do it again so that's why
it's saying that I have to overwrite it
but you guys shouldn't have to overwrite
it so basically what you need to do
first is you need to change the prefix
so if you go ahead and select this file
or it should take you here by default in
the prefix section right here click add
add prefixes and hit the forward slash
just like that so that's going to be our
prefix so now what we need to do is we
need to actually add the file so go
ahead and add add files and it was on
the desktop and where was it crap about
Bucky and again that says um we pretty
much want to copy it to our resource
folder because that's where we need it
to work on it so just hit copy right
there and it says choose copy location
this should be set up by default hit
save
we're good to go now if you click on
this your resource files you now see
that crap about Bucky text is now
successfully loaded into our program so
now that I think everything is loaded
let me see if there's anything else I
need to do hmm
you know what I think that's it right
there so now if we go ahead and build
and run our program come on baby come on
all right it looks like it's working so
far now let me go ahead and what's a
common word to Teo
all right go ahead and search for this
and hit go and hopefully oh yeah check
it out
and I know this even for me just looking
at it right now it's really difficult
for me to see so I'd imagine on YouTube
it's going to be extremely difficult but
the to right here is actually
highlighted now if you go ahead and hit
go again
it should highlight the next two which
is right here hit it again this one
again
right here and you can keep cycling
through it until it gets to the end and
once it gets to the end your programs
can complete you can go ahead X out of
it clap your hands there's the first
kind of useful program that we created
so again I keep seeing again a lot when
it's like the first time I'm saying
something but there you have it how to
create a very simple program GUI program
in queue so in the next couple of
tutorials I think what I'm going to do
is eventually get into more advanced
programs and I like to teach um instead
of just giving you guys the basics
pouring knowledge I want to teach
example by example maybe teach graphics
animation maybe get into a game
eventually but I'm not you know
guaranteeing anything anyways thank you
guys for watching hopefully you enjoyed
that lib demonstration and if you have
any questions about anything or you want
the source code go ahead and ask me on
my forum tnb forum comm and I'll be
happy to answer for you there oh and one
more thing before I let you guys go
don't forget to follow me on Twitter
Google+ and yeah I'll see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
