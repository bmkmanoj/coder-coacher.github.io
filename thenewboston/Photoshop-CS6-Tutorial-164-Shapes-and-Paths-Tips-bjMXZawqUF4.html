in Photoshop cs6 about how to create
shapes as paths so this is a really easy
and Photoshop does most of the work for
you go to your custom shape tool and
make sure this section here is on shape
and go ahead and select any custom shape
that you want I'll select this parrot
and draw it out maybe that's maybe
that's more like a hawk instead of a
parrot and I've got this silhouette
shape that shows up at my layers panel
if i go to my paths panel photoshop has
also made a path for me as well if i go
to my direct selection tool and then
click on it you can see that there's
points and there is a path that's made
and you can adjust anything you want on
it so i can make them beat look goofy
like that or something like that so now
it's like I don't know some goofy
looking but that was the basically just
the quick tip I just wanted to show you
that you can create a path out of a
custom shape so you can import like a
shape into Photoshop and just draw out
the shape in here instead of actually
drawing a path around it it's just
really helpful and quick so this will
help increase your speed and efficiency
and clients always love someone who is
fast and efficient so thanks for
watching this quick tip and hopefully
you guys can use it and one year's
upcoming projects so see you guys later
have a good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
