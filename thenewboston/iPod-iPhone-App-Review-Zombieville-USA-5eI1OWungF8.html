another app review and this app is
called zombieville and it's actually a
little game and it's not one of my
favorites but i got a request to do it
so i'm going to review it so start out
said zombieville USA why says USA I'm
not sure there must be a different
versions on me bill but this is the only
one that I ever saw so go ahead and
click new game and I'm always a survivor
since that's the first one but i can
meet a clam this time since you know as
well go with a new character and what
you need to do in this game is pretty
much just kill a ton of zombies go from
level from level and just kill them up
so your red button is you gonna right
here and you can walk with a little
arrows and you can also beat them with a
club using the dream button and you can
see at the top of your screen that
they're your health is in see numbers
can you screw it see your health is yeah
that's embarrassing I died already and
didn't even have time to explain but
your health is in top left and your
money is in the right and let me see if
I can change the difficulty in this type
of talk and play at the same time so new
game I'll be a survivor in the goal like
I said it's pretty much to get to the
end of the lily let's go ahead and shoot
these guys beat him with a club and
another cool thing is you can go in
these houses in every house and just do
it by getting close to it and tapping on
the door every house has a little
something inside that one had bullets
and this is your bullets up here and
again like I said this is your money so
I got nine dollars so I'm rolling in
cash right now and that's pretty much it
to exit just go ahead and wait though he
passes just jump out start beating them
with the club like that and this is
pretty much what you do over and over
and like I said it's not that easy
name and it's also really not that fun a
lot of people like this game but I don't
because I mean there's not really a
whole lot to it so that's why I'm going
to go ahead and personally rate this
game a 6 out of 10 is because you know
for some reason I don't like it there it
isn't really complex not very strategic
it's pretty much the same thing over and
over again so i would not recommend
getting this game i think it costs here
cost of 99 cents or 199 and in my
opinion it would just be a waste of
money so go buy some gumballs or
somethings that but uh like I said not
one of my favorite games and a overall
review a 6 out of 10 so thank you guys

long as general suck as bad as this game
