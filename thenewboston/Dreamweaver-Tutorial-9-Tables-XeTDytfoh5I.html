Dreamweaver tutorial and in this
tutorial I'm gonna be going over one of
the most important things that we can
learn in a website development for
beginners and that's the use of tables
now before we could use tables the
layout of our website was kind of crappy
and we can only do a limited number of
things with it but tables give us a
whole new way that we can lay out our
website so to do this I'm just gonna go
ahead and explain how to insert a table
first to insert a table you want to go
up to insert and who would have guessed
it go to table now when you open it you
see a bunch of stuff that you don't
really know what it does what rows in
the table are are the area that go left
to right so the more rows you have the
higher from top to bottom that your
table is gonna be the columns of course
go up the down or top the bottom so the
more columns you have the wider your
table is gonna be so we'll just leave
this at three rows in two columns for
right now
and the table width is the width it is
in pixels but we can change that very
easy later now if we never been familiar
with these terms cell padding and cell
spacing what cell padding is is how much
space is between the content and side
and side aveer cells which is each part
of the table
and the outside of that border so if you
have a lot of self spacing then there's
going to be a lot of space between the
words or images and that sides of your
cell
now what self spacing is is how much
space is between each individual cell so
for the most part you're just gonna want
to leave these just like default just
like this so once you have that all set
you can just go ahead and click OK and
as you can see we have a table made with
three rows left to right in two columns
that go up and down and as you can see
it's 200 pixels wide so as you can see
you can insert text in the table and you
can format it a lot easier you can get a
lot better layout then you could without
a table
now one thing that you're gonna want to
do first of all is resize your table
this is small and it doesn't really do a
lot so to resize your table do this as
you hover over a side you see a little
cursor that has two ear arrows pointing
left there right when you click down and
drag it
you can adjust the width of your table
this way you can also use the same
technique to just any column sizes in a
row sizes in your table and you can use
this if say if you had a bigger picture
in this row you can move this down to
make more space for the picture another
thing that you can do is change the
number of rows and columns as you can
see right here if you made a table with
3 rows into columns and you decided that
re I have this content right here but
now I want another row so what do I have
to delete this whole table and make
another row no it's a lot easier than
that
go like you were resizing and just
simply click on the edge as you see you
now have a black border around your
table this means that your table is
selected as a whole now if you go down
here you can change the rows and column
numbers without messing up any of the
data they already made so see we have
three rows right now if you want for
just simply type it to 4 and now our
table has 4 rows and you didn't mess up
any of the data and you can do the same
with the columns just remember select
your whole table first and then you can
go ahead and just the columns
and one last thing that I think is
probably the most useful thing you guys
are probably gonna want this in the
center of your page this whole table so
go ahead and select the whole table like
we did before and as you see right
aligned right down here we have in the
line and by default your browser aligns
it to the left hand side of your site I
always align mine right to the center
and as you can see this has a nice
uniform same even spacing on the right
hand side and on the left hand side and
it's not all bunched up to the left hand
side so that's how you can align your
table to make it nice in the center of
your website just remember select the
whole table go down and click a line you
can also align it to the right or to the
left which is the same thing is the
fault
so now that we know the basics of how to
insert a table and how to use it in the
next subject we're gonna be going over
some other awesome things that you can
do at the table and if you're on youtube
