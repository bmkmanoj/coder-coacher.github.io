illustration to toriel my name is buddy
Blackford today we're gonna learn how to
use the shape builder tool and the shape
builder tool is pretty cool because it
allows you to create more complex
objects by merging and erasing the more
simple objects so I was able to create
this peanut shape here out of two
circles and you can see that it is one
whole path and it's all merged together
so that's pretty cool now you can select
edges and different regions of the
object and those can be merged or erased
to form a new object so I'm going to
show you how to do that I'm going to
delete this out let's go ahead and
create two circles all right now I've
got two circles and I'm just gonna line
these up using my snap to guides here
and bring it up here alright now I've
got these merge or now I've got these
overlapping each other here now if you
got a if you want to use the shape
builder tool you have to select the
objects that you want to merge together
so go ahead and do that make sure both
your circles are selected then come over
here to the shape builder tool and
that's this it's got two circles and
then an arrow pointer there click on
that the hotkey is shift M and all you
need to do is click and drag through the
sections that you want to merge together
and it will merge them for you it's
really easy to do and all we did was
used a couple shapes and only took a
couple seconds I'm gonna go back real
quick I'm going to show you a couple
more things that you can do with this
now if you go ahead and you just click
on a section now you know you're in the
section because it has this like grayish
background that comes in if you go ahead
and click on a section it's going to
extract or basically like break that
region off from the shape so I'm going
to click on this section here and I go
back to my selection tool and go ahead
and click on it and you can see now that
it's just that shape and if I go to the
shape
there we go so it pretty much just broke
out that little section of the shape
there added in these extra paths and
this path wasn't here before
and made these two extra shapes so keep
that in mind when you're trying to
create some shapes together let's go
back to the shape builder tool another
thing that you can do is delete out
sections or paths if you want to if you
hold down alt you're gonna cursors going
to turn to have a negative minus sign on
it and you can go on top of either
sections here if I click there it's
going to delete that section out or I
can delete some paths so I can delete
that path out and then delete this path
out now if I go to use this section you
can see that when you start deleting
things it doesn't create a whole one
single path you'll have to separate if
that's your goal you want to have two
separate things and you want to use the
delete but if you want to have one
merged path then you're gonna want to
use the the actual merging where you
click and drag alright now let's go over
a little bit about the the options on
this sheet builder tool so we can
understand the tool a little better go
ahead and double click on it you'll get
the shape builder options the first
thing we have is gap detection and
that's gonna detect and show the gap
between the objects so when you have
this selected it's going to be off by
default you get if you have it selected
you're able to change the gap length and
small medium large or you can do custom
and you want to get this as close as you
can to what the actual gap is for
illustrator to be able to detect it the
next thing we got is our options and
there's a couple of different ones here
not everything's really crazy or not
everything's really that important but
the first thing we've got is consider
open filled paths
as closed if you select that you create
an invisible edge for an open path to
make a region the second one we got
merged in merge mode clicking stroke
splits the path so if you select this
you split the parent path into two the
first edge you click specifies the split
location and I was showing you that when
I was going to when I was clicking the
paths earlier we've got pick color from
color swatches if you want or you can
use artwork and artwork is just
something else that you've made or your
color swatches are going to be up in the
top up here so we have also got a cursor
swatch preview if you want to add that
on and that's going to be able to let
you preview and select colors and down
here we've got highlight so if you have
feel selected it's gonna highlight the
merged area in gray so when I had my
mouse in over in the section here in the
whole section turned gray with that gray
background that's what that means and I
suggest that you have that on so you
know where you're in but if you're
working with something that's already
gray and it's not working right then
it's not I mean you might not want to
have it on it depends on your project
you're working on highlight stroke when
editable so when I was holding down alt
and I wanted to delete these lines that
were in the center they turned this
color light red and that's what that
means you got this little information
bubble here that hold all two trim lines
and stuff like that
and a little bit more information but
that's it and if you want to set it back
to the defaults just click on reset and
everything is back to the defaults and
hit OK to make your changes so that's it
for the shape builder tool I like to
thank you for watching now you know a
little bit more you can create more
advanced shapes than just a peanut you
can take if you wanted to you can take
maybe something like a rounded rectangle
tool we can increase the stroke on it
and then if we take our circles here
I'll show you
oh I accidentally double clicked it put
that around here let's make this smaller
do something like this I need to make
this way smaller I'm trying to make a
cloud all right we got those I'll select
these both I'll increase the stroke a
little bit so it looks a bit more and
then go ahead with our merge tool we'll
select everything and our shape builder
tool I mean and we can start deleting
stuff out
delete these oops we're getting some
crazy artifacting in here that we don't
want I can go in and try to delete these
out so we've got some artifact in here
that we don't want looks like they might
be behind or something like that trying
to figure it out but as you can see
we've got some sort of we've got a path
here and I've made what is starting to
become somewhat of a like a cloud or
something like that it's not the
greatest but you under if you can
understand you can just make a bunch of
different shapes so thank you for
watching this tutorial I look forward to
you guys in the next tutorial watching
it and if you liked it go ahead and
click the like button thanks a lot
everybody and have a good day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
