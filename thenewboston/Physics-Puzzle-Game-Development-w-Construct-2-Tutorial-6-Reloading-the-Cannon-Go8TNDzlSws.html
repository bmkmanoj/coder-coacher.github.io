video the first thing I want to do is I
want to give the functionality to reload
the cannon because right now we just
shoot at once as you can see and that's
all of the bullets that we get we can't
click we can't shoot ever again so
eventually what's going to happen is we
want to say whenever that meatball is
destroyed whether it goes off the screen
or a block falls on it or the turn is
over whenever that bullet gets destroyed
and what we want to do is we want to
pretty much reload the cannon so in the
event sheet what we can do is we can
just add an event and we'll choose
meatball and we're yet destroyed I'll
just search for it on destroyed so
basically whenever the meatball is
destroyed then what do we want to do
well the first thing we need to do is we
need to change this variable they say
variable variable back to zero so it's
at one whenever you fire it but as soon
as it destroys or turns over set it back
to zero so in or do that of course
system global variable set value and set
it back to zero pretty easy and the only
other thing that I want to do is
remember right now we have our camera
zoomed out but whenever were working
with the game the camera is going to be
moving around and eventually it's going
to end up here because that's where our
meatball ended up whenever it could got
shot out however whenever we reload I
want to scroll back to the Canon right
here right where it was by when we first
started so in order to do that on on
this event right here whenever it's
destroyed let's go ahead and add another
action in that system and I'm just gonna
take this scroll to object and the
object that we want to scroll to is the
Canon and hit done so basically whenever
our meatball is assured in the turn is
over then reload that's what this line
saying and go back so the camera focuses
on
the cannon pretty much how you started
so let me just go ahead and play this
right now and even though we won't see
the camera movement we can see that
whenever the meatball goes off the
screen and this destroyed we can now
shoot it again pretty frickin sweet so
now what we can do is actually start
adding those blocks and I'm actually
gonna do in the next tutorial because I
want to add the blocks and I also want
to work on the physics for the blocks
and I'll show you guys how um well a
couple other things that we can do with
the tower but for now it was a short
video but then guys for watching I'll
see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
