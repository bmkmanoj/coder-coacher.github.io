basic terminology what I want to do now
is I want to give you guys a brief
overview of how the internet works now
the internet at the heart is just a
bunch of websites that a bunch of people
can go to right I mean of course it's a
little bit more complicated than that
but this is basically the very basics of
how the internet works and how
everything is connected so say that you
wanted to make a website a nice web
developer oh you know we'll put him
right here we have a goofy face because
web developers usually have crazy hair
and you know stupid face like that well
this guy is a web developer and he makes
a website using some cool program on his
PC well of course there are a bunch of
other pcs around the world your friend
your grandma who lives in you know
Mexico on some dude over in Europe and
some chick over and you know Australia
and you want you want all of these
people to view the website that's on
your PC right here but even though
everything is really connected by wires
going to the internet here's the
internet right here somewhere in here
they can't get to your PC right here why
is that well it would be insecure your
operating system doesn't allow just any
stranger like these guys to access your
PC and view the website that you made
all right
so how on earth can these people see
your website well in order for these
users all around the world to see your
website you need to store on a special
computer called a server so this is a
server right here and we'll get into the
details of a server later on but
basically what it is and I know you know
this isn't like the formal definition
but think of it like a special computer
that is accessible to many users now
whenever you know a server like Google
server that is world wide accessible to
everyone you also can have a server in
your home so if this was a home network
then you know maybe these pcs would be
your brother your sister your mom your
dad and you can all have the same
server for maybe you want to share files
or maybe on this is a school each PC
would be you know a different teacher's
room and you guys can all share you know
the students you know grades or
something like that but basically that's
what a server is it's a special computer
that many different users can access now
of course whenever we're talking about
the Internet in the world wide web then
your server is accessible not just to a
small group of people but to the entire
world and we call that a web server so
right that a web server is a special
server that anyone in the world can
access so whenever you build a website
you actually don't store the web files
on your PC you actually have to store
them on a web server and if you're like
all right
do I go to Best Buy and get a web server
where the heck well usually need to get
through a company online or you know um
type in like web server or web hosting
and they're a bunch of different like
GoDaddy's is probably the most popular
one unfortunately don't really like that
company but another thing I want to
mention is that web servers they usually
have lots of memory and why is this well
like say Go Daddy's web server for
example all of these people might want
to make a website and store it on their
server and also if you think of like
amazon.com a lot of users in the world
are going to access that web server so
it's going to have a lot of memory and
also a lot of power so like Amazon's web
server it's more than just a special
computer it's a really powerful computer
and it has a crapload of memory so
basically that's what a web server is
and that's how the internet works very
basic and if you don't understand the
details of a web server then trust me in
the next two videos is going to become
crystal clear</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
