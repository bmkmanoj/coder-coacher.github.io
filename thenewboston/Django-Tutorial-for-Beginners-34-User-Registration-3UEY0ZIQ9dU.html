video I am going to show you how to let
users register for your site
or create a new account and also log in
now before we get to the code I need to
talk to you about a couple core concepts
first of all as you know Django already
comes with the ability to create users
and we know that because we already
created in admin now if you played
around in your admin panel and click
users you're going to see that this is
your information right here so you have
a user name email address first name
last name and we don't have to fill
these out we just left them blank and
also the staff status and again if you
click it you can see that here's your
password that is hashed and it's
important to note that whenever Django
sorts passwords they're not raw text so
that's actually good for our hackers
whenever they you know hack your
database they don't get anyone's
password and a bunch of these fields
right there so we can just go ahead and
you know make the forms like we did
before but what you always want to do is
you want to make these in kind of a
different way now I say that because
whenever I have a website and I want
users to sign up I really don't care
about their first name or last name or
maybe there is some other thing that you
want them to fill in on maybe like their
relationship status if you're making a
dating site so whenever you talk about
user authentication or registration you
always want to handle it manually so I'm
going to show you guys the best way to
do that so let's close that all these
got my cheeseburgers for as tutorial all
right so the first thing we're going to
do is this in your musics app go ahead
and right click and you're going to make
a new Python file and name it forms so
you know like before let me show you
guys is this whenever we wanted to
create let's say a new album we just
said alright we're going to use this
model album so went over here and it
generated a new form based on this model
well that's essentially what we're going
to do with the users however since we
want to tweak it a little bit for
example we don't need it an input
for first name and last name because we
don't care about those we're pretty much
going to inherit from users and
overwrite whatever we want to or add
whatever fields we want to so informs
that py what we're going to do is say
from jingo contributing port user
alright so this is going to give us the
base user class just a generic user
class that we can use so after this what
we want to do is say from jingo import
forms alright so what we're going to do
now is we're going to make a new user
form class and that's going to tweak it
to whatever we want to display on the
form so class user form and this is just
going to inherit from forms model forms
so again whenever I talk to you guys
about model classes model forms all
you're doing right here is you're going
to make a blueprint that's going to be
used whenever you're making the forms so
the first thing we're going to do is
we're just going to make a new class
meta did I talk to you guys about class
meta it's basically information about
your class sounds kind of weird but
there you go
so the base model is going to be user in
other words whenever a user creates or
signs up for your site it's just going
to go in the same table right here so
we're not creating anything you know
brand new we're just saying what
information we need out of them so for
the fields what we wanted to do is we
just want to say what fields do we want
to appear on the form so what I'm going
to request is they pick a user name
their email address and also their
password we can leave all the rest of
the stuff out so can username email and
password now up here we actually need to
specify the password in all right so the
password is going to be equal to forms
dot character field now if we just leave
this like this
then it's just going to be plain text in
other words whenever the user tries to
type in their password it's not going to
give you those actresses is going to
give you just you know text like this so
then anyone peeping over their shoulder
can see what their password is so how do
we specify that this is actually a
password field and you need to actually
hide those characters or just go ahead
and write widget forms dot password
input so now whenever we display this
form what's going to appear on the page
for the user is area to pick a username
right there email and also their
password so now over infuse now that we
have our blueprint of how we want the
form to be laid out taken care of I'm
actually going to show you guys how to
do a bunch of cool stuff in this video
what I'm going to do is not only
whenever they register it creates an
account and pops our information into
this database but I'm also going to show
you guys how to have them log in
automatically in that way you know on
every page you can say hey Bucky or
whatever custom information you want
specific to them
and aside from logging in I'm also going
to show you guys
after you submit the form it redirects
you to I'll just redirect them to the
home page but you may want to redirect
them to I don't know like their profile
page their newsfeed whatever so we need
to import a bunch of stuff so from jingo
shortcuts we want to import to render
and also redirect so this redirect
module is going to redirect them to
whatever page you want after they log in
and I also want to save from jingo
contributes and login so again this
authenticate what this module is going
to do is is pretty much going to take a
username and a password and it's going
to verify that they are indeed a user in
the existing database in this login it
just attaches a session ID so then no
matter what page you're on you don't
have to like authenticate them every
time and they don't have to login every
page it just gives them my ID that they
can
use while they're browsing the site and
you know a railer session ID so now
stick this after this all right so from
jingo views generic import view
and the last thing is we actually need
to import this forms file that we just
created so from forms that's the file
name one in what did we name it
use your form user form looking
