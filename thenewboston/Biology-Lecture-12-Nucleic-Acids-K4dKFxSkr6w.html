to your twelfth biology tutorial and in
this tutorial I want to talk to you guys
about nucleic acid pretty freakin sweet
so nucleic acid is actually really
important in your body and I say that
it's important because first of all
without it you'd be dead so you know
it's kind of important i guess and i
know i keep saying your body but the
fact is that nucleic acid actually
exists in every single living thing on
earth
so nucleic acid is made up of these
smaller things because you know in
biology we like to break it down into
smaller stuff until our brain explodes
nucleic acid is made up of these smaller
things called nucleotides if you're
saying oh thanks Bucky now I understand
it and just kidding what the heck is a
nucleotide well a nucleotide is made up
of three ingredients and once we
understand these ingredients we
basically can understand what a nucleic
acid is made up of so the first
ingredient is a nitrogenous base and
whenever someone says a nitrogenous base
it basically means a base that contains
a nitrogen why they don't just say that
it's because biologists they like to
sound smart and come up with you know
these fancy terms for everything so
nitrogenous base the second is a sugar
and the sugar has to contain five carbon
molecules so I'll just put with five
carbon molecules in the third ingredient
is just a phosphate group
and that's it those are three
ingredients that you need whenever you
make a nucleotide so I know that you
know all this stuff is kind of going off
to the right and down so let me go ahead
and summarize this at the bottom real
quick first you take three ingredients
in with those three ingredients you make
something called a nucleotide and when
you have enough nucleotides you can go
ahead and combine them together to make
something called nucleic acid and this
is the important thing in your body
that's what your body frickin loves so
now what I want to do is I want to talk
to you guys about one specific nucleic
acid that I'm willing to bet that you
guys probably heard before a little
thingy called d-n-a now DNA actually
stands for deoxyribonucleic acid so
that's where all the you know letters
come from and DNA is actually made up of
two strands of nucleotides so let me go
ahead and if you ever seen a picture DNA
which I'm really guessing that you
probably have you notice that it kind of
looks like a twisted ladder and if you
ever take that ladder and untwist it
that's what I'm trying to draw right now
even though I may not be the best artist
on earth so right here we have your you
know untwisted ladder and DNA like I
said is made up of two strands of
nucleotides one right here in one right
here now the different parts of the
nucleotide we already know but where
exactly are they on the DNA molecule
well the sides of your DNA is actually
two of the ingredients these are your
sugars and phosphate group
so that leaves us with the rung of the
DNA and of course the rungs remember do
you remember that third ingredient I'll
let you guys think about it yep it's
then uh well it's a nitrogenous base
I'll just go ahead and write that
nitrogenous base so basically we can see
that DNA is made up of nucleotides which
is made up of the three ingredients a
nitrogenous base sugars and a phosphate
group and whenever you combine them all
of course you get this special type of
nucleic acid called d and a pretty
freakin sweet huh so in the next
tutorial what I want to do actually
thought I was going to have time in this
tutorial but I want to talk to you guys
about genes and a bunch of different
stuff so you know instead of telling you
guys what I'm going to talk about in the
next tutorial
just watch the next tutorial and you'll
see but for now thank you guys for
watching don't forget subscribe and I'll
see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
