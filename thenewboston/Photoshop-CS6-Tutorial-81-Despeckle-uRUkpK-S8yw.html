Blackford here with another Photoshop
cs6 tutorial and in this tutorial I'm
going to go over the D speckle filter
now the D speckle filter is a little bit
different but it's then uh some other
filters in the fact that you can't
adjust anything in it so pretty much I'm
going to be telling you what it what it
does and you may have to apply it
several times to get a decent looking
effect it is a very subtle effect so
let's go ahead and start with the day
speckle filter so what I'm going to do
I'm just going to duplicate my layer
just so I don't work on the original
background layer let's go to filter and
if we come down to noise it's under D
speckle right here and I'm going to
point out that to the right of the word
D speckle you don't have the dot dot dot
there that means that it doesn't have
any options for you to adjust so I'm
just going to click on it and you'll see
that it added a some blurriness to the
layer now I'm going to turn it on and
turn it off so you can see what it looks
like compared to uh ceiba to what it
looks like when it's not on so here is
on and here is off now there definitely
is a blurriness you can definitely see
it mostly in the skin tones and if you
look up here on the ceiling you can see
it in the ceiling a little bit but like
I said before the effect is really
subtle so you may have to add it several
times now what the D speckle filter does
is it looks in like shifts in contrast
or brightness and tries to preserve the
edges of those shifts and brightness so
for example look at the arm here where
there is a black shirt and then pretty
much a really bright skin tone there
and what the digital is going to try to
do is keep this edge intact while
blurring the middle part here where the
edge isn't so keep that in mind when
you're using this filter so I'm going to
add it again by just going up here it's
going to add it again and if you notice
that the ctrl F is the hotkey for just
using your last filter with its settings
again so use it again and now what I'm
going to do is come up into my history
layer I'm going to go to my actually I
don't even need to do that I can just
turn on the I on and off so here you go
you can see how there has been more blur
applied and probably too much in this so
I probably only need to do it twice so
let's go up here let's go back to here
so I went up to the history panel and I
went back one 1d speckle so I took away
one of them and here we go and here
we've got blurred in a little bit more
of a blurred image so that is how d
speckle works so pretty much use it when
you're trying to do inaccurate blurring
of your image while still preserving the
detail in the image so keep using de
speckle if you would like and then I'm
going to go over the opposite of the
speckle in the next tutorial which is
under I'll come up here to it filter
white oh that's off that's why filter
and if we go to noise dust and scratches
is the opposite and I'll be going over
that in another tutorial
so let's look forward to that one in and
I'll just end this one I forgot how to
end this one correctly again it seems to
be something that happens sometimes when
you're doing these you just forget what
to say sometimes but thanks a lot for
watching this one I'll see you guys in
the next tutorial see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
