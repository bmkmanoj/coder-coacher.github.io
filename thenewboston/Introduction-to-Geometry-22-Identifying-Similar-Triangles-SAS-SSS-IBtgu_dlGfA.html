to identify similar triangles which are
side angle side and side side side so
side angle side is when you have two
pairs of corresponding sides that are in
proportion and the included angles are
congruent side side side is when you
have three pairs of corresponding sides
in proportion so now we're going to do
some examples with these two properties
so tell whether triangles are similar by
side angle side or side side side well
for this first one we don't know that
any angles are congruent so it can't be
side angle side so in order to do side
side side we're going to put each one of
the little triangles sides over the big
triangle to see if they're all in
proportion so 2 / 8 is equal to 2 / 8 if
we cross multiply you get 16 equals 16
so yes those are in proportion and since
the other ones are also to a rate we
know that all that each one of these
sides is in proportion with this side
and if you want to know what the rate of
it is it's one-fourth because this side
is one-fourth of this side
so for the next one we have these two
triangles you know that this is a right
angle this is a ranting goal and we have
these two site links so since this is a
right angle its measure is 90 degrees so
that means that we're going to call this
angle a and this angle D so we know that
angle a is congruent to angle D so
that's the a for this part so now we're
going to put these we're going to put
the little triangle over the big
triangle and set it equal to the little
triangle over the big triangle so then
we're going to cross multiply and you
get 72 is equal to 72 so there so those
sides are proportional so therefore
these triangles are similar by side
angle side we have one more example we
have these two triangles right here and
we know the length of these sides so
first we're going to check and see if
these are proportional so we're going to
put this side over this side and this
side over this side so 2 / 6 is that
equal to 2 / 6 and yes those two sides
are proportional so there's no property
that's just sides side but if you
remember our special angles these angles
right here are vertical angles and
vertical angles are always congruent so
we'll call this j and this angle k so
since
angle j &amp;amp; angle k are vertical angles
angle j is congruent to angle k so now
we can say that these therefore
triangles are congruent excuse me not
congruent triangles are similar by side
angle side so now that we know the
properties of similar triangles and how
to prove that they are similar triangles
make sure you come and watch the next
lesson where we're going to talk about
perimeter and similar triangles</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
