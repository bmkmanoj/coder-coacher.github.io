here with another Photoshop cs6 tutorial
today we're gonna go over creating a
custom shape now creating a custom shape
is really easy actually all you need to
do is pretty much just lay down your
shapes into one layer and click on the
edit custom or define custom shape
button so I'll show you how to do that
in this tutorial should be pretty quick
so go ahead and go to your any of your
shapes and go ahead and try to make
something so I'm just gonna take the
line tool and I'm gonna draw some lines
if you hold shift while you're going to
draw another line you can add to the
current layer so I'll just do this and
just make like a kind of like a
starburst kind of pattern oops that's
not that one wasn't in there so I got
that something like that so nice you can
move them around with your selection
tool if you need to like if I need to
get this right to the middle so there's
my custom shape that I want to save and
all you have to do is make sure your
layer is selected go to edit go to
define custom shape and we'll call this
line star I'll hit OK know if I go to my
custom shapes down here and custom shape
tool open up this we're gonna have the
line star here that I just made and I
can drag that out and there it is super
easy now you can easily just define your
custom shapes and create them so that's
all so if you guys want to go ahead and
make some cool custom shapes and go
ahead and post them and the Bucky's room
forum under the Photoshop section it
would be awesome to get some more posts
in there I'll bring up a link real quick
so here we go we got Lucky's room org
slash forum and if you scroll down to
the Adobe section we've got our
Photoshop section where you can see I've
tried to help someone out I'm one of
these and I
I'll answer any of your questions that
you have on these and I try to look at
the YouTube videos but there's so so
many of them that's just easier to go
into the forum and answer them there for
you so thanks a lot for watching
everybody hopefully you guys can make
some really sweet shapes and share them
with the rest of us have a good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
