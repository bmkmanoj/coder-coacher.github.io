is is it's a list of objects that we
want saved in our store so just a list
of users if you want to make another one
call it a reducer movies then you can
have a list of movies in there if you
want to have another one called a
reducer music then you could have a list
of your favorite songs in there whatever
so a reducer is basically just a piece
of data that you want saved in your
store now one other thing I want to
mention before we actually toss this
into the store is this remember I said
that your store is one big JavaScript
object one big JavaScript object so if
we have a list of users and we have a
list of movies and we have a list of our
favorite songs
that's three objects now the store we
can only pass in one object so before we
take all these reducers and just toss
them in our store we actually need to
combine them into one big object first
so in your reducers directory right here
go ahead and make a new javascript file
and just name it index now this is a
file that I always have no matter what
type of data I'm using in my application
and what you can do is you can actually
call a function called combined reducers
and this is a built-in function and what
this does is it's function that allows
you to pretty much take all of your
reducers and combine them into one
object that's it so how do you use this
imports combine reducers from three
ducks now from here you just need to
import this file so whenever we import
this file by default it imports this
function in other words our list of
users all right so what I'm going to do
is I'm just going to state in for user
reducer from and it's in the same
directory so I'll just write dot forward
slash reducer users
now since this is the default import
you're pretty much importing this and
storing it in a variable called user
reducer all right so now I'm just going
to go ahead and make constant called all
reducers and this is going to be the
main object that's going to be thrown
inside our store so again anytime you
make another reducer just remember to
add it to all reducers and again this is
just equal to the combined reducers
function and all this function does is
it takes each of these reducers as an
object now here is the thing whatever
you name your object that's how you're
going to refer to it in your application
so I'm going to say users and set this
equal to user reducer so now all
throughout my entire application in all
my components in all my containers I'm
going to have a piece of data named
users now this object is equal to this
bit of data right here I can actually
change the name of this to anything I
want but since it's equal to users I
thought it was kind of appropriate and
then again you can make another function
called reducer movies or whatever you
want to name it and then you can have
something like movies equals movies
reducers and then you have more data
available throughout your entire
application but there you go so this is
how you can take all your reducers all
your different bits or chunks of data
and combine them into one big object so
now with this object we just need to go
ahead and throw in our create store and
it creates a react storage from all of
your objects pretty cool huh
and of course we need to import this so
import all reducers too lazy like this
I'm just going to copy from reducers
and since it's the index then I'll grab
that by default so there we go so again
just to recap one last time right here
we created our main store our main
application storage which is the huge
JavaScript object that's responsible for
storing all of our applications data now
right now we just made a small piece of
data to stick in there and this is just
a list of users but whenever we make
another one we have to pretty much throw
them inside this function combined
reducers and that takes all of your
little bits of data and combines it into
one big JavaScript object that we can
throw in to create our main store for
our entire application so there we go
and in the next video I'm going to be
showing you guys how to take this store
and pass it to your components so that's
what we have to look forward to I'll see
you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
