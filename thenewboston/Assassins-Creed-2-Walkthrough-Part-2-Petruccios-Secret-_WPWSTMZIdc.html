tutorial or walkthrough force essence
group 2 in this tutorial is for the
memory called petruchio's secret I think
that's a name petruchio's not real good
with Italian but I do try so you know
you're gonna have to suffer with that
but anyways this memory is pretty much
you this little boy he wants a bunch of
feathers for some reason and why I don't
know whenever you ask him he's like it's
a secret Ezio something whatever so the
easiest way to do this is go ahead and
get this first one closest to you first
and you want to try to stay on the
rooftops as much as possible so go ahead
and go over to this little tightrope
thing and this will keep you on the
rooftops it's pretty much the only way
to get over there
and from here you see in your mini-map
you get two feathers - left and right go
to the right and then as you run along
this you're gonna get well you're just
gonna naturally come across both of the
feathers oh I almost fell off there so
let's go ahead and get this one first
and as you can see the time allowance
it's I mean it's not even going to come
close it's a huge time allowance so
again keep running along the rooftop and
you automatically come against the other
feather right there so you know the only
problem of this it's a little too easy
so now that we got all four there says
art return the feathers do petruchio you
know that's all I say so go ahead and do
a little leap of faith and now go ahead
and run back if you wanna beat these
people have to go ahead but I don't
think I'm gonna this time make sure you
don't run into them by accident because
sometimes if you run in them go into
them by accident you actually steal
their money and then they're gonna call
the guards and you know whole bunch
problems so go ahead and knock on your
door for some reason this little
kikuchiyo got into your house so you
know giving these feathers
let me thanks youth and look really I
just got you all those feathers you
gotta get some little
Oh anyways um that's pretty much it so
now you got that mission complete and a
little pop ups gonna appear feather the
locations unlock and now you can begin
right there says feathers unlock
feathers can now be collected throughout
the world
you can now pretty much begin collecting
feathers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
