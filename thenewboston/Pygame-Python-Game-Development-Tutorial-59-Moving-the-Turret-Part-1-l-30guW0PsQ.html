the 59th high gain tutorial video in
this video what we're talking about is
how we can actually let the user move
the turret so we have our tank function
we have possible turrets here and then
here we were just drawing all of the
turrets so let's go ahead and get rid of
all but one of these lines like that and
then we're gonna add another third
parameter to the tank function and
that's just going to be comma and then
tur buzz so trip pits or a turret
position and this is going to pass
through the position in this turret list
which one we want to use so we'll pass
that through the function and that's
going to be contingent on what the user
like what button the prep the user
presses so we'll take turbos and then
when we go to draw that's this right
here we've got possible turrets and then
instead of just saying the zeroeth
element we actually want to say whatever
the turf pose is whatever the position
of the turret that we say that's where
we want to draw it so once you've got
that now we need to actually define like
the turret position and all that so
we'll come down to our game loop and
right here what we need to do is we need
to add a couple of new variables and the
first one will be current turbos so like
what's the current turret position and
then we're gonna add change sir and
that's gonna be as well as zero and this
is gonna be kind of like tank move right
it basically is gonna operate under the
same premise that tank move does
basically every time the user presses a
key we modify this variable to be
something and then every frame per
second we are plus equaling so we're
kind of combining changed her in the
turret position so once you've defined
those two now we're ready to come down
into our game loop here and this is
obviously the game over so we're gonna
come here
and we're looking at key down so
currently we've got elif event key
equals PI data key up and K down these
are what we're going to use to let the
user control the turret so if it is key
oh well we probably want to move the
turret up right that only makes sense so
what we're gonna say is change tur is
and make sure that was right yeah
changed over zero so it's changed her
equals one and then if K down then we're
gonna say changed her equals negative
one and that's it for our keys since we
had already kind of written those but we
do want to also want to modify this one
as well so we've got K up K down and so
you say here we can take we can
basically do something pretty similar to
this line that we did for moving the
tank so for example otherwise you know
changed her is gonna remain and it's
always gonna keep moving we want to be
able to like let the user lift up on the
key and stop the turret from moving so
we're just gonna say if event dot key
equals PI game dot and then we're gonna
ask K underscore up or event dot key
equals PI game dot K underscore down :
if that's the case and that either those
two keys have been released then changed
her should eat wool now zero so we want
this to stop moving then once we've done
that what we only need to do now is we
come down basically do this tank
function and remember we added that new
turbos variable so that's going to be
current tur pose that we want to pass
through but before we pass that through
we want to go ahead and have current tur
pose plus equals change tur now this is
going to give us a slight problem you'll
see in a moment but it the functionality
is there but we do have to cover for
something so I'll show you that in a
second but let's play make sure we did
everything right so we can move the
turret up and down that's cool
and then obviously we can later on we're
gonna fire will probably fire with the
space key and we're also gonna have
a like power right the strength of the
shot since that's in most tank games
even though I don't really think someone
might correct me as well but I don't
think that tanks actually have like a
power of their cannon like they can't
like really adjust like how strong the
fire is but I might be wrong but anyway
so that's that but we have a slight
problem and that is the following so I'm
going to move our game over here and
then I'll move the console there so what
happens though when we go to high well
we get a list index out of range because
we don't actually have like this is
gonna keep adding one while we're
holding up right and it's gonna do the
same thing when we go down we're gonna
get another error for that as well let
me close out of this so that was up and
then with down you'll find that you'll
get something as well so you hold down
and you'll see it popped back once but
if you keep holding down you'll get list
index out of range
so obviously it's no good that this kind
of error is going to result in a game
crash hanging like on the user and we
obviously don't want to have to be
happening so that's what we're gonna
cover partly in the next video and the
wall so probably do a couple other
things in the next video since the fix
for that it's not too bad clear up some
white space there so anyways that's it
for this video hopefully you guys
enjoyed as always thanks for watching
stay tuned to this video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
