welcome to my third walkthrough of left
4 dead 2 and this is a the streets level
still and let me go ahead and grab this
pipe bomb right here it's definitely
going to come and let a handy later play
poems are always better than bio bombs
in my opinion so what you need to do is
go ahead and walk around here and bless
these two people and then go ahead and
climb up these stairs and I just heard a
charger right there so Oh what fabulous
time to reload right as my teammates are
getting pummeled so let's go ahead and
walk up here and and yeah he didn't need
those legs anyways trust me and then go
ahead up these stairs and go to the end
of this and you see the gun shop and
first I here which and there she is
should I shoot her huh yeah I proper
should so heroically bullets in there by
the way if you don't disturb her which
she won't borrow that bother you and
she'll actually try to kill you if you
are shooting not the best idea but it's
the more entertaining idea so as I was
saying what we do is we need to get into
the gun shop and talk to the guy and
he's going to clear a path for us so
let's go ahead and kill these zombies
and the cool thing about this gun shop
is once you get in so let's go ahead and
open the store you can access to any gun
you want all the ammo on the laser
sights health pack right there so
there's your laser sight right there and
I'm going to go ahead and talk to the
gun owner right now as I'm upgrading my
laser sight in some of the guns right
now I already got the one I want the
most this is my favorite gun actually
but I am going to get some ammo
straight we get your shit and you'll
help us get so he pretty much says in
case you couldn't hear him because his
volume is kind of low is that he is
stuck on the roof and he wants coke and
that's what he says coke and so I
thought you wanted like you know some
cocaine but it's actually coca-cola or
actually Cola he wants I don't know if
you can say coca-cola in this game so
what you need to do is you need to go
get his coca-cola and he wants you to
bring it to him and in return for giving
him his soda he's going to blow a big
old tanker truck up that is blocking
your way the next part of the mission so
you give him his coke he blows up a big
truck for you everyone wins so as soon
as you go in a store the alarm goes off
because you know it's obviously one of
the main things are concerned about
rubbing this store because look at all
the goods on the shelves yeah so
obviously they spent all their money on
the environment not the goods and what I
like to do is I like to show right here
at the opening especially with a shotgun
and just glass pretty much everyone that
comes in since it's our only way in so
this is probably best spot to be right
now but again don't forget when you get
an opening go ahead back and grab your
coke and like last this guy
and again like I said when you get a
opening go run around and grab her coke
and what you need to do is you actually
need to walk around that grass in order
to get back to the guy again so let me
blast those people in head and make sure
don't step in that stuff and I really
wish out one of my teammates would just
grab the coke but they didn't and you
can actually bash people with it with a
show button but that's it for this
walkthrough thank you guys for watching
it don't forget subscribe and I will see
you guys next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
