max tutorial and in this tutorial I'm
going to be teaching you well all this
other stuff means in the material
options editor right here and also I'm
going to be going over maps a little bit
so let's go ahead and create a sphere
first of all I just create it then I'm
just going to move it and drag it up
above the plane right there and let's go
ahead and add some material to this so
go ahead and bring up your material
editor by pressing M on your keyboard
and your material editor will pop up now
let's go over the rest of these
parameters are here we went over pretty
much everything above the shader basic
parameters what a shader is is it pretty
much um each of these shaders is an
algorithm to give a different appearance
Blin is default and I'm not really going
to be going over the other one these
right now because they're kind of
confusing and we don't really need to
for anything so just stick with Blin for
now the wire right here is just an
appearance of your preview if you can
look up here the wire two-sided means
you can see the front and back of it um
faceted if you uncheck these it's like a
little texture kinda but just leave all
of those unchecked pretty much you don't
want to touch this ever but I had to
tell you what it was but what you do
want to concentrate on is the Blin basic
parameters um these are the colors the
main colors just an ambient diffuse and
specular you can also lock them some
once you change one color right here if
everything is locked together you change
them all at once so that pretty much is
what that does self illumination is um
if you want the object to illuminate
itself and what this does is pretty much
get rid of all the shadows so if you
change it to yellow or something you see
that all the shadows are gone shadows
before not anymore but uh we'll be
working on that later I leave it
unchecked for now the opacity of an
object is just that so if we go ahead
and let's go ahead and make enough
object and I'll show you the opacity
create like a box or something behind it
change it to green or something and if I
change the opacity actually let me move
this a little bit let me move this so
it's right about there now I can show
you the opacity if I change the opacity
of the sphere it's going to be able to
see through to the box so go ahead and
take this opacity slider and slide it
down to like 50 somewhere around 50 then
go ahead and render it out by pressing
this button to render production and now
you can see that my box and my arms fear
isn't lined up at all and that's because
this view wasn't selected which is
embarrassing
so now let's render that again and I
didn't apply that so there we go one
last time show me the money right there
no way me so whenever you lower the
opacity you need just the lower to your
desired opacity then of course apply to
your object by clicking there dragging
or pressing this which I didn't do last
time that I wasn't showing up and then
when you render it out BAM look at that
opacity is pretty much see-through so
now let's go ahead and raise that to
opacity 100 so it's totally opaque and
apply it again and now I can talk about
actually get rid of this cube too and
now I can talk about the specular
highlights the specular highlights are
pretty much the braces the britainís or
the shininess of your object so
everything is pretty much set pretty low
by default so let me go ahead and talk
you guys through what each one of these
means the specular level is how bright
something is so let's go ahead and raise
this a little bit and as you can see the
hotspots on it are getting brighter and
brighter so now we have a little bit of
shine right here the glossiness actually
let's go ahead and blow that out totally
the glossiness is how big that is so if
we narrowed it right here you can see
it's only a little pinpoint or only a
little bit of shine
if we took it and dragged it out like
this we'd have a big old glare on it
like that
so again the intensity the size and
soften is you probably don't want to use
this a lot
it pretty much spreads the highlight um
uh it pretty much has to do with putting
the highlight across the area that you
define a glossing is so again forget
ever say that don't ever touch solvent
unless I tell you to and I didn't tell
you to so now when you render this out
we get a nice little shine on our object
as well so I guess aside from opacity I
guess we can just move to Maps right now
so what a map is like I said before
pretty much something cool like um it's
pretty much like putting a sticker on
your object and making it do something
even like putting a label on it and
actually I'm just going to show you
something real quick with maps real
quick so go ahead and delete this and
let's go ahead and make a plane by
clicking plane in your front view looks
pretty good right there we probably want
to rotate it so click a rotate like that
and then we want to move it using select
and move mover right there so we get
some kind of plane like that now let's
switch views to maximize toggle viewport
and create a sphere right here and
actually don't want that blue that like
pink or something and let's go ahead and
move this up by clicking your left view
or something and moving it not not you
lost this one right here so get
something like this just by creating two
different objects and go to your click
this maximize viewport and go ahead and
bring up your material editor and let's
go ahead and zoom out just a little bit
BAM looking good now I'm going to show
you guys um some real cool map real
quick so in your second um preview go
ahead and click this and you can rename
it if you want I'm not going to go ahead
and expand maps and then in your let's
see reflection map we're going to want
to
like this and we're going to want to
double-click flat mirror and what this
is going to do is give us a mirrored map
now I'm going to make this plane turn
into a mirror and I'm going to reflect
this ball so I'm not going to want blur
so uncheck blur and then I'm also going
to uncheck use environment map because I
don't want to do that and I want to
apply it to faces with ID 1 which is
this so now once we got that map all set
we can go ahead and drag it select that
and drag it on our selected item now you
can see that this ball doesn't reflect
on this plane even though we just told
it to that's because it doesn't show up
till we render and that's just to save
our computer memory from having to work
with every single map in real time so if
you go ahead and render that out we can
see that this ball does indeed to
reflect on this map right here so that's
a I know I guy I went through that real
quick and I didn't really tell you guys
how to use maps but I figured it would
be easier to just show you guys what map
was so that way when I'm talking about
it you guys actually know what I mean
and another cool thing you can do with
map is like I can take a picture of my
face and I can apply it to here instead
of adding a reflection reflection map
but again like I said I just want to
show you guys real quick what maps did
so then when I'm talking about you're
like all right what the heck are you
talking about so in the next tutorial
I'm going to be going over all the stuff
I did with maps and showing you how to
edit them and make them sweet and a lot
better so thank you guys for watching
and don't forget to subscribe and I'll
see you next door</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
