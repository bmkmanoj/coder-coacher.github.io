sixth physics tutorial and in this
lesson I want to talk to guys about a
concept called projectile motion and I
want to do this by giving you guys an
example because I think it'll clearly
push through the concept in your head so
say that you were sitting in a plane and
whenever you did this crazy person who
happened to be let's say he was a
watermelon salesman he opened the door
to the plane as you guys were flying now
he's like freaking out and he's like
you'll pilot if you don't let me drop
this big old watermelon from this plane
then I'm going to freak out by the way
this right here is a watermelon so the
pilots like whoa whoa whoa do whatever
you got to do man just don't hijack my
plane so this plane is moving forward at
10 meters per second now in midair this
crazy person drops the watermelon out of
the plane
now whenever he does that the watermelon
is going to take a path that looks
similar to this right here before it
hits the ground there's the ground so
whenever he does what's going to happen
is this at zero seconds he's going to be
holding onto the watermelon at one
second the watermelon might be somewhere
around here
one second at two seconds the watermelon
might be here and at three seconds the
watermelon would be right around here
three seconds so as you can see there
are a couple forces acting on this
watermelon right here
first of all gravity is pulling the
watermelon downward at a force of 9.8
meters per second squared
so due to just natural gravity of the
earth the watermelon is going to
continue accelerate downward so the
longer it drops for the faster downward
speed it's going to have now aside from
just a downward speed because the
watermelons path isn't just like this
the watermelon has a curved path so
there must be some other force acting on
this and that is the force of projectile
motion not only is it going downward but
it's also going forward as well and
actually this is the thing whenever
you're in a plane and you drop out
something out of the plane or if you're
driving in on the car and you drop a
ball out of the car something that
object is going to continue moving in
the same direction and speed as the
plane so not only will this object
accelerate downward at a speed of at
acceleration of 9.8 meters per second
squared but it will continue forward at
a speed of 10 meters per second so just
remember that it's going to accelerate
downward in other word it's going to
gain speed but the forward motion it's
going to remain at a constant speed so
let's go ahead and take a look at this
graphically we're looking at three
things time and we'll measure time in
seconds now the forward speed I've just
put forward speed is going to remain at
ten meters per second and the downward
speed is going to be accelerating so
this speed is going to be changing so
meters per second meters per second
that's s by the way not a very good
looking one but it's an S all right so
at time zero you're holding on to the
watermelon it isn't moving at all so
therefore it has no speed whatsoever at
time one two and three let's go ahead
and figure out those so at one second
which is this one right here the
watermelon is moving forward at ten
meters per second however it's moving
downward at 9.8 meters per second now
it's second number two right here what's
going to happen is there is no extra
force causing this watermelon to
accelerate so therefore the forward
speed is still going to be ten meters a
second however whenever you have gravity
as a force you have an acceleration so
after two seconds if you remember from
like two tutorials ago it's now going to
have a speed of nineteen point six
meters per second downward now in three
seconds again it's going to be ten
meters a second I don't even know if I
said this but I know that you have
factors such as wind resistance and
maybe a
gust of wind is going to change the
speed but I'm just assuming for this
story we're going to forget about wind
resistance and all that so anyways with
projectile motion if you drop this out
of the plane then you have a forward
speed of 10 meters per second however
due to gravity since gravity causes
objects to accelerate after 3 seconds
this watermelon is going to have a
downward speed of twenty nine point four
meters per second downward so again
that's key to take note of this tutorial
basically the forward speed is never
going to change
but the downward speed is going to
increase and increase and increase due
to basically to the natural phenomenon
of gravity and earth making objects
accelerate the faster and longer they
drop forward so there you go there you
have it
projectile motion projectile motion is
basically two different forces acting on
object the force that makes the object
project forward at a constant speed and
also the force of gravity which is
always bringing things down so anyways
there you have it hopefully you
understand now
in the next tutorial we're probably
going to be covering some more about
projectile motion and looking out how to
calculate some more numbers so thank you
guys for watching don't forget to
subscribe and I'll see you guys in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
