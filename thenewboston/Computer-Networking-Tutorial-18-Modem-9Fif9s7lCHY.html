this video what I want to do is I want
to start talking about the basics of
network hardware now whenever you're
first starting out it can get pretty
overwhelming understanding the
difference between a modem routers
switches servers all of these different
pieces that you need even for a simple
home network so what I want to do like I
said is I'm going to go through each
device piece by piece and I'm going to
break down and explain exactly what it
does and why you need it in your network
now
I actually was going to make these
videos like ok this is a video about
modems tomato tomahto yada yada yada
modem on modem but instead I'm like this
is pretty confusing too so what I'm
going to do is I'm gonna build a really
really simple home network probably the
one that you have in your house if
you're just you know have like a plan
where you watch TV and you know have
basic internet so I'm gonna build a very
simple home network and then you guys
can see the pieces and how they fit in
to the big picture a little bit better
so this cloud right here first of all I
don't know when people started calling
the internet cloud but whenever someone
says like anytime they say the word
cloud it just means internet so don't
let it confuse it I don't know why they
did that it's kind of annoying actually
anyways this blue cloud is just your
internet service provider mine is
actually Time Warner so you build your
home network and then you send it out to
you know the telephone wire the
satellite whoever you have that's just
essentially representing the cloud what
network devices they have we don't know
so we just call it the cloud so
everything else is actually the hardware
in your home alright simple enough now
this video is about this device right
here a modem so the first wire that
comes from the telephone line outside to
your house plugs directly in to the
modem now once it's in the modem let me
just throw everything out here it goes
to your router actually let's use this
one so use a wireless router and what
devices do we want I got all these cool
graphics off of this uh
website so I'm like huh you know might
as well make a little a bunch of little
diagrams all right so let's say that we
have iMac let's see what else I got
right here a cell phone and let's use a
laptop all right so I just moved into my
new apartment and the first thing that I
want to do is I want to get some
internet so I call it my cable company
on Mike hey can he send some dude over
to hook up all my computers you know I
need to get on the internet so they do
he comes over and he starts tinkering
around a telephone pole out front what
he's doing who knows but he ends up
taking a cable from the telephone pole
and running it inside my house so then
believe it or not he gets a call from
his boss they get in this huge fight and
he just quits he's like you know what
eff this job I'll see you later
so I'm looking down at the wire all my
devices still aren't connected to the
internet and Mike hey hey hey dude you
can't just leave right now in the middle
of a job and he's like you know what
Bucky how he knows my name I don't know
probably you know that from the file
he's like Bucky figure it out yourself
so I'm like aw crap um can you at least
give me a hint and he's like yeah it's
easy all you have to do is you need to
buy a modem and you need to buy a router
take this cable that has the internet
right now and plug in your modem and
then from there take a Ethernet cable
plug it into your router and then all
your devices can connect to it so some
can be wired others like your phone can
be wireless and that's how it works I'm
like um all right that sounds pretty
easy well see you later good luck with
your new job all right so now we have to
figure out how the heck this actually
works what type of equipment buy and all
of that fun stuff so the first thing I
do is I start reading up on modems now I
learn that okay whenever you have a home
network we change my color right here ah
blue nice alright so whenever you have
your own home network I can see visually
that it has the pass through a modem to
get to the inter now to say
internets so we can see visually that a
modem is a device that connects your
network to the Internet that's what it
is
now I start reading online and
technically I learn what this does is it
converts digital signals from your
router to analog signals that can be
sent over copper wires or if you write
that down digital to analog so the broad
overview of a modem if you only remember
one thing is it's a device that connects
your network your home network to the
Internet and technically behind the
scenes what does is it converge digital
signals from your router or any device
that goes into it to analog signals in
other words a signal that can be sent
over copper wire in you know into the
cloud so I'm like okay that sounds
pretty easy I start looking online for
modems in turns out there's like a
thousand to choose from what one do I
pick well the first thing I'm going to
do is this before you even go on Newegg
or Amazon or anything like that go to
your ISPs website I have Time Warner but
every you know ISP has them and start
looking for the page that says these are
the modems that have been approved to
use with our service so different
Internet service providers only allow a
specific set of modems and these are all
the ones that I can choose from so again
this is the manufacturer this is just
the model number this is the speed we'll
talk about in a second but basically you
just can't pick any modem online they
need to be approved now another thing is
that I'll show you what I have all right
so I have the ultimate plan but in
different areas they have um you know
faster than this I can only get 50
megabytes per second no matter what so
that means if I choose a modem you know
if I just buy the most expensive one
that can you know handle 300 megabytes
per second it isn't really worth it
because sure my modem is you know
awesome and it can handle all that speed
but if
Internet maxes out at 50 then you know
what's the point so you always want to
buy a modem that either matches or
exceeds because if you you know decide
to upgrade your internet plan later on
then you can always you know bump it up
so again make sure that it's compatible
with your internet service provider and
also make sure that the speed is at
least that of your internet plan so we
say okay we narrowed it down quite a bit
now there's some other couple technical
things and let me pull up a clean now to
be honest whenever you're buying a modem
for the very first time that's probably
all you need to know just look at the
reviews and make sure that you choose
room from the list and it's going to be
compatible with your internet service
provider however if you want to know a
little bit more about them I'll explain
this now the standards that modems used
to communicate it's called duck if I can
write if I'm on my right thing all right
doc sis so like I said these are just
the rules for communication for modems
and every year oh I don't want to say
every year but every so often they come
out with an updated version so one point
there's actually a bunch of different
ones one point X 2.0 most modems are 3.0
right now and I'm sure in the future
that this will get newer and newer as
modems get faster and faster but you
always want to get the latest version
and also this isn't just for best
performance but they're also backwards
compatible so if you're like okay I know
I have a device that works with you know
docsis 2.0 modems if you get 3.0 it's
going to work as well since all of these
are backwards compatible so again get
the latest version to make sure that you
have you know the most updated
technology another thing that you're
going to see are the channels and most
modems well I don't want to say most I
didn't do a study or anything but a lot
of the ones I look at our 4 by 4 or 8 by
4 and again these are channels now the
first number in this means downstream
whenever you're downloading something
and the second number means upstream so
the one that I'm going to be showing you
guys in the future I'm actually
I didn't even know if I told you this
but in the future I'm actually going to
be filming me um setting up an entire
home network and you know talking guys
through how to do it hands-on the one
that I'm going to be using is a 4x4 if
you have a huge family that's on the
internet all the time you might want to
look into getting an 8 by 4 but yeah
either way there you go and just one
other little side note this isn't really
a problem as long as you're choosing one
of the modems from the list on their
website but make sure you get the right
kind for example there are cable modems
if you are you know if you have a cable
internet there's also like DSL modems so
make sure that you know if you have like
Time Warner Cable that you don't buy a
DSL modem but like I said this is pretty
obvious stuff as long as you choose one
from their list then you should be
golden so that's the basics of modems
again if you want to look at this one
last time what they are are pretty much
devices that connect your network to the
Internet all the rest is uh you know fun
little details so there you go thanks
for watching I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
