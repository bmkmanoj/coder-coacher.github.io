tenth java game developments doriel and
in this story we're going to be building
a couple more methods and necessary to
play our animation now let's go ahead
and build a method right now and what
this is going to do is get animations
current scene aka the image and I know I
use the terms image in scene
interchangeably but they are
interchangeable so I mean when I say
scene its image so don't get confused
and I got a itch on my ear so hold on ah
right there oh that felt amazing pretty
gross huh and now let's go ahead and
build this method public synchronized
it's going to return an image and let's
put get image just like that if you want
to name something different go ahead
feel free but now what do we want to do
in here let's first of all put if scenes
dot size equals zero then what do you
want to do if there's nothing in our
ArrayList now let's go ahead and return
a null nice little check and else what
do you want to do if you actually have
something in your scenes well if we
actually have something in there let's
go ahead whoa easy caps lock return get
seen and remember we're going to be
building this method next get seen and
what this get seen is going to do is
take scene index dot pick just like that
so now what do we have else return get
scene and next dot pick what this is
going to do is get your current scene or
the current picture that you're on and
it's going to return that picture of
here so I know that you don't know what
this picture variable is but we're going
to be built in class for that so it's
kind of weird building stuff that you
don't have built already but let's clear
that up for you right now and now
everything is going to start coming
together in this method right here so
private one scene because remember I
told you I'm going to make an inter
class right after this called one Scene
and what this method is going to do is
get the scene
what scene well we're going to be it's
going to get a scene according to the
index so for example let me scroll up
here if there are five pictures in this
array list right here then the second
image is going to be index two or
actually one but that's irrelevant and
what this is going to do when you put
get scene it's simply going to return
the scene so return one scene object
scenes dot get X what the heck to that
stuff come from
so what this is going to redo is return
the element of that array list and ever
saying alright so the only thing that
really is holding me from understanding
all this all and why is this underlined
oh I see so the only thing really that
we're missing is this private inter
class this one scene right here and once
I build this everything is going to make
sense trust me so let's add a comment so
drive it enter class aka scenes are
going to be object and remember I told
you each scene is in essence its own
object so let's go ahead and make
private class and I'm going to name it
one scene so that's why all these are on
the line
and now BAM so we're going to make a
class called one scene so whenever we
create an image it's actually going to
be an object of this class one scene so
we need two different things so let me
sit see if I already made it for you
guys up here yep right here whenever we
created a new scene we had to give it a
picture in the total time so we need to
make sure this class called one scene
has two variables
an image pic a picture and a long end
times a total time that you want that
picture to run so we have two variables
in here what picture do you want is your
object and how long do you want that
picture to stay on the screen for before
moving to the next one so we're only
going to have one method in here and
that's going to be the constructor so
public one scene and for the parameters
let's just use the same parameters image
pic and long end time right there and
again I told you what these did before
Nonie explain them again so let's just
go ahead and set each objects picker
picker each objects pic is equal to the
pic we passed in and each objects and
time is equal to end time so BAM how
easy is that
so in essence let's see if we can walk
you through this all see what we're
going to do we're actually we're going
to be a well I'll walk you through this
guys one last time we made a new class
called animation to pretty much handle
our animations the first thing it does
is of course call it constructor and it
pretty much starts everything new gives
you a brand new animation we now need a
way to add scenes or images to our
animation so we've made this method
called add scene what it does is take
the total time and add it each picture
is going to have a certain amount of
time it needs to run for and when you
add up all those times we get the total
time that our animation should run in
how do we add these pictures to our
ArrayList we use scenes dot this add
method this add method is built-in
method and this is how you add things to
an ArrayList so after this we are the
start method right here starts your
animation from the beginning by setting
everything equal to zero and this
ensures that your animation starts at
the beginning now after this here is how
you change scenes what you do is take
all the movie time is the sum of all the
time that
pass from the last update so it's going
to take how much time pass from the last
update all right add that to the movie
time and if your movie time is greater
than that total time up here then you
want your animation to start over again
so now what this wall does right here is
well we built this get scene later which
I'll explain later
pretty much says all right when do we
want to move to the next scene so let's
go ahead and we're making this a method
right here if we ever need to get our
images again get scene and it pretty
much gets the image based on the index
get scene this is pretty much all based
on this private inner class it gets the
scene based on or gets the picture based
on what index you told it to in your ray
list in this private inner class takes
each image that you give it and gives it
a variable called the pic aka the image
and also the length of time you want it
to run for and it pretty much creates an
object for each picture or scene you
pass into it and again picture scene
image or all the same thing so this
pretty much allows us to convert that
picture to an object every saying all
right why would we even want to create
or convert a picture to object because
then it has like attributes like the
name and the time it runs for and
they're just useful stuff so that's it
for this class we are done with our
animation class in our next tutorial
we're going to be building this Bucky
class right here so it's going to be
awesome
thank you guys for watching uh that's
all I got for you for this tutorial so
again thank you don't forget to
subscribe and I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
