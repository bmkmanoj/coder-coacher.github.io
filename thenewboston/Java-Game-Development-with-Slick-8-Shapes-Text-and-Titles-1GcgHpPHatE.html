game development video and in this video
we're going to learn how to pretty much
add simple stuff to the screen so let's
go ahead and look at our game so far go
ahead and launch this baby and oh my god
this frickin game is awesome it has a
frames per second counter that we didn't
even program ourselves that just came by
default so the part that we programmed
ourself is pretty much this a big black
screen I mean it's not that bad of a
game maybe you can call it empty space
the final frontier or you know before
the Big Bang but you know I think the
audience wants a little more excitement
so check this out
whenever we start our game the default
menu that we told it to pop-up or the
default screen rather is the main menu
so actually whenever we play our game
the very first screen the screen we're
looking at right here is actually the
main menu now currently we don't have
any functionality to get to the play
screen so we'll just go ahead and test
everything out on this main menu right
here so in order to draw stuff on the
main menu like I said in the last
tutorial we need to draw everything in
this render method render basically
means draw now everything gets drawn
with this graphics object which is G now
a graphics object just think of it like
a paintbrush you can paint stuff on your
screen it could paint images shapes text
anything that an artist could paint this
graphics object is like a really cool
artist so or a really cool paintbrush so
now let me show you how to use this
graphics object to draw we'll just do
basic text for now so you use the object
which is G and that object has built-in
methods one of them is draw string which
basically means draw text on the screen
now it takes a couple parameters the
first one is okay you want me to draw
text on the screen what text do you want
me to write and okay what's the name of
our game hand blaster so we'll just say
are you ready
you blast some ham ham again and put
like some of those things are you
freaking ready to bless home ham I'm
getting excited already just thinking
about it okay so that's the text and X&amp;amp;Y
is basically the coordinates and let me
just go ahead and write 5050 great movie
by the way and not there you fool you
need to separate them with a comma 5050
and now let me go ahead and run this
game and check it out I'll just go ahead
and check that so I don't have to do it
again so the reason that I needed to
type 5050 was those are the coordinates
the x and y coordinates our game uses or
java rather uses a coordinate system
that stock starts in the top left corner
positive X is over so this goes this
might be 10 20 30 40 50 and over here
might be like 500 so 50 across and 50
down that's where our text is going to
start so again that's Java's d fart test
ad fart oh man that's so embarrassing
defaults coordinate system so that is
how you draw text on the screen 50 over
50 down and this is the text that you
want to go in that location are you
ready to bless some ham yes I is yes I
is wow I sound like I'm from the Bronx
or something I mean no offense people
from the Bronx but you do say that a lot
so now what we need to do is now that we
know how to draw basic text on the
screen let's go ahead and do something a
little bit more exciting and draw some
shapes so in order to draw shape you use
the exact same object G so G draw rect
and what draw rect means is draw
rectangles
now this has 4 parameters instead of 3
and the first one is what do you want
the x coordinates to be x and y so we'll
say okay how far do you want this over
we'll just say 50 and if you press tab
you can actually Oh what the heck made
me look like a fool okay 50 over and
100 down wow what the heck it usually
does it okay 50 over a hundred down now
the width and height is how wide in how
tall do you want your rectangle to be
well I want this rectangle to be 60
pixels wide and 120 pixels tall I guess
that looks pretty good so actually let
me leave a little comment X Y width
height looks good so now let's go ahead
and run this game and hopefully we get a
rectangle and some text on the screen as
well oh my god are you freaking kidding
me this game is freaking awesome I could
play this all day so here's our text and
here is our rectangle that is 50 across
that's why it lines up in the text 100
down 60 wide and 120 tall pretty frickin
sweet now the last thing I want to show
you guys how to do is how to draw
another shape you know just for fun
because you know sometimes people want
to mix it up a little bit this is like
game 2.0 so I'm just what other shape do
we have gee draw oval I know we have
that one now oval pretty much takes the
same parameters x and y which is the
position and we'll put this over it like
200 130 so it doesn't overlap everything
and the width of this can be 130 as well
and the height well we all make it a
perfect circle we'll say 80 so now if we
go ahead and run this game Oh guys I
like I'm going to have to take a break
because I'm just going to play this for
hours and hours am I ready to blast some
ham heck yes I am we drew oval and this
could be you know the face of the ham
and this is going to be that big helps
that he's going to blast guys this game
is freaking amazing
and one other thing that I want to take
note of you see how I said at the very
beginning that let me see if I could
find it now we made a variable that gets
passed into our constructor and this
code right here basically made the title
on the top of the screen well
here is the screen or the window rather
and there is the title right there so if
we wanted to change that title like hand
blaster 2.0 then we just need to change
it right here then that would get passed
in the constructor and get passed in the
super classes constructor run this baby
and our new title changes so that is how
you draw basic images on your screen now
what I'm going to or excuse me basic
text titles and shapes now in the next
story what I'm going to do is show you
guys how to draw basic images such as
you know if you have a ping or JPEG or
something like that so that's all we
have to look forward to thank you guys
for watching and I'll see you guys in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
