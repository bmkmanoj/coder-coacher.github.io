another Illustrator cs6 tutorial in this
tutorial we're going to be learning
about changing the display view for
illustrator now illustrator uses two
main views preview and outline preview
displays your artwork in color as a pre
as it appears on the screen and that's
the default view that I've got right now
and then you've got outline which
displays your artwork as an outline or
paths so those are the two main views
now outline view it speeds your
redrawing when you're using complex
artwork and it makes things go faster
but you lose all the color so I'm going
to show you how to do this there's a
couple other views that I'm going to
show you and other things in the viewing
options that I want to show you so that
you can use you illustrator correctly
and hopefully now these two views are
essential to illustrator and the fact
that you need to use them when you're
all the time when you're doing stuff the
color is sometimes going to get in your
way and you can't see the outlines
unless you actually hover over them so
if I go to view and I'm gonna fit all
these in the window you can see as I
hover over these the paths are starting
to show now you can't see these in the
preview because that's how that view is
but if you go to outline you'll be able
to see all the paths and it'll be easier
for you to work all right so let's go to
view and right now we're on just the
regular preview now if we check outline
you can see the hotkey is control Y and
you'll want to remember that one now
this is our outline you can see all the
paths that come compose these are
compiled these vectors now over here on
the left you see a square with a big X
through it now that's because this over
here if I go back to my view I'll go
back to preview this is just an image
this isn't actually a vector and it has
no paths so when you have an image it's
just going to show up as a box with an X
that's just so you know here's that line
again now this it makes it easy for you
to edit your paths or whatever you need
to do and you know this in this view
now there's a couple of other things in
outline view that I wanted to tell you
about so if we go back to the preview
section here we can there's a way to
quickly go back and forth without have
an ease or cocky if you don't want to if
we go into the layers panel here and you
hold down control and you click on the I
you're gonna get your outline view and
this is good because it's just going to
do everything that's in that layer now
if I just ctrl click on not that one I
just control click on certain spart well
there's all these are grouped hmm see if
I could find one that's gonna work well
well just for the layer I guess it's
going to change it into outline mode and
if you have other layers in here
underneath these then you're going to be
able to view those separately while
having other parts still in preview so
I'm gonna close this up and the next
thing I want to show you is called show
print tiling go to view and we come here
to show print tiling I click on it it's
going to make like a little outline here
now this basically is an outline of
what's going to be able to print on a
sheet of paper in your document so if I
was to print just print this out right
now if I went to file and print then
only what is in these outlines is going
to actually print out on a sheet of
paper now that's pretty helpful if for
obvious reasons when you're printing
things now there's a couple other views
I'm going to take this off hide print
tiling it changes to hide
and there's a couple other views called
output views and these preview modes
they pretty much display this in
different types of modes or different
previews because of the different way
you're going to output the object so if
you're gonna print it on a high class
printer or if you're gonna do something
else so you're gonna use it on the web
it's going to show you how it's going to
look with those previews so let's go to
our view and then we want to look for
over print preview and click on that and
over print preview mode it's going to
display in ink preview and it's gonna
it's gonna go with a blending in it and
transparency and over printing in there
and you want to use this when you are
trying to print if you go to view pixel
preview this is what its gonna look like
on the web and the pixie preview mode
displays this as if it's rest rised and
like I just said viewed on the web so
that's where you're gonna use there now
if you zoom in to 600 percent you're
going to be able to see a pixel grid
when you're using the pixel preview so
that only works with the pixel preview
there we've got a separations preview I
can find it I don't seem to see it I
don't see it on here that's uh that's
fine though we'll just go over these two
that we've got right here there's other
other things on here that we could go
over but we're not you're not going to
use very much and there's no sense of
going over things that are you're really
not going to use that much until later
on and later on to tutorials so those
are good for now that we can learn about
we've got the over print preview in the
pixel preview
no the other the other ones there in the
window section that's why I couldn't
find them so if we go to window and then
man remember where these are actually
what's called separations preview mode
there it is if I do that then we get our
separations previews and we can see we
can turn off some certain colors here
for print same thing with a couple other
ones but I'm not going to go over those
so let's end the tutorial here and now
you know about your two main ones the
preview and the outline those are going
to help you work in Illustrator faster
and remember the hotkey control Y and it
switches that between both of them and
you remember you got your over print
preview in your pixel preview this one
is for printing and this one is for web
to check and see how what it's going to
look like so thanks a lot for watching
the tutorial you guys and have a nice
day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
