tutorial and I maintain for running
Boston and in this tutorial I'm going to
be showing you how to use a break and to
continue key words so all you're going
to need for this tutorial is a button
and a text box and once you have those
on your form
just double-click on the bottom and
under your bottom one click have some
sort of route statement that prints out
an integer into a text box so when we
debug here we should get numbers 0
through 9 no text box yep and that's
nothing they're using this before so
what we're going to looking at first is
the break key and we talked about a
little bit a little bit in the switch
statement and what a break does is it'll
just break out of the current statement
that it said for example like if we take
a break keyword right here as soon as it
got to the break it will just break out
of the sport statement and it would go
down here so it wouldn't even be able to
get to this line of code right here and
as you can see it's saying yeah
unreachable code detected it says so
what we need to do is we need to create
we're going to create an if statement
here because we want to be able to get
to that line so we're going to say if I
equals I plus 2 then we wanted to break
out so what it's going to do is is just
kind of run through here print it print
out 0 then it's going to print out 1
then it's going to reach 2 and then it's
going to check to see if I is equal to 2
and since it is it will just break out
and break out and it will just jump down
here so it won't even get to this line
of code one.iu goes to and always be
done and won't even go to 3 or 4 any of
those done with a whore statement so in
order to analyze that better we're going
to insert a breakpoint and we've never
done this before but what a breakpoint
does is it will allow you to go line by
line through the code and show what it's
doing like what the compiler is doing
with your code so when we debug here and
click button 1 it was jump down here and
this is where the compiler is at the
moment so when you click f11 it will
just step and it will just go to the
next part of the code that you can do so
now it created integer I and you can see
right down here
has all of our variables and stuff so I
is equal to zero right here now when you
put f11 again I'll just step to the next
line of code that we want it to do and
just going to check to see if I is less
than 10
since it is it's going to go down here
through the code and you're going to
check to see if I is equal to 2 since
it's not it's just going to jump down to
this line of code and print out I into
the textbox then you click f11 again it
will increment I by 1 and start all over
so not going to explain it again but now
we went on here and now we can see I is
equal to 2 right there so now I want to
catch this if statement it will go to
this break statement and when we click
f11 again it will jump down to here
because breaking out of this for
statement yep so now it has printed out
0 &amp;amp; 1 into the textbox because once it
got to 2 it just broke out and skip this
line of code so now we're trying stop
recording here all right so that's
pretty much it for the break here
now we're going to be looking at the
continue to and unlike the break here
what the continue keyword does is it
will just skip to the end of the
forestay or just stick the end of the
loop that is going to so if we were to
say I equals 2 right here so and we type
the continue keyword what it would do
once it got to y equals 2 it would just
skip this line of code right here go
down here and just start at the top
again and then increment it by 1 say I
equals 3 and now just continue on so it
would just skip writing to in the
textbox so let's do a little breakpoint
again and see what this does
so now when I click this button go down
here you're create I check to see if I
is less than 10 go into the for
statement check to see if I equals to no
it's not equal to 0 so right into the
textbox
then let's go again increment I by 1
just do the whole process again now that
I equals 2 it's going to check to see if
I equals 2 and since it does is just
going to continue through the statement
hit the continue keyword and then it's
just going to jump down here
going to skip the rest of the code that
is inside of the for statement so we're
just going to skip that and go right
back up to here and then we'll just
increment I by one again check again and
then ill just check to see if I equals
two and no it doesn't equals three and
then so it's dispensed skip to continue
and it's going to come down here and
it's going to print out so basically
what the continue does is it just skips
the rest of the code that is inside of
the loop statement so if there were like
multiple lines of code down here it
would just skip them all and go right
back to the top of the fork statement so
we'll just stop these like right here
and we'll just run it without this break
statement so let me click this button
you should get numbers 0 through 9 but
it will won't print out too because once
it equals 2
they'll just skip this line of code
right here and go back up to the top
yeah we got 0 1 3 4 and so on so that's
basically it this tutorial so see you
