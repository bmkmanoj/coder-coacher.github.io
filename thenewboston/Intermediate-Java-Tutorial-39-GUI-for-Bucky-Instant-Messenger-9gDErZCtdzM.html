tutorial and in this lesson I'm going to
be building the GUI for our I don't know
if you want to call it like a chat it's
more like an instant messaging program
because you know two people are going to
be connected on different computers and
going to be able to talk to one another
so I think I'm going to call it an
instant messaging instead of a chatroom
because you know a chat rooms like with
multiple people so anyways let's go
ahead and set up the GUI and of course
if you you know watch any more tutorials
you know we do this in the constructor
so the first thing we need to do is make
a method that's the same name as our
class in this classes server and
actually let me just go ahead and give
me some more blank lines so you guys can
see a little bit easier alright so
public server so the first thing we need
to do is add a title at the top of the
window and I'll just name this buckey's
buckey's Instant Messenger what a great
name for our program now the next thing
I want to do is set up the text field
where the user can go ahead and type
text so remember we made a variable or
ready for it last time and it is
actually user text equals new jtextfield
with no parameters so now we basically
have that text field setup now we can go
ahead and do a couple things to it now
the very first thing I want to do is I
actually want to run a method on this
called set editable and I want to set
this equal to false now what the method
is set editable I always freakin put
that use your text editable now what
this means is by default before you are
connected to anyone else you're not
allowed to type anything in the message
box so why did I do this well first of
all if you're not connected to anyone
and they're basically wouldn't even be a
point to typing anything in the message
box because imagine signing on you know
AOL Instant Messenger and typing
something into the message box and
hitting Enter it's like dude you're
not even talking to anyone why the heck
would you hit enter and so first of all
it would just be a waste of time to type
something in there
second of all whenever you try to send
something through the stream and no
one's connected on the other side you're
going to get a lot of crap messing up so
that's why we don't want the user to be
able to type anything in here because if
they try to send something through the
stream and no one's on the other side
then you know it's just going to mess
crap up
so set editable equal to false and by
the way whenever they do connect to
someone we can change this to true and
I'm going to show you guys how to do
that later on so now what we need to do
is we need to add an action listener so
user text add a method called add come
on pop up action listener there we go
too lazy to type it and let me go ahead
and make sure this looks so pretty
alright now inside here of course we
have new listener I'm not going to
explain this you guys already know
what's going on right here
and inside here whenever basically
whenever something happens inside a
method gets called called public void
actionperformed and the event is action
event event so there we go after all
that we finally got a setup
so basically whenever the user typed
something into that textbox basically
their message and hits enter then this
method is going to be called action
perform that means that you hit enter
obviously what you want to do now is
send the message that you typed into
your text area so what we're going to be
doing is we're going to be creating
another method for this called send
message and of course I think you guys
already know what this does it sends the
message and that's why we got a error
because we didn't create this message
yet but it says okay what do you want to
send well event get action command right
here if we hover over this it says
returns the command string associated
with this action basically what we're
passing into this is the string or the
text that we typed into that text field
so once a connection is complete with
someone else you're going to be able to
type stuff into that text field and
whenever we hit the enter button it's
just going to send whatever message we
typed in so after this after we send the
message what we want to do is we
actually want to set user text which is
that text field set text equal to
nothing now why do we want to set this
equal to nothing well think about it
think of you know your messaging program
rather you use Google Chat or Facebook
or you know AOL Instant Messenger
whenever you type something into the
message area and hit enter your message
doesn't sit there in the message area
still it it shows up in the chat area so
you know your friend can see but the
main message area where you type your
message now turns blank again and it
waits for you pretty much to type
another message so pretty much it resets
to nothing and waits for you to type
another message so that's what we're
doing right here if we didn't have this
line of code then you would send your
message in the message would still be
sitting there in the text area kind of a
waste of a you know you would have to
delete it pretty much waste of time so
now what we need to do is just you know
add all this stuff to the screen so add
user text border layout north so this is
pretty much going to be sitting on the
top of the screen
now the chat window we have to go ahead
and create this this is the main window
where all of your messages get displayed
years and your friends what we wanted to
do is we didn't recreate this yet so new
J text area and now we have to add this
third screen so add new
J scroll pain with the chat window in
there let me see if I type that right
yep no errors alright now I guess we
might as well set the size for the main
thing so set size equal to 300 and 150
now usually you would want it a little
bit bigger than this this is only going
to be a size of a really small I don't
know maybe pop-up or something but since
I'm going to be running both of these
programs at the same time and I want
them both to fit on the screen
I put it 300 by 150 and the last thing
is set visible equal to true so of
course it's actually visible on your
screen now hopefully if you coded
everything correctly then you should
only get this one mayor that's error
that says okay you know what
you didn't even create this method yet
so you know we have to do that later on
and of course we will in the upcoming
tutorials but now our constructor is
complete our GUI is you know
successfully created and it now has the
little arm where is it
the little user text where you can type
messages in and the chat window where
whenever you or your friend types a
message and sends it it displays in the
main chat area so in the next tutorial
what we're going to be doing is working
on some of the housekeeping stuff and
I'm going to be explaining to you guys a
little bit more about this with about
what this server variable means so thank
you guys for watching number you
subscribe and I'll see you guys in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
