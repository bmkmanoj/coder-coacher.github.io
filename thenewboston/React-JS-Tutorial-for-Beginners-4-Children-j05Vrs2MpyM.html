video I want to teach you how to use
children so the first thing you need to
do is you need to go out and find
yourself a child I'm just kidding don't
do that I'm talking about react
programming children
alright so whenever I say children what
I mean is this actually let me delete
this one as well in fact we might as
well clean this whole thing up from our
last example so all we're attending now
is a blank heading - and instead of two
properties for these components I'm only
going to use one so now this component
only has one other property which is the
user so instead of just making
components with a self-closing tag like
we have been we can make them with a
more traditional tag system in other
words a starting tag and an ending tag
so just like regular old HTML this is no
different now inside here we can type
whatever we want so I'll say that for
each component each one has a property
of user which is some person's name and
inside here this is the children
attribute in us to say like a Bucky this
guy is awesome and let me make another
one so you guys can clearly see what's
going on so I'll make another user
called Emily and I'll say uh she smells
like like mints why I have no idea but
all right so we now have two components
and they have one property in that is
user which is essentially their name now
even though we don't explicitly pass in
like we have before it also has another
property which is their children
property so children is anything that's
in between the starting and the ending
tag so now if I just make something like
a div so instead of just returning a
heading I'm gonna return let's say a
heading in a paragraph so I can say like
heading 3 and for the heading
I'll just display the name and you guys
remember how to do that from the last
tutorial so this dot props dot user so
that's what we're gonna display in each
components heading and we're also going
to display your child in a paragraph so
just like before so this dot props dot
children so if i refresh this you guys
are gonna see what's going on so for
every component it consists of two parts
a heading and a paragraph so heading in
a paragraph now in the heading we
learned this in the last tutorial we can
pass in properties by giving it a name
as an attribute and display at however
we want and also even though we don't
explicitly pass it in or in other words
we don't type the word children anything
in between your starting and your ending
tag gets counted as a child so whenever
we display the child as the paragraph it
just counts as this text and that's why
we were able to display these types of
components right there so there you go
that is how you use children again just
to specify I'm talking about in react
and not actual kids so thanks for
watching see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
