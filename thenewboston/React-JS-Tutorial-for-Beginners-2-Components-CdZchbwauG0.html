show you how to make a simple react
component now a component is the core
building block that you use whenever
you're making a webpage using react now
usually your web page has a couple
components on it and you can actually
make an entire site using nothing but
components but for this video we're just
going to keep things real simple I'm
going to show you guys how to create one
simple one and then once you know how to
create one of them then you know you can
use them however you want so we're going
to be creating this react component and
after you create these components you
say where do you want to put it on your
web page now we really since this is our
starting point you really don't have a
bunch of places to put it
so I'm just going to make a little divot
here and just stick it in there but
usually let's say that you want to make
a notification component well then you
would say put it in the top menu bar if
you want to make a chat component you
would put it on I don't know maybe the
right so you're pretty much going to
make a component and then tell your page
where you want to put it so that's the
core concept behind it so just so we
have some place to put it first I'm just
going to make a div and I'll give it the
ID of like a Content so we just have
some place to stick this thing whenever
we make it again this is nothing to do
with react this is just so I have
somewhere to put our component so I mean
just myself in my seat here alright so
the components we make are going to be
made in JavaScript so we need a script
tag so we are actually allowed to type
JavaScript somewhere now instead of just
getting started typing it right in here
we need to add one attribute to the
script tag and that's type equals text
slash JSX
now what this is saying is we're not
just typing plain vanilla JavaScript
we're going to be using this JSX
syntax so it's a little bit different
our own little flavor of JavaScript and
whenever you see this this attribute
right here means convert it to regular
JavaScript so our webpage can understand
it
and then we're going to be golden so
that's where we're going to be doing
boom let's go ahead and get started
creating this component so whenever we
create a component in react we need to
make a new class so our class is just
going to specify what you want your
component to do what you want it to look
like basically all of the details of
your component you stick inside its own
class and just so we can reference this
class later on I'm just going to give it
a variables name called Bucky's
component so you can name it anything
you want I'm going to name it Bucky's
component because why the heck not all
right so this component needs to be in a
class how do you create a class just
like react dot create class now inside
here make sure you put your semicolon at
the end so inside here is where we're
going to be adding all of the functions
all the attributes whatever we want our
component to do and it's different for
every component that's where we're going
to be typing however there is one rule
that you always need to follow whenever
you're making these little components
and that is you always need to have a
render function so what this render
function is going to do is it's saying
okay this is the HTML that I want to
display since that's all your component
is just a fancy HTML blob that can you
know do dynamic stuff update in real
time whatever we decide but it always is
going to look for the render function
and say okay whenever I'm using this
component this is what gets displayed so
for right now we're not going to give it
any fancy functionality we're just going
to output some really boring HTML just
so we can see the structure of a core
component but like I said the only thing
that this render function is going to do
is it's going to return some HTML and
let me just make a heading or something
so put like my name is Bucky all right
sandé sure my autocomplete doesn't mess
up so this is a core component this is
all it is so whenever you make a
component one more time just make a
class so a component is essentially
is a react class and it has one rule it
needs to have a render function that
returns some kind of HTML and of course
later on this is going to be you know a
little bit cooler than this but for
right now
that is how you create a component so we
got one created how do we say okay we
actually want to use this component this
is where we want to display it well for
that use react render now this takes two
parameters the first one is what
component do you want to display and
where do you want to display it and
right now it's pretty easy because we
only have one component and we only have
one place to display it so not that hard
all right so the component is Bucky's
component and the other attribute is
where do you want to display it well we
want to display it right here so
JavaScript language rewrite documents
get elements are you gonna pop up nope
by ID there we go and the idea of this
is content and boom look at that so
let's run it and make sure it works and
if I look at the source code check out
what's going on so this was our empty
div as we saw right here and we made a
component and then we said take this
component which is essentially just a
heading and display it in that div so
that's all it did and that's why our
heading is now displaying inside this
div so that's the core concept behind
react we're pretty much going to be
creating these components and I'll show
you guys how to do some cool stuff to
them in the upcoming tutorials and once
they're created we're just going to say
okay display them here or display them
there and you know eventually we're
going to have web pages that are you
know a little bit better looking than
one div on the screen but for right now
hopefully you guys enjoyed I'll see you
