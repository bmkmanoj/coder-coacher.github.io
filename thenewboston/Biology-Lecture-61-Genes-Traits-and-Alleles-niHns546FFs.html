biology lesson and in this story I want
to talk to you guys a little bit more
about genes and traits and also
something called alleles so basically we
already know that every gene in your
body whenever I say gene I basically
mean just a portion of DNA
so here's DNA right here and of course
we have the backbone and all the
nucleotides already talked a lot about
DNA but basically whenever I'm talking
about a gene I'm talking about
a portion or part of your DNA now some
genes are actually thousands of
nucleotides long other genes are just a
few hundred they differ in size but I
say this because remember that I said
that DNA is basically a blueprint or
template for other things in your body
now one of the most important things
that it makes is proteins and proteins
are actually pretty important whenever
we talk about traits and you know
heritage and stuff like that because the
traits or your traits are dependent on
which proteins your body makes so
proteins how they're made up in what
proteins you have in your body actually
affects your traits so a person with I
don't know let's say blue eyes might
have different proteins or they're made
up a little bit differently than a
person with you know green eyes so I
guess if we wanted to sum it up we could
say something like genes which are part
of your DNA determine how proteins are
made and the proteins in your body
determine your traits so just remember
that that is how genes and proteins and
traits DNA that's how everything is tied
together so now that we understand that
we can move on to what I said in the
beginning of the story which was alleles
now what the heck is an allele well the
definition is different forms of the
same gene alright so what do I mean by
that well remember that I said that
Mendel in this pea plant so let me go
ahead and draw you know really terrible
people ant right there draw some peas in
it looks pretty good now remember that I
said that Mendel
pea plants had two alleles for
determining height so one right here and
one right here it gets one allele from
the mom and one allele from the dad now
if a plant had two tall alleles at all
from the mom and a tall from the dad the
plants are just our plants would be tall
now if the pea plant let's say had two
short alleles so short a shorter one
from the mom and it inherited a short
one from the dad the pea plant itself
would be short but remember that I said
what if the pea plant had a tall allele
say from the mom and a short one from
the dead well that plant would be tall
and why is that well unlike the blending
theory where you know people thought it
would be average Mendel found out that
pretty much alleles were dominant over
other or they can hide the effects of
other alleles so basically tall
dominated over the short so that's why
we call tall the dominant in the short
the recessive allele because remember
one more time the tall dominates or
hides the effects of the short now in
people of course we just don't have
really tall people in really short
people like in pea plants what we have
is a bigger range anything in between so
we have average people kind of tall
people you know maybe kind of short
people pretty much a bigger variation of
values so why is this it's because you
know if we think about it pea plants
have genes and traits and alleles and so
do people and they kind of work the same
way so what the heck is up with this
well actually in people instead of just
tall in short alleles height is
determined by many different genes so
pea plants only have one gene for
determining height and people actually
have several different genes or several
different factors to determine their
height so that's basically why people
aren't as tall or short but everything
in between because unlike pea plants
where they have one or the other they
have a bigger range or more genes now
whenever you have a trade that's
determined by multiple genes we actually
call this
polygenic so that's you know a keyword
that you want to remember
so basically polygenic means traits that
are determined by multiple genes so for
example height in human beings is
polygenic or it's a trait that's
determined by multiple genes now
whenever I say locus what I'm talking
about is basically the location on the
chromosomes where the gene is found so
let me go ahead and draw I don't know a
couple different chromosomes and
basically we can say that you know this
is one from you this is one from your
girlfriend and this is one from you know
some guy who gives you pizza Tony I
don't know maybe you like pizza well
what am I trying to demonstrate well the
same gene is found at the same locus or
location in every single organism so for
example the gene that determines I don't
know your eye color is found at the same
place for you your girlfriend and Tony
so Tony is you know gene for eye color
wouldn't be you know down here or
anything it would be at the same locus
or the same location on every single
chromosome in every single organism so
that's basically what locus means
whenever I talk about that and you know
what else did we learn alleles and you
know some polygenic traits I think we
have enough knowledge for this tutorial
so thank you guys for watching and in
the next Soria what I want to do is I
want to start talking to you guys about
genetic crosses and one of the most
funnest things that we can do whenever
we're studying inheritance and biology
