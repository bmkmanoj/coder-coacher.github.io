your 17th C++ tutorial and in this
tutorial I'm going to be covering
something called the if-else statement
now let's go ahead and first I want to
build a basic if statement because an FL
statement is pretty much like an
enhanced if statement so let's go ahead
and use the knowledge or the information
that we learned in the last tutorial and
build on it so let's go ahead and make a
simple program we have a variable called
age and go ahead and set it equal to
whatever your ages now go ahead and make
a basic if statement now if you remember
from the left story all an if statement
does is it runs a simple test if that
test is true it runs a bit of code if
that test is false it doesn't do
anything so let's go ahead and test age
say if age is greater than 60 let's go
ahead and say um C out Wow
you are old so if the user is over 60
let's go ahead and say you are old and
now let's go ahead and end that line run
this program and see what we get we get
nothing and that is because I'm 24 so
this program does nothing but you build
this program you show it to your boss
and you're like hey where's my raise in
there like wow this program is
impressive in all
however wouldn't it be nice if we could
give a message to the user no matter how
old they are what if instead of skipping
this if the test is false let's give
them all an alternative message like if
anyone's over 60 we're going to tell
them they're old if anyone is under 60
we're going to tell them hey get a job
so saying alright um I suppose I could
put another if statement and then Ray
age is less than 60 but you know what
that isn't the best way to do things I'm
going to show you guys something called
the if-else statement so the if
statement basically ran a simple test
and if that test is true it ran this bit
of code and if it was false it did
nothing it skipped it but now we want to
say all right else if the test is false
then we want to run this bit of code so
either way it's
to run a bit of code either way if it's
true it's going to run this bit of code
let me just go ahead and copy that if
it's false it's going to run this bit of
code but let's not put while you're old
for either one if they're under 60 let's
go ahead and write you are young get a
job so now when we go ahead and run our
program unlike before when it says our
right since this test isn't true I'm
just going to skip it it says all right
this tests is it true so what am I
supposed to do it's false well I'm
supposed to do the else so let's go
ahead and nothing be talking run it and
it says you are young get a job and of
course if the user is like 87 we run the
program and they say wow you are old so
now you can see instead of just having a
basic if statement where it was either
run a bit of code or do nothing we now
have the option of something happens for
true and something happens for false so
now either way your computer program is
going to do something so that is the
basics of an if-else statement so now
that you guys know that let me go even
deeper I said that you can go ahead and
run a line of code inside the if
statement well you can also run multiple
lines of code just by putting them under
each other so if we go ahead and we copy
this we can go ahead and paste it paste
it paste it it doesn't matter you can go
ahead and run it four times as long as
it's in between those braces right there
server saying all right what if I wanted
to do something like this
what if not only I wanted to check if
they were over 60 but if they were over
60 I wanted to check if they were over a
hundred so let's go ahead and do that so
what I want to want to teach you guys
now is that inside if statements instead
of just running simple lines of code you
can also put additional if statements
this is called nesting of statements so
let's go ahead and say if
and remember this code is only going to
run if the user is over 60 so now we
want to test if the user is over 100 and
then we're going to write C out armed
why are you still alive I know this is
harsh but hey just trying to get the
point across so now let's go ahead and
go around this bit of code right now so
our program is going to say this alright
if the age is over 60 which it is I'm
going to run this bit of code right here
and in this bit of code I'm going to
test if the user is over 100 well
they're not over 100 but they are over
60 so nothing is going to happen so
we're going to run this nothing is going
to happen but say our user was 178
pretty old huh well we're going to say
all right is your age over 60 yes so now
go here is your aive is your age over
100 yes it is
so now run this bit of code right here
and we're going to go ahead and run it
and it's going to say why are you still
a lot because come on guys let's face it
if you're 178 years old you should be
dead just saying so now we get begin to
see how we can make complex tests and
very complex programs and I know that I
it's called nesting and if statement
inside another if statement but you can
also nest an if-else in here and you can
also nest another if in here and you
what you can do is you can nest if
inside of if inside of if as many times
as you want but say you wanted to test
if the user was over 10 then over 20
then over 30 then no to 40 and the 50
well there's even a more simple way to
do this than nesting a thousand
different ifs inside of each other and
I'll probably be teaching you that in
the upcoming tutorials but for now what
I want you guys to take away from this
tutorial is instead of a basic if
statement where if the test is false
then it just skips the code you can now
add an else and what this does is it
gives it an alternative choice and also
a side
from that you can also nest if inside
other ifs so that way you can basically
test two things and if two things are
true run a bit of code so as long as you
understand those concepts you should be
good go so for now thank you guys for
watching don't forget to subscribe and
yeah if you have any questions send me a
message on my website the new Boston
calm and I'll be glad to answer them for
you so thank you for watching don't
forget sub and I will see you next story</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
