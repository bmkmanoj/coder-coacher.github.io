name is Bucky Roberts and welcome to
your very first tutorial in this little
program I want to show you guys how to
make it's an Instagram downloader and
what it basically allows you to do is
with PHP what you can do is you can have
users sign in to their Instagram
accounts and download all of their
Instagram photos now the reason that I
actually made this is because I'm
working on a social network right now
and I thought you know what whenever
they want to post the picture from the
Instagram if the go to Instagram
download it and then save it re upload
it to Bucky's room and I was like you
know what would be awesome if they can
just click a button sign in Instagram
and have all their pictures imported so
they are all on my social network I want
to make it easy for them so that is what
I'm using it for but you guys just can
use it to download maybe you just want
to backup all your photos from Instagram
so anyways let's go ahead and get
started so the first thing that you need
to do is you need to go to Instagram
comm slash developer and you need to
make a developer account but it doesn't
like cost anything and doesn't even take
any time to approve it's pretty much
just like creating an account for any
website so once you have a developer
account you can go ahead and at the top
here click manage clients now a client
you basically want to build one client
for each new program you make using the
Instagram API and of course the
Instagram API is this a bunch of code
that Instagram wrote that allows users
to connect to their database so they can
do things like download photos so what
we want to do in here is we want to
register a new client and it says sorry
your se okay didn't know I had that so
let's just go ahead and delete some and
by the way typically you don't want to
be showing people all this information
now I'll show you why later but um I'm
going to be deleting all this because I
don't trust you guys after I upload
these tutorials so it's good right now
so register new client and your
applications name is pretty much the
name of your program and
I am going to name mine BR downloader
for Bucky's room downloader and the
description it really doesn't matter
they don't like review it or anything so
I'm just going to put best program ever
now the website and this setting the
OAuth redirect URI are actually really
important and let me talk to you guys
about that and it's a really good idea
to have these the same now the reason
that you need it and put your website
right there is because they only allow
websites that are registered to use
their API you just can't make one client
and use it you know on any website you
want they want to have you know a strict
overview and make sure no one's abusing
the system now this thing right here
this redirect URI is pretty much the
website that people get redirected to
after they log in now let me talk to you
guys what about that what that means
basically I'm going to have a link on
Bucky's room that says okay import all
of my pictures from Instagram now
whenever they click that link a little
pop up is going to appear and it's going
to ask the user to log into their
Instagram account now after they're done
logging in this is the website where
they get redirected to so that's why
it's a good thing to have them both on
the the same web page there's like a
clicking in right here we're stupid
headphones
alright think it's good alright so both
of these can just be default and of
course enter the CAPTCHA and register
that bad boy now you can go ahead and
copy this and like I said before your
client ID is pretty much your
identification number for a client it's
pretty much says okay
Bucky Roberts is using this client so if
it does anything weird then we can go
ahead and punch him in the face we know
who's doing it your client secret is
your password definitely don't want to
give that away and I just talked about
these two right here and like I said if
you guys try to steal my stuff I'm going
to delete it by the time I up leave this
upload these videos so too bad now this
is from
my other tester but typically what you
want to do at this point is go ahead and
copy all of this data and just paste it
into a text file for right now because
um we're not setting
we're not like configuring any PHP files
right now this is just a very basic
setup of our project and with that being
said what I want to do now is actually
create a folder called BR downloader
start setting up my main source files so
I'm going to make a new folder and it's
good idea to name it well you have to
name it wherever you're going to be just
pretty much make sure that your source
files match whatever URL you entered and
since I said that the main folder is
going to be right after my public HTML
directory that's where I'm going to
upload it to my server
I think I'm connected already refresh
your downloader and upload that all
right so now if I go I can see you just
uploaded a folder it's empty but your
project your barebone project is good to
go so now what we're ready to do is
we're ready to jump in and start
actually coding some PHP files and start
writing some code so anyways we're going
to start doing this in the next tutorial
I think I gave you guys enough
information for now and also another
thing I want to mention if you guys ever
have any questions about anything or you
want to see the source code for this you
can just go to my forum I'm going to be
putting everything into the PHP section
so if you ever need it it's right there
and also if you ever get stuck on
anything you can ask people a lot of
people are willing to help out anyways
thank you for watching I'll see you next
