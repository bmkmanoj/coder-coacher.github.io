tutorial and today we're going to be
talking about how to do some basic math
in our PHP so so far what we learned is
pretty much we can have a variable and
the variable can be anything and we can
set it equal to a number and if we went
and we want an output on a screen we
would write echo and we're going to
write the variable and then when we went
ahead and saved that let's set it equal
to 34 and if you don't know what I'm
doing then go watch my later tutorials
so I'm not explaining it again now today
I told you if we're going to be going
over some basic math and this is what I
mean by this
PHP besides being able just to write
crap on the screen it's pretty much like
a big calculator so this means you can
do basic math functions right in your
variable so for example if you wanted to
do 34 plus whatever that is I'll save it
and do that and as you can see it
outputs it right on the screen for you
so again you can do basic math functions
right in your variable so 54 minus 90
and we save that and refresh it as you
can see gave us minus 36 so again set
the variable equal to what other
whatever equation you have and then it
echos or displays the output right on
the screen so say we have this variable
called anything and also equal to 66
what we can also do is have another
variable called something and we'll set
it equal to 85 besides just making the
equation up here right in the variable
you can also make it in your echo
statement so say we have anything plus
the variable something when we save this
refresh our page you can see that PHP
automatically added our two variables
for us now this is useful whenever you
want to perform a function on two
separate variables and there's a bunch
of different stuff you can do you can of
course add subtract using the subtract
shine
sign sorry multiply using the asterisks
divided using the backslash if you want
to divide and get the remainder you use
the percentage sign if you want to set
it equal to use two equal signs and
these two and signs and I'm actually
just going to go ahead and list all
these on my website and not go through
them all so if you want to learn
everything that you can do then just
check out my website that New Boston
comm but I really don't feel like going
through all of them for you right now so
again what we learned today to do some
basic math you can either include it
right in the variable or you can add or
do different things to separate
variables right in your echo statement
so that's it for this tutorial watch my
next door see you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
