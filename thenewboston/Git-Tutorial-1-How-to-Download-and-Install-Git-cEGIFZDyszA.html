gentlemen my name is Bucky Roberts and
welcome to your very first tutorial in
get G I T now in this little video
series what I'm going to be doing is I'm
going to be teaching you guys how to
download and install git and also how to
use it from beginner to expert however
before I do that I want to mention this
whenever you're watching this video make
sure to watch it in 1080 high def and
also full screen I'm going to be
recording my entire computer screen so
if you try to watch this video in that
little YouTube player it's probably
going to be pretty difficult to see
what's going on
so again 1080 full screen once you
change those settings then well just
kick up your feet relax and enjoy the
show
so my guess is that most of you guys
watching this video probably already
have a good understanding of exactly
what get is um you probably already know
exactly what it does however for those
of you guys who maybe just heard your
friends talking about it or maybe saw
you know a quick little story about it
on online somewhere let me go ahead and
explain you guys exactly what kit is and
what you can use it for so this is just
no powder right here this is just a
random text editor but it's going to you
know help me demonstrate what it is so
git is pretty much a program that lets
you keep track of changes in files
alright well that sounds like the
dumbest program ever why would we even
want to learn that well let me give you
guys a really basic example of what it
can do so say that you're typing a Word
document for school and you're like okay
this is my essay arm you know it's done
so you go OK file save as you know this
looks pretty freaking cool so I'm going
to save this is a final essay text
alright ready hand this in oh crap oh
look at this I forgot the apostrophe in
its
there we go okay so file save as Oh
final let's just put final essay - okay
so okay save that okay ready oh oh em
gee look this I forgot to capitalize the
okay ermahgerd alright so file save as
okay so definitely yada-yada-yada final
essay - okay so keep doing that over and
over again and I know that everyone has
has done it and check this out we now
have a bunch of oddly named final and
I'm doing the quotes thing with my hands
even even though I just realized that
you guys can not see that but that's
basically what this program is it lets
you manage all of these versions of the
same exact file it just does it a lot
better than you did or at least that I
just did a couple cool features about it
is that if you ever want to go back to
the original one or maybe just when you
changed it right here it lets you do
that incredibly easy and you don't have
to keep renaming stuff definitely final
essay - and without you know talking
guys about the history of git or all the
intricacies of how it works
um it's really a really awesome program
for keeping track of changes and files
and other than that this is where most
of you guys are going to get excited
it's one of the best programs for
managing source code because I know a
lot of you guys have written source code
before and you need it either to undo
something that yeah you know maybe it
was a bug you tried to fix and you
needed to go back well it's perfect
for managing source code so I could
probably talk to you guys about the
history of git and exactly how programs
like this work but instead what I
decided to do is I'm just going to go
ahead and download it and then show you
guys along the way and explain it that
way because it's a lot easier to
understand it if we actually have the
program up and running so let's go ahead
and let me show you guys how to download
this and by the way if you guys are like
alright I don't need
and I'm not a programmer I don't work
with source code at all um so why would
I even need this well I just showed you
guys on the text file and I also mention
source code but you can actually use
this with any file and I'm talking about
Word documents Photoshop files text
files Microsoft document files it's just
at programmers and those working with
source code use it the most often but
anyone can use it so you know if you're
not a programmer watch these tutorials
anyways you'll thank me alright so in
order to download it of course go to
Google and just type in download git and
press enter and right now the download
you know anytime you download something
the download page changes like every
five seconds but right now it's at this
website get slash SCM com slash
downloads now I'm on this page right now
it automatically detected detected that
I have Windows but I'm going to go ahead
and click Windows right now and as you
can see it automatically starts
downloading so again obviously I'm
running Windows right now and uh if you
guys have a Mac or anything else then my
guess is that process is kind of the
same but anyways this is how you
download it for Windows so once we
downloaded it and you can actually close
out of Google right now go to wherever
your downloads are mine are Bucky
downloads all it did is it downloaded an
executable file and this is really easy
but you know if you guys ran into any
trouble then you can follow along but if
you ever downloaded anything before then
it's going to be pretty easy to follow
along so double-click this right here
and do we want to give it permission
yadda yadda yadda of course we'll allow
it yes
and this thing is annoying me close out
of that alright so now we got really
simple wizard and we're actually going
to keep all the defaults so next next
and actually you might want to take note
of wherever it's installing next all
right looks good next next and make sure
you use git from git bash only and when
we're done with this you guys are going
to see exactly what git bash is it's
very cool but make sure you have that
option selected next next and let it do
its thing
doo doo doo doo doo doo doo double bit
okay I apparently need a faster
processor and fessor hard drive man
I coulda told you guys a story this time
all right so once that thing is done
then well yeah let's go ahead and look
at the release notes why the eff not
finish and it's probably going to put it
up in some stupid program I should have
not click that I'm regretting that
already why did I even open that that
was a waste of time I don't care what
that is
all right so basically it downloaded
apparently but I don't see any change
except those stupid or release notes so
what I'm going to do is go to all
programs and we're going to scroll down
here and boom check this out we now have
a folder called git so if you double
click this or just click it once you're
going to see git bash and get gooey
alright well I don't want to get gooey
because I just took a shower but um
alright so right click give back and
guys those corny jokes they're going to
be coming all tutorial series long so
get ready for it and just go ahead and
put a shortcut on your desktops and so
I'm going to be using it a lot and now
if you double click git bash you can see
that it's basically like a command line
for Windows except this is actually UNIX
tile and if you guys don't know any UNIX
clans then don't worry
um I don't assume that you do I'm going
to be teaching you guys everything that
you need to know from the ground up in
learning get so let's just go ahead and
before you know I cut the twirl off
let's just test something out and this
is a really some
command if you type you get GI t - -
version and press ENTER then it's just
going to tell you your version and
actually kind of the command whenever
you type it it kind of sounds like what
you want to do like get the version of
my get get - - version all right so
that's one command but uh but guys trust
me there is more that we can do with
this program then just type that one
command of course so in the next
tutorial I'm going to be showing you
guys how to configure git and then we're
going to be getting into the awesome
stuff so for now thank you guys for
watching don't forget to subscribe and
I'll see you guys next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
