28th or 29th or something C++ tutorial I
don't really know what one it is and in
this disorder I'm going to show you guys
how to use a function to only use it on
a specific range in the array so for
example I know that sounds confusing but
unless kappa toriel's we talked about
using a function like to sum up all the
elements in the array but what if
they're like 10 elements in your array
and you only wanted to some elements 2 3
&amp;amp; 4
oh you already only wanted to sell some
of the elements the first one through
the fifth one well we don't really know
how to work with array ranges yet but in
this tutorial you'll know how to so the
most common and most widely used
approach to this is by passing two
pointers into a function one pointer
points to the beginning of the array and
one pointer points to the end of the
array or the range that you want to use
so since I told you guys you need a
function using two pointers let's go
ahead and build a function using two
pointers so I'm gonna call my function
sum since that's what it's gonna do so
go ahead and put int sum and as your
parameter is right constant and then go
ahead and write int since is going to be
integers we're talking about pointer
begin and do this exact same thing and
this is gonna be the beginning value or
where you want to start in your array
and then go ahead and write constant in
int since again you'll be working
interest pointer and just go over ahead
and write end or something like that
now let's go ahead and build the body of
it because we're bodybuilders get it so
I thought so don't have to write Const
and we need one last pointer so go ahead
and I'm gonna name my pointer and now we
need a variable to hold the sum of all
these elements we've already made our
function called sum so I'm gonna name my
total so in total and make sure you
started out zero because you know why
wouldn't you
and now let's go
and though the loop to loop through the
elements in the array so let's go ahead
and make for loop and it's going to
start and just go ahead and press
pointer equals begin and then where do
you want to end it
pointer not equal to not equal to end
and then we just want to loop through
one at a time so pointer plus plus so
now we can go ahead and build body for
this and you can add your comas if you
want I always do just because uh I'm
just addicted to them so now we have
that total variable and what we want to
do is each time it goes through the loop
we want to take the value of that
pointer which is just going to be the
value of the elements I'm just making it
a pointer because well you're gonna have
to learn pointer sometimes so why not
now and it's just going to add it to
that value of total so if the first
value is two it's going to add two to
total if the next one's for the total is
now going to be six if the next one's
for it's now going to be ten got it good
and now we need a return total of course
we need to return our answer we couldn't
name the answer but well too late now we
need to go ahead and prototype this
function so just copy it and put it at
the top paste so now we have a function
built that takes the beginning element
of an array in the n1 and it adds up the
sum or sums the numbers so here's what
it pretty much does the first one or the
pointer points to the beginning item to
be processed and then once it loops
through one time it takes that value and
adds it to the total and then what this
one does right here this plus plus it
just increments through the loop cousin
it to point that in the next element
until it finally gets to the end and
again the beginning and the end are
going to be declared whenever we call
our function so let's go ahead and since
we're working with array let's go ahead
and if we probably needed making array
I'm going to name my numbers and I'm
going to have like eight elements
it and let's go ahead and well add eight
elements into it so one two three four
five six seven eight
make sure I got eight one two three four
five six seven eight not bad so now that
we have an array we can begin using our
function so let's go ahead and I'm just
gonna make a variable I'm gonna name my
value this is actually the sum but I
can't name some because that's what our
function was called so it value equals
the sum and now we need to pass at the
beginning and ending locations of our
array so numbers that will start at the
beginning
and numbers plus eight we'll go one past
the ending one and you need to go one
past the ending one so you know where to
it well it's not really useful when
you're doing the whole array but uh
you'll see why later I'll make another
one later and you'll see why so now
let's just output it on the screen um
the total or let's put the sum of the
numbers is and let's just go ahead and
present value and this end line and now
let me run this execute compile and run
and you'll see how many errors we got
check my semicolons real quick it made
and oh forgot my semicolon right here
that is embarrassing
remember ladies and gentlemen when
you're prototyping your functions always
put a semicolon not like me so now it
says the sum of the numbers is 154 so
that pretty much did what we did our
last couple of Sorrows but now I promise
you that we do a range of numbers so
let's go ahead and do that right now
so let's go ahead and say instead of the
value of this entire thing let's go
ahead and put the first two so the first
two is numbers in numbers plus two and
I'll show you why this is if you're
saying well let me go ahead and make
sure compiles right before I do I don't
think I could have messed then
thing up that fast but it should be yeah
there we go 45 and let me show you guys
why this works the numbers is the first
value so it starts with 2 and this is
index 0 of the array and now it adds 2
so this is index 1 and this is index 2
but if it's an all right why didn't add
this fourth one this last one right here
tells it where to end so you never
include this when you're adding up
numbers so for example if we have
numbers plus 1 it would start with 43
and if we had numbers plus 4 would go 0
1 2 3 4 but I want to add that 6 so it
would add 43 plus 4 plus 21 I think
let's go ahead and compile and run that
and see if it's right so it should end
Wow
how the heck did I messed that up that
fast I don't even remember what I was
teaching now I put a really put I mean I
can't even talk that's so embarrassing
so anyways it's gonna add 43 well let's
just go ahead and compile and run this
how figure out 0 1 2 3 4 so it's not
going to add the 6 so it should end in
an 8 right there so it adds 43 plus 4
plus 21 so this is 1 and this is 4 right
here but it doesn't include the 4 so
there is my answer right there I don't
even know if I showed you guys the last
answer but well there you go
so that's your quick tutorial on how to
work with a range of an array so thank
you guys for watching don't forget to
subscribe to my next tutorial that
doesn't even make sense
