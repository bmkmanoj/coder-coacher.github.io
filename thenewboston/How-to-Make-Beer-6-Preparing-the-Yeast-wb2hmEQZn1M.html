all the boring sanitizing and cleaning
we can go ahead and get to the good
stuff making the beer now the first part
I want to talk to you guys about is
preparing the yeast now this is actually
one of the most debated topics among the
brewing community how exactly to prepare
the yeast what kind of used to use and I
can talk to you guys about and probably
like an hour - about yeast and not even
run out of material but let me just go
ahead and give you the basics right now
so yeast comes in one of two main
categories liquid yeast and dry yeast
now we're gonna be using dry yeast in
this tutorial because that's what came
with our recipe but I'll talk to you
guys about liquid Easter real quick
usually whenever you have liquid yeast
you want to let it sit in your
refrigerator until the day that you brew
now before you brew it you want to take
it out and let it sit for a few hours
and some liquid yeasts are actually
called smack tacs and what they do is
you actually need to prepare them by
smacking them in an inner pouch breaks
open and it starts activating the yeast
so then you can actually see it expand
and that's how you prepare that I don't
talk about that too much because like I
said we're gonna be using dry yeast now
dry yeast is really easy and that's why
I wanted to have this recipe because
this is actually a really simple recipe
no preparation needed for now the only
thing you need to do to this is just go
ahead and take this entire packet and
throw in your sanitizer solution you may
think won't that get the yeast you know
moist and ruin it well no this is
actually vacuum sealed so no water is
gonna get in here and actually that's
what you need to do because it's
important to sanitize the outside of
this packet because actually there's a
lot of bacteria on here believe it or
not so go ahead and throw this in the
sanitizer and once you do that and ready
to move on to the next step
now the next thing you want to do is you
want to add water to the pot now it's
important to use a good quality drinking
water a lot of people just use water
from their sink or you know on their
toes of their house but I like to go
ahead and get water from the store
because I know that you know very pure
you can go ahead and use water from your
house but if it small smells like sulfur
or anything then you probably don't want
to use it is a general rule you hear
this a lot good water
equals good beer now go ahead and add
about two and a half gallons to the pot
and don't worry if you you know add a
little less or a little more because
eventually we're going to be bringing it
up to five gallons so even if you add
you know a little under or over two and
a half gallons then the ending result is
going to be the same since what this is
gonna do is we're basically going to mix
all of our ingredients in here and then
we're gonna be adding more water to
bring it up to five so again like I said
if you accidentally had a little less or
more don't worry your ending outcome is
gonna be the same no matter what now the
next thing you need to do is go ahead
turn on your stove and bring your water
to a boil now we don't start adding any
of the ingredients until the water is
actually at a boiling temperature so go
ahead and grab a beer in a way and
actually why we are waiting for this to
boil we can also prepare a couple things
so come with me and check it out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
