tutorial for the new boss in where we're
actually going to start using this geo
coder to get it address and print it on
the screen so what we're going to do is
we're gonna work within our try bracket
that we set up in the last tutorial
we're gonna create a list that holds our
addresses and it's going to be the
dresses type so we're gonna set up our
list and like I said it's the type of
dress like this and we're just gonna
call this address now set this equal to
our geo coder that we set up in the last
tutorial so we're gonna say geo coder
dot we're gonna use from the location or
get from location and as you can see it
takes a lot longitude latitude latitude
longitude and a maximum result so first
thing that we need to do is we need to
reference our geo point that we set up a
few tutorials ago called touch point
right here and again we can also say get
longitude get latitude and that kind of
kind of method to get the longitude and
latitude so let's just set that up here
real quick again our geo point was
called touched point so we can say touch
point dot get latitude and that's going
to give us a geo point but what we want
to do is we want to convert that into
kind of the reference that Android is
going to take for this so we're just
going to divide it by a 1 e to the 6th
like that and then we're also going to
do the pretty much the same thing for
the get longitude so we're just gonna
say our touch point or a geo point dot
get longitude and again we're going to
divide it by one e six because again
when we're getting our longitude and
latitude it has this e six here so we
actually just want to divide that out to
get rid of that and then for a maximum
result all we're gonna say is one
because we just want one result for a
list and I see that I mistyped list over
here so make sure it's like that and now
we have our list address set up and all
we're gonna do is basically
see if the dress size is bigger than one
because then we will have something
within our list and we can actually
reference it so what we're gonna do is
we're gonna say if address dot size and
that's going to return the size of our
list and if that's greater than zero
we're going to perform an action in this
action all we're gonna do is a for loop
and we're gonna say int I is equal to
zero to start with not one sorry I I
know I'm kind of going quickly here I'll
explain everything at the end once we're
we have everything set up and we're
gonna say as long as I is less than our
dress dot get and we're gonna get the
location which we set as zero and what
we're gonna do is we're going to say get
max address line index and that's gonna
get you know the maximum value of our
addresses list and we're just going to
increment by one and now what we're
gonna do is within this for loop we're
going to say set up a string called
display we're gonna say display is plus
equal to which is gonna add to address
we refer to our address list so we're
gonna say address address dot get
position zero or location zero and then
we're gonna say dot get addressed
address line and we're gonna refer to
our variable which we called I and then
we're just gonna print a new line so you
print a new line again just backslash in
and that's gonna set up our string so
let's get rid of our air we have to add
the catch exception the input/output or
we're just going to say finally and we
just need to get rid of this error so we
need to add a catch exception or finally
so we're just gonna say it finally and
have nothing in there so once we have
that finally we see we get an error here
so we actually need to catch
kind of exception so we're just gonna
say add catch clause to our parameter
and it's an input-output exception that
we're gonna catch so it sets it up for
us
we need to have that specific catch
because that's what we're trying here
and now when we run our application
let's hope everything works all right
and then finally what we're going to do
is and then after this for loop what
we're going to do is we're just going to
create a toast that's going to display
our address or a display string here so
we're just gonna say toast t is equal to
toast make text dot context can say get
base class or get base context which we
use I didn't really explain but that's
gonna be like our main context and we're
gonna say display and the duration toast
dot set length long and then we're just
gonna say dot t dot show so we're gonna
display our toast and we're getting an
error here because our string is set up
within this enter for loop so we're
gonna cut that and kind of define it
right here within our if statement and
now when we run our program sorry that
went a little quick there but again we
just need a string outside of our if or
a for statement and then we're gonna
display the toast just so we have
reference to the same variable let's run
it real quick and I'll go over a quick
overview of everything that we've done
in this that we did in this tutorial
because I know it went pretty quickly
but let's make sure it works first
what's up guys I ran our application on
the emulator and for some reason it
wasn't pulling up that dress but when I
ran it on my phone it was working so you
guys just can't take my word for it that
the way that we wrote it here does work
I would show you guys but you know I'm
too lazy to bust out my camera and it's
probably gonna be out of focus anyway so
it will display like you know if we zoom
in in the house you can click on that
house hold it down and then say get a
dress and it'll tell us the specific
address of that house so that's pretty
neat and I also told you guys how to
explain everything but this tutorials
getting kind of long so I'll probably do
that in the next tutorial because it's
going to be pretty short so just check
the next tutorial if you guys want a
better understanding of what we actually
set up here and I'll catch you then and
have a good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
