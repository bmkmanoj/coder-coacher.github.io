questions or suggesting suggestions or
ideas for my videos let me know there
now another thing I want to talk to you
guys about was my computer giveaway now
if you've been following my tutorials
you saw me build a custom computer and
teach you guys how to build on and at
the end I gave it away actually this
conscious is still going on and I'm
going to put a link to it in my
description box and once that video
reaches a hundred thousand views I'm
going to give it away to one of my
subscribers so my subscribers saw this
video and wonderful message me and told
me that he had this whole computer that
he had last year and that he never
really used it or anything because he
wasn't really in the computers back then
so I'm he messaged me and asked re Bucky
if I send you this computer can you give
it away in a contest and I was like
alright so I exchange information with
them in about a week later I got this
thing in the mail a brand-new dell
dimension 3000 computer that i upgraded
myself so since he asked me to give it
away in the contest this is what i'm
doing right now so what we're going to
do to give this away is this if you want
to win this computer the first thing you
need to do is subscribe my channel once
your subscriber you're eligible to win
if you're not yet then just click that
little yellow button on the left side of
your screen or actually on the right
side of your screen and once your
subscriber you're eligible to be in the
contest the next thing that you're going
to want to do is wait for this video to
hit 15,000 comments so comment comment
comment and wait for it to hit 15,000
comments and once it does i'm going to
pick the most recent comment and whoever
left that comment wins this computer so
again leave a comment until it gets
fifteen thousand comments and i'm going
to be waiting 15,000 comment
the most recent one I'm going to click
on their name make sure their subscriber

and another thing your comment it can be
about anything it doesn't matter what
it's about any comment will do as long
as your subscriber and as long as you
post a comment then you can win and
lastly once this contest has ended I'll
show you guys that is ended in the
description box so unless you see a link
to a new video or me saying that this
contest has ended in the description box
