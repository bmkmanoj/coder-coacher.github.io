another backgammon story in this
tutorial we're going to continue talking
about vacuum strategy and specifically
hitting versus making a new point now
you know that it's always good to hit
them when they have one checker on point
or to make a new point which means
picking two or more checkers and owning
a new point both of these are good
tactics but you often come across case
scenarios where you can either have the
option of a hitting one of their
checkers or be making a new point on the
board so in this tutorial we're going to
weigh the advantages and disadvantages
of both now the common rule is it's
usually better to hit them than to make
a new point and this doesn't only apply
to backgammon but everyday life usually
you want to hit someone as often as you
can't say you know I'm not only teaching
backgammon lessons but also life lessons
as well whenever you get the opportunity
to hit someone do it that's all I'm
saying so anyways let's go ahead and
take a look at a bad game example so we
now rolled a 3-1 us brown so here are
your two options you can go ahead and
play one two three one and this gives
you a new point and you now own the five
point making it hard for them to escape
this is a good move but it isn't your
best option you can also play your three
one this way you can also move one
checker one two three four
hit them and send them up on the bar so
when you have the option between making
the new point and hitting them what do
you choose and why well the correct
answer like I said before is you should
hit them in this case scenario and in
most case scenarios and you should do
four do that for three main reasons the
first reason is look how close white was
to bearing off they're already in their
home board so they're ready to bear off
and that checker is ready to go from the
endgame start bearing off and
potentially win the game but now
whenever you hit them it sends them way
back to the beginning and now this
checker instead of being able to bear
off with a 5 now has to travel the total
distance around the board in order to
bear off so that's why hitting them is
in that sense another way is you know
how I said making a new point is a good
idea like you can do right there we'll
check this out whenever you hit them
you don't just knock them on the bar but
you also are making a new point or at
least starting through right here this
is half a point basically and all you
need to make a new point on this 20 is
to roll a 4 on your next turn on your
next turn as soon as you roll for not
only you got your new point right here
but they're also still on the bar so
that's pretty much like making half a
point already so you can either make a
point with this or hit them and make
half a point just look at it that way
and the last thing I want to point out
is if you don't hit them and you make a
new point right here what happened
you gave white the opportunity to make a
new point on their next turn so if they
wrote one that five the five point now
belongs to them or your 20 point so
instead of you taking that point they
now have the point and that gives the
potential for your checkers to be
trapped back here so you never want to
give them the opportunity to track your
checkers behind and you always want to
make points so not only when you get a
attacked and you need a reenter that it
gives you an opportunity to re-enter
more successfully but also your triggers
you don't ever want them be tracked here
for example if they made a perfect prime
or any prime so anyways those are three
reasons why you should hit them rather
than making a new point a it sends their
white checker all the way back so they
have to travel the total distance of
board B you start a new point which on
the next turn it only takes one for to
make your new point anyways and C the
last thing you never want your checkers
to get trapped back here so whenever you
had an opportunity and make a point in
their home board you want to do that
so anyways that's all I have for you
guys for this story remember it's always
better to hit someone than to not so
