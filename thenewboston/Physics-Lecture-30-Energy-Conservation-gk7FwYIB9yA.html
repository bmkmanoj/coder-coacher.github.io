and in this video I want to talk to you
guys about one of the more interesting
topics in physics the law of
conservation of energy now if you looked
up this law in the textbook or online
it'd probably say something like the
total energy at the end of any event is
equal to the total energy before the
event but that's kind of a confusing
definition so you may have heard it like
this
energy can neither be created nor
destroyed basically energy can't come
from nowhere it had to come from some
other place
it was just converted into something
else so why is this important and I
thought we were talking about potential
energy and kinetic energy so what the
heck is all this crap well I'm going to
show you guys an example of how
potential energy can become kinetic
energy basically remember when I said
there is an apple that was on a tree and
it had the potential to turn into energy
but right now I'm just sitting there
doing nothing well the type of energy it
had the potential to become was in fact
kinetic energy now whenever we look at
real-life examples you're going to
notice a little fluctuation a little
loss in energy in some cases and I want
to explain you guys why that is so this
is a little side note take the example
of a pool ball and I'll say that this is
the cue ball and this is the eight-ball
so remember when I said that whenever
the cue ball hits the eight ball the
eight ball has it's pretty much going to
start moving and there's going to be a
transfer of energy the energy from the
cue ball is going to go to the eight
ball now if you run some calculations
and measure everything you would notice
that the eight ball does not absorb 100%
of the energy from the cue ball the
eight ball is going to move it of
velocity slightly slower than the cue
ball
so you're saying wait a minute if the
cue ball was supposed to transfer its
energy to the eight ball and the eight
ball isn't moving as fast then where the
heck did the energy go because the law
of conservation of energy says it can't
be lost you can't just get rid of energy
in the universe well some of this energy
turns into kinetic energy in the eight
ball starts moving
but aside from that much of its energy
goes into other forms of energy
specifically heat energy and sound
energy that's why you hear a noise
whenever the balls are going to hit each
other and also they're going to produce
a certain amount of heat so even though
whenever you're calculating strictly the
motion and velocity of these balls it's
going to look like some energy is lost
and these are going to be in real-life
examples in fact the law of conservation
of energy is not broken it's still valid
they just go to different forms of
energy so remember that energy can be
converted into different forms it just
can't be created nor destroyed so now
let's go ahead and take a look at an
example of when indeed this would be
useful let's go ahead and take a like
look at an energy calculation so say
that you were standing on a bridge and I
guess the bridge would look the lip it's
something I just make it really simple
this is a bridge and what's below a
sidewalk I guess this is a sidewalk and
I guess this is a building and hey if
we're going to get really creative I say
that this building sells tuna why not
it's my example so you were standing on
top of this building that's old tuna and
you had a big old meatball in your hand
why I don't know man just I don't know
it's my example these this is the first
thing that comes to my head whatever I'm
trying to think of an example meatballs
in tuna how bad is that so let's go
ahead and first take a look at this
energy calculation this meatball right
here it has a mass of five kilograms now
in addition to that how far are you
standing off the ground well we will say
that you were standing off the ground
20 meters so this meatball is 20 meters
in the air
with a mass of five kilograms so what we
need to do is we need to figure out how
much kinetic energy this meatball is
going to have whenever you drop it and
it hits the ground well in order to
figure that out
since kinetic energy you need
mass and velocity we don't have the
velocity yet so how we going to figure
out the kinetic energy well the first
thing we need to do is we need to figure
out what we can in this case the
potential energy so the potential energy
as we know equals well it equals the
weight of an object times height so in
other words since we don't have the
weight we only have the mass mass times
the force of gravity that's going to
give you your weight and you take this
and you multiply that by the height so
the potential energy of this meatball
equals five kilograms times the force of
gravity that's how fast is going to
that's how you tell how fast this
meatball is going to be sucked into the
earth with a force of 9.8 meters per
second squared and you take this and you
multiply it by the height which is 20
meters and whenever you do this you find
out that when you are holding a meatball
on top of a 20 meter building in this
meatball has a mass of five kilograms it
has a potential energy of 980 joules you
probably don't care about that you're
probably just hungry and you know just
want to eat that meatball but that's
important because now what we can do is
we realize that the kinetic energy right
before it hits the ground is going to be
equal to 980 joules why because then
right before it hits the ground it's
going to be moving instead of in your
hand and still so furthermore what we
can do is we realize that the kinetic
energy right before it hits the ground
is equal to one-half mass times velocity
squared so we know a couple pieces of
this equation the kinetic energy the
mass now we can figure out what's the
velocity of this object right before it
hits the ground
well the kinetic energy since the law of
conservation of energy is converting
this from potential to kinetic is going
to be 980 joules right before it hits
the ground now this is equal to one-half
the object's mass which is five
times its velocity squared so what we
can do now is figure out five times one
half whenever we take that and throw it
over nine eighty we get 392 and this is
going to be equal to its velocity
squared so if you were wondering
whenever I dropped this meatball from
this building how fast is it going to be
moving right before it hits the ground
well if we figure out this equation and
take the square root of both sides we
get an answer of maybe I shouldn't write
it right there it's velocity right
before it hits the ground is equal to
nineteen point eight meters per second
so how awesome is that only knowing the
mass and the distance from the ground we
can not only figure out its potential
energy its kinetic energy but we can
also figure out the velocity of the
meatball right before it hits the ground
so many pieces of information using
these simple calculations or formulas in
physics so hopefully you guys understand
a little bit about the law of
conservation of energy
how potential energy often becomes
kinetic energy and also how you can with
few pieces of information figure out a
whole lot of crap so thank you guys for
watching don't forget subscribe and I'll
see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
