and welcome to another amazing chemistry
tutorial in this video I want to talk to
you guys about storing chemicals know
typically whenever you're buying
containers for storage you want to buy a
mixture of plastic and glass and you
also want to buy a variety of different
sizes to sort a different amounts of
chemicals now here are some of my legal
chemicals and a couple tips I have for
storing chemicals first of all make sure
to store them in proper containers
whenever you buy chemicals online they
typically don't come in the best
containers for example my copper sulfate
in my potassium chlorate whenever I
bought them they pretty much came in
like a plastic bag so obviously I move
them to a little bit better storage
containers another thing of course make
sure to label everything a lot of these
chemicals look the same for example this
potassium chlorate and you know boric
acid they pretty much look the same as
you know baking soda so if they weren't
labeled it would just be a guessing game
not very good and the last you know kind
of mini tip I have is make sure not to
store reactive chemicals next to each
other if something happens like you have
a leak in the bottle you don't want it
reacting and causing an explosion so
none of these chemicals right here of
course you have some reactions like your
vinegar and your baking soda or your
sulfuric acid can react with potassium
chlorate but they really need to be
heated up to properly react with each
other so right now I have everything
separated in a proper way and all my
very reactive stuff I don't even store
in here I keep completely separate now
aside from storing your bulk chemicals
it's also useful to have a smaller
variety of bottles and jars so for
example these ones right here whenever
you've synthesized a new chemical or if
you're just playing around and you make
something in a small amount it's useful
to store these in a smaller bottle
instead of you know a big jar so that's
what these are right here and another
cool thing is they're actually really
cheap usually given by the Dozen or a 20
pack for example I think these ones came
in a 20 pack and I think this entire
thing was under $10 so it's nice to have
a mixture of
stick and glass and also like I said a
variety of different sizes now the last
thing I want to mention before I let you
guys go is be careful whenever you're
storing concentrated acids or very
concentrated basis because concentrated
bases like sodium hydroxide or potassium
hydroxide they can actually eat through
glass so make sure that you don't store
very concentrated bases in glass
containers and another thing is whenever
you have a concentrated acid they can
actually eat through certain types of
plastic so just make sure you know do a
quick google on the chemical and see the
proper storing procedures and that's
going to make sure that you know of
course your chemical doesn't eat through
your container</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
