and I'll explain a few things within the
preset manager now we have the ability
to load more of our presets if we wanted
to so if I wanted to go let's go to
crack's brushes here I'll click on that
and load it it'll load them within the
preset manager almost the same as doing
it within the drop-down menu up there we
if we click on a a preset brush a brush
preset we can also rename it and this
one has a name we could rename it if we
wanted to if we want to keep these
brushes together we can select them all
or you can select separate ones hold
ctrl to deselect certain ones you don't
want or select ones that you want you
can hit save set and then you can save
out an a brush a whole brush set like
the things we were loading together and
then we have the option to delete them
out of our brushes preset manager there
so that's how you use the preset manager
you can also do this with things like
Styles patterns and all that stuff
swatches you can add different swatches
in here if you want so that's pretty
cool and your swatches will appear over
here on the right so let's uh I think I
think that gives you a pretty good
overview of the preset manager another
thing that I wanted to show you that is
new in Photoshop cs6 is the ability to
migrate presets or export and import
presets now migrating presets is for
migrating from older versions of
Photoshop and since I don't have any
older versions of Photoshop on here I'm
not able to show you this so if you in
Photoshop cs5 you would be able to
migrate your old presets into Photoshop
cs6 very easily
now if I go to import or export import
presets I have the ability to import my
different presets here so let me go to
click on import and then i go to select
import folder i could come down to I've
got to find my folder computer that's my
external
let's go to resources sorry about that I
was thinking and then Photoshop brushes
and now I could load any of these that I
really wanted to let's let's do coffee
stain hit okay and then I click on it
and I'll hit the button to bring it over
to presets to import and I'll hit import
presets and now if I go to let me get
this out of my way I go to the brush let
me make this brush a little smaller so I
can like see what the hell I'm doing all
right click on this and then we go up
here to our gear load brushes and see if
I can figure out where it went
so the preset isn't going to show up in
our manager or in our drop-down menu
because we need to restart Photoshop so
let's do that and I'm going to run
Photoshop here I run it as administrator
so I can save to certain areas sometimes
I get the not available to save in this
area kind of stupid thing
so open up what we just had you don't
you need to open up to see this but I
like to have it on there so I can start
drawing and then I move down the preset
button here click on the gear and then
down here at the bottom we have the
coffee stain brushes preset we can
either replace the whole entire set or
we can append this to the dependent to
the bottom we're just going to hit OK
for to replace
Save Changes current brushes no thanks
so now we got our coffee stains here so
that's how you manage your presets and
that's how you get them to show up down
here for quick and easy access so
hopefully you guys learned how to use
these fairly well and nice awesome and
hopefully the this helps you save a lot
of time so just take some time to manage
your preset your brush presets and then
we can then you can start like using
them all the time and not have to worry
about manage or doing anything else
later you don't want to be stuck having
to manage your brush presets while
you're working on a deadline for a
project because that just wastes time
obviously so do it on your free time
when you don't have anything to do is
and that's my advice to you so I'll see
you guys in the next tutorial thanks for
watching subscribe if you want some more
Photoshop tutorials to be notified about
so see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
