33rd java game development tutorial and
and this is all we're going to be
learning about something called
mouselook and if you're wondering what
the H is mouth look then I'll tell you
mouth look is like this if you ever
played a first-person shooter especially
on your computer like doom probably or
modern warfare you know that whenever
you want to look around all you have to
do is move your mouse on the screen but
we can't really do this right now
because whenever we move our mouse and
it hits the edge of the screen we'll
stop looking so what we want to do is we
wanted to be able to do 360s and give
our player total freedom of wherever
they want to look around so we need to
make sure that our mouse never hits the
edge of the screen and we do this using
something called a robot and what a
robot does is automatically move your
mouse for you aside from you physically
moving your mouse so that's what Mouse
look is is pretty much um enables you to
scroll forever I mean you can really
scroll forever instead of just getting
to the edge of the screen and stopping
so let's go ahead and get started we'll
go ahead and I already made a class I
named it look and make sure you have all
your imports right here and also I
implemented Mouse motion listener so you
can respond to Mouse motion events such
as drag and move and also key listener
right here and I implement key listener
because whenever we want to escape our
program we need a key to escape in
that's going to be the escape key so
let's go ahead and get started first we
need a private image so we can actually
see something scrolling around on our
screen stuff just a white screen and I'm
going to name it I'm just going to use
my background image and now we need a
robot object so grab it robot from the
robot class and I'm just going to name
my robot since this is your first
tutorial don't get into and confused now
we need to keep track of three points on
our screen and there's actually a point
class where we can do this so make
private points and the first one is our
mouse location
and let me just go ahead and copy this
save me some time and the other one is
going to be the center of your screen
which is Centrepointe and the last one
is going to be that background image so
we're going to be pretty much keeping
track of three things location the mass
location the center point on your
screens location in the images or that
background image right here location and
now we need one more boolean value so
private
booooo lean centering and this is going
to be true while your mouse is centering
on your screen and false while your
mouse is already in the center of the
screen so that's what all these
variables do we're going to be actually
using them well let's go ahead and get
right into it the first method of this
is of course our init like always public
void in it and what this is going to do
first and foremost is called our super
init so we can get all our good classes
from last time and all that good stuff
and next let's go ahead and actually
take these point objects and set them
equal to something mouse equals new
points and we're going to be doing this
for every point and now once we do this
we can actually start giving it some
value some mouse center of your screen
and your image so pretty much all these
three things are locations on your
screen so now we'll go ahead and since
we aren't centering anything right now
centering equals false now aside from
that the only really variable that we
didn't work with is the background and
the robot so let's go ahead and do that
right now
after we create all these what we want
to try is we want to set that robot
actually equal to a new robot object so
we can use it later on after this what
we want to do is we're going to make a
method to Center the mouse on your
screen and it's going to be called
recenter Mouse so we're going to make a
robot object we're going to get a method
that called recenter Mouse and what this
does is pretty much take your cursor and
put it back in the middle of the screen
and this is how your mouse is never
going to hit the edge of the screen
and what this is going to do is it's
going to give you your center points at
the screen X&amp;amp;Y
so aside from that we want to take mouse
to X which is the location of the mouse
x value which is left and right and set
it equal to the center of the screen to
X so this recenter mouse is going to
give you your center of the screen and
now we're going to set the mouse equal
to that point so therefore our mouse is
in the middle of screen how easy is that
so now your mouse is y value equal to
the center of the screen and it's Y
value so now our mouth should be
chilling in the center of the screen and
now what do we want to do after that
well we've got to go ahead and catch
exception and the X might want to
actually put an exception here just put
like system.out.print line and put
exception one and what I like to do
here's a neat little thing instead of
writing what my exception is all I go is
if I ever get an exception I name all my
exceptions one two whatever um you know
however long my program is 10 or
something then if I ever print out an
exemption all I have to do is scroll
through until I get to that exception
then look what code that didn't run so
instead of trying to read all right
unable to create a robot or unable to
recenter mouse instead of me having like
80 to recenter Mouse methods I just go
to that exception so you know that's on
the ill tip you can write anything you
want in there but just that I throw that
out there and now let's go ahead and do
a couple more things set our window
object equal to s dot get full screen
and if you're wondering all right how
can we use this screen object when we
never even created one well if you
remember in our super classes
initialization which was the core we
created a screen object so and since we
inherited everything from there we were
able to create a screen object from
right there now we need to go ahead and
add mouse motion listener and it's just
going to be this which is the window and
window dot add key listener and that's
going to be this as well
which is again the window hasn't changed
next set your background equal to new
image icon and remember these being
string
I put mine and see I put it in a folder
called test and I put it in a file
called back jpg and now after that you
just need to get image using the built
in get image method and we are good to
go so let me make sure I put an C test
two backslashes of course so it escapes
itself and we are good to go for this
method so that's all you need to do to
get started in the initialization method
pretty much called the superclass's
initialization and give all your
variables on something to be referenced
to so in the next tutorial we're going
to be going over the draw method and
also some other methods we have time but
for now thank you guys for watching we
are well on our way to using the mouse
look feature so again thank you guys one
more time don't get subscribe and I'll
see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
