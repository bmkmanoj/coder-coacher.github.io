welcome to your very first java tutorial
now in this order before we begin
writing any programs we first need to
download something called the JDK and
for all you new Java developers out
there this is the program that lets you
actually write Java and actually compile
it
and compile it just means a transferring
it from code you can understand the code
the computer can understand so just
follow me and by the end you'll be able
to write Java code so the first thing I
need you to do is go ahead and open up
your internet browser right here and
once you have that open I'm going to use
fire fact Firefox go ahead and go to the
website Java dot sun.com and this is
gonna give you give you Javas main page
what you want to look for is the
download link and this is gonna give you
a bunch of different Java editions to
download you're gonna want to go to the
Java SE link and this stands for a Java
standard edition so go ahead and click
that and what we're looking for is
something called the JDK in this stands
for Java development kit so we can write
in a well compiled Java programs now we
just want the top one which is a
standard one on this EE stands for
Enterprise Edition this and that beans
is something else we don't want that so
just go ahead and find the standard
basic Edition and click download and
once you click that it's replicant bring
its a new page let's see and yep and
it's gonna say Windows which we want
English which we want go ahead and agree
and press continue I already have this
downloaded so I'm not going to download
it again though just be stupid but once
you download it is gonna give you an
executable file now um your executable
file is going to look something like one
of these this is something else I
downloaded but it's gonna give you a
file like this called e x e once you get
that file go ahead and double click this
and that's going to start the wizard to
download the JDK now it also might give
you a file on your desktop right here
like put it somewhere right here if it's
right there Jan just double click that
and once you do a Wizards are gonna pop
up and you're probably gonna have to
click like next 40 times and press I
agree I agree to some stuff next next
but once that's all done then you're
gonna have the Java compiler downloaded
now let me show you guys what the Java
compiler is if you go to your Start menu
then press CMD and press Enter
your command prompt is going to come up
now what this allows you to do is have
access to your java compiler and again
like I said before to duck the Java
compiler allows you to transfer code
that you can understand to code the
computer can understand and that's what
we just downloaded so let's test it out
Java C press Enter nothing's working and
nothing's working because the Java
compiler it has it downloaded but
whenever you try to use it it doesn't
know where it is so let me show you guys
how to do that and again pay very close
attention to this
hopefully you downloaded it with all the
default settings if you didn't then
while you're still gonna be able to see
what's going on but go ahead and in your
Start menu click on computer now go
ahead and click the local disk witch or
whatever your main hard drive is then go
ahead and click program files now you
should have a folder called Java go
ahead and click that now go ahead and
click the Virgin JDK if you don't see
this that means you didn't download it
right so go ahead and click that JDK the
next thing in last thing I want you guys
to do is click on the thing that says
bin right here and remember you follow
all these instructions very carefully
next right click on any of these things
right here just click on your topmost
run remember right click it and click
properties now this is where you're
going to tell Java to look for your
compiler so it says location go ahead
and copy all of location right clicking
be it it should say something like C
program files Java your version and say
been the last thing make sure you get
that bin that's very important if you're
not if you don't see it then do this
tutorial again and do exactly as I say
anyways you want to see that bin so once
you have this golden code that's what
we're looking for go ahead and X out of
that now that's where you the compiler
is so how do we tell your computer to
look there well go ahead and go ahead to
click on my computer again from your
Start menu and click properties remember
you want to right click it and click
properties all these are very important
go ahead and click advanced system
settings
and probably a little message is going
to pop up if my computer is not freezing
and it is so my computer properties
advanced system settings there we go
continue and you're gonna see something
in your system properties called
environment and variables go ahead and
click that and pay attention what I'm
gonna do here what we want to do is
create a new user variable so go ahead
and click a new now the variable name
for this you have to write pass PA th
and the variable value is going to right
where that compiler is remember that
link with a bin so that's why it's
really important that you get that link
now go ahead and click OK
and bam click OK on this ok and you now
have your compiler setup and ready to
run so go ahead and go back to your
command line and in command line go
ahead and type Java sea and unlike
before we now have a bunch of crap that
pops up and this crap means that our
compiler is ready and set and ready to
go so now with that being said we know
that we are now able to write Java
programs so in the next tutorial
I'll show you guys how to do that but
for now just follow this tutorial that's
how you install a Java on your computer
so you can actually write Java programs
if you didn't follow those instructions
exactly like I said you're not going to
be able to write Java programs on your
computer so make sure follow this
tutorial very carefully do exactly as I
did I know it's kind of a pain in the
butt but it'll be worth it in the long
run so um thank you guys for watching
make sure you get a job in salt if you
have any questions or I wasn't clear on
anything just send me a message or leave
a comment and hopefully I'll get back to
you so again thank you guys for watching
hopefully you have Java installed and in
next tutorial I'll show you guys how to
write our first Java program so thank
you don't forget to subscribe to my
channel and I'll see you in the next
tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
