welcome to your fourth iPhone
development tutorial super excited about
this tutorial because we are finally
going to be going over some user
interaction a way to interact with the
user not just you know showing them some
text on the screen because you know
that's cool but I think that cool so
here is the app we're going to be
building two buttons and a label it's
top of the screen that you can't see
whenever you click a button the label
pops up with a buttons name in it so you
click red red pops up blue blue pops up
red red blue red blue blue red blue you
know pretty easy pretty awesome program
we're gonna be creating so again we have
a label on the top and two buttons on
the bottom you can actually put the
buttons anywhere you want but anyways
that's reminder so you know I thought it
was pretty cool so go ahead and open
Xcode and let's go ahead and get started
with this we're gonna be doing is
creating a new Xcode project and just go
ahead and make it a view-based
as last time choose and name anything
you want I'm gonna name mine
Bucky's buttons I think that's kind of a
catchy name maybe we can market that so
go ahead and before we jump right into
building all the buttons and labels on
the interface what we're going to be do
first or gonna be do first what what
we're going to be doing first is taking
a look at these classes now these
classes you see a couple things first of
all these delegate classes these are
pretty much the built-in methods pretty
much the background housekeeping stuff
we usually don't want to mess with these
well we are gonna be messing with is
these view controller this view
controller class now this view
controller class is the class that
controls all the stuff on your screen
from this class you can control the
buttons the labels the colors anything
on your iPhone screen or iPod screen you
can control using this class pretty cool
huh
hence the name view controller so let's
go ahead first and jump into your view
controller header and go ahead and
delete these comments
really need those I didn't think so so
before we start typing code I want to
give you guys a little background of how
code and objects on your screen interact
with each other so we're gonna have this
code that we type in in this class all
right that's cool and then we're gonna
have a bunch of buttons and labels on
our iPod or iPhone all right that's cool
I see this but how does the code
actually connect with those buttons well
whenever you type a code in your class
you're gonna be making these things
called outlets and an outlet it's pretty
much your code representation of that
object so say you made an object and by
the way all an outlet is going to be is
pretty much a variable so say you made a
button on your screen you can make an
outlet variable in your code so whenever
you change that variable say a property
of that variable it will actually change
that button on your screen so you know
they're pretty much one in the same
again these are called outlets outlets
are pretty much variables that are
connected to objects on the screen so
whenever you change the outlet you
change the object on the screen all
right so we know the basics of how to
change an object on your screen but
there's also these things that you can
connect to the objects on your screen
that are called actions and this is how
you call code from objects so out let's
go from the code to the objects but you
can also do actions that go from the
object to the code let me give you guys
a quick example whenever you click a
button on your screen it's going to call
an action and this action might be
something like run a method maybe
calculate you know how much gas mileage
I'm getting in my car
when I click a button call an action to
calculate you know how much a doc you
ace you know so whenever you create an
action pretty much you can set up an
object on your screen like a button to
trigger a special method called an
action
so that's where we're gonna be doing in
this story we're gonna be using an
outlet to change the label on the screen
and whenever we click those buttons
they're gonna call actions to call
methods in our program so you know I
think it's about enough time of me
talking let's go ahead and get coding
the first thing we're gonna be doing is
creating an object to represent that
label on the screen now the built-in UI
label is the class to represent any
label and I'm gonna go ahead and just
name mine
labels text so whenever we you know work
with this object labels text we're gonna
be working with that label you know that
text that appeared on screen that either
said red or blue so what we want to do
now is since we need to actually use
this outlet to change the object on the
screen that label we actually need to
build this outlet so how do we actually
build outlets well the first step to do
this is to use that property and if you
don't know what property is I taught you
guys this in Objective C tutorials so
that is why I wanted you guys to go over
learn the objective-c tutorials first
what property does it actually just
builds the setter and getters or
mutators and access or methods for you
but we don't just build this property
like any other normal property we're
gonna want to include two keywords
non-atomic and retain now let's go ahead
and finish building this in order to
build an outlet go ahead and type in the
keyword i-b outlet and then go ahead and
type in UI label and of course your
property's name which is labels text and
are saying alright I mean you really
don't need to know what these two mean
right now but I know a bunch we were
gonna ask me so for you people and new
people only and for you guys who really
don't care don't pay Jen don't pay
attention in this non-atomic pretty much
means that
in Mac OS 10 the default is to create
extra code for multi-threaded programs
we don't need that in iPhone program so
just set it to non-atomic it means get
rid of the extra code retain pretty much
means keep your variable in memory so
you know it doesn't get lost usually
what you want to do is anytime you're
creating a property that isn't just a
basic raw data type like int char flow
you want to retain it if you're creating
just a basic property you like you know
an X then you don't need this at all but
usually retain any property that isn't
raw like this one simple enough so this
is how you create an outlet and again
this outlet whenever we change this
object it's going to change that object
on the screen that we link it to so the
only other thing that we need to include
is the interface is that action now
whenever we create an action we're gonna
link it to the buttons so here's how you
do this every time you create an action
you need to pass in IB action this is
what it returns I'm gonna name my action
clicked because it's gonna happen when
the button is clicked and you want to
pass it ID sender and what the sender is
is pretty much gonna be that button
that's gonna be passed in so this is the
method that's gonna be called whenever
you click a button and I know all of
this isn't gonna make a lot of sense in
this tutorial but in the next tutorial
I'm gonna clear things up and we're
actually gonna be building the code to
explain everything so I mean we're
pretty much just built the titles of
everything now in the next story I'm
gonna be showing you the code how to
make everything interact and work so I
thank you guys for watching don't forget
subscribe and definitely check out the
next tutorial it's going to be good one
so thanks for watching and I'll see you
later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
