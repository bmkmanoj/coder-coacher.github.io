and in this video i'm going to talk
about cells and cell structures just a
random side note i picked up a java
monster Irish Blin Irish coffee without
the alcohol in it it is absolutely
fantastic so now that I have a massive
amount of caffeine and whatever other
energy supplements they put in this
thing I'm ready to go cells come in a
variety of shapes and sizes they are you
can have unicellular organisms which
only have one cell or multicellular
organisms which have two or more cells
humans for example contain about one
trillion cells that's a lot of cells
cells perform metabolic functions to
sustain life and they divide to produce
new cells that are identical the parts
of a cell are known as organelles or
little organs most of these organelles
are only found in eukaryotic cells
unless you decide to take a microbial
diversity class in which case you will
find that this is not completely true
but you don't need to worry about this
for the scope of basic biology anyways
the first organelle we are going to talk
about is the cell membrane this is the
outer boundary of a sale also called the
plasma membrane this is composed of a
bilayer or double layer of phospholipid
molecules with proteins embedded within
if you remember from my organic
chemistry lecture video rather a
phospholipid you've got your lipid
molecule here with your hydrophobic
tails hydrophobic meaning water hating
and you've got your phosphate group here
which is hydrophilic or water loving the
cell membrane controls what enters and
leaves the cell and it is semipermeable
which means some molecules can enter
some can't and the model we use for the
cell membrane is called the fluid fluid
mosaic model you have your proteins
embedded within the phospholipids
there's another protein you've got the
hydrophilic phosphate groups on the
outside in
with water and you've got the
hydrophobic tails facing each other so
they interact with each other they don't
have to worry about touching water or
anything like that the cytoplasm it is
all the cell material between the plasma
membrane and the nucleus and organelles
are located within the cytoplasm you had
these cytoskeleton these are proteins
proteins that are located in the
cytoplasm responsible for maintaining
cellular shape holding organelles in
place moving the cell and moving
structures within the cell and the
cytoskeleton is composed of
microfilaments and microtubules
microfilaments are really long then
structures microtubules are two straight
tube shaped structures we next have the
endoplasmic reticulum or ER not to be
confused with ET over here which is
extraterrestrial anyways ER is a system
of membranes extending from the nuclear
membrane it control is responsible for
movement of materials through the cell
synthesis of proteins and modification
of other molecules and you have two
different types you have rough
endoplasmic reticulum which has ratlam
organelles called ribosomes bound to it
and you have smooth endoplasmic
reticulum which does not contain any
ribosomes ribosomes are the sites of
protein synthesis there are freestanding
ribosomes which are just scattered
throughout the cytoplasm or you have
ribosomes that are attached to the ER
ribosomes that are resetting are
involved with cellular protein synthesis
ribosomes that are attached to the ER
are involved with proteins that are
going to be exported from the cells Winx
have Koji bodies are also known as the
Golgi apparatus this is a series of
membrane stacks they receive what these
are all transport things called vesicles
from the endoplasmic reticulum and they
modify and package these molecules for
transport and vesicles are just little
storage areas that are enclosed by some
sort of
rain vacuoles are big storage areas
lysosomes are a special type of vacuole
these contain digestive enzymes so if
you were to bust open a lysosome within
the cell it would destroy the cell it
would eat the cell alive basically
lysosomes are different because they
have not won membrane but two membranes
so two phospholipid bilayers instead of
just one next we have peroxisomes
they're similar to lysosomes and they
can say contain enzymes or proteins that
neutralize toxins gly oxys ohms are
similar to proxies ohms they contain
enzymes proteins that convert fatty
acids to carbohydrates we next have the
mitochondria these are the powerhouses
of the cells they they have two
membranes and inner membrane and an
outer membrane the outer membrane
separates the mitochondria from the
cytoplasm the inner membrane is the site
of the electron transport chain and ATP
adenosine triphosphate synthesis this is
called they are the sites of cellular
respiration the nucleus is the location
of most of the DNA and RNA the cell
makes it's also a double membrane so two
membranes containing these big holes
called pores where things can enter and
leave the nucleus and within the nucleus
is a structure called the nucleolus
which is the site for synthesis and
storage of RNA next we have flagella and
cilia these are cytoskeletal app
cytoskeletal extensions from the cell
surface and they're involved with
movement think of flagella as these long
tails that extend from the cell celia
are more like little itty bitty tiny
hairs on the surface of the cell the
cell wall is composed of different
molecules depending on what type of
organism organism you have for example
plant cells have cell walls
of cellulose fungi have cell walls
compose of a molecule called chitin cell
walls are very rigid they're involved
with structure and support of the cell
as well and they are located outside of
the plasma membrane pluses are found in
organisms that are capable of
photosynthesis you have Luca plast or
amyloplasts that store a molecule called
starch chromic last store pigments which
are involved with color different
pigments produce different colors red
white green blue what have you and then
you have chloroplasts which contain the
molecule chlorophyll and these are the
sites of photosynthesis and finally we
have organelles called centrioles which
are involved in cell division you really
only find these in animal cells but this
is all I have for cellular structures in
my next two videos i'll be going over
the differences between plant and animal
cells i'll show you pictures of
everything so hopefully it'll make it a
little bit more sense</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
