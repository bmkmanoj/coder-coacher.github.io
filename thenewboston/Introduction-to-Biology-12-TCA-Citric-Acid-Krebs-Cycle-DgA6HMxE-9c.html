this video i'm going to be talking about
the TCA / citric acid / kreb cycle
they're all the same things I don't know
why it has so many different names
probably just to confuse people but
anyways this is a process is going to
take place in the mitochondria of
eukaryotic cells takes place in the
cytoplasm / cellular membranes
prokaryotic cells and it is an aerobic
process in which pyruvate is combined
with some other molecules and carbon
dioxide is really least two molecules of
ATP are formed and it's also going to
form a bunch of other intermediates that
are used in other biochemical pathways
so this is a very very important pathway
in cells you can create fatty acids and
amino acids and bunch of other things
from the intermediates you get from this
cycle so before you actually enter this
cycle you have to take pyruvate from
glycolysis and you have to break it down
into a molecule called acetyl coenzyme a
this is done by the enzyme pyruvate
decarboxylase so you've got your
pyruvate right here a three carbon
molecule you're going to have your
coenzyme a come in and also some nad the
oxidized form pyruvate decarboxylase is
going to chop off this carbon dioxide
group right here it's going to attach
the coenzyme a to the acetate group
that's phone as at a curve this one and
in the process is going to reduce nad to
NADH so now when you actually enter the
cycle you've got your asset eel coenzyme
a and a molecule of what is called
oxaloacetate these are going to combine
together to form the six carbon molecule
citrate or citric acid whatever you want
to call it the enzyme that does this is
called citrate synthase it's going to
combine a molecule water and sto
coenzyme a and ox
acetate it's going to kick off that
coenzyme a attach everything together
and then you've got citrate and the
reason this is called the TCA cycle
means tricarboxylic acid cycle is
because citrate has three carboxylic
acid groups you got one right here one
right there and then one right there the
next step is a two-part process in which
citrate is reconfigured moved or like
some of the stuff is moved around and
you get the smaller Kuehl called
isocitrate this is called an
isomerization reaction it is done by the
enzyme econo taste first off sit
straight has a water removed you've got
the hydroxyl here on carbon 3 one of the
hydrogen's from carbon 5 coming off its
going to form a double bond between
carbon 3 and carbon 5 and then this
water is going to be put back on except
for instead of the hot hydroxyl group
bringing on the third carbon and
hydrogen being on the fifth carbon it's
going to be the other way around so
you've got the hydroxyl group here on
the fifth carbon the hydrogen here on
the third carbon to form isocitrate the
next step is also a two-part process in
which isocitrate is decarboxylated and
oxidized into alpha ketoglutarate this
is all done by the enzyme isocitrate
dehydrogenase so the first thing that's
going to happen is isocitrate is going
to be oxidized into oxalis succinate nad
is going to be reduced to NADH so
basically you're converting this alcohol
into a ketone or a carbonyl group rather
right here and then the next step this
carbon dioxide or this carboxylic acid
group right here is going to be kicked
off in the form of carbon dioxide so you
go from a six carbon molecule to a five
carbon molecule and with the oxidized
alcohol group right here on carbon four
alpha ketoglutarate is going to be
oxidized into a molecule called
succinylcholine zymn a it's also going
to kick off another carbon dioxide in
the process this is done by the enzyme
alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase so
you're going to have this carboxylic
acid group right here kicked off its
going to attach the coenzyme a and in
the process is going to reduce an ad to
NADH in the next step succinylcholine
zombie is going to be broken down to
coenzyme a and succinate this is an
exergonic reaction ramin which means
it's going to release energy and this is
going to drive the synthesis of 80 adp
to ATP actually first it forms molecule
called GTP and then GTP transfers its
fast great group adp blah blah blah but
all you need to know is that during this
step ATP is formed the molecule that
does this is called succinylcholine sime
sip the tastes so you got your sexy
little coenzyme a to succinate really
all it's going to do is kick off this
coenzyme a and form the carboxylic acid
here succinate is then going to be
oxidized to make what is called fumarate
during the process it's going to reduce
a molecule called qk width also known as
Queen all or coenzyme Q it's going to
reduce that to qh2 succinate
dehydrogenase is just going to chop off
two of these hydrogen's right here to
make a trans double bond forming the
molecule fumarate the enzyme femur race
is going to combine a water with
fumarate to form the molecule male 8 the
hydroxyl group from water is going to
attach to the second carbon the hydrogen
from water is going to attach to the
third carbon you see you got rid of that
double bond there as well and the last
step is when male 8 is oxidized to form
ox
acetate again it's going to reduce an ad
to NADH by converting this alcohol or
hydroxyl group whatever you want to call
it into a carbonyl group here on the
second carbon so you got mail 8 to form
oxaloacetate and then the cycle gets to
start all over again so the overall
procedure of the cycle produces three
molecules of NADH one molecule of fadh2
one ATP and two carbon dioxide's but
since you get two molecules of pyruvate
after every psyche or every cycle of
glycolysis both of these things are
going to go through so you get a total
of six and a th to fadh2 s two atps and
four carbon dioxide's from every
molecule of glucose but that is all I
have for the citric acid cycle</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
