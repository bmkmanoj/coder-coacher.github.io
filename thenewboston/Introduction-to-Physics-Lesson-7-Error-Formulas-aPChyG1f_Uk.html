welcome to your seventh physics tutorial
and in this story I'm gonna be showing
you guys how to calculate something
called absolute air and percentage air
it's basically the formula you use
whenever you want to figure out how much
did you mess up by it's actually one of
the very first formulas that your
teacher teaches you in either college or
high school physics so say for example
that you were doing your very first
college lab and your teacher wanted you
to find the weight of a cheeseburger or
something so what they did is they gave
you this cheeseburger however maybe your
equipment wasn't right on point or maybe
you smoked a little pot before class so
you weren't really on top of your game
so we needed to you know find out the
answer that we got was probably a little
bit different and then answer that it
should have been so in order to
calculate how much we messed up by we
can use these formulas called air
functions or air formulas so before we
go ahead and get to the formulas I need
to talk to you guys about some variables
now whenever we're working with these
formulas D D a is going to stand for
absolute air now for example this
basically means in everyday terms how
much did you mess up by say for example
we have a cow that weighed 300 pounds
however whenever you measured it you
found that it weighed 290 pounds and
that may be because you know you weren't
paying attention really to the scale or
maybe the scale you waited on is from
you know sixteen hundred and twenty the
years sixteen hundred and twenty so you
know it's not the most reliable scale so
anyways you messed up by ten pounds so
ten would be your absolute error so
that's your quick little you know
explanation that basically means how
much did you mess up by now the other
variables we need is X M
and XM is not the radio it means
measured value or basically the value
that you came up with so in this case it
would be 290 since that's the value that
you came up with I'm really pretty
handwriting I just noticed that and the
last variable is X a if I can write that
correctly
I'll get that eventually give me some
time XA equals actual value and this
pretty much means the correct value or
the value that it should be so the
correct weight of the cow was 300 so I'm
gonna go ahead and just give you guys
another real quick example so say we
want to kill calculate the absolute err
let me think of something we'll go ahead
and do the cheeseburger example so say
our teacher gave us a cheeseburger and
we needed to find the mass of that
cheeseburger well whenever we calculated
the mass of that cheeseburger we found
that it had a mass of 5.8 kilograms
however when our teacher did it she got
a value of 5.6 so she knows what she's
doing so 5.6 kilograms is the actual
value so what we need to do is we need
to take 5.8 and subtract 5.6 and we get
point 2 kilograms for da in other words
our absolute error is point 2 kilograms
that's how much we messed up by pretty
simple stuff huh so now let me go ahead
and add a new layer and show you guys
how to calculate percentage error now
the variable is a little bit different
it's actually just written a little bit
different it's D percentage and this
stands for percentage
err I probably have the best handwriting
in the world so d percent equals
percentage air and this basically means
instead of coming up with a value like
point two or you know ten pounds
whatever we come up with a percent so
it's like we messed up by ten percent or
three percent or something like that so
let me go ahead and change my color let
me change it to something like bright
red so say we had well let me give you
guys the formula for percentage air so
the formula for percentage air equals
100 times our measured value XM minus
the actual value over the actual value
so this looks really complicated but
it's actually really easy so let me go
ahead and I guess we'll do that a
cheeseburger example let's see if I can
remember the values so we came up with
what was it five point eight kilograms
I'll leave the kilograms out and the
actual value was five point six so what
we do is we take five point eight minus
five point six and then we get point two
and we need to divide that by the actual
value now the actual value was five
point six so point two divided by five
point six equals point zero three five
seven so what we need to do now is we
need to take this number and times by
100 so all we need to do in order to
times the 500 move the decimal points
two places to the right
so three point five seven is our
percentage air pretty cool huh
so basically again one last time is we
take the measured value which is five
point eight and subtract the actual
value which is five point six and we get
this number right here in this case it
was point two and we take that invited
by the actual value which was five point
six again this number and this number
are the same
and then all we need to do is once we
have our value times by a hundred and
bam there we go our percentage err
perfect and hopefully this number is as
small as possible if this number small
it means you did a really good job if
this number is big it means that you
know you might want to lay off the weed
before class just a little bit so there
you go that's how you calculate errors
and yeah like I said hopefully we won't
be using this formula too much but
whenever we need it there it is so thank
you guys for watching don't forget
subscribe and I'll see you guys in the
next story</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
