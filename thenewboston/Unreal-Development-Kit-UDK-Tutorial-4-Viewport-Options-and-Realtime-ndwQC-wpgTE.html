watching this Michelle Phan video real
quick and okay let's just get rid of
that kind of embarrassing but do you
guys ever do that you just see a hot
girl in the video and you just click it
even though you know it's a dumb makeup
tutorial I can't resist um a guy so you
know blame me but anyways welcome back
to your fourth you decade story and in
this tutorial I want to talk to you guys
about this thing right here the viewport
toolbar we're probably not going to be
covering everything in this tutorial but
we're going to knock a couple things out
so basically I want to stress to you
guys that every single viewport has a
toolbar and what this toolbar allows you
to do is allows you kind of the
customize your view - depending on how
you're working with your 3d models what
you're doing it allows you to set it up
exactly how you want so this you know
red block is nice and all but I'm going
to go ahead and open a map that's a
little bit more interesting so go ahead
and hit file open and go ahead and open
V CTF actually just open your favorite
map it doesn't really matter what it is
again this is a lot better than you know
that red block so the very first thing I
want to talk to you guys about is this
the viewport options drop-down menu now
believe it or not all of these things I
don't want to say all of these things
about 80% of these options in here are
just an alternative to these buttons so
you can either they have these buttons
or you can choose them in the drop down
menu so it's not like totally new set of
options they just give you different way
you can choose it a couple things in
this menu however are not options in our
tool bar menu so we need to cover those
the first thing I want to cover is the
show menu right here I know you guys
don't know what half this stuff is right
now or probably all of it right now but
whenever we're working in our viewport
we notice all these little designer
light bulbs and wireframes and lines and
stuff whenever we learn what these
things are and we said all right I want
to see something but it isn't displaying
in my viewport chances are that's
because you don't have this
in your show menu now again I know you
guys don't know any of these things are
so once we're covering them I'm going to
be covering them again in outcomes
Orioles but for now just remember in the
future videos whenever you think you
should see something and it's not
displaying go here that's probably what
the problem is now another thing again
like I said I'm not going to be covering
all this stuff like show volumes sprites
because that's a whole separate story
we're nowhere near learning that yet but
one thing I do want to cover is this
remember in the last story I taught you
guys about the different viewport types
well that's just how it is set up by
default the top left is the side the top
right is the front top over here and
this is the perspective but you can
change that if you want and you can
change it by choosing this the drop down
menu V port type you can change this to
the top if you want or you can go ahead
and change it to the front by default
this is perspective so that's how I'm
going to leave it I just want to show
you guys if you want to set up your
viewports in a different way you have
the option view that you're not locked
in this default view right here so with
that being said that's all I really want
to cover in this drop down menu again
all of these things right here
they're buttons that we're going to be
going over in the upcoming stories and
this other these other options right
here like volumes layer sprites
and you know culling an occlusion and
unlimited anywhere near that so going
over it would just confuse you guys
probably confusing me too well I do want
to go over is this real time again this
P is just a viewport type we already
covered that the next thing is this
real-time option now with this real-time
option in by the way I have no idea why
the icon is a stamp if anyone knows then
please let me know because I think it's
a stamp it might be something else but
it just confuses me so I have no idea
why it's a stamp but basically the
real-time option is this any time you're
working in viewport and you have either
an animation or an effect it doesn't
play that animation or effect by default
let me go over and actually
let me find an animation or effect I
think there's a waterfall somewhere
around here here we go so let's go ahead
and look at this waterfall let me go
ahead and zoom out and check it out
whenever we're working in this viewport
the waterfall looks like it's freezing
it's not moving at all even though if we
were to play the game the waterfall
would appear to be moving water that's
because whenever we're just working in
the viewport we don't really need to see
that effect we don't need it to eat up
our computer's memory it will take extra
resources from our computer that we
don't have to spare right now however we
do have the option of watching this
waterfall move and that's by clicking
this real time button so go ahead and
click this real time button and now even
though we're working in the viewport and
we're not playing the game we can see
these effects and animations begin to
play so that's how we can you know kind
of see effects and animation start play
is which this up because like I said it
does take some extra memory from your
computer and we want to save all the
memory we can when we're actually
working with models another thing
concerning this real-time is this
whenever we're working with objects so I
know I'm not talking to you guys about
these different views like wireframes
but go ahead and switch to wireframe and
actually just follow along for this
tutorial whenever you have an object
selected like this say you have this
object selected well whenever you select
it and hit home every viewport is going
to snap to that object now check it out
if I were to go ahead and move this
object look at this and by the way I
know you guys don't know how to move
move objects but I just want to talk to
you guys about real-time for a second
whenever you go ahead and you move this
object in one viewport notice all the
other viewports notice this one up here
and this one in this one the object
isn't moving even though we're actually
moving the object in our you know in our
UDK so you're saying all right even
though I'm moving it why isn't it moving
up here well again like I said it's the
save memory but if you want to see it
like maybe you're trying to
position in a certain type of way what
you can do is you can go ahead and check
these real-time options right here and
whenever you check these real-time
options check it out whenever we move in
now the object is indeed moving in those
viewports so again in the future
whenever we learn how to move models
around how to rotate them and stuff like
that
if we want to move it in one viewport
and see the actual difference as it's
happening in other viewports that's the
option that we need to check that
real-time option so again those are the
two important aspects concerning real
time one whenever we have real-time
selected all of our animations and
effects we can see in real time and also
whenever we're moving objects in one
viewport they move also in real time and
other viewports so again anytime we want
to switch those off just go ahead and
switch them off off and off and by the
way the benefit of switching them off
rather than leaving them on all the time
it just it helps save some of your
computer's resources so that's all the
time I have in this story I know there
are a lot of more buttons that we need
to cover but for the sake of this
tutorial I actually I have more time but
I want to go watch some of michelle phan
videos so that's the truth I'm going to
watch some more makeup tutorials and you
guys watch this video over and over
until you're pro with real time in few
ports so thank you guys for watching and
I'll see you guys in next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
