tutorial that I'm making for the new
Boston and in this tutorial we're going
to continue working in our address book
project and basically what we're going
to be doing is creating a class for
every person's information and we're
also going to be creating a folder and a
file that will store basically all of
our people in it so first we're just
going to want to create a class so we're
just going to want to right-click on our
form and go to view code and then we're
just going to go down here and create a
new person class so class person and
we're just going to basically just have
a bunch of properties in here so the
first one will just be for their name we
obviously want all these properties to
be public so we're going to say public
string name and we're going to make it
so the user can both get and set it so
they could really write it so I'm just
going to say get and set in here and we
can just copy this so we don't have to
write public string a whole bunch of
times so we're basically just going to
have two or three other strings string
property the first one will be for their
email the other one will be for their
street address and we're going to have
another one for any additional notes
paste another one in there and all this
dish annul knows all right and we're
going to want to have one other property
and that will be for their birthday so
we're going to make it a date time so
public days time and this will just be
for their birthday so birthday and we're
going to make it so that you can vote
read and write it so get and set alright
so now that we have our person class
created we're now going to begin
creating the files that on all this
information will be stored in so it's
going to go and select our former here
go down to when the form is loading and
just double click on it and the person
that we're going to want to do is
basically just create a folder inside
the AppData folder for our program so
we're just going to see right here
so before we do that though we're just
going to want to create a new string and
this will basically just hold the path
cue the app data folder so we don't have
to continue our retrieving the directory
son is going to call this path and set
it equal to environment dot git folder
path and we're just going to want to get
the cat of the application data folder
all right and then we're just going to
want to create a new folder in there so
we're going to say directory dot create
directory and then we can just use this
path up here so path plus and then the
name of our folder and I'm just going to
call it um bad dress hook and then put a
dash after it and then all right but we
only wanted to do this if there isn't
already a directory named this so we're
first going to check to see if this
exists so we're going to say basically
if this directory doesn't already exist
then we're going to create it
so if directory dot exists and then we
can just go ahead and copy this path
right here alright so now we'll only
create this directory if it doesn't
already exist and we're going to want to
do the same for on the XML file inside
of this folder so we're going to say if
that XML file doesn't exist which we
haven't you created it yet so we're
going to say if file dot exists and then
we're going to say path plus and then
this obviously since it's going to be
stored inside of this folder and then
we're going to call this XML file just
settings.xml alright so if it doesn't
exist then we want to create this file
so this is a file dot create and then
this file right here
all right so let's just go ahead and
test and see if this works
add another run to see there so if I eat
bug right here it should created those
files go in my app data see address book
atom and we see an XML file for our
settings perfect all right so that's
pretty much it for this tutorial so see
you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
