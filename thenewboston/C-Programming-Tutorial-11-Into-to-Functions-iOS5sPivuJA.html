and welcome to your 11th seat tutorial
and this is where I'm going to be
talking about functions now what a
function is just a quick background it's
pretty much a process that's outside
your main function right here this main
function all of this this is the
function that's what we're going to
working on this so far but now we want
both something else that you're going to
be able to use in main so um it's easier
to just show you guys so the first thing
that you do when you build a function is
you have to make a prototype now what a
prototype kind of does is tell your
computer are right I'm going to be
building something and you're not going
to know what it is but I just want to
let you know to be ready for it so when
it comes along you're not going to get
confused so that's what we got to do
right now and to do the prototype we
have to do this
the first thing we have to type is what
kind of data it's going to return to us
so we're going to be solving a question
and the answer is going to be integer in
this case we're going to be finding an
area it's going to be giving us the two
numbers and we're going to be
calculating area so when it spits out
the answer of the area it's going to be
integer so whatever you're returning
it's going to be right here
if if we had a function that found your
name and spit out letters then it would
be like char or string or something like
that but since we're spitting out a
number it's going to be integer the next
thing that you do when you make a
function is give your name a function
just like you named a variable or
anything else name it something easy to
remember I'm going to name mine find
area and the next thing you do in the
last thing when prototype in the
function is you have two parameters in
your parameters you have to write woke
up so I got whooping cough in your
parameters of the function you have to
write what information do you need to
solve this problem and since this
function is fine area the formula for
area is any two numbers you need to do a
number times the number
so since we're doing that we need two
integers to work with so to tell our
prototype this just type int X and int Y
so right now we have we're going to be
solving for an integer we named it
whatever you named it and we're going to
be inputting two numbers so now that we
got a main function prototype copy this
and now we have to build our function
and just like int main void we need to
do the same thing so just copy this and
paste it down below and get rid of your
semicolon and add two curly braces now
whatever goes inside your curly braces
that's what you want the function to do
so all we want this function to do is
get x times y and return us whatever the
answer is so this is probably the
easiest thing you'll ever learn in your
life just type in our et you are in
return x times y that's it now what the
function is going to automatically do is
this it's going to take whatever two
numbers we got it's going to plug them
in for x and y and it's going to return
that value to us so let's go ahead and
this is we're done building the function
we're done prototyping it that's all you
guys need to learn on how to make
functions and prototype them you can
have as many instructions in here as you
want this is just the easiest function
you'll ever make in real life so that's
why I'm doing that the next thing we
have to do is in order to make this
program useful we're going to want to
use this function somewhere we didn't
just build it for fun we actually want
to use it in our main program so to use
it let's this is what we do in them I'm
just showing you guys you guys probably
know exactly what I'm going to do but in
case you don't here's what we need to
variables int 1 and n 2 and these are
going to be the two variables that we
use for I'll leave that prototype in
there let me tighten things up a bit
there's going to be the two variables
where our two numbers
so let's do a scan F in case you guys
can't remember up on a second can't type
and think at the same time we'll scan in
one and we'll scan in - so whatever two
numbers we scan will be set in the
variables one and two next let's make a
print function to print out our answer
so percent percent D and then it's going
to print out a variable or print out
integer so instead of just putting in a
variable name in there we're going to
want it to print out whatever it found
in this function so let's go ahead and
put um how let's let me think of some
numbers we can use find area here's how
you do this you just add your function
name right in here and then put your
variables inside the parameters of the
function so don't let all this confuse
you what you're looking at is right here
that's how you use a function you write
the function name and then instead of in
X and int Y you write the two numbers
that you're going to use right in it so
let me go ahead and compile and run this
and show you guys what it actually does
and uh after I ran it I'm going to talk
you guys through one last time so let's
find an area let's find um five and six
so it multiplies them both together and
gets 30 so pay attention five six thirty
I'm going to take you guys through one
last time and show you guys what
happened you have a main function right
here we have two variables one and two
we scan in whatever we typed in the
first time is going to be stored in
variable one whenever we type in second
time is going to be stored in variable
two and next we had print on the screen
we want to use the function find area
and we want to use the numbers five and
six and it's going to write and now your
program is going to go alright what the
heck is fine area well it's going to go
down
here and says all right what do you want
me to do with those numbers you just
gave me well the first number I want you
to use right here in the second number I
want you to use right here and when
you're done figuring out this formula I
want you to return that value to me so
now instead of all this it's going to
have 30 calculated from all this so
that's how we got print percent D 30 and
what prototyping does if you're
wondering what this is the first thing
your computer does is go through your
main function
it doesn't look at this first so
whenever it comes to this and says then
C's fine area it's not going to know
what the heck you're talking about
because it's not a variable or anything
like that so what the prototype says is
it just tells our program are right when
you whenever you come across this thing
called fine area I'm going to tell you
that you have to go look for a function
so it just helps it and it doesn't make
it so confused like it would be without
it so this is a pretty simple function
on the easiest thing you can do is just
practice with your functions I'm going
to copy this right now and put it on my
website the new Boston comm so if you
want to use this right here you can go
to my website then new Boston Common and
copy right in and that is your
introduction to functions I hope you
guys learned something and in my next
tutorial I'll be clearing a couple
things up so thank you guys for watching
make sure to subscribe and I'll see you
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
