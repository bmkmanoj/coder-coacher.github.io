last video covering site analyzer I just
have a few other things I want to cover
before we move on to something else and
the first thing is this tasks section
it's kind of a difficult word for me to
say tasks tasks nailed it all right so
this is pretty much a built-in to-do
list and it's very handy for keeping
track of everything all the issues that
you need to fix on your site now the
quickest way to make them is actually if
you just go to page analysis and click
on your one one of your analysis
analysis how do you say that I haven't
started so I heard that I'm talking
today all right so here are a bunch of
issues that we need to work on and they
already have a check mark next to each
one so if you want to you know you
really don't need to fix some of these
you can uncheck on me and Mike and I
really don't need to worry about that my
sites a video site really not worried
about Texaco to ratio but keep the ones
checked that you want to work on and
just hit add to my task list so if you
click on this you can see that all of
those are right there and you can start
working on them and whenever you're done
just go ahead and click this little box
right here and it's going to delete it
from your list another cool thing that
you can do is instead of just getting
all of these from the page analysis you
can actually write your own manually so
what I like to do is I actually like to
break it up and I like to separate these
groups by person so for example I'm
gonna have a task and this task is just
by pizza so this is gonna go under the
group Bucky and my task so now you see
that this the new boston.com
that's everything I need to do for this
website right here now under Bucky Bucky
just needs to buy pizza
now actually I also need to uh like
watch TV and I actually just want to
head this the Bucky so I'm gonna do that
and check it out now Bucky has another
test buy pizza and watch TV now Eric is
the main web developer for my website
and I'll say
fix everything right there so fix
everything and that can go under air so
again of course I would help them out
and actually I'm doing the SEO and he's
doing some of the more technical stuff
right now but I just want to show you
guys that if you have multiple people
working on your site you can actually
break it up and separate the tasks into
different groups very handy
or if you want you can just have one
major list and then you can all work on
it together or by yourself whatever and
the Settings section here this is really
nothing that mind-blowing and game this
is just all your account information so
if you want to change your password or
your profile picture or you know
anything like that then you can regular
settings now this last little tab I want
to talk about the white label what you
can do is you can actually generate
reports for customers so say that you
want to you know start an SEO company
where clients would come to you in bed
hey can you analyze my site I'll pay you
some money maybe fix some problems give
you some more money well what you want
to do first is you want to analyze your
site and generate a report for them now
the report is essentially just the curl
data I mean it's all the stuff that we
saw already all the issues with all the
different pages keyword info and stuff
like that but by default you have a
template that looks kind of generic we
can actually do is you can actually
create your own custom templates so I'll
say
Bucky's theme and I'll hit save so
whenever you hit save it automatically
brings you into the editor and you can
just change stuff like I don't know
maybe I want to change this text maybe I
don't want to make it bold maybe I want
to change the color to blue something
like that so again this is essentially
just the look and feel so if your
company is you know has a certain color
theme it likes to follow or something
like that you can go ahead and customize
it to your liking change the font size
the font family whatever now once you're
done
just go ahead and hit save so again this
has nothing to do with the actual
information such as the crawl data or
keywords or anything this is just look
and feel of the document so once you got
designed how you want go ahead and close
that out so this is your template but
now how do we actually generate a report
well what you do is you go up to crawls
right here and whenever a client comes
to you go ahead to their website we
paste it in and crawl it so I already
got this one right here again this is
the one we looked at in the last video
which was just my site and once it
crawled your site just go ahead and
click see so this is just gonna bring
you to again we already looked at all
this pretty much the overview or
analysis for your site now from here
instead of just clicking on all these
tabs you actually want to hit export so
this is gonna go ahead and export your
final report so your customer can view
it so I'm just going to export this to a
PDF document and let me go ahead and
choose Bucky's theme so again if you got
a bunch of different color schemes you
can pick them right here and now you can
also give it a title and a subtitle so
the title can just be like reports or
new boston.com
I'll say SEO report SEO report for the
new boss gonna calm and for the subtitle
just very Bucky Roberts so that's going
to be the home page for the report now
just hit download and that's it so it's
gonna go ahead and generate your PDF
download it and check this out once it's
done downloading this is the thing that
you're gonna want to give to your
customer so double click that and I
should probably add my logo right here
that'd be a little bit better but check
it out all of the results and let me
boost this up so you guys can see
basically everything we looked at before
but now your customer can see it much
better now this is actually really
useful not only let's say you want to
start an SEO company not only can you
just give them the results but say that
you wanted to land a potential client
well it's hard to convince them that you
know this is actually useful stuff and
there's a bunch of problems with their
website so you may want to generate a
report for free
and gift to them and once they read it
they're gonna make well I actually do
have a bunch of problems with my website
I need someone to fix these and then
you're like oh well how about me so
again there's a bunch of different ways
that you can make money with SEO a lot
of people do it for a living
either just analyzing someone's site or
you can analyze the and fix issues so
again that is what site analyzer is now
that you guys have a brief overview of
it you saw all the different parts of it
you can decide if you want to sign up
for an account again I love it it's
pretty cool and in the upcoming videos
I'm gonna show you guys some other tools
that I like to use a lot so yeah thanks
for watching and I will see you guys
later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
