structures it's time to move on to
cellular division my name is Sarah and
in this video I'm going to be talking
about binary fission and mitosis despite
the differences between prokaryotic cell
division and eukaryotic cell division
they do share some common features you
have to have DNA replication you have to
have a segregation of the new DNA
molecules and you had to have
cytokinesis which is where these cells
actually split apart prokaryotic
organisms are going to replicate by what
is called binary fission prokaryotic
organisms are only going to have one
circular chromosome so that's going to
replicate copies of each chromosome are
going to attach to different parts of
the cell membrane by what is called a
missus ohm the cells are going to pull
apart and then you have cytokinesis
resulting in the parent cell which is
the original cell and the daughter cell
which is the new cell prokaryotic
division is very simple compared to
eukaryotic cell division eukaryotic
organisms are going to go through a cell
cycle there are four phases in the cell
cycle you have the g1 phase or the gap
one phase which is where growth occurs
and synthesis of molecules that the cell
needs to grow and function cells that
don't divide any longer such as neurons
will be in the growth one phase forever
they're not going to divide anymore
they're not going to need to replicate
their DNA or anything like that the S
phase is called the DNA synthesis phase
the g2 phase or gap two phase is where
they sell prep prayers' prepares for
mitosis and the in phase is the mitosis
phase g1 s and g2 phases are
collectively termed interphase which
means the cell is not actively actively
dividing eukaryotic cell division is
going to involve a couple of steps
you've got the division of the nucleus
which is called karyokinesis and then
you have the division of the rest of the
cell the cytoplasm and all the
organelles which is called cytokinesis
somatic cells or body cells are going to
accomplish karyokinesis by what is
called mitosis sex cells or gametes are
going to accomplish karyokinesis by what
is called meiosis and like I said in
this video we're going to be covering
mitosis so before a cell can divide it
has to replicate its DNA which is found
in the nucleus cells do this during
interphase during interphase the nucleus
is this distinct organelle it is bound
by the nuclear membrane DNA exists as u
chromatin which is just long stringy
strands of DNA it's not very coiled and
it allows for transcription or the
reading of DNA to occur so the cell can
synthesize proteins and other molecules
it needs to grow it and function mitosis
is the division of the nucleus it is
composed of four different steps you've
got prophase metaphase anaphase and
telophase the way I was always taught to
remember this was Pro meta anatella
it sounds kind of dumb but it works
during prophase chromatin is going to
condense and coil to form what are
called chromosomes the nucleoli and
nuclear membrane are going to begin to
disappear centrioles if the cell has
them are going to migrate to opposite
ends of the cell and spindle fibers are
going to begin to form before we move on
to the next step there are a couple of
vocabulary terms you need somatic cells
are diploid this means they contain two
copies of every chromosome you've got
one from the mother and one from the
father chromosomes when they condense
our compose of what are called
chromatids for example this is a
chromosome each half of the chromosome
is a chromatid these are just identical
or replications of the same DNA so
you've got one chromatid from your
mother it replicates you could form the
chromosome which contains two chromatids
and then one chromatid from your father
it replicates to form the chromosome
from your father
chromatids are joined by what is called
a centromere which is this little black
dot in the middle and then you've got
homologous chromosomes you got the
chromosome from your mother and the
chromosome from your father they contain
the exact same DNA the same genes but
these genes may be in different forms
and these different forms are called
alleles but anyways as you can see
you've got the nuclear membrane is being
a to disappear
got your centrioles here and your
spindle fibers coming out from your
centrioles during metaphase all the
chromosomes are going to line up in the
middle of the cell by this time the
nucleus has completely disappeared and
the spindle fibers are going to begin to
attach to centromere at locations called
kinetic cores and you can see in this
drawing all the chromosomes are lined up
in the middle the spindle fibers are
attached and the nucleus nuclear
membrane is completely gone during
anaphase each side of the chromosome
which are called the chromatids are
going to be pulled to opposite sides of
the cell see if you notice in the last
picture it was they were all attached
during interphase and these two are
going to be pulled apart and during the
last phase of mitosis spindle fibers are
going to detach the cytoplasm begins to
separate into two parts the plasma
membrane is going to pinch in from both
sides and the nucleus is going to reform
chromosomes begin to end coil new
centrioles are formed and the cell is
going to begin to enter re-enter
interphase and this is just a picture of
telophase you can see here the plasma
membrane begin to pinch in all the
chromosomes
excuse me chromatids are on opposite
sides now the last part of cell division
is cytokinesis which is the separation
of the cytoplasm this is when new
organelles are going to be synthesized
and it forms this thing called a
cleavage furrow which is when the cell
is actually going to split and you can
see here you've got your mitochondria
all your other
organelles they're going to divide and
each like the organelles are just going
to go to each new cell you've got the
parent cell and the daughter cell that
is all I have for mitosis and cellular
division for now but in the next video
I'll cover meiosis which is the process
of division for sex cells</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
