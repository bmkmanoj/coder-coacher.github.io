11th I think html5 tutorial and in this
tutorial we're going to be laying out
our website making it look pretty
because here is what we have so far this
website and I have to admit looking
pretty good
but I don't think we're going to get any
high-paying web design jobs with using
this in our resume so let's go ahead and
jump over to our main CSS file and start
laying this bad boy out the very first
thing I want to tackle is this big
wrapper pretty much this main tip that
wraps all the contents for your website
so in order to reference a div just go
ahead and hit the pound sign big
underscore wrapper and now let's add
some style to this piece the first thing
I want to do is just add a border and
I'm probably going to be adding a border
to a lot of my stuff just so you guys
can see what's going on
so one pixel solid black and after this
we need to set the width of our website
now if we go ahead and look at our
website right now if we highlight this
you can see that the blue goes from all
the way from the left to the right
however we don't want our website to
take up the entire width of the browser
if we go look at websites like YouTube
or something and we scroll out we can
see that they have some padding on the
left and right and their website isn't
the entire width so we want our website
typically to be somewhere between 950
and thousand pixels wide so I like
making mine a thousand pixels wide all
the time and the reason for this is
because whenever we are fixing all the
boxes and articles and stuff later on a
thousand is a nice number to work with
mathematically it's easy one to remember
and some people use like 960 980 but
that's really hard whenever we're doing
math later on so now that we got our
width of our website we need to set the
margins pretty much this is how we
Center the website so if we hit margin
first we need to give it the top margin
pretty much how much space is from our
website to the top of the browser and we
just want to say okay 20 pixels from the
top because if it's
right jammed up against the top of your
browser it looks a little weird so give
it some padding somewhere from 10 to 20
now for the left right and bottom just
go ahead and set those to auto and this
is essentially going to say okay I want
an even amount of space on the left hand
side and right hand side and whatever
happens on the battle happens on the
bottom it really doesn't matter but this
pretty much is centering your website so
if you go ahead and save this and look
at our website oops
still on YouTube there and refresh if we
scroll out we can see that okay we got
20 pixels of spacing from the top of
your browser to the top of your website
or excuse me whatever this thing is
called to the top your website and also
the same amount of space on the left
hand side and right hand side and now
our website is perfectly centered how
awesome is that
so the only other thing we have to do in
this big wrapper is left-aligned text so
text-align:left now what this basically
means is even though the box itself is
centered the contents inside the box are
going to be left aligned right like that
so as you can see the overall web site
is centered inside our browser however
the contents are left aligned and that
is just because you know whenever you're
reading a magazine or newspaper stuff's
left the line so web sites are no
different so let's go ahead and now we
want to work on the top menu now the top
menu is basically this thing right here
if we scroll in and we can see that the
home tutorials and podcasts it's
basically our links so let's go over and
work on that and main CSS reference this
by hitting top menu or excuse me
top header
not a jitter top header and actually
let's go ahead and look at our HTML so
our top menu is basically the list of
links in our top header is where we have
our it's where we would put the logo and
pretty much the title of our website so
I forgot about that so I need to take
care of that first so what we want to do
is again I'm going to be putting some
weird colors on our website but that's
just so you guys can see visually and
easily what's going on and this is what
you guys should do whenever you're
laying out website for the first time
but once you've got your website laid
out then you can get rid of the colors
and you know make them all match however
if I make all the colors match now then
you like okay what parts the header what
parts the articles so I'm going to be
giving it weird colors so I'm going to
be giving this a background of yellow
that'll stand out pretty good and a
border of I don't know 1 pixel solid
blue now also I'm going to be giving the
top header a padding of let's say 20
pixels and this will pretty much make
sure that the text is kind of separate
and it is in budding right up against
the border now in case you guys forgot
for my CSS tutorials the space between
the text and the border or the element
and the border is the padding and the
margin is the space outside the border
so pretty much just remember like this
the padding is inside in the margin is
outside so if we go ahead and save this
and look at it we can see that okay we
are good to go
so pretty much the padding is this the
space between the text itself and the
border pretty cool so we now have a
yellow background and a blue border
looking good so now let's go ahead and
jump over to this top menu and we can do
that by referencing pound top underscore
menu and what rules that we want to
apply to that top navigation menu well
let's just go ahead and set the
background
and set this equal to blue and we'll
just go ahead and set the color of the
font equal to white blue and white is
actually my two favorite colors now if
we go ahead and save this we can go
ahead and refresh and say okay I'm
noticing a couple things first of all it
looks pretty crappy I'll go ahead and
admit it I mean our links those are kind
of very poor way to display our links
because first of all they're 1 under
each other no navigation bar is 1 under
each other they're always from left to
right and also would be nice if they
were like bold or something so let's go
ahead and take care of that problem
right now now what we need to do in
order to do this is reference top menu
again so top underscore menu and we need
to reference the list items now I'm
going to be doing a couple things to
these list items and if you remember in
our top menu it's basically made up of
an unordered list with three list items
now I actually would make these links
later on but for now they're just list
items since we don't have any other
websites so let's go ahead and change a
couple things to these list items the
very first thing I want to do is make
sure that these things appear from left
to right instead of stacked up on top of
each other so the reason that they are
stacked up one then under pretty much
tutorials is under home and podcast is
under tutorials instead of appearing
from left to right is because they are
block level elements instead of inline
so we need to change that and we do that
by hitting display:inline-block and this
will make sure that they appear from
left to right so let's go ahead and
refresh this and as you can see they now
appear from left to right pretty sweet
huh so now let's go ahead and make them
look a little bit prettier list style
and I'm just going to go ahead and
change this equal to none so in some
browsers they may have a little bullet
on the side or maybe a little star
depending on the browser we pretty much
saying we don't want any symbol no
bullets or anything
and now let's just go ahead and give us
some padding because if we look they're
kind of jammed up against one another so
we'll give it a padding of five pixels
and this will make the overall top menu
a little bit bigger make it look a
little bit prettier and I want to change
the font too because that font was
really ugly looking and I just changed
it - I don't know bold how many pixels
14 is probably good and Tahoma you gotta
love to Homa so okay let make sure
everything looks pretty good and
refreshes go ahead and refresh it and
good go so now we have a little more
space between the border and the
elements themselves they are now
appearing left to right and 14 pixels
bold Tahoma Wow there's like a car crash
going on outside or something so anyways
if we go ahead and look at our website
it's looking pretty good right now but
we still have a lot to go and I'm still
going to show you guys the coolest
things how to lay things out and make
sure that these articles appear in an
awesome kind of way so anyways you got a
lot to cover thank you guys for watching
and I'll see you guys in the next story</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
