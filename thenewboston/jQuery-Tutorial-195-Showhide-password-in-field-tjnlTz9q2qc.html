with a video tutorial for the new Boston
now as you can see here I have a form
field that is actually a just a password
field so I can type in some values in
here and obviously as you would expect
from a password field in HTML the
characters are starred out or you have
these little circles here that just
represent each character now what we're
going to be doing in this tutorial is
creating this little show password box
and this will apply for all password
elements that you create on a page so
for example let's go ahead and just
duplicate this password field here we'll
just pop a line break after it and then
a new password field so we can have sort
of like as many password fields as we
want so this can this will sort of
globally attach to all input types that
all input fields that have a type of
password so I can go ahead and I can
type in a password in here and then I
can use this check box to actually show
the password in plain text I can then go
ahead and check that back out and make
it returned to its hidden value so I can
then go ahead and type it in here as
well and do exactly the same thing so
depending on obviously how many password
fields you have on your page or you know
just you use this as sort of like a
global JavaScript file this will
automatically create this check box you
can see that on my main page I don't
actually have this check box present
because our JavaScript file will handle
all of that for us so it's an
interesting you know theory that you'd
want a show password box next to a
password field in order to let the user
show the password that they're currently
currently typing or I've typed and it's
becoming more common to allow people to
show the passwords you know different
things different scenarios people might
want to be able to see their password if
they're creating a particularly long
password or something that they need to
say paste in and double-check this is a
really really nice feature that you can
add globally across your page to ensure
this works with all fields so we're
going to be going ahead and creating
this code but obviously the first thing
we're gonna do is go ahead and set up
our password field because there's a few
important things we need to talk about
in that area so let's go over to our
text editor and start from scratch and
start to create this functionality okay
so over to our text editor obviously the
first thing that we want to go ahead and
do is actually create our password
fields so let's go ahead and use input
type equals password and obviously this
is important because this will only work
with input fields that have the type
password obviously you don't want to
give this functionality to plain text or
an email field for example or anything
else like that because none of the
others hash or star out the password now
when we create our input field it will
work with just this functionality like
this so we'll work if you were to just
go ahead and type input type equals
password however we need to take into
account that when we do this that we're
actually in jQuery going to replace this
input field altogether with a text type
so what we're doing is the process
involves getting rid of this field and
then creating a new field but this time
with a type of text and the reason I'm
explaining this beforehand is because if
we would have a password field with for
example an ID of something and a class
of something and we'll obviously need to
give it a name as well because this is
how you would you know if this was if
this belonged to a form this was this
would be how you'd read in that variable
the variable value associated with the
password so you might have
a name for this as well and a variety of
other attributes as well and what we're
gonna be doing is when we replace this
we're gonna need to replace each
attribute because it's gonna remove the
password field and create a new text one
and this is how we switch between it
there's no easy way to show the
characters inside of the field unless
you create or delete the password field
and then you know give the give the
value the same password value to a text
field so that's how we're going to do it
that's the only way that we can actually
do it like I said there's no feature
that we can use to you know unhide a
password it's not that easy in the
example I showed you it looked easy and
instant but in actual fact it involves
replacing this input field altogether so
now that we have these this ID class and
name I'll leave it like that because
obviously that just demonstrates you
know the fields the or the attributes
that we want to go ahead and get and
then you know put them back in when we
replace this so a password field looks
like this on a page it's not much it's
just literally a password field
obviously the content of it is hidden I
think I've created a JavaScript file
called ext das which I've included on my
page as well as jQuery so we're gonna be
writing all of our jQuery code in ext
ojs there's no more code required for
this index dot PHP page that's it we're
going to allow EXT doc j s to handle the
insert a ssin of the checkbox</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
