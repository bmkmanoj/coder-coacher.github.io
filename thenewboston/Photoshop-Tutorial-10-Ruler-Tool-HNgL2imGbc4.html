video and in this video I'm going to
demonstrate to you guys how to use the
ruler tool now I opened up a picture
already of me when I was I don't know I
look like I'm about four years old or
something and I can't remember exactly
what happened this day but it looks like
I drank one too many juice boxes and I
was probably just recovering from a
hangover or something but anyways the
ruler tool is under a sub it's usually
the eyedropper tool but if you click it
and hold it you're going to select the
ruler tool and as you can see your
cursor changes to a little ruler with a
plus sign and a little arrow on it so
the most simple thing that you can do
with a ruler tool is just to drag the
ruler tool or drag your cursor around
and what it does is it measures the
screen for you whatever you're measuring
so if I wanted to measure the distance
of my body I can see that from point A
to where I started drag into where I
finished dragging the width at the very
top is 832 and the height is negative
202 pixels now negative just means that
you're going up and positive going down
so it's basically 202 pixels change in
height now whenever you release that you
can see that the line stays there now
stays there for a couple reasons and
we're going to be getting to that
shortly how we can change the line
around even but another thing I want to
mention before I forget is also if you
drag and hold down the shift key on your
keyboard your ruler is going to snap to
a perfect 45 degree angle no matter if
your cursor is off by a little bit so
that's 45 that's zero degrees and you
could also you know go 180 360 well I
guess 360 would be in the same spot but
just remember that whenever you hold
down the shift key it snaps the 45
degree angles now another thing I want
to mention is say that you made a
measurement like this and you're like
you know what I want to measure the
distance from this line to this red line
so what you can do is actually you can
change the starting point in the ending
point of your ruler if you go ahead and
hover over one of these points you can
move it around by dragging it and
dropping it same thing with ending point
go ahead and drop that into place and
aside from just moving the beginning
point in the ending point you can
actually move this entire line see by
default your cursor has an arrow a ruler
in the little plus sign and once you
hover over your line that plus sign is
going to disappear that's your indicator
that you are hovered over the line so if
you just drag this and move it you can
go ahead and readjust that exactly where
you want it now another cool thing that
you can do is you can actually clear
this line altogether and by clearing it
I mean get rid of this line because if
you say okay I'm just going to click
away oh crap it's not getting rid of it
maybe I just do another one okay got rid
of this one but now I have this line
what the heck in order to get rid of
this line completely just go ahead and
hit this Clear button on the top and bam
your line is gone now the last thing I
want to tell you guys is a cool little
trick and it's how to straighten a layer
once you have a ruler measurement set so
say that for some reason you want to
straighten this layer so that these
lines on the bed instead of going you
know to like a 45 degree angle that they
were horizontal left and right according
to the document well what you could do
is you could draw a line there's
actually several ways to do this this is
probably the most the probably the
hardest way but what you could do is you
could actually draw a line along this
bed and go up to here and press straight
in layer now what that would do is take
this line that's a I don't know like a
31 degree angle right now
and whenever it straightens you can see
your image strands along that line so
now it looks like I'm about to slide off
the bed and my head's probably going to
hit you know a toy or something down
here
but nonetheless that's your introduction
on how to use the basic ruler tool and
in the next story what I'm going to do
is I'm going to show you guys how to use
something called the ruler guides it's
going to be thrilling
so I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
