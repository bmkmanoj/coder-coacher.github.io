tutorial and then this is horror i'm
going to show you guys how to draw it an
ellipse now what an ellipse is is pretty
much an uneven circle it looks like a
circle that was pushed in on the sides
and actually the world earth is in the
lips and if you know why then leave me a
comment and tell me I'm dying to know
but anyways the point of this tutorial
is to show you how to draw an ellipse
now of course we can't just uh do it the
same way we draw a circle because it's
pretty much a totally different thing so
what Python decided to do is to give you
a rectangle and it pretty much puts a
rectangle on the screen and pretty much
if you put a circle and try to fit
inside a rectangle that would give you
an ellipse so that's what Python allows
you to do or pie game in other words so
the first thing it needs is a color so
let's go ahead and write color and set
this equal to RGB value set equal to
zero 255 255 just first thing that
popped in that's not a 0 that's 0 isn't
it don't want that so the next thing you
need is a rectangle now the rectangle
let's go ahead and and make call it
Erick tangle now the rectangle is going
to take four parameters the first two
numbers are the position of it so let's
put 40 and am now the next two
parameters are the size of it so let's
write it 150 x 90 so this is a rectangle
that's 40 x 80-in in this position and
the size is 150 x 90 but we aren't going
to make a rectangle we're going to want
to fit in the lips into it we just need
a rectangle as a parameter so let me
show ahead let me show you guys what
this does and I'll explain after I show
you and then we'll make a lot more sense
let's go ahead and write pygame the draw
module and inside is e ll I pse 2 l's in
that techno now takes 3 parameters
screen
the color and of course that rectangle
one now let me go ahead and print this
out and I'll show you guys explain you
guys what it does as you can see we now
have an ellipse that is this color and
what a rectangle why we need that
rectangle well let me show you the
parameters screen color and then
rectangle if we were to make a rectangle
it would be 40 across 80 down and then
it would be 150 wide x 90 down so that
is why you need to make kind of an
imaginary rectangle and that is where
your lips fits into pie came thought
that this was the easiest way to a make
that you can make it so you can make an
ellipse so that's how they did it they
made you like kind of have an imaginary
rectangle as one of the parameters so
again actually that's kind of the color
of the Earth's water if you're looking
at from space so anyways your challenge
is to tell me why the world is an
ellipse and then once you figure that
out you're ready to move on to the next
tutorial so that is the basics of how to
draw on the lips and pygame I hope you
enjoyed um don't forget to subscribe and
I'll see you next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
