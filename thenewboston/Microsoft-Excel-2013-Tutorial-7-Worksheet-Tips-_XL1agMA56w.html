so that was my intro that just popped
into my head pretty sure if I did that
at the beginning of all my videos then I
would lose all of my subscribers so so
I'll stop doing that alright guys so in
this video I want to talk to you guys
about some cool things that you can do
with worksheets in exactly how to manage
them because every single workbook that
you have is probably going to be made up
of more than one worksheet so I already
told you guys what exactly they are in
like the first tutorial or the second
one and I already showed you guys that
if you ever want to add another one then
you can just click this little plus sign
right here to add some more and they're
pretty much like tabs or individual
pieces of paper that make up your entire
workbook now in addition to adding them
by clicking this little button right
here the keyboard shortcut is shift and
then f11 so check that out it not only
opens new one or excuse me creates a new
one but it opens it right up so again
those are two different ways that you
can add worksheets now a lot of times
you're going to work with a workbook
that has multiple worksheets so for
example this one only has four that we
just created and if we ever want to
cycle between Omar get to a new one we
can just click it with the mouse pretty
simple however when you have a ton of
them for example you might have 20
you're going to want a more efficient
way to cycle through so the keyboard
shortcut for cycling through them is
hold down ctrl and hit page up or page
down so again that's control and page up
and page down and that actually is for
some reason a lot easier than clicking
with your mouse wouldn't by your mouth
how would you click with your mouth
maybe you're using your mouth set your
hand for your mouse but anyways let's
send me ramalon this is what happens I
just ramble on about the dumbest thing
and uh next thing you know 30 seconds of
our lives gone so let's get back on task
Bucky and let's go ahead and tell them
how to delete a worksheet pretty simple
so for this one I don't know I just
really hate this one so anytime you want
to delete a worksheet right-click it
delete how easy is that probably the
easiest thing I've ever taught in my
entire life now first of all check this
out this worksheet right here it's named
visitors very cool but these worksheets
I don't know maybe I want to store like
my page views for the website in this
and maybe like um the sessions data on
this one well obviously these names
aren't very descriptive and whenever I'm
working with a big project if I have
everything named sheet1 sheet2 I'm going
to be looking for my data for a long
time so it's always a good idea to give
your sheets very descriptive names so
you can find them and manage them a lot
easier so how do you edit a sheet name
well it's actually really easy you just
double-click the name and then the
static text is going to change to an
input where you can actually change it
so I'll say that this one is something
like page views and I'll say that sheet
to let me just double click this I'll
just like make something up up like
sessions all right so of course now
whenever I'm looking at my data this
page views sessions and Visitor's is a
lot more easy to find then um sheet 1
sheet 2 sheet 3 very cool now a couple
other things that I want to show you
guys these aren't really necessities but
they can help you in certain instances
sometimes you're going to want to change
the color of these tabs so anytime you
want to change the color just from
default you can right click it and hit
tab color and then you can select
whatever color you want so let's give it
something weird so it stands out let's
give this one purple and now as you can
see if you ever are in another tab it
stands out as purple and let's give this
sessions 1 something like I don't know
light blue so again I really don't like
the colors because I
personal preference I think they look
stupid but if you ever are working with
something where colors are actually
relevant or maybe you just don't know
like them like unlike me I don't know
just not my taste but if you ever want
to do it then that is how you change
colors right click tab color and select
the color also known as a theme but
whatever now one last thing I want to
show you guys how to do actually two
less thing is they're going to come
times where you're going to want to
rearrange these tabs now by default
whenever you add a new sheet it just
adds it to either the last or if you add
it in a different kind of way it adds it
at first but say that I have a bunch of
tabs sessions pageviews visitors and
maybe this visitors I want at the end
maybe I want this in alphabetical order
so in order to rearrange your tabs all
you have to do is click on one of these
tabs and drag it to the end so again you
can drag anywhere you want and arrange
these tabs in whatever order you prefer
um often what I like to do is put the
worksheets I work on most in my workbook
at front or the first ones and the ones
I usually don't work on or maybe I just
made some calculations and I'm never
going to touch them again I like to put
those ones at the end or in alphabetical
order so you guys would probably find
yourself doing that a lot too but I'll
leave that up to you now one other cool
trick I would say one other there's like
three other things I'm going to tell you
I don't want to lie to you I said one
other like eighty times in this tutorial
so uh um I don't know listen to me
ramble on again so I'm going to show you
guys how to copy a worksheet I have
trouble saying that a work sheet real
quick and that's this so say that um we
have this visitor's worksheet right here
and we're going to make some
calculations to it but i have a feeling
that i'm going to mess something up
because maybe it's a calculation that i
never performed before or maybe i'm just
going to test out some styles so
really don't want to do it right on here
so it would be nice if I could have a
copy of this so how exactly can I do
that well all I need to do is hold down
control on my keyboard and just drag and
drop this visitors tab like before now
check this out I now have this original
one right here and I'm clicking on it
and nothing is actually changing so let
me go ahead and slide this in between
but it is indeed a copy of this visitors
work she named visitors too so you can
actually rename it visitors copy if you
want but I just want to point out that
this is the original one this is an old
tab or an old worksheet and this is my
new one that I can make changes to and
of course like I said the reason I like
to do this is because I can make
whatever changes I want and if I ever do
something actually useful I can save it
if I ever mess up like usual I can go
back to my original one without having
to worry about my old files or anything
like that
now this is actually the last thing that
we're going to talk to you guys about I
promise in this video and that is how to
zoom in and out of your worksheet now
it's actually really easy and it doesn't
affect the data at all the only thing it
changes is basically the view so if you
ever say okay this text is too small or
maybe you just want to get an overall
view of how your entire sheet is laid
out you can zoom in and out using this
slider in the bottom right corner so
again like I said when i zoom out I
actually do this a lot to get an overall
view of how my entire worksheet is laid
out without having to change the font
size so again take note the font size
isn't actually changing it's just my
view just like if you were to take a
book and actually hold it farther away
or closer to your face and another thing
and this is actually what I do more
often hold down control under your
keyboard and take the mouse and scroll
with a mouse wheel the middle mouse
wheel and whenever I do that it either
zooms out or zooms in so I do that more
often but for these tutorials I'll
probably use a slider just because I
don't know it's kind of easier if you
see what's going on rather than me
saying that I'm holding down control and
scrolling each time so those are some
cool tips with working with worksheets
again you're probably going to have to
watch this video again to memorize every
single one I know I threw a lot of
things at you so for now hope you guys
enjoyed that thank you guys for watching
and in the next video it's probably
going to be the most interesting video
yet because I'm going to show you guys
the awesome things that you can do with
tables I know we learned a little bit
about them before but in the next video
we're going to be getting more advanced
you guys are going to fall in love with
them so thank you for watching and I'll
see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
