video I am going to show you how to
render multiple components now this is
one of the most important rules that you
need to understand whenever you make
components and that is every single
component can only return one parent
element so what the heck does that mean
well say that you wanted to make this
bacon component and you wanted to have a
heading that said bacon component and
under it you want it to have I don't
know like a paragraph tag or something
so you went like this paragraph
paragraph and alright I am some simple
text all right looking good wait a
minute why the heck are we getting a
bunch of errors right here well remember
like I said right here what we're
essentially doing is we're returning to
main parent elements but we want our
component to consist of both these
things so how do we get around that well
what we need to do is we actually need
to wrap these inside a div so if I just
go div div then check this out
this allows us to use two elements
inside a single component because we're
only returning one parent div so now
whenever we render this check it out so
again just remember whenever you make a
component make sure that you only return
one parent div if you have multiple HTML
tags in here then you need to encompass
them or stick them inside one div now
another thing I want to mention is this
this render right here it can only
render or display essentially the same
thing one parent tag so what happens
whenever we want to display bacon three
different times well if we do this just
rake the tag three times you see I'm
getting a bunch of errors and remember
whenever I try to run it it's not going
to work so what do we need to do well
the same thing and actually let me clean
this a bit so whenever we want to render
multiple components we just go ahead and
make a main parent div and then inside
here we can write bacon is met
many times as we want check it out so
again that's one of the tricky things to
watch out for in react on whenever
you're getting an error or something's
not splaying properly and you don't know
why just know that every single
component can only return one parent
element if you want your component to be
made of multiple elements then you need
to wrap them inside one main parent div
or span or whatever you want so there
you go
I'll see you guys the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
