and in this video what we're going to be
doing is we're going to be learning how
to actually gather links I know that
this video series is pretty much a
program on how to crawl a website and
gather all the links well up to this
point we are in our fifth tutorial we
haven't gathered one link yet so let's
just go ahead and take care of that or
right now so I'm going to make a new
file and I'll name it a link finder and
we're actually going to create a brand
new class and this is going to be
responsible for taking a look at some
HTML sifting through it and I'll show
you guys let me inspect this so we're
basically going to give all of this HTML
over whatever website and it's going to
sift through it and find all of the
links all of the 8x now that sounds like
a lot of work right we got to write a
bunch of custom parsing and weird
functionality lucky for us
Python already comes with a class called
HTML parser and it does like 90% of this
for us so let's just go ahead and import
it in if you write HTML parser import
HTML parser now we also need to import
from URL Lib imports parse and check
this out so essentially this is a
generic HTML parser in other words it
can take a look at a bunch of HTML code
and sift through it but we are going to
need to add some custom functionality to
it pretty much just add some more
features to it so what we're going to do
is we're going to create a new class
called link finder and we are going to
inherit from HTML parser so HTML parser
and that way we all the functionality of
HTML parser plus we can write whatever
suite methods we want so the first thing
I'm going to do is just bring my
initializer so dunder init double
underscore in it and I just need to call
the super classes initialization method
so super
in it and we also need to implement
abstract methods and there's one here
called air and that's just the rules it
said hey whenever you inherit from me
you also need to implement this method
so anytime you get air I know what to do
but we're not going to get any airs
actually we probably will but there you
go so that's the core basics of it so
again now we can start adding our own
custom functionality to it now before we
do I just want to show you how this
works right now so in HTML parser there
is a method called handle start tag now
whenever this starts parsing HTML this
method or function is going to be called
I guess it's a method so this is inside
class it's going to be called whenever
it comes across a start tag
so HTML start it's going to call it
right there and you see I say that
because it's only going to call it on
the start tags so it's going to call it
on this tag but not this tag I know that
might be a little small to read on
YouTube but this is the beginning head
tag and this is the ending head tag so
what we want to do is let's say for this
link we are only worried about this
method because the URL is in the start
tag right here this ending tag it just
tells you where all the crap ends it
there's no information in here that we
need so we need to worry about that
method right there so you can just use
it by default by default it doesn't do
anything so we're going to go ahead and
override it and it's called handle start
tag right there so what can I do by
default let me just go ahead and uh
print I just print out the tag alright
so let me go ahead and we'll keep this
demo real quick before we start adding a
bunch of cool stuff to it so say link a
name a Finder Finder equals linked
finder
and finder so this is how it's going to
work first you make a link finder object
which is basically a HTML parser and
then you call a function called feed now
this feed function is pretty simple all
you do is you put in some HTML right
here and the rest it takes care of
automatically so it starts running all
of these functions so again all I did is
I took some HTML and I just got this
from the Python website but eventually
we're going to actually pass in the HTML
from whatever page were crawling and
check it out so you see that any time it
comes across a start tag HTML head title
body h1 all I did is I had it print out
that tag so HTML head title body h1 so
that's pretty useless for our example
because we're looking for links we
really don't care about HTML header
title so how do we say hey that function
is the one we're looking for but we just
care about those links well what we can
do is this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
