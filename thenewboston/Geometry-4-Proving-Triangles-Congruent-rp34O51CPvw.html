how we geometrically prove that
triangles are congruent so the important
thing to talk about first is what do we
mean by geometrically proof if I was to
tell you to algebraically prove
something you wouldn't use equations to
solve for the sides and then that's how
you could prove that they are congruent
but instead we're going to geometrically
prove it which means that we're going to
take the theorems and the rules that
we've learned up until now as reasons
why these triangles are congruent so if
you remember there's a bunch of
different ways to prove triangles are
congruent there's side side side side
angle side angle side angle and H L so
those are the kind of things we're going
to use to prove that these triangles are
congruent so that given so we're always
going to start off with a given
statement given D is the midpoint of AC
and that a B is congruent to BC the
directions should say prove triangles
are congruent so first what we want to
do is take note of the information they
give us so we know that a B is congruent
to BC and that's always going to be our
first step
our first statement is that a B is
congruent to BC and our reason for that
is simply given because we're told right
here that that's true the next thing
we're told is that D is the midpoint of
AC so first we're going to say that D is
the midpoint of a/c
and that is also a given so if D is the
midpoint of AC which is this segment
right here if you remember what it means
to be a midpoint that means that D
divides AC into two congruent pieces so
for our next thing we're going to say
that a D is congruent to DC and then our
reason is going to be the definition of
a midpoint because that's how we know
that these two are congruent okay so so
far we have one pair of congruent sides
two pairs of congruent sides so most
likely we're going to be doing a
side-side-side proof if you notice they
share this side right here B D well we
have this little theorem that says BD is
congruent to BD because it's the same
line so it has to have the same measure
as itself and our reason for this is
called the reflexive property
that's like saying five is equal to five
well obviously five has to equal five
and the length of BD has to equal the
length of BD so now we have three pairs
of congruent sides so for our last step
we can say therefore triangle a B D is
congruent to triangle C B D by
side-side-side that's how we always
finish our proof is by saying therefore
the triangles are congruent or therefore
the parallelograms are congruent or
something like that so now we're going
to do one more practice proof for today
so given that QT and is parallel to our
s so QT is parallel to our s and QR is
paralleled TS prove that triangle our q
RT q is congruent to T our s
so we're told that these two we have two
pairs of parallel lines well if you
remember there's a special kind of angle
formed when when parallel lines are cut
by a transversal so if we look at this
these two parallel lines first this one
and this one you can see that it's cut
by this transversal TR and if you
remember if you look these two
these two parallel lines right here have
this angle and this angle and if you
remember these two angles are called
alternate interior angles remember when
that Z forms there's called alternate
interior angles and alternate interior
angles are congruent so we can say first
we have to write down the given
information QT parallel to our s and Q
are parallel to tes and that's given
okay so for our next thing we're going
to say that angle 2 is congruent to
angle 4 because of and our reason is
that if lines are parallel then they're
alternate interior angles are congruent
now if you look we have two sets of
parallel lines which means we have two
sets of alternate interior angles so if
we're talking about these two lines that
are parallel and it's cut by this
transversal you can see that angle 1 and
angle 3 are alternate interior angles
for those two lines so in the same step
we can say that angle 1 is congruent to
angle 3 and that has the same reason
that if lines are parallel then they're
alternate interior angles are congruent
and we have one more step so far we have
two pairs of congruent angles now if you
look these two triangles share this side
TR so TR is congruent to itself
by the reflexive property and now if you
look we have we have one angle congruent
to one angle the included sides are
congruent and we have another angle
congruent to another angle if you
remember there's a property called
angle-side-angle oh I'm writing it on
the wrong side
so therefore the triangle RT q is
congruent to triangle t are s by angle
side angle so that's all we're doing
with proofs today but make sure you come
back and and we're going to be talking
about constructing congruent segments in
different kinds of segments we can
construct</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
