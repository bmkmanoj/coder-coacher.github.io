that I'm making for the new Boston and
in this tutorial we're going to continue
working on our address book project and
basically what we're going to be doing
is coding for the Save Changes button
and we're also going to begin coding to
write the XML file that will actually
hold all of the data or all the people
so the first thing that we're just going
to do here is double click on the Save
Changes button and basically we're just
going to want to rewrite all this
information right here so the first
thing that we're going to want to do is
access the person a year editing so
we're going to say people and then the
index of the person that you're trying
to edit would be the same index of the
selected item and this list view so we
can just say just to be one box selected
items and then we're just going to put a
0 in here since you can only select one
item at a time and then we're just going
to want to get the index of that
selected item now we're going to say
that person's name equals whatever text
is in text box long descent on the text
and text box one will be the person's
name all right and then we're just going
to want to do this for all the other
properties in the person's class or it's
going to paste here a few times and
we're going to say on their email
address it's a text box choose text then
we're going to say on their street
address is text box threes text and
finally the additional nodes is text box
scores text text box all right
so additional nodes and that would be
text box fours text alright last thing
we have to write is their birthday so
we're just going to say people right
here so I'm case one more time and say
that their birthday is equal to date
time picker one value and date time
picker one is this right here all right
so now let's just go ahead and make sure
that this works so we add a person right
here add on email address whatever
female com street address whatever name
through
and birthday doesn't matter additional
notes on none at a contact now if we add
another one at this contact now if we go
back and edit Adam let's change name to
Bob
change the street address to something
on River Run and then save the changes
now if we go back to Adam we see that
the full name has changed to Bob and the
street address has changed to Riverrun
however it didn't change it in the list
of user going we're going to want to
change the text in this view too well so
let's go back here and say let's be ones
on selected item we can only have 0 or 1
item selected so we're going to put 0 in
there now we're going to want to say the
text of that item is equal to text box
ones text which is where you'll be
changing your name all right so let's
just go ahead and debug and make sure
that this works so we just add add on
stuff contact another one at this
contact now if we change this person's
name to like Bob or something save the
changes we see it changed in the list
you as well
all right so now we're going to begin
doing is basically writing the XML file
so since we already have the XML file
created we don't have to rewrite it
again so now all we have to do is access
this file and edit it alright and we're
going to have it do that whenever you
close the application so we're going to
want to select on the application right
here go over to events and go down to a
form closing all right and then whenever
the forms closing we're just going to
want you to write all the people into an
XML file so we're just going to want to
say using system dot XML since we
haven't done that yet we're going to say
using system XML and now we're just
going to want to go down here and create
a new XML document to write in an
existing XML file since we already
created it up here whenever you load the
form we're going to say XML document X
dog equals new XML document
and then we're just going to want to
load that XML document that we created
when form loads so I'm going to go ahead
and copy this for them for the default
path so I'm going to do that and then
we're going to say X dot lo via XML
document and then we're just going to
want to provide the rest of the path to
the XML dot so I'm going to go ahead let
me go ahead and copy this right here and
say pack plus and then the rest of the
path right there alright and now we have
a sectional document all ready and set
to write inside of it so that's pretty
much it for this tutorial in the next
tutorial we're going to finish up
writing all the people into that XML
document so see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
