to be showing you how to make a playlist
component but before we do that I'm
actually going to just make a class for
videos so of course we have something to
put in our playlist so the information
that I'm going to have about the videos
is just an ID number and this is just
going to be one for the first one two
for the second one just a unique ID like
always and also the title which is this
title right here and I'm also going to
have the video code now the video code
is just this bit of information in the
URL and whenever you're embedding videos
from YouTube into your website this is
what you need so that's why we need that
and the last one is just the description
and I'll just say like video about dogs
playing in the grass or for this one
I'll put like a video on how to install
Django whatever and that's what we're
going to be doing so in order to do that
go ahead and make a new file in here and
I'm just going to name it video ts or
should I yeah just name it video ts keep
things simple alright so this is pretty
much it give me a class for videos so
we're going to export class video and
now I can just start typing my
information so that ID is just going to
be a number primary key 1 2 3 4 whatever
the title just going to be string now
for the video code that's also just
going to be string and so is the
description and let me just write the SC
that way I don't have to write
description every time alright so I'm
only going to have a constructor in here
since we're not really going to be doing
anything too fancy so the constructor
whenever we create a new video we just
need to pass in all this information so
we can pretty much just do this we're
going to request an ID from the user and
also a title and also some code from
that YouTube URL in some description and
they can leave the description blank if
they want but whatever
so now
we just need to set class variables so
this the ID equals the ID of whatever
they passed in now let me do this title
title Vidya call it fatty alcohol in
desc that's all right so in like two
seconds we created a video class so
again we're going to take these videos
we're just create like five or six just
real quick and then this is where we're
going to be adding to our playlist
component so now let's go ahead and make
that playlist component so you see the
convention I'm confirming or whenever
you make a component you write whatever
the name is whatever you choose dot
component TS so for this I would just
say I'll just name it playlist dot
component dot TS right like that
so we can actually copy some stuff from
our main component so I don't have to
type it again so we're actually going to
need to import this since we're going to
be creating a component and let's just
do all this other stuff by hand so you
can kind of see me as I do it live so
since this class isn't just going to be
a traditional class like this it's
actually going to be a component use the
app component decorator now inside here
is when get out of here thing whatever
you are is where you can make your
selector in your template so I'll just
say the selector in other words this is
just the tag name whenever we include
this in HTML we can just use the tag or
excuse me
playlist and also here's a little trick
I want to talk to you guys about so you
see that I said that this is your
selector that's what we just filled out
now your template is essentially the
HTML that is going to be displayed
whenever you use this component however
it's actually not really a great idea to
include your HTML right here because
think about this right now we just have
a heading I mean not really that
difficult but what happens when we make
this
we're probably going to need some divs
some spans we're probably going to need
to embed that video so if we have a
crapload of HTML right here then it's
just going to get all cluttered up with
our typescript and also what if you give
this to your web designer and they're
like a Bucky I don't know
type script don't make me write all this
code right in here like dude just learn
typescript it's not that difficult
Begg now I only work with HTML like okay
well do you a favor dude what we need to
do is we need to separate our typescript
files away from HTML files and by the
way it's not just annoying web designers
it's actually cleaner this way and the
proper way to do it anyways so instead
of just having a template right here we
can actually have a template URL so this
is essentially going to be a HTML file
that represents whatever HTML we want to
use for the template simple enough so in
order to make one of these just go ahead
and make a new file and you actually
name it whatever your component name was
but instead of a typescript extension
use a HTML extension
so playlist dot component dot HTML so
now we can actually copy that so we can
use it later on and instead of template
make sure it's named template URL so
again a template is just for basic HTML
but whenever you're using a file call
URL and then that right there now one
thing I want to point out and this is
kind of weird but whenever you're using
these templates you actually need to
give it the full file path so this is
because later on we're actually not just
using this file we're going to include
it in our index.html so it actually
needs the full file path so it's App /t
s slash playlist uh component to HTML
and again that is just so whenever we
use this in other parts of our website
then it knows exactly where to find it
so in here you can
anything you want so eventually we're
going to be making a whole playlist but
right now I'll just write actually make
h2 so it appears a little bit bigger
alright uh my playlist will eventually
go here all right mate looking good so
all the HTML we write here is
essentially just going to be plopped
right in there nothing fancy so now
let's go ahead and actually make this
class so this is a real since I'm
running out of time I'll just make an
empty class and in the next video we'll
fill some cool stuff out so export class
playlist component alright so like I
said kind of run now time right here but
check it out in this video what we did
is we created a basic video class so
later on we're going to be making videos
using this blueprint and we also made a
brand new component which is going to be
our playlist component now just to make
things a lot cleaner
instead of writing our HTML right here
what we did is we separated it into a
different HTML file it's a lot cleaner
that way trust me and yeah pretty cool
looking good see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
