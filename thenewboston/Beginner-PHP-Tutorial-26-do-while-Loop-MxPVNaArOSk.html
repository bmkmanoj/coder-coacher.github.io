another video for the new Boston this
time we're going to be talking about
do-while loops now we've looked at wire
loops and this is the previous example
that I showed it basically counts from
one to ten and displays hello for each
increment or each time the block is
executed now a do-while loop is quite an
is it's very similar except it has one
minor difference and that is that we
don't check the condition if the
condition is true or false we don't
evaluate a condition at the star we
evaluate it at the end so the do-while
loop will always run the block once if
this isn't making sense I'll show you
it's do-while then the condition so we
always execute at least once in here
before we test for condition so for an
example let's echo this will always show
okay so while zero okay so do while zero
remember in the last example when we did
the while loop I put zero in and nothing
happened because we evaluated it to
false therefore the block here didn't
run now do we're going to echo this then
we're going to make an evaluation and if
this this equals false the second time
round we're not going to echo this out
so we can forget about counter for now
that's irrelevant let's refresh and you
can see this will always show because it
will always show however if we wanted
this to display three times for example
and we reset up our counter we can do it
ten times so let's break and we can
change this to one this will always show
once so despite what our while thing is
this will always show once now let's
create a condition so while counter is
smaller than or equal to ten under here
we're going to say counter plus plus so
doing exactly the same thing as we did
with the while loop but while counter is
smaller than you equal to ten
we'll always show once let's refresh so
one two three four five six seven eight
nine ten
it's shown ten times however if this if
this at any point evaluates to folks
we're always going to show the first one
so why is this useful in programming
like why would you want to do it well
you might not be able to think of an
example offhand but you may have an
example you may come across an example
in programming when you're maybe
creating something for yourself or
someone else well you think oh well I
need to show this once I need to make an
evaluation you're going to be think
about the do-while loop because you're
going to loop still but you're always
going to show at least one thing or a
process this block at least once so
that's basically the do-while loop in
