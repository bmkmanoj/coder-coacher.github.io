trapezoids and the trapezoid is a
quadrilateral which just means that it
has four sides so it's a quadrilateral
with exactly one pair of parallel sides
right here and right here and these pair
of parallel sides are called the bases
so this is base one and this is base 2
and exactly two pairs of consecutive
angles that are supplementary so one
into our supplementary and three and
four are supplementary but one and three
and two and four are not supplementary
so like I said that the base is the
parallel sides are called the bases and
the non parallel sides are called legs
so these two right here our legs and in
an isosceles trapezoid these legs are
congruent but that's only in an
isosceles trapezoid so we have trapa
trapezoid ABCD name the bases so like we
said the bases are the parallel sides so
these two sides are parallel so that
means that CD and a B are the basis of
this trapezoid if the measure of angle B
equals 90 degrees what is the measure of
angle C well we said that these two
we said that there can only be two pairs
of congruent or sorry there can only be
two pairs of supplementary angles so for
this particular triangle these two and
these two are supplementary so to solve
X we get we sell at X plus 90 equals 180
if you subtract the 90 / you get x
equals 90 if d is a hundred and two
what's the measure of a so y plus a
hundred and two equals 180 so check that
over and you get 98 sorry you get 78 so
if ad is equal to five CB has to equal
well this is an isosceles trapezoid
because the legs are congruent so if the
legs are congruent that means a of equal
length so if a t equals five then CB
also has to equal five if the measure so
if the measure of angle D equals the
measure of angle C and the measure so
that means that these two angles are
congruent and the measure of angle a is
45 degrees what's the measure of angle
what's the measure of angle C so you
know these two are congruent
and these two angles have to be
supplementary so we're going to call
this we're just going to call this D so
d + 45 equals 180 to subtract that 45 /
you get 2 equals 130 so that means see
also equal 135 degrees if the measuring
the measure of angle a plus the measure
of angle who equals 80 well we did we
just did that right here so the measure
of angle D DC is parallel to this line
right underneath it a B because these
two lines will never intersect so now we
have true or false so there exists a
trapezoid with three congruent sides
well say we have this trapezoid we're
just going to call this trapezoid F and
it's in the salsa Lee's trapezoid so
these two sides are the same length well
all four sides couldn't be the same
length because then it would be a square
not a trapezoid but this side could
equal the length of the legs and it
still be a trapezoid so that is true the
basis of an isosceles trapezoid are
congruent well we just answered that
it's the legs that are congruent so that
is false so that's all we have on
trapezoids let make sure you come and
watch the next lesson where we're going
to talk about mid points and the median
of a trapezoid</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
