12th seed tutorial and in this story me
teaching guys how to build a random
number generator now this is going to be
useful in a lot of applications we're
going to build like say you wanted to
build a computer application to like
figure out when you roll a dice what
number it is or a slot machine or like a
card game where they randomly deal cards
this is the function you use to make
sure all of that is random now the
function for random is are a nd with
parameters now we're going to be working
with empty parameters in this tutorial
but that's the basic function Rand
stands for random so let's put this
thing to use let's go ahead and the
first thing we're going to want to do is
print out a random number so let's go
ahead and make a printf statement and
let's go ahead and put percent D and
let's make a new line and then as our
variable we're going to just write the
random function in for that and remember
you don't have to write variables in
here you can also have entire functions
will act which act is variable for
formatting and % d so let's go ahead and
compile and run and see if we got this
working so far let's see looks good
should I run and it's going to go ahead
and print out a random number and our
random number is 41 awesome number
author choice so um let me just loop
this couple times because I'm going to
show you guys a couple different things
so let's go ahead and make a counting
variable set equal to 0 and put while I
is less than let's say 15 probably need
a other parentheses there
curly brace curly brace on I plus plus
now that's just the count now let's make
sure our loop is working and once you
got your loop built and what I do forgot
a semicolon that's embarrassing and now
it will work so go ahead and build a
while loop to loop through this a couple
times
I'm going to show you guys something and
as you can see what this does is when
you look through your random number
generator is it generates a list of
random numbers and the number is
composed in the range 0 to the max of
your system now the max is probably
somewhere around um it might be 30 mm
for mine looking at it might be 64 for
others but um this depends the max
depends on your system or your computer
whatever you're running it on so it can
be difficult to judge the outcome of
your number so in many cases especially
with like a dice where I only has six
sides or a slot machine where I only
have only has so many choices our cards
or is only 52 cards in the deck you want
to limit these choices of random numbers
that I can output and to do this we kind
of need to trick the random function and
outputting only a certain amount of
numbers and we do this by using the
modulus operator which is the percent
sign now if you don't remember what the
modulus operator does is give you the
remainder of a division so let's say you
divided by 10 well what this would do is
take a random number divided by 10 and
give you whatever the remainder is so as
you can see or not as you can see but as
you know if you divide any random number
by 10 it's either going to give you
something in a range 0 which means it
divides perfectly to 9 now it doesn't
give you 10 because if it divided by 10
it would just add 1 to the main number
so let's go ahead and execute the pile
and run this and as you can see we
should have a list of numbers 0 through
9 and there we go right there
and again what this is doing is taking a
random number doesn't matter how big it
is dividing it by 10 and as you can see
the remainder and this was 1
remaindering this was 7 for this one
invited perfect so it was a zero and
this is how you can get a list of
numbers
but as you can see the first problem in
the main thing that's going to annoy you
is this zero right here if you have
something like a dice you don't want
zero or a deck of cards or anything
since zero is not really a common thing
when you're out putting numbers so
another thing let's go ahead and ten
gives you zero through nine which is ten
options so anything after the modulus is
how many options you want so let's say
we have a dice with six options but the
thing is this is going to give you 0
through 5 and the dice is one to six so
how can we fix that problem right there
well this my friend is easier than not
even going to say because probably get
my video taken down but say you want to
start at one and get six options all you
have to do is go 1 plus random number
and let me explain you guys why this
works this random number is going to
give you 0 1 2 3 4 5 right here when you
add 1 to it it's going to give you 1 2 3
4 5 6 so this starts at 0 and gives you
6 options and this just adds 1 to
everything so let me go ahead and let's
a get 20 right here in case we don't get
a 1 for some reason let's go ahead and
compile and run this and we should get a
list of numbers 1 2 6
come on baby come on baby work oh yeah
that's what I'm talking about and as you
can see that is how you use the random
function to output whatever numbers you
want and as you can see you don't only
have to add 1 to this you cannot do a
bunch of different math operators but
this is a really simple way to use the
random function is just to recap one
more time this after the modulus gives
you the remainder or how many choices
the random function has and this is
pretty much what number you want to
start it if you put 5 plus or andum it's
going to start at 5 1 plus r/n I'm going
to start 1
and this isn't necessary but it's just
useful so you don't have to start at
zero the whole time by default so that's
that for the random function thank you
