another pygame tutorial video in this
video we're going to be continuing to
work on our enemy tank and give him some
functionality we're gonna first get them
oriented in the right direction so the
first thing we'll do is head down to the
enemy tank function here and the first
thing that we need to do is we're gonna
modify his turret position basically
everything can stay the same for our
enemy tank except or the turrets except
for these minuses so the the X is all
that has to change the Y doesn't have to
change or literally flipping over so you
just replace that plus plus plus plus
plus boom done
all right so now we'll run this real
quick hopefully play yes so now you can
see he's now mimicking our you know it's
better than mirroring our movements now
so cool all right now moving on we want
our enemy tank now to be able to fire
but before we do the enemy tank firing
we probably will go ahead and make his
position if you recall this has you know
one two three four five six seven eight
nine elements in the list which really
means the last element is eight so what
we want to do and that would be like
that's the highest position so we want
this we want the enemy tank to basically
always be in an 8 for now I mean if you
guys want to change it down the road
that's totally fine but I'm gonna go
ahead and leave it as an 8 so we come
down here to where we define enemy gun
instead of current turret position we
just say 8 and so now when we save and
run this we can move our turret around
you can see he's he's staying still and
we can fire so now that we've done that
we'll go ahead and close out of this and
now we want the enemy to actually like
to actually fire at us so how are we
going to get the enemy to fire and
basically going to do the same thing
that we did with the the friendly tank
firing or our tank firing so we've got
fire shell and what I elect is that we
just copy and paste fire show
call it e fire show the other thing that
we could do possibly is trying to think
of a really good way that we could we
could not have a problem without cuz we
don't want to copy and paste so so let
me just try a quick quick idea what's
gonna copy and paste this but I just I
hate to copy and paste like this much
freakin code uh-huh no different than
the enemy think really we could have
just paste it in like the positional but
let's see if we can we can fix this so
if our show or fire show that we were
gonna do a fire shell we can just say
let's throw in a final parameter here
and we'll say tank and we'll just say it
equals player okay so the default is
player but then we'll come down here and
it should be the case that mmm let's see
X Y right so the Y variable shouldn't
need to change I'm pretty sure only the
X variable right because this is minus
equals so that's moving the X left when
wrote so the shell would be moving left
but we want the shell to be moving right
so the only major change that we would
have to make I believe would be right
here so let's just say dogs making all
kinds of noise back there start bucking
here that uh will say if tank equals
enemy so if it's an enemy tank then we
want to say this but we're gonna say
plus equals instead of minus equals and
then we'll just throw it else in here
else starting shells your minus equals
so let's go ahead and save and run that
we're not actually having the enemy tank
fire or anything so let's just see okay
so our firing is still as expected sorry
I just have to get it over the barrier
every time anyway so we close out that
so our firing still works as expected
and so now whenever whatever we fire we
want like when we fire
we're basically going to make the game
to the point where like wheel fire and
then whenever we fire we don't have the
opportunity to move or anything so we
fire they fire and then another round
begins so as soon as you're ready to
play you fire and immediately after that
the enemy will fire so that's what we
want to do so when we come down toward
game loop we're basically looking for
the fire show yeah so first we do fire
shell and that's the friendly right
that's us but then we can copy this we
can paste this let's go ahead and add
our other parameter here and that is a
tank equals enemy and then the fire show
the position you've got main tank X main
tank Y that will be enemy tank X enemy
tank Y so replace those enemy tank X
whoops okay wait any tank
y there and then enemy tank X current
turret position for the enemy tank is
eight firepower hmm see this is the one
later we're going to change this for now
I'll let this slide
we'll put 50 but that's well just well
probably have another conditional in the
thing I think that'll probably be the
best but we might have to change that
down the road there's a really there's
some special functions that are gonna
have to be passed through the enemy's
firing but we'll get there X location
that's fine us for the barrier barrier
with RAM high tank enemy let's try it
let's see it what happens okay so it
fired from the the wrong turret
basically which is odd because I thought
we said okay gun okay that's our problem
remember so we said gun when really we
need to say enemy gun which is
interesting because that won't have been
defined
your chances are the player isn't gonna
press that fast but that could happen
anyway so enemy again let's try again so
since I didn't really speak too much
there so the turret position is
basically under this variable gun and so
we were basically putting the same
turret position through each each
function there let's try again fire and
fire okay cool so now we're firing and
our enemy tank is firing Bravo uh so now
what's left obviously so the hits aren't
registering the enemy tank is not
actually aiming for anything he's just
same position same 50% power so that
needs to change enemy tank doesn't move
and that's about it for now
so anyways we're gonna keep working
towards fixing up our enemy tank getting
him to be an actual formidable foe huh
so stay tuned for that as always thanks
