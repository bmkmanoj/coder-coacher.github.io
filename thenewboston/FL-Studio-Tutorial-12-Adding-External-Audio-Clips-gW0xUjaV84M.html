studio tutorial and in this video what
I'm going to be doing is I'm going to
show you guys how to add an external
audio clip and incorporate it into your
FL studio project and it's going to be
frigging awesome so the first thing I
want to do is actually get rid of all
this so I'm going to right click and
drag and we're basically going to be
starting with a brand new blank playlist
or a brand new song so now what I would
like to do is I would like to include
that and of course it's an external file
so it's not over here and I want to put
it in a new channel and actually if I
make a new pattern called song and press
Enter
so now we have a an entirely new blank
pattern so the audio clips that we're
going to use are typically like sound
effects or new kicks maybe you just want
a small vocal or you know maybe you want
an entire song so what I'm going to do
is I'm actually going to include an
external mp3 which is an entire song so
if you have any you know songs that you
probably downloaded illegally from the
internet any mp3s
you can just go ahead and use those and
follow along but in order to include a
new audio clip you want to first add a
channel so channel add one audio clip so
we're basically adding a blank audio
clip channel to our pattern so now you
can see that you have a blank audio clip
channel right here and if we go ahead
and play this nothing happens and the
reason for that is because even though
we made a blank channel that says we
want an audio clip we didn't tell FL
Studio what audio clip on our computer
we want to link this to so that's what
we have to do next and in order to do
that click on the audio clip button and
now you can see this channel settings
window pops up and if you click this
little folder right here this is how we
tell it alright we want to link this
channel to an audio clip so in order to
do that just go ahead in my audio clip
is under sick beats audio clips and it's
this one right here so I'm going to go
ahead and open that and as you can see
this channel is now linked to the
sound file however here is the problem
my audio clip is about two minutes long
and I want to say just an estimate and
this pattern is only a measure along
about two seconds so if I go ahead and
play this check it out alright so you
may have not heard it exactly very clear
over YouTube but what it's doing is is
just it plays and then it loops over
itself and it sounds really jumbled
together definitely not the sound that
I'm going for so in order to fix that
problem what we need to do is we can
actually delete this by right-clicking
it and here's a cool little trick hover
over this entire thing in the channel
settings and if you left-click it you
can actually drag the entire thing out
by your playlist and not just press stop
because when you click it also plays it
so now what we can do is we can drag it
to track one actually whatever track we
want and put it up against the very left
hand side and now we got this entire
hold on a second Oh gross I had to
freaking cough up a hairball
but anyways whenever we drag it out we
can put that entire mp3 on its own track
and it doesn't matter how long it is it
doesn't have to be shorter than pattern
itself so now let's go ahead and preview
song mode by clicking this little button
down here and press play
you
all right so now my sound file is
working sweet so actually in the next
video what I'm going to show you guys
how to do is how to change the tempo
over it so you can make a very simple
remix so anyways
go ahead in like I said if you don't
have any mp3s go ahead and download one
if you want to do it illegally I don't
freaking care but go get one and once
you have one set up watch my next video
it's gonna be freakin awesome so thanks
for watching I'm gonna subscribe follow
me on Facebook Twitter yeah he added
tomato tomahto and I'll see you next
