show you guys how to play the animation
and what I want to do is I want to go
ahead and play it whenever the user taps
the screen because remember what this
game is going to do whenever they tap
the screen this little dude is gonna
shoe a bullet out so whenever they tap
and that's when we're gonna want to play
the animation obviously so I'm gonna add
a comment for animate the shooter and we
can actually just over add touches began
in boom method built in for us so again
this is gonna be called any time the
user touches this screen so the first
thing we need to do obviously is get a
reference to that shooter node get a
reference to this little dude right here
so if we say and Xcode is tweaking out
all right let's shoot her node just name
them the same thing self child node with
name and remember we named it shooter
node alright so that's a reference to
the dude now it's always a good idea to
if shooter node is not equal to no just
make sure that we have them because that
way before we call bunch of actions on
them we can verify that it actually
exists then we don't have any errors or
anything so for the animation oMG this
is how you create it so SK action
animate with textures and it takes two
parts the first part is saying alright
an animation is pretty much a list of
images and I need to play them for a
certain period of time so first give me
a list of images well look at that we
already have one called shooter and
mission that we built in the last
tutorial now time per frame is the
second piece of data how long do you
want me to play those images for and
you might want to have a like less than
0.1 so this is a tenth of a second and
that might be kind of choppy but I just
want to make sure that on YouTube you
guys can see that it is playing and it
doesn't um appear too fast for my screen
recorder so we'll see how that looks
again in real life when you're making a
real game you might want to put a like
half of that but for these tutorials
that's pretty good so this creates in
animation the only other thing we have
to do now is we need to call shooter
node which is that dude and run action
and pass our animation in there so it
says okay you're gonna pretty much make
an animation which means this image is
gonna switch into a bunch of different
images for a certain period of time
where do you want it to occur well just
write on our shooter dude right there so
let me go ahead and play it and see how
it looks
all right so now hopefully whenever we
click in our shooter scene check out
what happens and actually let me slow
him down because I'm not sure how this
is gonna appear so I'm gonna put it at a
quarter of a second again you never want
to do this in a real game you would
probably want to like point oh five or
0.06 or something but just so you guys
can definitely see alright so obviously
we still need to make the bullets come
out and have them actually travel across
the screen and shoot some balls but
right now we got that backfire effect
and whenever we click he is shooting so
pretty sweet that is how you build a
really simple animation so now we can
continue with the rest of the logic of
the game</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
