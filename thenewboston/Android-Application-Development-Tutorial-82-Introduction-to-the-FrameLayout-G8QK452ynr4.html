Android tutorial and what I want to
quickly show you guys is I added some
buttons as you can see here in our
linear layout right before slide our
drawer and we're going to click this and
now we're going to open our handle but
as you can see it just stops right here
because you know for linear layout
that's all available height that we have
but basically a way that we can surpass
that is using something called the frame
layout and that's what this tutorial is
going to be about just so again you guys
can be a little more customizing your
application we still want our handle go
all the way up and we can achieve that
by setting up a frame layout so what
we're going to do is we're actually
going to cut this closing statement of
our linear layout I know you guys
probably don't have that yet but I'm I'm
positive you guys can set something up
like this just set up four buttons and a
linear layout here we're just going to
paste that right here so we still have a
linear layout for our buttons which has
vertical orientation so our four buttons
are there but now what we're going to do
we're going to copy this beginning
statement here and paste a new kind of a
new class all right I'm sorry just say
new layout above this layout here and
what we're going to have this layout be
is something called a frame layout like
that and the frame layout there's no
orientation and basically the frame
layout is going to allow us to draw on
top of each other like you know linear
layouts like hey guys let's get
organized either you get blow in or get
to the right side you know guys come on
come on stay in line here and frameworks
like screw that crap like stand on top
of each other you know I don't care if
you guys kick each other everyone do
whatever they want
who gives a he's like who you know guys
whatever just do whatever you want so
that's that's what we're going to set up
here to encompass our whole class and
then we just have to close off our frame
layout here below our sliding drawer so
now when we
our application it's gonna get buck wild
so basically what's happening now again
our linear layout still controls all of
our buttons but that's still within our
frame layout where it's like hey who
really cares what you guys do I'm so as
you guys see when we run this now of our
slider class we can go way beyond where
we could before and slide it still all
the way up because the framework or the
frame layout just really doesn't care
like I said and then we can still click
our check button and obviously like we
this isn't the best kind of a linear
layout but I don't want to spend too
much time on some mundane things but as
you can see we can still click these
previous buttons here so you know it's
that's not probably the best choice when
you guys have a drawer like this a
sliding drawer but you know that's fine
I just want to show you guys what the
frame layout could do for you and you
know you can develop that way as well
and if we didn't have this linear layout
here basically all for these buttons
would just compile on top of each other
because again the frame layout doesn't
even care so that that's pretty much
done in this tutorial just to introduce
you guys to the frame layout and get you
going with that and then the next
tutorial we're just going to quickly
just code that drawer and I'm going to
show you some of the methods that you
can use but uh here we go this again was
with I took out the linear layout and I
rendered I started the application we
have four of our buttons right on top of
each other there because we were in the
frame layout there's no organization we
can still slide up but that's why we had
that linear layout controlling those
four buttons there so I'll catch you
guys in the next tutorial peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
