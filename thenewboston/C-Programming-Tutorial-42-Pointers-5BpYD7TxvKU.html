video and in this tutorial what I want
to do is I want to start talking to you
guys about something called pointers now
a pointer is a kind of confusing concept
whenever you start to learn it but it's
something and see that you need to learn
if you want how-to if you want to learn
how to build really powerful and really
awesome applications so again a lot of
people get confused at first so what I'm
going to do is I'm going to teach you
guys the core basics of it and then I'm
going to be showing you guys why it's
useful and eventually showing you guys
how to build awesome pieces of software
with it but for now let's just go ahead
and stick with the basics so the first
thing that we need to do is go ahead and
create any old variable make it an
variable instead of equal to anything
you want I'm going to call my tuna going
to set it equal to 19 so the first thing
I'm going to display is I want to show
you guys how and where your computer
actually stores this variable in its
memory so use printf and in order to
print out a memory address on your
computer it's not exactly a number so we
can't use percent d it's not exactly a
string so we can't use percent s it
actually needs a special symbol to let
it know okay I'm going to be printing
out a memory address and that is % P and
as you guys are going to see later on
that stands for pointer now of course if
we just try to print out tuna it's going
to try to print 19 which is in the case
we want to see where in our computer's
memory this is printed out so in order
to do that we need to use a special
symbol called an ampersand right there
you guys know what let's call it Isaac I
just don't know why I said that but
basically ampersand and then the name of
the variable says print out the memory
address of where this tuna variable is
on your computer so let's do that right
now so this tuna variable is stored
somewhere in our computer in memory 0 0
to a FF 1 C okay that's a I don't know
kind of interesting Bucky I mean
computers absolutely obviously store
very
Abel's a little bit different than we
think they do and the reason for this is
because if we just try to use that
memory address instead of this variable
name I mean it's kind of hard to work
with it's kind of hard to remember and
understand so what C allows us to do is
use this name instead okay cool but who
cares you know who cares what happens
behind the scenes in our memory not
important kind of interesting but who
cares let's skip pointers for now
well just a second there are some
instances where you need to actually
work with the memory address of your
computer and in about three tutorials
you guys are going to see exactly why
but for now let me display a couple
things to you so what we can do is I'm
going to be building a little program in
this tutorial that basically shows you
guys the address the name and the value
of a few variables including pointers so
the first thing is we're going to be
printing out the memory dress just like
we saw and then the name of the variable
which in this case would be tuna and
then the value of it which would be 19
but it's going to be a little cooler
than that so of course well I guess you
can let's just keep that line simple
we'll keep this program really easy to
understand so in this print statement
down here what we'll do it first for
this tuna variable so of course the
first thing we want to print out is % P
and then tab that and then the name of
course it's just going to be a string
this is just going to say tuna so % s
tab and lastly the value which is % d
take it to a new line so we'll print out
tuna the address of tuna which is going
to be 0 0 whatever tomato tomahto then
the name which is tuna and then the
value and of course just like before
whenever you want to print out the value
of a variable just use this name on % d
run it and check it out so now we can
visualize this a little bit better so
this tuna variable has a value of 19 in
to us we can
just use the word tuna because see is
pretty cool and it allows us programmers
of stupid human beings to use simple
names for stuff but of course there's
not just a random spot in your
computer's memory named tuna waiting to
be filled with some number so we made
this but what your computer actually
sees is this space right here that's a
space that was waiting and whenever it
actually uses this variable that is the
address that it has to go to all right
so that was pretty interesting so what
the heck's a pointer well we know that
this right here is a memory address and
what a pointer is is a special type of
variable that can hold this address
because look at it 0:02 a ff1 see well
we can't just store it in like an INT
because it has characters in it we don't
really want to store it in a string
because it's kind of like a mixed up has
numbers so we need to make a special
type of variable whenever we want to
store these addresses and those
variables are called pointers I'll show
you guys how to do that right now so in
order to make a pointer variable you
type what data you're going to be
storing or we'll store a pointer to this
one which was an int so put int and if
we just type the name after it it's
going to be a regular integer variable
but we say we want to store the memory
address of an integer variable so if you
type the asterisks it's above the a on
your keyboard what this is basically
telling C is we're going to be making a
special type of variable to hold a
memory address called a pointer now the
truth is you can name your pointers
anything you want you can even name it
tuna too but it's common practice among
programmers to begin all pointer names
with a lowercase P and then type the
variable name that it's pointing to and
that's just so later on arm you can see
okay this P tuna is a pointer to tuna
you know just a common sense stuff so of
course this isn't going to be holding
the actual integer it's going to be
holding the memory address now we
already know how to access the memory
address with an ampersand and then
the name of the variable so now what we
can do is we can use this P tuna
interchangeably whenever we would have
used this and I'll show you guys that
right now so let's print something else
out right now and we'll just change this
one right here
I guess I'll type it out P tuna so what
this line prints out and what this line
prints out is essentially the same exact
thing so we can now use this variable P
tuna instead of accessing the memory of
this directly and I know you guys are
saying okay that still doesn't explain
why I would ever need a pointer and for
right now we kind of just need to
understand the basics before we learn
about things like how it raised our kind
of pointers and the heap and all that
crap and how to make cool expandable
applications but for right now as long
as you understand this you'll be good to
go so the one other thing that I want to
do just so this sticks in your brain is
this so let me actually print out the
memory address of this pointer variable
and then I'll put P tuna and P tuna and
change this to a P right there now if
you run this check it out so of course
this is the inner information for tuna
these top two lines they're redundant
this is where tuna is stored on your
computer so is this and the value of
tuna is 19 but this last line right here
right down here this third one it prints
out the information for the pointer of
tuna now as you can see the value isn't
19 the value of P tuna is the memory
address of tuna the 0 0 to a FF 1 C is
equal to the memory address of tuna so
that's what we said in this line right
here we're going to be making a special
type of variable called a pointer and
its value is equal to the memory address
of another variable so actually let me
go ahead
delete this line because it's probably
confusing guys a little bit so again if
you take one thing away from this
tutorial is this you can make a special
type of variable called a pointer and
its value is something weird it's not a
number it's not a character it's the
memory address of another variable in
this case tuna so in order to get the
value of it it says okay go to tuna find
out what its memory addresses and store
it in this new pointer variable and of
course since this is a new variable it
has its own memory address somewhere on
your computer
so the last thing I want to point out is
that I know you guys don't understand
why the heck we would even need these
pointers at because right now we're just
learning what they are but in the next
tutorial I want to teach you one more
concept and then after that we're
actually going to be using them in an
application and you guys are going to
see why they are incredibly cool but for
now
then guys for watching don't forget
