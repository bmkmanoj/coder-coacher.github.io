slash on live gamer for the new Boston
and in this tutorial we're gonna be
talking about nested namespaces now just
like a whole bunch of stuff inside of
Visual Basic you can nest namespaces so
let's go ahead and get rid of this code
that we have already added so we will
delete our person and if you have no
clue what this code is then you might
want to go ahead and move back a couple
of tutorials see what we're doing okay
so what we can do is come up here and we
can just create another namespace to
nest people other people and friends
inside of it so we'll just go ahead and
type namespace all people and then we
can go ahead and end that with an end
namespace so you can see that we have
they have sex all people and then we
have two namespaces nested inside of it
so this is a better way of organizing
your types inside of Visual Basic but
there's also another way of nesting
namespaces that I will go into in the
next tutorial is a little bit better
than this but I figured I should teach
you guys this anyway because it's always
good to know if you need it so we'll go
ahead and come back over here to form
one BB and we'll go ahead and create an
object so we'll type private friend or
here my friend or here let's do my new
friend as new things here that we're
gonna have to specify the namespace all
people so all people dot friends dot
people
so now we have access to all the stuff
that is inside of people inside of our
friends namespace so we can access the
properties first name last name and
years friends so let's just go ahead and
send the year's friends - okay so we'll
go ahead and come back here to our forum
one maybe maybe didn't know what I just
did there I added was the the integer
years friends - the two string to the
override to string function so it will
give us back the first name last name
and years friends so let's just go ahead
and add another text box here so come
down here and select text box and we
will add another label and we will say
years being friends
okay so now let's come over here to our
four Mondavi B now what we want to do is
we want to select set the properties of
my new friend whenever the button one is
clicked so my new friend first name
equals text first name dot text and then
my new friend dot last name equals text
last name dot text and they'll do that
one more time for the years friend so
dot year's friends equals and what we're
gonna need to do is we're going to need
to convert this to a an integer because
you can see that under our years friends
property it's an integer type so we're
gonna do is we'll come over here back to
four Mondavi beam will type c type and
for our first argument is going to be
the object so we're going to use over
here
textbox one dot text and we want to
convert that to an integer and then
textbox 1 dot dot text is this right
here because we didn't actually rename
it so let's go ahead and run this and
see what happens so we can add the first
name Jim Harris and years being friends
as I say we've known each other for 23
years
click show person and we forgot to show
the person so let's come back here and
we will type message box my new friend
dot two string and we'll go ahead and
run this
and once again we'll type Jim Harris and
23 years being friends and what we show
the person we at Jim Harris 23 so go
ahead and practice nesting namespaces
you can nest as many as you want but
what you want to keep in mind is that
you need to keep your code simple and
easy to read so that lets say some other
developer looks at your code they should
be able to figure out what's going on
without having to read through object
and try to understand it themselves so
don't be nesting native spaces all over
the place and make it really confusing
but just go ahead and practice nesting
some namespaces and once you've done
that go ahead and move on to the next
