tutorial and in this lesson we are
finally going to be done with all of the
coding we're going to be finishing up
Bucky's instant messenger so the first
thing that we need to do is actually
import javax.swing jframe and once that
is imported then of course we need to go
ahead and create an object to access
this class right here client class so
let's go ahead and do that right now
client is the class and our object will
go ahead and name him charlie I think
the other one was named Sallie for a
server so Charlie can be the client now
before I go ahead and actually set this
object equal to some value I want to go
ahead and talk to you guys about this
constructor right here now what this
constructor does is it needs a IP
address of the server that you are
connecting to since eventually what we
want to do is we want to store the IP
address in this variable called server
IP well in order to do that whenever we
create an object we need to pass in the
IP address that it gets stored in the
variable host that eventually gets
stored in the variable server IP so
whenever you you know you make an
application like this and you want
people that are viewing your website to
download and you know actually run this
application then what you have to do is
you have to give them the IP address of
your server however I know that a lot of
people watching my videos they probably
don't have access to like a dedicated
server or maybe a virtual private server
so what I'm going to do is I'm going to
show you guys how to test this on your
computer no matter what server you have
access to as long as you're running this
on a personal computer which everyone is
or watching this tutorial then you can
just go ahead and code it like this so
go ahead and set your object equal to
new client and just go ahead and instead
of the IP address of a server type in
127.0.0.1 now if you guys aren't very
familiar with IP addresses or networking
one
to seven point zero point zero point one
means localhost and what that means is
the computer that I'm at right now so
what this basically does is say okay the
server program is on the same computer
that I'm at right now so again like I
said whenever you actually install the
server program on a server then this IP
address is going to be different but
just for testing purposes so everyone
watching this on YouTube can follow
along just go ahead and put this address
127.0.0.1 and it's going to run on your
computer it's going to view it as a
server so now what we need to do is set
charlie give him a set default close
operation and put j-frame
crap on capslock exit on close just like
that now last but not least remember
after we're done creating the object
itself and giving it a close operation
which basically means close when I tell
you to close what we have to do is
actually start the programming or the
brains for our program so in order to do
that we have to call this method start
running so charlie start running charlie
start running and what that does is once
the GUI is created and you're connected
to the server then it could say okay now
I want to start running I want to be
able to connect to another computer so
guys hopefully you understand what
really happens whenever you're actually
making this program itself first of all
you make one program for the client and
you can go ahead and you know turn this
into a jar and distribute it to all your
clients and you have another program for
the server so you have two separate
programs server and client once it's on
their server and once it's on everyone
else's computer the client and when both
of their programs are running then they
are able to connect to each other
through streams and sockets and actually
have an instant message chatting session
with each other
so of course I'm sure that you guys want
to see an awesome example of this just
so you guys know that you know the last
hour so of your time wasn't an entire
waste of time and this thing actually
works so all I have to do is click this
button right here but you know what guys
I'm actually going to wait into the next
video because not because I mean but I
want to talk you guys through a lot of
different aspects of which part does
which and why this does that and guys in
the next tutorial what we're going to be
doing is testing out the greatest
instant messaging program ever created
Bucky Instant Messenger so I'll see you
then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
