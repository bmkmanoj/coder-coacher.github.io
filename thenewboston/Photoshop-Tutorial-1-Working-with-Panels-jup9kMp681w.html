roberts and welcome to your very first
tutorial in the dhobi photoshop now in
this tutorial series what I'm going to
do is I'm going to start you guys from
the very basics of Photoshop
assuming that you guys have never even
opened Photoshop before so I'm going to
be taking you from a very beginner just
getting you know showing you the
interface the very basic tools to some
very advanced Photoshop techniques so
this tutorial series are pretty much for
everyone so sit back relax grab a hot
pocket and crack your knuckles and enjoy
now if you're watching this video
because you know you heard a Photoshop
it forward but you aren't really sure
what it is and you just wanted to see a
quick example let me go ahead and tell
you guys what Photoshop is even though I
know a bunch you guys already probably
know what it is and that's a program
that used to edit photos and images
digitally now you can use it to edit
photos that you took with a digital
camera or you can also you know create
your own graphics for example if you
want to make a logo for your company you
can also use Photoshop to create new
graphics images cartoons as well now
it's probably most well known for you
know altering photos for like models and
stuff making you know fat people like
myself look skinny or you can also use
it to make skinny people look fat if you
want to be kind of weird many ways I
also already assume that uh I'm guessing
you guys have it installed on your
computer already um it's really easy
just pop in and s press next next next
1000 times its installed I didn't want
to do tutorial of that because you know
if you're using this for you guys
probably know how to install stuff so
install it open it up and the first
thing I want to do before I just open a
photo and start editing and you know
getting real involved is I want to go
over the interface real quick because
once you open Photoshop you see all
these menus and buttons and tools on the
left hand side and all these tabs and
it's kind of overwhelming at first so in
the first couple tutorials I just want
to show you guys how to
Gate the interface or the layout and
that's what I'm going to do in this
tutorial so first of all let's go ahead
and take a look at the right-hand side
and you see that the interface is made
up of a bunch of different panels or I
have to call them tabs this swatches tab
for example the color tab but
technically they're called panels so I
would try to call them panels from here
on out now Photoshop pretty much
organizes a bunch of similar actions or
a bunch of similar properties or
settings in tabs for example the color
tab is where you work with all your
color you have different styles on their
Styles tab all your layers so they
basically grouped a bunch of things
together for you because there's like
literally about ten trillion and of
course not literally but there's a ton
of things in Photoshop and that's just
how they organize things in panels or
tabs so first of all I want to teach you
guys how to open and close panels now
right now we see that there's a swatches
color adjustment Styles layers channels
and paths panel open now Photoshop
actually has a lot more panels than this
and if you ever want to open one or if
I'm talking about a panel and you guys
don't see it just go to this window menu
and the one the options with the
checkbox are the panels that are open
and for example this histogram history
info see how they don't have a check
next to it that means that the panel is
not open so if you know I say open your
color tab or color panel just go ahead
and make sure it has a checkbox and
you're good to go so after that I want
to show you guys how to collapse and
expand these so if you have a bunch of
different panels open think sing it
cluttered really quick as you can see
this looks pretty cluttered already and
we didn't even open any new ones so in
order to collapse these go ahead and
double click the name of the panel and
whenever you do that you see how it
collapses now swatches in color panel is
now collapsed so we can actually
collapse Maule if we just double click
and double click and it cleans
everything up so let's say we only
wanted to work with
if you know maybe the swatches panel we
just go ahead and click that once and
then what expand again but anyways
that's how you collapse and expand
panels by double-clicking the name of
them pretty sweet huh now another thing
I want to mention is that panels are in
groups so right now this swatches in
color panel there are two different
panels but they're in the same group the
same window kind of so what you can do
is Adobe Photoshop gave you the ability
to customize your groups so say that you
work with the swatches and color panels
a lot so you don't want to keep clicking
from tab to tab back and forth it can
get kind of annoying you want to put
those in different groups so you can
take the color panel and if you actually
go ahead and drag it you can drop it
into a whole nother group so you can
either drop it right here to make its
own group or if you want to put it in
this group right here with adjustments
and styles you can go ahead and drag it
and drop it in there so again you can
make a panel its own group or group it
with other panels as well again this is
all personal preference whatever the
heck you want to do that's up to you now
if you want to get super crazy you can
actually have this um level I guess we
might as well work with the color panel
so you can actually drag this and drop
it right in this gray area and then it's
going to turn into its own floating
group so this pretty much gives you the
feel of you know like Microsoft Windows
where the windows are floating around
but I usually like to have them and
tabbed groups just like that but you
know if you want to get crazy have that
little window field have a float around
go ahead now the last couple things I
want to talk about because I know you
guys have probably fallen asleep from
this freaking tutorial already but uh
you know we didn't you know turning the
oranges and the robots or anything cool
with images yet but a couple more things
about the interface is you can also
collapse and expand entire panel sets
now what's a panel set well the panel
set is pretty much this column of panels
right here so
if you are working on a big image and
you want to hide this entire set then go
ahead and click the slow little double
arrow right there and it's going to
collapse this entire column give you
some more space to work on your image
now again there's actually two sets
right here in case you didn't notice so
let's go ahead and expand both of these
sets one right there and one right there
so again through those things you pretty
much know now how to do everything as
far as customizing your panels getting
your layout exactly how you want it to
now the last thing I want to talk about
panels and guys I'm I promise you guys
this is the last thing I'm going to say
about panels and then I'll go on to
something a little bit more interesting
in the next video but you guys are like
okay that's how you move panels around
and you know expand them collapse them
make them float like a window but what
if I just want to get rid of a panel
completely well what you can do the
easiest way is just this say you want to
get rid of this styles panel because
you're like I don't even know it's tile
ziz I never use it I just want to get
rid of it
what you can do is you can either
right-click it and hit close or every
group has a little drop-down menu right
here and this is just menu to give you
more options for example this swatch is
one if you just go ahead and choose that
little menu it's going to give you more
options about the swatches panel
obviously like any menu would do in any
program so now that you are experts on
photoshop panels we can move on to some
more interesting topics you know
something more useful and exciting but
for this tutorial I just want to say
