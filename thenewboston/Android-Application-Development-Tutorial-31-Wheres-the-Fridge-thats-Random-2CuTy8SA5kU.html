Android tutorial for the new Boston and
we are going to work with this new
basically command that we're checking
for called where's the fridge and what
we're going to use is something called a
random basically so we can get some
random input make our application kind
of unique so within these brackets we
are going to just set up a random
variable and again we got to find the
type just like any other time we type we
a time when you define a variable and
it's going to be of the random class so
we're going to say random we're going to
call this variable crazy because when
things get random it just gets crazy and
all we have to do is say new random and
then two parentheses adventure statement
now we can refer to this and it's going
to know it's a random object or and we
can just basically set up some
parameters of like if we want a random
integer which would be a random number
etc so now what we're going to do is
define some methods within this WTF
where's the fridge and again we're just
going to set the display or set the text
I should say to WTF oops something like
that next thing we want to do is maybe
change the text size so again we can
just say display dot set text size and
here's here's where the beauty comes in
because we can just say you know like
ten something like that fifty but
instead we can just do refer to our
random variable that we set up called
crazy so we're going to say crazy dot
and this is how you set up kind of the
parameters that you want it to randomly
slick so we're going to work with an
integer so we're going to say random
integer and then we're going to tell it
how many numbers we want it to choose
from so basically let's say good text
size would be 75 so this will choose
anywhere from like you know
1 through 75 or give us 75 choices we're
just going to randomly pick one so that
kind of sets up a random display or a
random size and we can also do you know
display just kind of review and show you
guys how you can use the random again
just get kind of familiar with it so
we're gonna say set text color and
within here we're going to refer to the
color class we're going to hit dot and
this time we're going to use this RGB
down here so as you can see it takes a
red a green a blue if you guys are
familiar with like Photoshop or you know
working with colors on computers you
know that basically you can have a value
up to 265 or 266 something like that for
each of these and then it's going to
kind of mix those the red the green and
the blue together you get your desired
color so again we're just going to kind
of use a random for each one of these so
we're going to say crazy dot next folks
next next int and then we're going to
give it within the parameters 265 I
believe that's how many color options
there are then we're just going to copy
this for the green and also the blue as
well so it's just going to kind of give
us a random mixture of colors each time
so I mean that's how we can use the
random and in the neck I guess I mean
we're basically done with the tutorial
like I said or with this application but
I am going to show you there's probably
two more tutorials just showing you guys
another kind of Java thing that we can
use it's going to be pretty important
called a switch in case and then also
after the tutorial after that I'm going
to kind of break down some some things
we can do in job as well and then we're
going to start building our new
application so I'll catch you guys then
have a good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
