tutorial that are making for the new
boss them in this tutorial I'm going to
be showing you how to use the folder
browser dialog so all you're going to
need for this tutorial is a button and
once you have that on your form just go
ahead and double click on it so the
first step in using a folder browser
dialog is first creating an instance of
the folder browser dialog class so what
if I'm on skype out here folder browser
dialog and you can call it anything you
like I'm just going to call it f PE for
folder browser dialog and then steadily
to a new folder browser dialog so just
like every other dialog where your most
of the time you're going to want to
track to see if on user actually selects
a path so do that we're bringing up
statement right here we're going to say
if the result of the show dialog is okay
then we'll continue on and if it's okay
we're going to have a match box show
just so I can show you what the folder
browser dialog actually is so once you
have this code right here just go ahead
and debug this button I should get a
folder browser that water yep and as you
can see the folder ground dialogue
basically just allows you to browse
through the folders and just select a
folder like documents right here just
click OK and we get our test but like if
you exit out of it you know look at that
message box so the most important
property of the folder browser dialog is
the selected path and what that will do
is we'll just return the pack to the
selected folder so we're just going to
do ft b dot
and it just returns the selected pack so
if you're going to select a desktop will
be like C slash users slash I add on
slash desktop just do select on the
desktop
yep the path to the desktop folder the
select our My Documents right here
documents okay if it's a pass my
documents done next property I'm going
to be showing you is the root folder
property and that the root folder will
do is it will select the root folder so
it when you open up the folder browser
dialog it will set the folder that will
show up when you open it so we just set
this equal to documents then as soon as
we open the folder browser dialog it
will automatically be in My Documents
yep it's already in my documents and the
final on popular movie showing you is
the description and what this is is it's
just a little little extra blob I guess
right on the folder browser that I log
and you can set this to anything you
like but usually you're probably going
to want to set it equal to something
that will help use your out but right
now I'm going to say like add-ons so now
I'm a debug this button get we have Adam
is there you can just set that equal to
like something to help use your out tell
them like what sort of folder or
something like that so that's pretty
much it for this tutorial on the folder
browser dialog so see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
