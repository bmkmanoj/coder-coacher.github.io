I decided to do was not walk you guys
through client up UI because the way
that a client connects to your server is
the exact same as it was with a regular
um single threaded reverse show so I did
add some other um you know checks and
balances so we didn't don't get that
many errors but there's like two little
additional lines of code that are
different from the first version and if
you guys want to check this out then
just click on my github link below this
video but yeah this is pretty much the
exact same from the clients point of
view it doesn't matter if your server is
capable of handling multiple connections
or not it doesn't care it connects and
talks to it the same exact way so I'm
just going to leave that the same and
what I want to do in this video is
actually show you how to take this code
and convert it to an executable because
I'm guessing that if you're using this
program is to help out some of your
family members or friends with their
computers maybe they have like a problem
with something and they need your help
so I'm guessing if they need you then
they probably can't figure out how to
run a Python program or else you know
because if they need your help there
probably a beginner so it's probably
easier if you take this turn it into
executable and then you just say hey
here's a program click it and I'm going
to be able to control your computer so
what we need to do is we actually need a
new file so new and this actually Python
file and we'll call it set up dot py
actually don't need the extension and
there you go do you want to add to get
what ifs all right so we're going to use
a module called CX freeze and this is a
module that you can download using pip
or you know just pycharm or whatever and
it's basically a way that you can take
Python code and convert it into an
executable so your friends can just
double click it and it runs on Windows
so virtually first going to import sis
and then we're going to say
from CX freeze import set up and also
executable now another thing that I
found so just a heads up of this
whenever you are using this you actually
need to use Python 3.4 I try to use it
with Python 3.5 and it wasn't working
for me for some reason so I just wish
the Python 3.4 and everything is going
to work smoothly so there you go
and alright so once you have that
imported what I'm going to first show
you guys how to do is later on I'll show
you how you can actually stick this on a
CD and as soon as they pop open the CD
or put it in their computer and click it
then this program is going to run
automatically so if you ever watch mr.
robot this is how hackers actually
infect your computer it's a really
clever technique so just keep an eye out
for this they can have like some guy
sitting in front of like some store some
like Walmart or gross or handing out his
CDs and you think that they're a music
CD so whenever you put it into your
computer in click play it's actually not
a music at all it's just a program in
executable that runs automatically so
it's a really clever but really like a
shady technique so guys if anyone ever
gives you a CD from like a garage sale
do not play it unless you like put it in
your car CD player because and because
you know who cares about your car it's
your computer that you want to protect
so anyways
include files and we're going to include
a file called autorun.inf now again you
don't need this if you're just
converting it to it executable that you
want to give your friends but later on
this is the file that you need whenever
you plop it on a CD and even if you're
just making this reference it doesn't
hurt to have this in here so you can run
it as a executable anyways just gives
you some more options now I also want to
set base equal to none because what you
to do for sis platform is you need to
check if this is equal to win32 because
if it is this base variable right here
you need to set this equal to win32 GUI
so all this does is it actually checks
the version of Windows and says okay if
it's a 32-bit version of Windows then
we're going to use this right here which
is compatible with 32-bit if not we're
just going to assume that it's a 64-bit
version which most people have nowadays
so there you go now the last thing we
need is just this function right here
we're going to call setup and we need to
pass it in a bunch of parameters about
your program so you can actually name it
anything you want you can name it like
puzzle arm cool program the new boss
then don't name it the new Boston
because just all right you can name it
anything but the new Boston are so
version equals 0.1 and description again
the version doesn't really matter but
you know you need to give it this
information just so it can run and now
the description is just a description
about your program so what like someone
stupid would do is they're like fun
computer game and they would make you
think that this was a computer game
instead of what it really is and then
you know someone would see a CD and bike
oh this is a computer game I just might
as well click this boom now they got
your computer again people if you see a
CD lying around do not put it in your
computer curiosity killed the cat all
right all right so now that we got our
basic info we need to give it some
options now the first option is just
going to be build underscore exe and
this just means build and executable and
we also want to put include files and
just sit
come on oMG there we go alright so
include files this is just a regular
JSON set this equal to your include
vials object so this is pretty much
saying we want to build executable and
we also want to include these files so
you actually can stick this right in
here but I find it's easier if you just
throw it at the top then you don't have
to go going through all your you know
Jason and stuff like that so the last
piece of the puzzle we need is just eggs
executables and we're going to set this
equal to executable which one client py
and the base is equal to our base all
right so this basically means that we
want to convert this file to an
executable so it's going to go in here
and by the way if you like imported on
other files you don't need to include
those either in here or your include
files this is really just for um
external files not Python related if
those are imported in client app UI it's
going to go ahead and grab them
automatically because it already knows
from here and actually before I run this
I'm going to go ahead and create that
new file so again that files name is
auto run dot I and F and this is the
optional file and now I don't want to
add that alright so this is the file
that's going to cause this executable to
automatically run whenever it's coming
from a CD so auto run make sure you put
those in square brackets and we're going
to say open main dot e x e so whenever
CX freeze takes the source code and
converts it to an executable it's going
to give you a file called main XE so you
need to name it that and you can also
have an optional favicon so I just had a
favicon because this is for my website
but uh
just thought it's cool and then it looks
like a legit program in on a more
professional so icon equals favicon dot
ICO and alright so now we got everything
taken care of we gave this all the
information that it needs to convert
this Python file to an executable what
we can do now is we can hop in the
terminal and you need to navigate to the
directory wherever this file is set up
that py so mine is in multiple clients
because I actually organized my source
code from the first part of this
tutorial series to the second one now
once you're in that directory the only
thing that you have to type is play fun
set up dot py build and hit enter and
I'll show you guys what it did so it
said I thought that that I am gonna oh
em gee you know what it pretty much just
build it I don't feel like walking you
guys through all that but I'll show you
guys some cool art so you see after you
run that what you now have is this
directory called build now if you expand
that and you expand all these sub
directories you're going to see ok you
have a program called client exe and
actually what I'm going to do is this
since I'm not calling it main then I can
actually change this autorun.inf and by
the way whenever you put in a CD in
Windows Windows is going to look at this
file first auto run that INF to say what
am I supposed to do so then we say ok go
ahead and open this file right here and
I called it main before but then I got a
little sidetracked so you can actually
whenever you want to rebuild this just
select build hit delete it and then or
run this again click on setup
da-da-da-da-dah and there we go so now
it's built and it's automatically going
to run client exe in what I'm going to
do in the next video is I'm actually
going to be testing all of this out on a
live server so all the server code
I'm going to go ahead plop this on there
and boot it off and then I'm going to
run one of these clients from the
computer I'm right now and then I'm
going to run another one from a laptop
in my living room and I'll show you guys
that we can handle multiple clients and
control them all with a single script
one single Python reverse show it's
going to be awesome I'll see you guys
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
