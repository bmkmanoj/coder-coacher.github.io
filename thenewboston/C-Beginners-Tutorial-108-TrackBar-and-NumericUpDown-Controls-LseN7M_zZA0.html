tutorial that I'm going to be for
through Boston and in this tutorial I'm
gonna be showing you how to track bar
control in the numeric up-down control
the first control that we're going to be
looking at the track bar control so this
is going to be toolbox and try to track
bar control on to your form we also
going to need to have a bottom so let's
make sure you have that as well where
it's property that we're going to be
looking at in the maximum property and
the maximum property if a stake is the
maximum value that the user can select
so if we were to drag in this track bar
all the way to right it would represent
10 since the maximum value further
changes to 100 then and we have this all
the way to the far right you would
represent them under the minimum is just
a minimum value that the track bar can
represent so when it's on this left side
right here it represents the zero
because it's as far along as they can
get who are the changes to like 1 or 2
or something like that I represent two
right now the next thing that we can
mess with is it tick through fancy and
that basically means how often it'll be
a tick
since our maximum is 10 and it took
frequency is 1 will be 10 ticks because
there is a tick for each value so here
the changes to 100
we'd have 100 ticks because there is one
tick or each value we have to change
this to tick frequency like 5 then we
would get 20 ticks because they're for
each ah
5 value 2 in single tick alright so in
order to get the value that the user has
selected in the track bar the key G
value property so words can have a
message box display the value that the
user selected in the track bar key so
just gonna say message box
so here track bar 1 dot value and this
returns an integer so we're going to do
string nothing convert it into a string
all right so now I need to bug here we
should have a 0 right now because the
minimum value is 0
yep I just all the way to the far right
should see 100 because 100 is and
yep and anywhere in between should it be
in between 0 and longer perfect another
thing you can do the track bar is change
the orientation right now it's
horizontal meaning it's like across who
would make it vertical vertical popping
down now and again this would just be
the bottom so this is zero and this is
the top so it'd be 100 so now we sure
this to zero
yeah this up 50-100 anywhere in between
should be and you can also change it
where the ticks are you wanted them to
be on you know this side I guess to be
on the left vertical right now or if you
wanted them to be on their right or I
could just disable the ticks so they're
not even there at all or you can have
them on both sides I think it looks fine
that way I guess it's up to you so
that's pretty much all we're going to do
for the track bar control it's not very
much the other control that we're going
to be looking at is numeric shutdown and
the numeric up/down basically just only
allows you to type numbers in there and
so we're good just debug here but all
right so now maybe bug you can only
enter numbers in here it's pretty much a
mask text box that only allows you to
enter numbers so we can only enter a
number that we try to take into letters
but the nice thing about this is it will
just increment it for us so miss have it
go up by one but you can change how many
of those drop for example the
incrementer e now is one for one of the
changes like a 10 or something now would
go up by 10 every time we put up and
with deep in it by 10 every time we put
the down right pieces were up 10 go down
go down and also screw with the minimum
and maximum values the maximum right now
under change that to something else the
minimum right now at zero we're gonna
make that like negative ten maximum is
like thousand and so if we type in like
thousand right here look up nope it
won't let us go down anymore type in
negative ten and try to go down you
can't go down alright so that's pretty
much it for this tutorial
those two controls are pretty basic not
really that much to them I just think
you should know about them yeah see you
