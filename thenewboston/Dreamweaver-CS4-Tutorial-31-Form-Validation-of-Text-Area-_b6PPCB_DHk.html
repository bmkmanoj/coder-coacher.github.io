going to be going over the sprite X area
and how to validate a text area using
dreamweaver cs4 so i'm going to go ahead
and create a text area using my input
tab over here on the left click on text
area just going to add name it text area
over you have one and i'm going to give
it 20 columns and five rows there we go
i text area is now inserted so i'm going
to click inside the text area go over
here to the left and click on spry
validation text area as you can see it
is inserted our javascript and our CSS
for us and is also insert in javascript
down here our options are down here at
the bottom in our properties tab we have
min characters and Max characters if you
want 100 characters to be the minimum
characters then you type 100 and then
we're going to talk two hundred for the
max and you can see right here we have a
counter which we can use what these
radio buttons to add in a counter to the
bottom right next to our text area so as
the person types it will actually count
the characters that they are typing and
it will show it in real time as it's
being typed so I'm going to click
characters count to begin with and I'm
going to run this and it's going to ask
me if I want to save then it's going to
ask me it's going to tell me about
access I already did it it's not going
to tell me about changing these r I
assets and creating this rye assets
folder inside of
this same folder that this forms that
HTML I'll get it in so here inside the
browser you can see as I start to type
it is actually showing how many
characters are inside of my text area as
i type there are two different options
for this counter there is the one that
counts up as you type and then there's
also one that counts down which is
characters remaining so I'm going to
save this and run that I'm going to
reload here and now you can see that
since our max characters is that 200
then our characters remaining is 200 so
you can see that it counts down instead
of up now so just a recap in this
tutorial we went over the spry text area
validation we have shown that you can
add a minimum amount of characters and a
maximum amount of characters and you can
also add a counter that counts up and
down depending on what you need so you
can also do the exact same thing that we
did in the past tutorials with a valid a
tumbler and validate on change I just
left it to submit this time so that is
it for this tutorial in the next
tutorial we are going to be going over
validation of check boxes so thanks for
watching and don't forget to subscribe
and I will see you in the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
