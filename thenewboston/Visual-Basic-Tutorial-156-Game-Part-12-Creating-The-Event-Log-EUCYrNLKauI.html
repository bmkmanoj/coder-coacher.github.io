slash on live gamer for the new Boston
and in this tutorial what we're gonna do
is add a an event log for our game so
whenever something happens in the game
we're going to go ahead and log that to
a list box in our case now you could
incorporate a a module into your program
but a list box was working fine it works
just as well and it's easier to work
with so we're just gonna go ahead and
use that so let's go ahead we'll shrink
this down a little bit first okay so now
that we got rid of some of that space
there let's go ahead come over to our
game jewel GUI we will add a new form so
we'll just select a Windows form and
instead of form to VB will just call it
event log dot VB go ahead and click add
okay so here is our event log now we can
make it any size we want but let's go
ahead and make it the same width as our
form one you'll see why we're gonna do
this later on so we'll go ahead come
over here to size make this a little bit
bigger so it's four hundred and fifty
seven for the width so we'll come over
here to event log and we will set the
width to 457 and this looks like a good
size so what we're gonna do is we'll
come over here to our tool box and we
will add a list box now we'll set the
name to list events and instead of
dragging it out and trying to make it
fit inside of the form what we can do is
just use the dock so for dock we will
select the middle which will fill up the
entire form with our list
now let's come over here and let's
change some stuff about it so we don't
want them to be able to minimize the box
we also don't want them to be able to
maximize the box so all they can do is
close out of it so let's go ahead and
double click on this and whenever it
loads let's just go ahead and type list
events dot items dot add and we'll just
say event logger has successfully loaded
and then we'll just add some spaces
after it so listen events dot items dyad
or let's not add spaces let's add just a
separator so that they can see where
their events start ok so it's gonna load
up and it's gonna add this and now what
we want to do is let's just go ahead and
create a sub that will allow somebody
controlling an object to this class to
add something to the list box you can
see here that we call the event log VB
again I don't know why I do that
but let's just go ahead and make this
public so they can be accessed outside
of the class itself so public or let's
make it yeah a sub add event and we will
just do by Val event as string so they
will pass an event to this now event is
a keyword so let's just go ahead and
we'll call it string event and we need
to add an in sub there so whenever
somebody calls at event and passes a
string to it we just want to add that
event to the list event so list of in
stock items to add and string event
so let's go ahead and we will come back
into form one dot VB you can see here
that I made our event log look a little
bit cooler I made the background the
back color a black you see right there
and then I made the four color a lime
just so it wouldn't look more like a a
sort of a command line log so come back
here and let's find for m1 dot VB okay
so whenever an attack has been has
happened what we want to do is add that
to the log so after the hero attacks
what we want to do is we want to create
that event event and then add it so
let's go ahead and we will create a
private sub create event and then when
you just need to buy Val name or string
name as string so this can be used to
create events for either the enemy or
Popeye based on the string so that we
don't have to create two different subs
for this
so whenever Popeye attacks we want to
create an event so we'll just type
create event and for the string will do
hero dot name go ahead and put that in
there now we just need to make it pop by
dot name because we are accessing a
constant that's one of the things that I
always forget to do so whenever we
create the event what we want to do is
type let's say or we'll make it a
function because we need to return an
event that has happened so as a string
so when that event is created what we'll
do is we will return
and then we will add we will do a string
name and then we will add some stuff to
it so out of space has used that what we
want to do is get the attack that they
have used so we'll do hero dot and let's
come over here and we'll go into popeye
so we want to access this attacks right
here at the index of let's see here
attack num so we need to make attack
non-public so that we can see it so
we'll just do that
so whenever attack is called it's going
to be different so come up here and we
will say public attack num as integer
okay so now that we have attacked num
there let's go ahead come over here into
form one so we'll type hero dot attacks
at what what index do we want to use so
we're accessing the array right now and
we want to add at the index of let's see
here what was that called attack num so
at the index of attack num and let's
just close that inside some brackets so
so here we can see exactly the attack
that they used and then we'll add four
and then let's do how much damage for a
blank damage so once again we will close
that in some brackets and now what we
need to do is we need to get the damage
so in order to do that what we need to
do is create an array inside of our
popeye class</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
