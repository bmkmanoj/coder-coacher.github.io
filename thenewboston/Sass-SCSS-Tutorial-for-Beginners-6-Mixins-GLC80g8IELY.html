this video I want to talk to you guys
about something called a mix in in how
you can use parameters with them in
other words whenever you have a rule
incest and you need to give it
additional information in order to work
this is how you do it and for this
example what I'm gonna be doing is I
kept my demo from the last tutorial
where we had a little panel in a big
panel and I'll add a border radius to
these in other words you see how these
corners are square right now I'm gonna
add a little curve to them and if you
guys ever did this before then you know
that whenever you just want to add a
curved corner to something it's kind of
a pain in the butt because every browser
you need to tell it how to work
differently so you can have a class
called border radius and you would
typically do something like this
WebKit's
border radius and this is how you tell
it for WebKit browsers like chrome and
just give us something like five pixels
and let me copy this because we need to
do it for everything so WebKit border
radius also going to have a Moz border
radius for Firefox ie or excuse me
ms border radius and then just a regular
border radius so let me actually do all
this right now so there's WebKit and
then there's Moz for Firefox and then
there is I believe it's a MS for
Internet Explorer Microsoft and you're
looking at this and you're like okay so
this is a lot of work and anytime I want
to add you know just a curved corner to
something this is what I have to do and
remember the one rule that I told you
guys is that you never want to repeat
yourself in web design so we're looking
at this and we already know that it's
inefficient so instead of just taking
this in either extending it over and
over what we can do is we can actually
use mix-ins and we can use parameters so
instead of just having the same
curviness of five pixels we can actually
pass in
value since we're gonna be using over
and over again so first let me show you
how to include a mixin so a mixin is
just a chunk of code which is in this
case this that we're gonna include in
other places and in this example a
little panel and big panel so in order
to make a mix in before whatever name of
your rule is type at mixin
this means is that I'm gonna take this
code and mix it in to somewhere else I
guess that sort of means and also after
this if I want to give myself a little
bit more flexibility I can add something
called a parameter and a parameter is
just additional information so instead
of just having a fixed value of five
pixels for every single corner I can
actually write after the name rehear I
can type another variable called like
radius now I'll take this and let me
paste this my stupid cursor would work
properly
right here whenever I would have that
hard-coded value so now let's go ahead
and include this chunk and see how it
works so right you know whatever
properties you want to use this mixin
type @include and since you're including
this border radius you can see in the
little text in there that whenever you
include it it needs an additional piece
of information in order to work and
that's the radius so for this one I'll
just say five pixels and let me do the
same thing but I'm gonna change the
pixel or around Venus of the corners in
this bottom rule right here and I'll
change this one to 20 so real quick I'll
show you guys what this compiles to so
basically we're taking this mixin right
here we're copying it and pasting it
wherever we include it but we're also
giving it an additional piece of
information mm-hmm sound like I don't
even know Sean Connery or something
and depending on what we pass in that's
what it's going to use so this one used
five pixels and this one used 20 pixels
so check it out so little panel has a
slight roundedness and big panel this
has a border radius of 20 pixels so that
got very Roundy I guess that's a the
technical term Roundy miss I thought
that is the technical term but it is in
this video whatever
so that ladies and gentlemen is how you
use a mixin basically a little snippet
of code that you can pass in custom
values to set your properties equal to
those values see you next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
