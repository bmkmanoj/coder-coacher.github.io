tenth html5 tutorial and in this
tutorial what we're going to be doing is
we're going to be applying a style in
pretty much adding some CSS to make this
plain-jane boring website look prettier
and I'm going to show you guys how to
layout websites
awesomely so the very first thing we
want to do is we want to hop over away
from our HTML file and into our CSS file
now the very first thing or the very
first style we want to apply is a style
to the overall pretty much all the tags
so I'm going to be setting the margin a
default margin of zero pixels and I'm
also going to be I can copy this bad boy
I'm going to be setting a default
padding of zero pixels as well now we're
seeing okay that seems kind of redundant
isn't that the case with all the stuff
why do you need to set everything zero
pixels well some elements have default
margins and default padding's and this
pretty much resets everything back to
zero because we want to lay things out
very specifically so if they have like a
default margin of five pixels it's going
to throw our layout off so we pretty
much want to ensure that our margin and
padding is at zero by default makes
sense so now what I want to do is I'm
going to go over a few simple tags and
just make it look prettier the very
first tag I want to go out over is the
headings I say go out with embarrassing
so we have heading 1 I think it's our
main title yep welcome to the new Boston
and also each one of our articles in the
main content has a heading 1 as well so
let's go ahead and what kind of got lost
there for a second I do that a lot and
let's go ahead and change the font to
make it look prettier so I'm going to go
ahead and change this to bold 20 pixels
and Tahoma
I really like to Homa for some reason
and the order you need to do this is
weight the font weight which is bold the
size in the font family and I'm also
going to do this too
heading to as well so let me copy that
beast and I'm just going to might as
well keep that all the same except for
heading to I'm going to change it to a
size of 14 they don't make heading one a
little bit bigger than heading two and
if we go ahead and take a look at our
website we can see that okay heading one
is a little bit bigger than heading two
and it has a nice two Homa font
definitely better than that default
times Roman or Arial whatever the heck
it was so now that our headings are
looking a little bit better I need to
tell you guys something else some
browsers don't recognize those html5
tags or some browsers also treat them is
in line elements now if you remember
whenever you have block elements block
elements are always positioned one other
one under each other and inline elements
are kind of elements that get positioned
from left to right so what we want to do
is we want to make sure that this
website is compatible with all browsers
so we need to take all those html5 tags
and we need to make sure that they're
going to be displayed as block elements
rather than inline and also let our
browsers recognize them so this is
pretty much ensuring that all browsers
handle our website in the same way in
the most simple terms so put header
section and you need a spell this right
footer
let's see wilts that we have a side nav
article see Ellie I believe it is come
on baby I'll get it eventually in each
group and I actually want to make sure I
didn't forget anything
header section footer aside I wish here
was a h-harry Sally Freddie and Ned
eight hens
okay
okay Harry Wow definitely forgot that
already I was I'm just going to go ahead
and assume I have everything if I see
something's messed up later on then I'll
fix it then but not my little mnemonic
device did not work in that case
embarrassing so anyways how you do that
is put display block and what this does
is pretty much makes all of these tags
block level elements so now we can go
ahead and move on to the last kind of
tag we want to tackle today and that is
the body now remember everything is
surrounded in this main div tag called
big wrapper and that is pretty much
enclosed in the tag of body so what we
need to do is in this body we just need
to text align this to Center and they
were saying okay why would I even need
to mess with the body if everything else
is enclosed in this big dip well in some
older browsers as well and this is
Oriels pretty much taken care of all the
older browsers all the nitty-gritty
technical stuff and in the next story
we're going to be making everything look
pretty and laying it out but you
definitely need this or else people are
going to complain that your website
looks weird so anyways like I was saying
in some older browsers you need this
text line property to ensure that your
website is centered if you don't have
this then everything else is going to
look nice but it's all going to be
shifted to the left and most websites
are centered some are shifts to the left
if you want to go for that then hey
that's all you but anyways this is just
to take care of old browser
compatibility so now that we have all
that boring crap done we can finally
start laying our website out to look
nice and pretty so that's what we're
going to be doing in the next tutorial
it's going to be a blast so thank you
for watching don't forget to subscribe
and I will see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
