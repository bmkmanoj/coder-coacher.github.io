generator so dim Jin as new random now
we will just declare attack number as
integer and we'll set it equal to Gen
dot next and we'll have a max value of 4
so it will give us possible values or
not let's do a max value of 3 so it will
give us the possible values of 0 1 &amp;amp; 2
so let's go ahead and do a select case
so select case attack num and we'll just
do case 0 so if he punches what do we
want to do well we want to do enemy
health minus equals and let's say let's
do 5 so now let's come up here and we'll
create a variable so public and we'll
just call it as spinach as boo lien and
we'll go ahead and set it equal to false
to begin with so we'll go ahead and
we'll use an if statement so if has
spinach then what do we want to do well
we want to double the damage so if he
asks us spinach then we'll go ahead and
the new - equals 5 times 2 so it will
subtract 10 so let's go ahead and cut
this right here and if we use if has
spinach that will run if it's true
because of your testing and see if
something's true you don't have to put
equals true so then if it equals false
then we'll just go ahead and take away 5
now we'll do this for each of the
possible values so
case one if has spinach then enemy
health minus equals and we will do for a
kick let's do 8 times 2 or what we'll do
10 times 2 and then if he doesn't then
enemy health minus equals 10 and then
for the last attack case 2 the anchor
throw if has spinach then enemy health
minus equals 15 times 2 and then if he
doesn't then enemy health minus equals
15 now in order for us to be able to get
that enemy health and set it we're gonna
have to come over to our enemy class
which all of our other enemies inherit
from and we're going to have to make
health a read and write property so
under our get and in get we will do type
set and it will fill a bivalve value as
integer and what we want to do is type
int health equals value so now that now
they can set the health of the enemy and
we can use that inside of this attack so
let's go ahead we'll come over here to
our form on BB design and let's just
shrink the attack button down a little
bit so we'll make it say that big and
let's come over here
come over here to our toolbox and we
will add a radio button so we will line
it up here with our button and we will
set the text to use spinach
but first we'll set the name - radio
spinach and we'll set the text to use
spinach and now let's go ahead and add a
label and we'll just let's move
everything down a little bit here so
we'll set the name to label spinach left
and we will set the text to spinach left
and then three so the user will be able
to use the spinach a total of three
times now they won't know what attack
this is going to use it on because it's
generated randomly so let's go ahead and
resize everything so now what we need to
do is come into form 1vb and let's
create an object of popeye so private
let's just call him hero as new Popeye
so now that we've created that let's go
ahead and use him when he attacks so
we'll come over here to form on Beebe we
will double click on attack and what we
want to do is check to see if they have
selected it use spinach so we will come
up here and we will create a variable so
private int spinach as integer and we'll
set it equal to three so
if radio spinach dot checked equals true
then we'll go ahead and set the has
spinach equal to true so hero dot has
spinach equals true so now that now that
it is true we will just go ahead and
attack so hero dot attack and what we
want to do is access the health of the
enemy so we'll type current enemy dot
health so after your attacks what we
want to do is set has spinach back to
false so hero dot has spinach equals
false now we also want to see how many
of these they have left so if this is
checked if this check two goes through
and if in spinach is greater than zero
so in spinach is greater than zero then
we will set that equal to true and then
in spinach minus equals one so we just
take one away from it and so when we
attack the enemy what we want to do is
is update the the health bar so with our
progress bar enemy dot value equals
current enemy dot health so let's go
ahead and run this and see what happens
okay so you can see that I've spawned
the enemy and it has full house health
and what we need to do is set the full
health bar when the forum unloads but
for now we'll just ignore that so if we
check you spinach and click attack you
can see that it takes some health off
the enemy and we can attack again and
again until the enemy is dead
and then what we can do is check to see
if the enemy has no values left in the
progress bar and then we will show a
message box saying that do you have one
so we'll go ahead and stop this and so
go ahead and put this code in if you
already haven't if you haven't already I
mean and once you do that go ahead and
move on on to the next tutorial where we
will be working more on this game</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
