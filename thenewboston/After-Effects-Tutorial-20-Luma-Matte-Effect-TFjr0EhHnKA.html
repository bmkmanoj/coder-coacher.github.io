Effects tutorial and then this is where
I'm going to show you guys how to create
an inverted mask and also how to UM
create something called a luma matte
effect so let me go ahead and get rid of
this on the lights here and go ahead and
create a basic mask anywhere on your
composition I'm going to go over my
layers panel and create something like a
star mask or something and as you can
see um whenever you create a basic mask
the only thing it does is just create it
like you told it to but sometimes
instead of just showing what's inside
the mask you want to show what's outside
the mask so anytime you want to do that
what you need to do is go ahead to where
your mask is and go ahead and select
this inverted button and now as you can
see in our composition everything
outside the mask is inverted or excuse
me is showing instead of inside the mask
and this is useful let me play this and
show you guys what it looks like if you
want to like block out like my computer
screen right here and make it show
something else you can use something
like this mask to give it a new effect
so you don't always have to mask inside
the shape you can also mask outside the
shape so let me get rid of this mess and
show you what I got for you next
close my lair now aside for masking you
can also use something called a mat and
it gives you a different effect so let
me show you guys what that is right now
um let me see if I can get in my
Photoshop thing and show you guys what I
created here's what I created in
Photoshop just a black and white picture
and what's going to happen is I'm going
to show you guys whenever you create
something like this all the white it
shows through and all the black gets
maxed out mask out there we go so
anytime you see Bucky it's going to show
through my video and anytime you see
black and this doesn't just work with
the Photoshop file but that was the
easiest it also works with anything
that's black and white so let me show
you guys how to use this
I got my black-and-white image right
here it's called boobs - I'm just going
to go ahead and drag it if I can grab it
just go ahead and drag it on the screen
right here now in order to use this
well let's expand this a little bit
first ctrl T actually leave it just like
that I don't want to mess anything up
what happen or dur to use this what you
need to do is make sure that this um
your mat is on top of your video file so
if it was under here
it wouldn't work it needs to be on top
just like that another thing that you
need to do is go ahead and over on your
video file not your mat you need to go
and select luma math and what this does
as you can see is it takes your mat and
makes it well exactly how you want it to
do what it does is make sure or not make
sure it makes all the white parts
see-through and makes everything
underneath um showing so anything that's
black gets blocked out and anything
that's white gets see-through so let me
expand this and let me show it to you
guys as you can see when I play my video
anything that's white gets shown through
and anything that's black gets blacked
out so those are the basics of a mat and
again the keys you have to remember here
is the mat has to go on top of the video
file and also this luma matte has to be
selected if you don't have those two
things then it just isn't going to work
and again if you want to turn that off
just go ahead and select no track mat in
your backyard or Malvado so that is how
you create a mat and it's kind of
different than a mask and that you can
get more well just different techniques
and we'll be going over a mat in the
next couple tutorials to show you some
real cool techniques or from now that's
how you add a basic mat to your video so
thank you guys for watching don't forget
