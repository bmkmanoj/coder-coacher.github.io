is a PHP tutorial for the new Boston in
this video I'm going to be talking to
you about assignment operators now
assignment operators in PHP we've
already seen a few for example if I was
to say number one equals ten we've
already used an assignment operator here
this is the is assigning a value of ten
to this variable so it's not is equal to
we're not comparing anything that's
comparison operator we are assigning
this value now what happens if I wanted
to let's create another variable say
number two equals five now if I wanted
to for example create a result and I
wanted this to equal 10 oh no I wanted
this to equal number one plus two and
here I'm trying to achieve the result 12
in fact let's get rid of this number two
now for complete so we don't confuse
ourselves so we've got number one and
we're assigning the value of 10 to this
now we're assigning the value a value to
result and this value is ten plus two
now how can we use this in shorthand
we've already seen this basic assignment
operator here however there is a lot of
lot quicker way to do this and this
would be to say number one plus equals
two now what this is saying in plain
English English is number one so we're
saying ten equals not equals ten plus
two so we are taking the value and just
adding on two rather than creating it as
a long string a long line of code sorry
so let's refresh this and we see that
we've got no we need to echo out so echo
number one so we're signing up here
we're performing an operation on here
but we are reassigning a value and then
we're echoing out the value here so
let's refresh and you see we've got the
value twelve so we've used plus equals
as opposed to we could say number one
equals number one plus two but removing
the whole of this we can just say plus
equals so that's a lot easier way to
demonstrate that now for example we
could use the same thing with minus
equals so let's refresh that and we're
left with the value a so we're doing
exactly the same thing we're saying
number one equals number one minus two
but instead we're doing - equals so it's
an easy shorthand version to do things
we can do the same as well as multiply
so here we'll receive the result 20 and
that works and the same with divide as
well you can use exactly the same thing
so we're going to say ten divided by two
and that's going to be equal to five you
can also do the modular so in this case
we're going to be left with zero because
there's no remainder however if we would
change this to three we get the
remainder one so you can see how already
we're shorthand in the code it's a lot
easier to program it's a lot quicker to
program and as far as looking at it as a
whole it's as long as you learn the way
it looks and convert it into plain
English in your mind well enough you'll
understand it straight away so you can
just say yeah that's number one equals
number one plus two now we can also use
concatenation with the equals we've
already looked at concatenation in some
of the past videos and but what we can
do is we can work with string data so
I'm going to say text equals hello now
what if I wanted to concatenate some
text onto this to make it say hello
world obviously this is a useless
example but now you'll get the feel of
how we can concatenate on easily all I
need to do is I need to say text dot
remember we use dots for concatenation
dot equals I'm going to put a space in
there and say world so let's just
comment this line
as it stands we refresh the page
remember to echo out the text down here
we refresh the page and we get the text
hello now if we bring this back into
play just by taking out them that
comment there we're saying text equals
text and then we concatenate in this on
so it's the same as saying it's the same
as saying well it's the same as
basically having this up here like that
obviously like I said I use this example
but it shows you how they how it can be
done and later on when you're obviously
programming complex programs this is
useful so if we refresh we get that
hello world so these are basic examples
of assignment operators and how we
assign different values to other
variables or plain plain text itself in
