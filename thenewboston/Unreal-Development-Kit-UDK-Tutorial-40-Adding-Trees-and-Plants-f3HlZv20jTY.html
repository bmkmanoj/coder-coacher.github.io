40th UDK tutorial and in this tutorial
what I'm gonna be doing is I'm gonna be
taking our terrain we made and I'm gonna
be taking it to the next level because
our terrain is looking pretty good right
now with these Rocky Mountains and nice
little valley and even nice little dirt
path for our user to walk along but
check it out if we were to walk outside
right now no piece of earth would look
like this because outside has more trees
and rocks and plants and bushes and
they're definitely none of them in our
terrain it's kind of like a wasteland
right now so let's go ahead and add some
of those things through the use of
something called a deco layer now a deco
layer is just short for a decoration
layer and these are the layers that you
add that hold the trees and plants and
bushes and even rocks and stuff like
that so in order to do that before just
go ahead and start popping new layers
down in our layer panel let's go ahead
and select the static mesh that we want
to use so go ahead and open the content
browser select static meshes and I'm
just going to go ahead and search for a
tree to see what trees we got all right
some nice options some kind of dead
looking trees right here even a tobacco
plant to the right here and you see re
so the only really two trees we've got
that aren't dead are this tree and this
tree so I'm gonna go ahead and use this
tree because it looks pretty cool to me
however I want to say this anytime you
have a static mesh and you want to
incorporate it in your terrain you need
to make sure that it's loaded now if you
can see these options right now it says
path they added and status you see that
the status is not loaded and we need to
make sure that this tree is loaded in a
memory for us to use it so go ahead and
it's probably easier just to load the
entire package that the trees in so what
we can do is go scroll down here try to
look for the tree our is in this package
nope this pack is you know is it a no
this package no well what we can do if
we go ahead and right click it and hit
find a package it's gonna automatically
jump to the package that it's in so the
package that this is in is
generic foliage so go ahead and
right-click it and have fully load and
now it's gonna load everything that's in
generic foliage should check it out
with our tree selected you can see that
path info they added and status it's now
loaded into memory so go ahead and just
select that right now and make sure it's
the currently selected item in your
content browser and then go ahead and
close out of that now like I said in
order to add trees to the terrain we
need to add them on something called a
decoration layer or a deco layer so in
order to add a new deco layer right
click and add new deco layer and I'm
just gonna name it something clever like
you would never guess like trees go
ahead and hit OK however right now we
basically have a blank decoration layer
it's a layer but it doesn't know what
static mesh and needs to associate with
so go ahead and with your layer selected
right click and hit add selected
decoration this is gonna take whatever
object is currently selected in your
content browser and associate it with
this layer so now this tree's layer is
actually associated with the tree in our
content browser however before I just
start painting them on we need to change
a couple properties of this layer so go
ahead and hop up the properties and
under your terrain under your deco layer
so you now have a bunch of options go
ahead and just expand everything 0 0 and
factory what we're looking for actually
you don't even need to expand that
Factory but if you do you can see that
it is indeed associated with this tree
right here what we're gonna be looking
for is this min scale max scale and
density now these are the three most
important settings in your terrain
properties layer remember this is the
decoration layer we're working with in
min scale and max scale is basically
just like it sounds
whenever you're adding trees to your
terrain it doesn't know how big or how
small to Adam so it's going to add them
randomly so the minimum size you want is
like point two of the normal size now by
default the size is 1 so we're just
saying change it like the maximum size
of the tree is
by default now the density is how thick
do you want to add these materials so if
you have something like point 1 then
it's gonna add a 1 every time I it's
just an example it's gonna add like 1
every time you hit your brush but if you
have something like 2.0 it's gonna add
like 50 every time you add your brush so
how dense do you want those trees
whenever you start paying and I'm just
gonna put it like at point 6 because
that's a nice median we don't want them
too thick or else our players and gonna
be able to run through them and we don't
want them too skinny or else it's only
gonna be like three trees across our
entire terrain so these look like pretty
good settings to me we can always change
them later on but just go ahead and when
you have your settings applied X out of
there and now what we can do is go ahead
and start painting on the screen so go
ahead and let me change my radius hold
ctrl and start painting those trees
right across my terrain and another
thing you want to notice is that these
trees the more you paint just like
anything else the longer is going to
take your game to load so sometimes you
want a lot of trees but a lot of the
time you uh well I just want to sit I
can I'm not going to go into the fact
that the more things you have on your
map longer it takes load but just like
anything else make sure you don't you
know add a ton of trees to your map or
else your games going to press this
forever so now that we have a couple
trees added let's go ahead and hit play
from here and I want to show you guys a
few things first of all you guys notice
that some trees are small and some trees
are bigger and that's because of that
men skill and max scale you might be
able to see better right here that some
trees are small some are big ol bigger
it randomly adds them depending on the
settings you chose so actually that's
basically all I need to teach you for
decoration layers that's how you do it
that's how you add it again to paint
hold down ctrl and left click if you
want to go ahead and erase them hold
down ctrl and right click and it's kind
of erase some of those trees from your
layer and again you can add trees and
rocks and bushes and tobacco plants and
marijuana plants and any illegal drug
plan you want using this way so
that is the basics of a decoration layer
and through the use of all those things
I taught you with terrain you should be
able to now create some awesome amazing
looking terrains so for now I think
that's gonna be all I'm gonna be
covering with terrain there's a lot more
that I can go over but uh for now you
guys got the core understanding of how
to work with terrain so thank you guys
for watching don't forget to subscribe
and I'll see you guys in next Sorrell</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
