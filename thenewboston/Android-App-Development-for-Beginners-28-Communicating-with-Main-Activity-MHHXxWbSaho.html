video and in this tutorial what I'm
going to be doing is I'm essentially
going to be gluing together this top
fragment with this main activity so I'm
going to be showing you guys how to
communicate mmm that was a kind of cute
cute little burp there all right I
always try to compliment my burps as
best I can all right so what I'm going
to be doing is I'm going to be showing
you guys how to successfully communicate
between this top fragment and the main
activity and again it's it may look a
little bit weird whenever I'm doing it
but I promised by the end of this
tutorial
once you see how everything is put
together it's going to make sense
so again if you're watching this
tutorial don't give up halfway through
because at the end it's going to make a
lot of sense so the first thing we're
going to do is we actually are going to
create an interface and you'll
understand why later so I'm just going
to name my top section listener activity
commander is the name of the interface
object and of course since we said okay
we're going to create an interface named
top section listener let's go ahead and
do that right now so public interface
top section listener and of course what
we need to do is we need to say okay
this interface that's going to be
implemented by main activity you're
going to implement it to ensure that you
have some function orcses me I'm used to
a program in PHP I've been working on my
site so that's why I make all
something's functions but it ensures
that you have this method implemented so
this method that we want to make sure
that main activity implements is create
meme now for create meme whenever main
activity is trying to create meme and
again this is just a method that we're
going to be making later but we're going
to pass it in two strings the top
in the bottom so again what's going to
happen is this main activity is going to
implement this interface and whenever it
does it says okay I promise that I'm
going to use this method called creep
meme and what create meme essentially is
going to do is we're going to pass it in
the text from here and text from here
and then it's going to use that to
create the bottom meme alright so what
we have to do after this is actually
have an override method in the override
method is on attach hit okay so while on
attach does is it gets called whenever
we attach the fragment to the activity
so whenever that happens what code do we
want to stick in here well all we want
to have is we want to say okay try that
activity commander it set this equal to
top section listener activity and let me
just finish this up and then I'll
explain what I'm doing so after this
what I want to do is just catch class
exception I'll just call it E and if I
catch that hope for the I wrong throw
new class cast exception activity and
I'll just have to string so we have
something nice to look at or hopefully
we don't look at it alright so actually
I might as well just finish up all this
code and then I'll talk you guys through
it so on button clicked and I added a
little comment so you guys know what's
going on so this eventually gets called
whenever the user clicks the button
remember we just stuck it down here to
make it nice and neat and inside here
for that activity commander thing which
what the heck is that you're going to
call create meme and remember great meme
is pretty much how we communicate to
mainactivity so whenever we're
communicating with it we're going to
give it two pieces of data to pass along
to bottom picture fragment and those two
pieces of data are the text that the
user typed in here and in here so how do
we get that text well the two parameters
are top text input and to get the text
from edit text it's just a method get
text and convert it to a string which
pretty much means just the text itself
so the first parameter is the top text
that they typed in and the second
parameter is the bottom text so the same
exact thing essentially so to string
alright so let's go ahead and step back
and essentially see what the heck just
happened so what's going to happen is
we're saying whenever you want to talk
to top section fragment in order to do
that you need to implement this
interface right here so later on we're
going to implement it from main activity
now whenever we implement this interface
that we just created
what main activity is doing is it same
okay I implemented it so I promise that
I'm going to create this method called
create me now we need to ensure that
this method gets created because if
we're trying to talk to main activity
and pass along that information and they
don't have a method called create meme
well that's going to cause a whole bunch
of trouble so saying okay
whenever I attach this fragment on main
activity then I'm going to create that
interface what you just did actually
right here is where we created it and
then since I created this I'm going to
include this method and eventually
whenever they click the button they're
going to go to main activity and call
the great meme
method with these two pieces of
information so I know it's kind of weird
but that is how top section and main
activity talk to one another and if you
made it through this tutorial I promise
everything else is actually really easy
so that was the hardest part so if you
don't understand then well you probably
will by the end of this tutorial
it's probably going to be like two more
videos maybe even one so for now thank
you guys for watching don't forget to
subscribe and I'll see you guys next
