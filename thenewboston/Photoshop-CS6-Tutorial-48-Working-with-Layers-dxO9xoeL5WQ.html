Photoshop cs6 tutorial my name is buddy
Blackford and today I'm just going to
show you some things that you can do
with the layers and these are a bunch of
little things that you can do but they
are essential to being able to work with
layers like nice and efficiently and
everything like that so let's just start
out with some with some basics that I
haven't gone over yet so we're just
going to start by creating a new layer
which I have showed but there are a
couple of ways to create your new layers
so the first one is by clicking down
here in the bottom right on this little
piece of folded paper down in your
layers panel if you click that it
creates a new layer for you and this is
just the basic regular layer that you
can do pretty much anything you want to
the next thing I wanted to show you is
that you can take images that you have
in your Windows Explorer or in your Mac
finder and drag them onto your canvas
and then they'll answer a layer for you
also so I've got the Explorer open for
me right now and I'm just going to bring
it over a little bit over here so it's
not taking up like the whole entire
screen and I'm going to just grab
something and just drag it right over
and it'll place it here for me now when
you place it it allows you to scale and
everything like that so you have that
choice when you're going or when you're
doing that and then then the last way to
add an image is are to add something
here to add a new layer file and then
place and you'll be able to just select
whatever you want so I'll select this
because I it's I don't have to resize it
and I just hit enter and there we go
so there's some ways to create new
layers now when you have a your layers
in here you're able to drag them around
and reorder them so if you click on a
layer and have it selected and you drag
it you're able to drag
into a different area so that way you
can reorder what's on top and what's
below so for example I'm going to take
this business Pig picture here I'm going
to put that on the top and then we can
see that this picture here of Jobi with
the bass is below the business pig in
the lair so if I drag business Pig on
top of it it's going to be over top in
the layers also so that's how the layers
work now that's on the normal blending
mode here just so you know so if you
keep mostly everything on normal in your
project it'll overlap like this now if I
bring Joey up above obviously Jovie is
going to be over top in the layers and
that's how the layer system is working
for us here so let me just move this out
of the way and put him so he's not
laying over top now you can move the
stacking order in your layers with your
keyboard and there is a hotkey and I'll
just type it out real quick for you so
it's going to be control if you're on
the windows and then if you're using the
Mac it's going to be I think it's the
option key and then you're going to
either use the left of this one you're
going to use the left bracket or right
bracket and the left left bracket moves
the layers down and the right bracket
moves the layers up for some reason
that's like a tongue twister for me to
say is I want to say black it for some
reason oh well so that's how those work
with me maybe drag this up here so it's
not over over any pictures or anything
like that
but that's how you move things up so I
have this layer selected and if I hold
down control and then use my left
bracket it's going to start going down
in my layers panel so take a look at the
bottom right in the layers panel and you
can see that
I'm using those keys now on the layers
you also have these eyeballs that are to
the left here and these are your
visibility you can click on them to
toggle the visibility and it will just
disappear from the canvas now if you go
to save this image this um this layer
that isn't visible isn't going to save
so it's not I mean it's not going to
show up it'll save with the project and
still be there but it won't show up when
you try to save out like a JPEG or a PNG
or something like that so make sure
anything that you want to have on is on
and anything that you don't want to save
and your final image is off so if you
hold down alt and then you click on the
visibility for a layer it will solo that
layer and by soloing that layer you can
get rid of any distractions and just
solely work on that layer if you really
want it to or if you're working on like
a canvas that has a bunch of different
things in it but you want to just like
save certain things out as an image then
just solo each layer and then save
amount individually like that if that
makes sense to you when you add a layer
you have the option of adding a layer
and selecting options at the same time
now if I create a layer just by clicking
on this layer button right here it's
just going to create a layer and we
don't get any options it just creates a
blank layer for us now if I hold down
the Alt key or the option key on the Mac
I'll click on the layer button here and
then it'll give me options that I can do
I can name the layer so I'll just type
in a name you can check this here to use
your previous layer as a clipping mask
so if you select the check box it uses
the image information from the previous
layer to mask elements from this layer
that you're creating right now you can
assign the color to the layer so I'll
just give this like a green
and then you'll be able to select from
colors at you have if you're like trying
to like search for certain layers and
everything like that we've got our mode
over here and it right here and it gives
you the different blending modes that
you can apply and I'll have to go over
the blending modes at some point it's a
I'll go over each one of these blending
modes and try to tell you what each of
them do at some point in time because
they some of them work the same and some
of them work differently then you've got
a chance to toggle the up what the
opacity is going to be through this
slider right here and that's how opaque
or transparent something is so if I hit
OK it creates a new layer for me and as
you can see that layer has been colored
green on the visibility and you can end
up searching by color here and it'll
pull up all the ones out of that color
so it's a good way to group things up
that you need to work on if you've got
an idea of what's going on so I'll go
back to kind and as my search there and
that's a that's it for that part so
that's good for this tutorial and in the
next tutorial we can start with like
groups and selecting layers differently
and things like that I'm already like
eight minutes in for this one so I'll
just switch over to a new one so I don't
keep my tutorials too long and that way
you guys don't have to sit through stuff
you already know so thanks for watching
this tutorial and thumbs up if you like
and subscribe if you want to see some
more have a good one everybody</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
