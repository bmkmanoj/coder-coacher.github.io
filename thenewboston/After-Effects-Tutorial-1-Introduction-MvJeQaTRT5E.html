first Adobe After Effects tutorial and
in these next couple tutorials I'm going
to be going over every single thing you
ever wanted to know about Adobe After
Effects so if you're a beginner and you
just opened up After Effects and you
have no idea what all the stuff is or
what you're even looking at then this is
a great place to start and if you're an
expert in After Effects then I'm going
to be going over some advanced a video
editing graphic so I hope you enjoy so
let's go ahead and get started and
before we even get started I wanted to
tell you guys one thing make sure you're
watching all of these tutorials in high
definition I'm going to put a link in my
description box on the right hand side
and trust me it makes a world of
difference
so aside from that now let's get to the
After Effects tutorial now before we get
started I want to tell you guys that all
of the work that you do when you're
working with After Effects you're going
to be saving it with a a EP extension
that means After Effects project so
anytime you see this extension right
here that means that you can be working
with it in After Effects anything
without this extension you're in the
wrong program another thing I want to
tell you guys just because it's going to
come in handy is that whenever you use a
video or a footage you don't actually
and you import it you don't actually
copy it again in this program what it
does is After Effects uses that video
from the same spot it is and doesn't
copy it to a new space on your hard
drive and this is so that the project
files can remain small but whenever you
export that's when it creates a whole
new file so in case you're wondering why
your projects are smaller than even the
video then this is what now all the
material that's going to come under this
project panel is I'm going to be calling
it footage so let's go ahead and the
first thing that you usually want to do
is go up the file
import file and we want to input a movie
or something like that just for basics
I'm going to go ahead and input any
movie this is one month me and my friend
in Myrtle Beach I'm not going to be
doing anything with it I just wanted to
show you guys how to import so again to
import file import file find your movie
double click it easy enough so now that
you have this video it's going to appear
under your project panel just like any
other video you import and again if you
input more video it's just going to all
organize right here now once you have
your video open you have a lot of
different things that you can do with it
for beginners if you double click on it
it's going to open in a new arm panel
called the footage panel now this is
pretty much just so you can get a better
look of what you're working with
and it just gives you some more detail
and I just stuff like that it's really
just much a lot like a player like
Windows Media Player or anything like
that but it's built in After Effects
now now that we know what the footage
and project is another thing that we're
going to be working a lot with is a
tools panel right here now a lot of
these tools the ones with a little
triangle right here they have a drop
down menu where you can pick a different
variation of these tools so for this
this rectangle tool it's going to allow
you when we're working on compositions
to select um like how would I say like
circles and triangles maybe but in
anything with no triangle is just one
tool so this selection tool this is a
hand tool and this is a whole bunch of
tools so we're going to be going over
the tools and depth later but for right
now I just wanted to show you guys where
it is and whenever I refer to our tools
panel panel this is where it is and
again the project panel is where all of
our footage
is stored and another thing I want to
tell you guys about the project panel
whenever you start getting a lot of
footage right here you're going to want
to organize it into folders to make a
new folder go ahead and create this
button says create new folder and you
can name it whatever you want I'm going
to new my new folder and anytime you
want to move something into your folder
go ahead and move it in and any time one
second
make sure you have this selected go
ahead and drag it into your folder and
then you can see it's indented a little
bit and that means it's in your folder
and anytime you want to hide the
contents just press this little triangle
anytime you want to show them just press
it again so that's how you can organize
footage so aside from that all of these
panels right here we're gonna want to
sometimes learn how to rearrange them
resize them or open new ones so to
rearrange them just click go ahead and
click this gray area right here and you
can drag it to anywhere you want so go
ahead and as you can see if I want my
project panel over here just let go but
I'm going to want mine over here so go
ahead and click project and drag it over
to the left now now that we learn how to
move around our panels anytime we want
to resize a panel just go ahead and drag
it and this is going to give you more
information and all this that once you
resize one of the panels the panels to
either side of it get either smaller or
bigger so rearrange that play however
you like it and the last thing I'm going
to be going over this tutorial before we
move on to actually the fun stuff is
anytime I'm working with the panel and
you don't see it say you don't want this
footage won or you don't have it at all
go to window and go over to all these
things right here and what these are are
panels anytime there's a checkmark next
to them means that it's showing anytime
there's not means it's not up there so
go ahead and get all the ones you want
see once you click that tool panel
disappears and once we click it again it
pops right back up so that's pretty much
the basics of After Effects and how do
you call it the interface of it so just
make sure you find your way around and
those are the very basics so anything
we're going to be going over later I'll
show you how to do it but once you got a
good feel pretty much of After Effects
then you can move onto my next tutorial
where we will be creating our very first
composition so I hope you enjoyed this
tutorial I hope you learned something
study it and once you're good with the
interface move on to my next tutorial
