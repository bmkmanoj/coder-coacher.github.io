Photoshop cs6 tutorial
I'm buddy Blackford and today we're
going to talk about another filter and
this filter is called the unsharp mask
filter and it's up here in your filter
menu and then if we come down here to
sharpen it's right here under unsharp
mask so what the unsharp mask does is it
creates a visually sharper image by
locating pixels that different value
from surrounding pixels and then when
you put it on the bordering pixels they
pretty much the lighter ones get lighter
and the darker pixels get darker and it
creates the illusion of sharpness it's
not actually sharpening the image so you
need to be careful how you use it like
that one thing to watch out for is that
the effects appear more severe I guess
you would say on the computer then if
you were to print the image out so just
keep an eye on that and especially low
resolution photos so let's go ahead and
apply this math to see what it does
let's duplicate our background layer so
we have another layer that we can
compare to now I'm going to go to a
filter and I'm just gonna apply my
unsharp mask to the top layer and you
can see that we've got some different
settings here now I'm going to move to
actually going to move towards this tire
area and I'm going to move all these
back this is the setting that I found
that I liked I'm going to move back so
we can see what's going on so I can go
over each of these with you the amount
here determines how much to increase the
contrast so I went to like 90 because I
liked how that looked now experiment on
your own with your own picture to see
what you like because they're all going
to be different based on your image that
you pick the radius here determines the
number
pixels surrounding the edge pixels that
are going to get affected so I want some
something like this sounds good right
here you can see how the image is
getting way more affected with our
radius now so this was it before you can
see it's kind of little like a little
blur here and then when I bring it this
up a little bit starting to get a lot
sharper and you can see some details in
it and everything
now the threshold here determines how
different the sharpen pixels are from
the surrounding area and I'll just move
this and you can see how it affects the
image see there it's a if I turn it up
all the way I kind of like got rid of
the sharpness that I was going for so
I'm going to keep it down a little
pretty much until it looks nice so
something like this ten I'm going to hit
OK and then we can just check out the
image by turning or check out how the
filter looks by comparing it to the
background image I'm just going to turn
on and turn off the visibility of the
layer now you don't see a huge subtle
change or you don't see a huge change
but I could definitely see change right
here or on the waist area I can see
change in this then these tires over
here so keep an eye on those when you're
looking at this real quick those are
probably the most visually impacted
areas that I can see right now as I'm
going back and forth the sunglasses look
like they're getting changed so pretty
much looks like the image is getting
less blurry and more sharp and that's
what the unsharp mask aims to do and
brings us a little bit more contrast in
your image so that's what the image is
used for and our that's what the filter
is used for and you can see how it's
pretty useful and making your images the
less blurry so that's it for the unsharp
mask filter
remember that what it does is it gives
you the illusion of sharpness by making
the contrast of the bordering pixels
around there
it makes the letters get light our
mix-up makes the lights get lighter and
the dark errs get darker so hopefully
that makes sense to you guys so thanks
for watching this one it's all over
we'll see you guys in the next tutorial
have a good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
