evening or morning or whatever it is for
you this is buddy Blackard and we're
gonna be learning more in Photoshop cs6
and today we're going to create our own
customized user interface so you can
either stick with the whole user
interface here that Photoshop party has
or you can like add some color and flare
and create your own which is unique
because not a lot of hope not a lot of
programs allow you to do that so let's
go up here into window
up here in the menus click on it let's
go down here to work space then keyboard
shortcuts and menus click on that and
make sure you're on the menus tab
there's a shortcut keyboard shortcuts
tab and then there's a menus tab so we
don't want to mess with the original one
that they have here so we're going to
create a new set based off of what we
already have so this button right here
does that for us and it's creating a new
set based on the current set of menus so
let's click on that and then we can save
this under the menu customization and
I'm just gonna say this is tutorial then
you can save yours is whatever you want
obviously so make sure you have tutorial
selected as your set view menu for and
then we got our panel menus and in our
application menus so let's twirl down
the drop-down menu for let's say file
now we get to change the visibility of
some of the things that are in there and
we get to change the color so what I'm
gonna do I'm not I'm gonna change the
color of let's say open we'll change
that to like an orange I'm gonna hit OK
real quick and then if I come here to
file you can see that open is an orange
which is pretty neat let's go back to
our menus panel now I can toggle the
visibility and I'm sure that you guys
know that that will basically turn off
the menu in within your menu I guess or
turn off the item within your menu
so be careful when you're toggling the
visibility so you don't completely
forget about something especially if you
like have a filter that you want to mess
with they close this up and let's go to
the filters and say you you you never
use this surface blur so you want to
turn it off so it's not cluttering well
just remember that you turned it off
because of if you ever have to come back
for some reason and use surface blur
you're watching a tutorial where he uses
surface blur then you definitely know
that it's you just definitely remember
that it's still there and not like some
problem with the computer so let's keep
going so once once we have our menu
customized and you have done everything
that you want to change the colors and
change the visibility of everything
we're going to come up here to this
button here and it's called save all
changes so click on that and it saves it
and then you notice that when it the
modified text went away so let me make
another change and I'll show you what I
mean no it says tutorial modified once I
save it save all the changes the
modified goes away that's how you know
that you're saved then if you get sick
and you mess up or you get sick of it
and you mess up and you don't want to
use this anymore
just come over here to delete and you
can delete the current set of venues and
it's gone and now it's back to the
Photoshop defaults so hit OK and that's
all there is to customizing your own
menus pretty easy so thanks for watching
this quick tip and I'll see you guys in
the next tutorial see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
