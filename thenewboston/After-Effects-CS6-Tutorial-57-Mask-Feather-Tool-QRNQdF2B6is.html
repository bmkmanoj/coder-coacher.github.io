After Effects cs6 tutorial here with
buddy Blackford and today we're going to
go over a feature that is new to IEC at
six and it is called the feather mask
feather tool so if you come up here to
where the pen tool is and you hold down
your mouse button you can see that the
mask feather tool is right there so I'll
show you how to use it real quick now
I'm just going to make a square and
that's good enough
zoom in so you can see and we'll go over
here to the mask feather tool the hotkey
is G so if I hit G it will switch in
between or between so you can pull out a
mask feather point from anywhere on your
on your screen here so if I pull up from
point it's going to pull out from
everywhere there I'm going to control Z
and same thing you can pull out from the
line there you can pull out mask
feathers from pretty much anywhere there
and I'll just make a few just so you can
see
there you go and my adaptive resolution
is on so it's it's trying to render
every every time I make a move now
there's different properties for these
uh for these mask feathers here if you
right-click you can see that there are a
few different ones here we'll start off
with hold and that goes clockwise or
clockwise and makes a constant feather
until the next point and then this next
point here it's independent so if I make
this one another hold that's going to be
in depth that is going to go across all
the way and then until this one so
that's a something you can take note of
may not not really sure how that's too
useful yet but I'll figure it out as I
use the program more since uh this is a
new tool everybody is still learning the
best ways to use it
so another Oh control-z to move back out
of these another thing you can use is
the Edit tension here and what that is
going to do is a if I increase this I
don't think it's going to show up very
well with the point layout I have but it
it changes how the mask right here it is
a like tensions up I'll make make some
more points so we can see a little
better so move this up then we'll make
another point here to like move it down
and I'll put the attention back on zero
for this one but we'll go to this middle
point and I'll edit the tension and it's
at zero right now so it's nice and
curved if I put it at 100 you can see
that the tension changed if you hold alt
on the keyboard for a PC it'll come up
to the like convert vertex tool looking
thing with the double arrow this is also
how you adjust the tension just click
and drag a left or right and you can or
up and down and you can adjust the
tension that way also the next button
here we have is a edit radius so I'll
come over to this one and the radius is
pretty much just the distance between
this point here and the actual mask so
it's the length of this line so if I put
it at 100 you'll see that the line will
or the point will be closer to the
original mask and then obviously the
opposite will happen you can also drag
there is no hockey because all you got
to do is drag now the next one on there
is a edit corner angle and we'll pull
out from a corner here and say OOP
clicked on the wrong thing right here
edit corner angle maybe I want it to be
exactly 45 degrees okay and there you go
for that you can edit the angle of your
corner there now I'm going to show you
that if you hold ctrl and go over top of
your mouse points there you can or top
of your feather points you can delete
them off
so let me I'm going to delete them all
off real quick so I can show you another
trick so if you hold shift you'll get
over this line right here you'll get
this sorry you'll get this no I gotta
get back on to my mask feather here so
click off that's what I had to have my
mask selected I didn't have it selected
at that point so hover over and you'll
see the plus sign so you can add another
point if you hold shift
it'll add have the two plus signs and
you can drag out and just pull out from
a section there and that's pretty cool
if you want to make like a gradient fade
looking kind of thing I wanted to show
you one more thing if you right-click I
get get out of the way there if you
right-click on your point here not the
actual feather point if you right-click
on your vertex point and come over here
to mask you can change the fall-off down
here from smooth to linear and just
watch to the left how the mask changes
or how the fall-off changes it just got
like a linear fall-off instead of like
an exponential smooth fall-off so it
just changes how that that looks there
and it depends on which one you like is
whatever one you want to use and that's
all I've got for you today on this new
cs6 tool where you can add different
fall-off and everything so as you can
see the tool is a bit new and
everybody's learning how to use it to
its full potential experiment with it
see what you can do I mean it's it's
good for rotoscoping and it's you don't
have to use it just on little shapes
like this you can use it on more power
better shapes like blurry parts of
someone's hand like if they're moving
their hand and it's blurry every frame
you can use the fall-off to catch that
motion blur that and then the copying
artist can put it in there and put some
opacity on it and everything like that
so that's that's like a practical use in
a studio so I hope you guys enjoy this
tool and practice with it learn it and
use it so I'm looking forward to seeing
you guys on the next tutorial we'll see
you there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
