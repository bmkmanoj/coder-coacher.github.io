tutorial that I'm making for the new
Boston and in this tutorial I'm going to
be showing you some more variable bikes
we haven't looked at yet so the first
variable type that we're going to be
learning is a bite and a bite is
composed of eight bits and a bit is
either a 1 or a 0 the maximum value that
an eight bits can hold is 255
so therefore the maximum value that a
bite can hold is 255 now two bites put
together is called a sword so that would
be 16 bits on my short right here just
set that equal to 0
all right and another way to represent a
short is called an int 16 and that's
just basically another way of saying a
short so the 16 in this int basically
just represents the how many bits are
inside of it so we just begin in 16 or a
short so a 16 bit integer so all this
calls is all right and since these are
both the exact same thing we could set
my short equal to in 16 or in 16 equal
to my short this day are shorter and
it's fine because they're both the exact
same thing the next one or bytes or 32
bits is the back same thing they've all
been using up until now which is just
come in that's just a 32 bit into here
called mine interior and central to 0
and another way of representing on
integer is just 8 32 let's call it mine
too and since int and in 32 or the exact
same thing we can just save mine 32
equals mining and the last one is a long
and along is basically on 8 bytes long
or 64 bits long so I'll post my long
term now to 0 another way of
representing a law
in 64 miles or and just like all the
other ones since my long and my n64 the
same thing ourselves long and insisted
for the same thing we can set mine 64
you go to my law alright so up until now
all we've learned is signed integers and
signed integers meaning means you can
set them equal to both negative and
positive numbers so since these are all
signed right here you can set any one of
these all equal to a negative number so
if we want to set this is like a
negative whatever that is on your code
we can set this byte equal to anything
right
well actually know this fight is
unsigned and unsigned means you can only
study equal to something between 0 and
255 so in order to represent a signed
bite you're just going to put s fight to
represent a signed bite so now we can
set this equal to negative numbers as
well and now these however they're all
signed already so to make these unsigned
we're just going to put it you in front
of it to make an unsigned number and an
unsigned number means that it can only
represent number 0 and up so we can set
this only equal to positive numbers or 0
and in order to have an unsigned int n
16 which of you in front of that and now
becomes an unsigned in 16 and same with
all these strings so that I have a UN to
view int 32 you long and au and 64 same
thing all right the next thing is a
float and a float is a floating point
integer and floating point integer is
used to hold very large or very small
numbers and so to represent a flow you
just going to want to type float and
also let's call flow but anyways you can
set this equal to pretty much any sized
number one
to make it like that I think that's yeah
you can say you go to that but you can't
set like you know long equal to that so
but the thing with a float is it's only
um accurate up to seven digits long so
we were to on display this in a message
box let's say this float three a message
box load and my loads are stored in
scientific notation so they can only be
accurate up to seven digits long so now
we bug here and collect you'll see it's
a scientific notation yeah so it's only
accurate up to seven digits long which
is how long this is after that they'd
all be zeros but if you keep something
under seven digits like that that will
be stored fine and it should just be
displayed normal yep and you can set
floats equal to negative and positive
numbers so to make this negative right
here fine book negative whatever that is
and you can also set floats equal to
decimal points so you can do like 0.5 or
something like that but in order to
convert it into a float we have to use
the F suffix just to tell the compiler
that it's a four-armed now another way
that you can store on numbers of
decimals in them or numbers less than
like one you can use a double double
here it's called d30 equal to I don't
know anything and you can set these
equal to numbers with decimal ones as
well only you don't need to have the app
suffix so we can just set this into like
that and that'll be fine
and the final one that I'm going to be
showing you is the character and this
doesn't really have anything to do with
numbers but it just stores a character
so we just use char it's a
representation for c-sharp character
let's call it C and to represent a
character in c-sharp you're just going
to want to use the single quote
sparkies I'm going to be that but we
can't represent more than one character
in a character so we can't do like dee
dee dee dee now it's not going to work
go to setting equal to only one
character at a time so that's pretty
much it for this tutorial
um so see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
