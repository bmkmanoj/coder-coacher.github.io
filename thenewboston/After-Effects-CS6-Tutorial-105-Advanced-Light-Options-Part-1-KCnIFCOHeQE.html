Effects cs6 tutorial about advanced
lighting and I'm going to go over the
properties of layers so that you can use
them to interact more advanced with
lights so instead of just throwing your
light up on there and expecting it to do
what just a light does you can mess with
the layers options to show how it
interacts with the light for instance I
created a spotlight here and an ambient
light the ambient light is turned off
for now but I need that there to show
you what's going on know I've got this
vector here which is a 3d layer and is
affected by the lights so I'm going to
twirl down here and come down to the
material options and we have a few
options going on here and quickly I'm
going to make sure that my background
layer will accept lights or except
shadows so I can show you what's going
on so we're gonna tour onto the material
options here and except shadows on ok
good so I needed that that should
prepare that first but here we go we're
down in the material options now we have
cast shadows on for this guy here now if
I turn my spotlight so that it cast
shadows is going to cast a shadow on the
background
well we already knew this obviously from
the other lighting tutorials but did you
know that if you click on cast shadows
you can set it to only on the image
there so that only the shadow is not
projected now if you try moving left to
right it's not it's only going to go
from on and off for the shadows so you
have to click on it to get on to only so
there's a way for you to only to show
the shadow
I'm gonna turn it I'm just gonna turn it
to off for now now we've got light
transmissions here and light
transmissions here is an interesting
parameter here that I can go into more
depth into another tutorial
but let's explain what it kind of does
here when you have like a spotlight and
it's shooting at your image here and
I'll go into my custom view so we can
see if we get behind the image you can
see that it's black the light isn't
passing through so it's just black now
if I turn the light transmissions up to
a hundred percent it's going to show on
the other side so if you want and you
have a camera animation that goes and
shows the back of the object but you
want it to still have the light the
light transmission is going on and you
can use this to create some other cool
effects that I'll try to go over in
another tutorial so let me go back to my
regular view zoom out a little
so the next parameter that we have here
is except shadows and now you can do the
same thing with as cache shadows if you
click on it you can go to only or off so
I want to demonstrate to you how only
works so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
duplicate this layer and it created a
layer on top
I pressed Club control and press D for
duplicate I'm gonna rename this so I
know what what's going on shadow caster
is gonna be the name so I want to make
sure that this cat shadows which is
there we go
and what I'm gonna do is I'm going to
bring it forward a little bit so it's in
between the light and the other vector
scale it down a little
there we go that's good enough so we can
see it's casting a shadow on to the
background there it's catching the
shadow onto the background squish there
so that's how a layer will cast a shadow
onto another and if we click accept
shadows and we turn it to only now you
can see how the shadow is portrayed in
the back now so we can turn that back to
on we can turn this a little small guy
off and just stay messing with this top
guy right now the next parameter that I
have here accepts lights now if you
don't want it to be affected by the
lights turn it off and it'll just be at
a hundred percent of its color with a
hundred percent illuminated no lights
affecting it and there is no only in
except lights it's just on or off</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
