video in this little introductory
beginner game development story with
construct 2 I don't know what I'm going
to call the tutorial series yet but in
this last video I just want to add a
couple last things one being that first
of all whenever we're playing our game
right now
we actually have a way to kill all the
monsters and then once we kill them all
it's like that's it you can't get a
score higher than 6 and another thing is
you guys are going to see is what you
guys probably aren't even going to see
so first of all I'm going to make more
monsters and second of all I'm going to
make it so that once these monsters
actually catch you then you die and they
just don't you know pass through you
like some kind of ghost so let's go
ahead and first um
spawn monsters randomly and regularly so
we need to add a new event in the event
it's basically going to say okay well
I'm just added two guys so if the system
and let's see if I can find it every X
seconds and I'll just put um let's put -
or not
so basically saying every two seconds
that's the test that it looks for what
do we want to happen well what we want
to do is we want to create a new monster
every two seconds so for the action
which is pretty much the result of
what's going to occur every two seconds
is we want system create object
well object you want great we're going
to create a monster where do you want to
create it on layer one where all the
cool stuff is going on now x and y is
basically saying where do you want to
create it or yeah that's what it's doing
the x and y coordinates so for X we'll
just put 1400 in the Y and put it random
which remember gives you a random number
and we'll just put 1024 which is
basically good and give you a random
number between 0 and 1024 and if I'm
correct this is also an integer so it's
not going to be like six point two eight
one
so basically um spawn it in our random
spot so done so now every two seconds
it's going to create a random monster so
now we have like unlimited and monsters
we it doesn't matter you know we just
don't kill six monsters and then the
game's done and also remember the only
other thing I wanted to do was actually
have these monsters kill this dude
whenever they caught them so for this I
need a new event and someone just
messaged me on Facebook nope it is a
friend request hmm okay okay get to that
later so add new event where was I
okay I have a new van okay lost track
here so what we want to do is we want to
check if the monster Clyde's with the
player then something's going to happen
so the test we're looking for is if the
monster and it's called on collision
with another object player so the test
is when the monster collides with the
player and what do you want to happen
well all we have to do is put player
destroy so again every two seconds make
a new monster and when the monster
catches the player kill the player
simple enough so now just go ahead and
kill one of those guys you guys probably
can't see but they are responding and
now oh I don't know if you guys just on
the right hand side of your screen they
popped up and of course when one catches
me I get destroyed so Wow is spawning a
lot of monsters two seconds is probably
a little too fast you might want to put
that at like four or five but uh yeah
that's what it does so um well that's
pretty much it for this like really
basic series but I just want to mention
that this program is a lot more powerful
and a lot more complex than just you
know making monsters chases dude around
you can pretty much make any 2-d game
you can possibly imagine check out some
of the construct two games in your
guys's mind will be blown so I will pray
they make a I don't want to make any
promises but I'm probably going to make
a bunch of other tutorials on using the
software because I love making tutorials
and the software is actually really fun
to teach people how to use so for now
thank you guys for watching and remember
to check out my website for all my
latest videos and also the forum if you
have any questions at all or else you
want to just share your projects or
collaborate it's an awesome place to do
that so again thanks for watching and
I'll see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
