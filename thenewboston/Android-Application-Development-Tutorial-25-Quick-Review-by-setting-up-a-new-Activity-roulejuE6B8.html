Android tutorial what we're going to do
in this tutorial basic aliy get our new
activity set up and you know add our
references and introduce you guys to a
little bit of Java so what we're going
to do is we're going to create a new
Java class you guys probably already
know how to do this so we're going to
call this class text text play whatever
something like that and I'm going to
open that up again this is going to be a
regular activity that you guys might be
familiar with should be hopefully and
extends activity again we're gonna
import activity and we're going to add
the oncreate method by again source
override unimplemented methods and this
is probably the last time I'm going to
show you guys how to get your activity
set up so you know pay close attention I
wasn't even going to show you in this
tutorial but I thought I'd show you one
last time just so you guys know what
what's going on and now all we need to
do since this is regular application
we're going to say set content view
again have this equal and this is just
setting up the reference to the XML that
we just created so r dot layout because
it is a layout dot text and there we go
we have our class setup for the most
part now we also anytime we set up a new
activity we have to define it in the
manifest the guys remembered that so I'm
going to open up the Android manifest
and what we can do is we can copy and
paste one of the default activities that
we have set up and paste it and then
down here we're going to change in the
text to our class name to text clay
instead of menu and also what we can do
is we can delete this whole intent
filter and I'll explain why in a second
if you guys haven't figured that out but
why we can delete that intent filters
because all it's saying it's a default
category sorry is it's a default
category so we won't really need that
because this is going to kind of assign
it as a default category anyways
that's just kind of for a special
category like a launcher the other thing
is the action name
and we aren't opening these activities
anymore by the action name because we're
going to go into our what was it our
menu class and again it opens it by
reference to the class name so we don't
even have to get the action name anymore
because we're referring to the class
path and the other thing that we're
going to do real quickly is set up
instead of example one we're going to
call this text play again just like that
class we set up exactly same text
case-sensitive and everything so now our
list activity will be able to open this
class so that's why we kind of set up
that list activity I know is kind of
confusing to go through but you know
it's an easy reference to access over
our you know all of our new activities
that we're going to create so hopefully
everything's set up and it's going to
work now within our emulator but the
last thing we're going to do is just set
up some references and you guys probably
know how to do this as well so we're
going to say button because we have a
button and we're going to call this
check command so that's we're going to
call our button again we have to import
the button and set equal to or create
that bridge / bridge over to the XML
we're going to say button find view by
ID again r dot ID dot we're going to
looking for a button the button results
yeah it must be so we're going to use
button results
I'm just gonna oh no now we're going to
set up a toggle button as well the nice
thing is basically the name is the exact
same as the name in an XML so you guys
if you ever figure out forget what type
of variable you're setting up most
likely it's the same name so there you
go we're going to call this password or
pass we're gonna call it pass toggle or
pass hog like that and set that equal to
something we're also going to you know
import it so we can use use it as a
toggle button and find you by ID this is
kind of a repetitious tutorial really
don't probably need to go on anymore I
just want to make sure you guys are
setup properly here and again we're
looking for the T G or t be toggle
button password reference and the last
thing we have to setup well two more
things I'm sorry an edit text we're
going to call this input and set it
equal to edit text find you by ID again
and then edit text commands so that's
what why I kind of use this kind of
reference so I kind of know if it's an
edit text or whatever that makes it
simple for me to remember you guys can
label those however you want those
identifiers again you have to import
edit text and we also have one last one
which was our text view we're going to
call this display when those part
that's decent name whatever and we're
going to set this equal to textview
and text view results so there we go we
basically have everything initialized
for the most part and I just wanted to
review that because it's been a while
since we used or worked with a regular
activity and kind of made these
reference bridges over from the XML but
again this is probably the last time I'm
going to show you guys how to set up an
activity but remember every time you set
up an activity you want to define it in
the manifest and we're also going to
change our menu class so it adds to the
to the item for the most part so we're
going to save it and run it real quick
make sure that list activity works sorry
is messing around earlier and that's
kind of what the past oh I'll get to
that it's like next tutorial so so
hopefully this works
I don't know pretty boring tutorial
really don't learn anything new just
kind of reviewed but you know it's
always good to review a little bit when
you guys are new so there you go now we
have whoa I think my mouse just died but
now we okay no we don't now we have that
new item and again it's when we click
this it's referencing it by the class
name and starting the activity due to
the class name which will open this up
if you guys can't get that to open up
make sure that this ListView item is the
exact same as that new class that we
created or that new activity and also
make sure that that activity is defined
in the Android manifest so thanks again
guys for watching I'll catch you guys in
the next tutorial or we'll do some Java
programming have a good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
