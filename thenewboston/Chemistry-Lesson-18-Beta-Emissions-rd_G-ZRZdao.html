18th chemistry tutorial and in this
tutorial I'm going to be talking about
yet another type of radiation and that
is called beta emission now let me go
ahead and warn you guys first if you
guys were not confused yet by all this
chemistry mumbo-jumbo
then get prepared to be because
sometimes some really weird stuff
happens inside the nucleus of the atom
and that stuff is what I'm going to be
talking about in these upcoming
tutorials so beta emission is basically
the process of making these things
called beta particles so let's go ahead
and understand what the heck a beta
particle is first an electron emitted
from the nucleus okay I think I misread
that let me read that again an electron
emitted from the nucleus I think I did a
typo or something because Bucky there
are no electrons in the nucleus right
well you are correct most of the time so
let me go ahead and show you an example
of when this would occur and then I'll
talk you guys through it so say you have
something like 14 6 carbon it can
undergo some process that I'm going to
be talking about later which can turn it
into a 14-7 nitrogen and also an
electron and we write electrons like
that
so you're saying okay you're kind of
scratching your head right now how can
you turn 14 6 carbon into a 14-7 oh I I
see what you're doing you're adding a
proton well that doesn't make sense
because the mass number is staying the
same plus you have this electron that
came from somewhere what the heck is
going on well let me go ahead and tell
you guys this sometimes in the nucleus
of an atom a neutron and I better write
it down a neutron can get converted into
a proton with a positive charge and an
electron with a negative charge so this
room just to remember that that
sometimes in the nucleus you can turn a
neutron in whenever a neutron decays or
breaks apart it becomes a proton and an
electron now first that electron is what
we refer to as a beta particle
it's the electron that gets emitted
whenever this happens now the element
that this happens through it holds on to
that proton it keeps it in the nucleus
so basically you're saying okay I kinda
MC in this now so since a neutron and a
proton weigh the same amount or they
have the same exact mass your mass
number isn't going to change so that's
why 14 on this side and 14 on that side
however your atomic number does change
because remember the atomic number is
the number of protons in the nucleus so
that goes from 6 to 7 because you
converted a neutron to a proton make
sense okay
fair enough so you're saying okay does
this happen often or like when does this
happen in what kinds of isotopes well
this happens in isotopes with a high
amount of neutrons compared to protons
and the reason behind this is remember I
talked about in the last tutorial
basically I said that in the nucleus of
atom atoms always want an even number of
protons is neutrons and therefore it
makes it stable so in some isotopes you
have a high amount of neutrons in a low
amount of protons so this process of
getting rid of a neutron and adding a
proton it just kind of helps even the
ratio so again to recap one last time in
order to make a beta particle or beta
emission it's pretty much the process of
inside the nucleus you take a neutron
and turn it into a proton and an
electron
did I say Newton I met Neutron you take
a neutron and turn it into a proton and
an electron the element holds onto that
proton and it sheds the electron from
the nucleus so that electron is called a
beta particle and this happens in
isotopes with a high number of neutrons
in a low number of protons because it
helps even out that ratio and it helps
stabilize the atom so now that you
understand what beta particles are in
beta emissions hopefully we're
move on to something called gamma
emissions in the next tutorial so make
sure you watch this the door when I know
this is really weird and confusing and
you guys probably didn't know before
that a neutron can turn into a proton
and an electron but if you think this is
confusing wait to I talk to you guys
about the different types of radiation
then you're then you're really going to
be baffled but anyways thank you guys
for watching and don't forget to check
out my next tutorial and please add me
