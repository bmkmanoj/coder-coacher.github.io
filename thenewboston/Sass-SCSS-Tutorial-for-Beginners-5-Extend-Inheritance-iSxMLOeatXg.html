talk to you about the extend keyword and
if any of you guys out there are
programmers and you guys used
inheritance before then you're going to
feel right at home with us but for those
of you who are really familiar with
programming the extent keyword what this
allows you to do is basically have CSS
that you can include inside other rules
sounds kind of weird when would we ever
want to use this instead of just typing
it in directly inside the rule well say
that we have all of these panels which
are just like little boxes on our
website now they all have the same basic
styling but we have different variations
of each for example we might have a
little panel which has smaller font we
might have a big panel which like has a
border or something but they all share
the same basic CSS properties well what
we could do is we can actually do
something like this we're first going to
make a CSS rule and this is just going
to be called panel now this class is
going to have all of the shared
properties that are going to be shared
among every single panel no matter
whether they're big small yellow green
whatever so a basic panel always has a
border of let me just make something up
like 3 pixels of solid Dodger blue and
let me give it a background too so
background I'll say like light to green
and also I'll give it a margin of 10
pixels all right so any panel of any
type that we create on our website
they're going to have these properties
right here now I also want to include
something called a little panel now a
little panel is going to have all of
these properties as well but it's also
going to have like I don't know maybe
like a smaller font size in some padding
or something who knows so what I can do
is I can actually take this copy it and
paste it right in here but that breaks
the number one rule of programming and
web design you never want to repeat
anything that's in that's always a rule
that you should try to follow whenever
you're
pretty much dealing anything on the
computer programming doing web design
try to never repeat anything
well we actually want to include this
code in here so how can we do that well
what we could do is we could use the
keyword extend now inside here we can
say what do we want to extend or inherit
well all of the code from this panel
class whenever we extend it we're pretty
much saying we're going to inherit from
this in other words behind the scenes
it's going to take all this copy it and
paste it right in here now the cool
thing about not actually copying pasting
it is because if we ever change a
property up here any place that it gets
inherited into or any you know other
panel that inherits it it automatically
gets updated so now let's just do
something like change the font size to
like twelve pixels and add some other
things that are only going to be
specific to the little panel so padding
I'll set this equal to like five pixels
now just so I can show you guys why this
is actually useful I'm also going to
make a big panel and that's not what I
wanted to do let me tell you this so
just a bit might alright so little panel
also going to make a big panel and I'll
just saw a change of font size on this
to something like 32 okay this is going
to be a really big panel and 20 all
right
so both little panel and big panel both
inherit all of these properties and if I
go right here then we can see they all
get these shared properties but then we
can add properties that are specific to
each of these panels now let's actually
see a demo of this so div class and this
will be a little one first so little
panel I'll just really like a little
panel
in big panel and big panel look at that
now let me refresh it and check it out
so remember those shared properties were
a three pixel solid Dodger blue border a
margin of ten so they aren't butted
right up against each other and a
background of light green pretty awesome
now I'm looking at this I'm like you
know what this background it isn't
really vibing for me so what I'm going
to do is I'm going to change this to uh
I don't know like this baby poop color
orange yeah that's what I want right
there so instead of having to change it
in little panel and big panel and medium
panel and kind of medium panel all I
have to do is change it in one location
and look how awesome that is so you guys
can see already that extends or is
basically just inheritance where you
take a little chunk of code and inherit
it in other properties or other rules
it's going to save you a whole bunch of
time and yeah there you go
so think guys for watching and we're get
subscribed see you guys in the next
