video and in this tutorial what I want
to do is I want to start showing you
guys how to create apps with multiple
screens or multiple views so up until
this point we only worked with a single
view application and this was just using
one screen one view and you can create
some pretty cool apps like this but all
of the really popular apps they use more
than one screen so um yeah let's go
ahead and get started now there are a
lot of different templates that you can
use to get started but the easiest way
to learn in my opinion is just using
this tab application so what this does
is if you select this and click Next
it's going to start you off with two
different views two different screens
now for this I'll just name it like um
tab I don't know example everything else
looks good next sure that looks good
right there and all right so let's go
ahead and look at our storyboard first
so the first thing we see is well first
of all it's pretty big so if you just
scroll to the right and right click you
can zoom to 50% and that lets me show a
little bit better and also if I adjust
this alright maximize my teaching area
right here alright so we see that it's
not really set up like a typical app
like a single view application now
here's what we have we have one grey
thing called a tab bar controller and
then we have two of these things that
kind of look like the views we're used
to before so let's run this example
again seriously and let's see what we
got alright so by default before we add
any code or add any things to the
interface this is what it gives us
now this grey area right here this main
thing on the left what that is
resembling is this down here now the
reason that it's grayed instead of a
separate view is because
that part it doesn't change no matter
where you are in your app this bottom
bar this tab bar controller is always
going to stay in place it's not going to
disappear or anything
now these views we can switch between
them by clicking these buttons down here
now of course we got two right now the
first view and the second view and that
was just what we are given by default
just to show us you know the bare basics
of how this navigation controller works
now let me go ahead and close out of
this and in order to really understand
how everything is put together instead
of me just saying okay giving you a
bunch of terminology I think the easiest
way is just to create a brand new screen
so I already have this first one we
already have a second one let's go ahead
and create a third one and we'll create
this one manually and once we see how to
create it we're going to understand
piece by piece
exactly how it's done so to add another
screen what I want you guys to do is go
make myself a little bit more space go
down on the bottom right and click view
controller and drag it out so this is
going to give you a new view controller
in other words another screen now before
I go on I want to mention this why am I
saying view controller sometimes and why
am I saying screen technically these
different areas you look at these
different screens are called views
however I really don't like that term
because everything all of these things
right here are views all the items you
add are technically views all the entire
screens they're technically views so
instead of me just saying view view view
for everything I'm going to review I'm
going to refer to the individual items
as items and the screens as screens even
though like I said I could call
everything of you a table view a
progress for you a view controller but
you know just so I don't sound like a
robot I want to talk to you guys like in
how you would explain something in real
life but if you're taking a test or if
you're learning this in college don't
call them screens they're called
use all right so now what we did of
course is we added this view controller
aka screen to our application so we now
have three screens first second which
we're given to us and this new one third
one right here so now we can actually go
ahead and start adding items to it but
since we kind of zoomed out it may be
hard to kind of play around with it so
I'm going to zoom back in to 100% and
what can we add to this one um let's
just go ahead and add a label so I just
add a label and we'll say that this
screen is for I don't like your profile
or something I just want to say third
because I don't know it's kind of boring
to me so we'll say that this is your
profile page let me just click this and
increase the font a little bit let's go
30 and nice even 30 all right now
another thing that I can stretch this
but what I'm going to do is just go to
editor size to fit content and then it
fits it for me the lazy way and another
thing I want to do is just change the
background of this just because all this
white I really wish that they did give
you kind of a tinted background by
default because um when I'm just like
looking at this close up I'm like okay
where is on the left or right and then I
have to like search for it so I like to
give everything a nice little tint all
right how about this blue right there
good enough all right so now we have
like I said three different views three
different screens so now let's run this
in the stimulator and check it out all
right we have the first one we have the
second one where the heck come on I
thought we just made a brand new view a
brand new screen so where the heck is it
well we did create a brand new view let
me close out of this it's annoying me
however we have to tell us to actually
connect this with the main navigation so
right now it's just sitting in memory in
if you can tell by these arrows it's not
really connected to anything in any way
so how do you connect this to the main
tab bar controller
so what's aware of it well the first
thing we should probably do is zoom back
out so we can see the grand scheme of
things and now this is actually probably
the easiest thing you ever will learn in
your life if you just hold down control
and click anywhere in this tab bar
controller and add a line boom look at
that it adds that connection but now
it's asking what kind of connection do
you want and I'm going to talk to you
guys about all of these in detail later
on but for right now just choose view
controllers it's kind of like the
default connection and now you can see
that we indeed do have an arrow and
another thing I want to point out if i
zoom back into 100% I also want to show
you guys that we have this third item or
icon on the tab bar controller so for a
second those linked to those on the
right and this last one this item it
links to this view right here now
another thing I want to point out q4
again is you know how I drew or whenever
I added that main view controller that
additional screen I edit it right below
this tab bar controller it doesn't
really matter where you add it I just
did that because I don't know there's
some space down here but you can add it
above the left you can even add it way
over here it doesn't really matter so I
just wanted to point that out
real quick Joanie's zoom back in 200 and
now let's go ahead and run this again
and see what we're working with all
right so we got the first given to us by
default the second and now we have this
third right like that so now we can
navigate between the three which is
pretty sweet but we have a couple issues
first of all it's called item and I want
to change it at the profile second arm
we're kind of missing an icon right here
so in the next tutorial what I'm going
to do is I'm going to show you guys how
to fix all of those problems and also
right now we just have a screen and it
doesn't have any brains so I'm going to
show you guys how to add
means to your screens do</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
