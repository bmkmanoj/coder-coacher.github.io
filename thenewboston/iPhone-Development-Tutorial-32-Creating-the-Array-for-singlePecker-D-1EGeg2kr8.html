welcome to your 30 second iphone
development tutorial and in this
tutorial well before I even talk to you
guys about that I just want to let you
know that I haven't created store on
like a week so I might forget a few
things and if I do don't leave me hate
comments unless you know you absolutely
need to then go ahead leave me some
comments but anyways stick with me and
maybe you'll learn something so the
first thing we need to do is synthesized
our outlets which is single pecker and
we also need to synthesize with a @ sign
that's a little better CMS enough
already synthesized picker array so the
single picker is pretty much the picker
itself in the picker array is pretty
much the array we're creating a picker
from so in case you figure out what
we're going to be doing is I'm taking an
array in creating a picker from a so a
picker our picker is pretty much going
to be a visual representation of the
array so we'll be doing that layer by
anyways the first thing we need to do is
implement this method so go ahead copy
that and paste it right at the top and
this is what happens whenever you press
that button and all we want to do is
whatever thing you selected in the
picker we just want to send out alert or
something anything really so here's how
Pickers work we automatically had one a
date one from last time but you know we
don't really have any automatic thing to
make it so we gotta make it ourselves so
the individual wheels in the picker
we're only going to have one let this
time but they're not called wheels like
a been column the term they're actually
called is components so each wheel is
called a component and we only have one
in this tutorial so we're going to index
it at zero so our component is 0 and
aside from wheels we also have a bunch
of different rows in each thing in your
component like each name in this case is
called a row so in order to get
something from a picker he's got to say
what component or what wields at and
what row it's at so that's pretty much
the coordinates for picker so and
s integer um let's go ahead and see what
row do we want to get we pretty much are
selecting our item first so in our
single picker I mean because you only
have one picture on the screen selected
row and component 0 so this means in our
wheel 0 it's the only row we have get
whatever row and they select so this
will return the selected row so if it's
the third item in the row it's going to
return to because they're starts 20012
that's the third if it's a fifth item
you select is going to return for is
your integer so that's pretty much how
you get the selected row now what we
want to do is take whatever object is at
that row which is pretty much a name of
something and store it in a string
variable so NS string and just like put
choice because this is what I've been
going to be with their choose and
remember our picker is pretty much a
visual representation of an array so if
you pick the fifth object in a row or
excuse me in a component it's going to
be the fifth object in our array since
they're one in the same so let's just go
ahead and foot / for a picker array
object at index row so if in this wheel
you pick the object at row 6 it's going
to be the sixth element in our picker
array and we're pretty much getting that
element and storing it in a string
variable called a choice easy enough so
after we have the element whatever we
picked what we want to do is we just
want to put basic alert on the screen
you I alert view just name it alert as
always and just go ahead and set it
equal to UI alert view allocation space
with it and initiate with title and just
hit tab and it's just go ahead and put
like tea for title and the message I
mean you can put this in the title or
the message doesn't matter it's just an
example but you're going to output
whatever choice they made so
that choice object right there now for
the delegate go ahead and press Nell the
cancel button go ahead and purrs like
cancel that's a little better and other
button titles go ahead and right now
that's just housekeeping stuff so what
we did so far as we say are a what
weíll do you want to be working with
and now that we have a wheel we say are
a whatever item they picked find the
corresponding item in the array which we
didn't create yet but we will it takes
like two seconds and get that object and
get string unless you're working with
numbers then you would want to do some
outs but we're not so alright so now we
alerted it and we got a alert show and
course alert release hey out really
really really going to autofill in the
wrong stuff for me that's cool all right
really so remember anything you allocate
you need to release so that's why we did
that so we're done with this method all
this method does is that so next thing
we want to do is actually create the
array but where do you create it well
let's go ahead and create it in
viewdidload so this pretty much could
happen this pretty much happens right at
the beginning after your view is loaded
so when we create this array right after
the view is loaded then by the time they
can choose anything and press the button
it's already going to create a form so
NS array name you write anything i'm
going to name my ex because i don't have
time to type any more letters than one
and go ahead and NS array allocate some
space for it in in it with objects and
go ahead and up put like tuna spelled
around fish
Apple's more tuna and like palm kins
spelled totally wrong and remember the
last thing in your array always has to
be nil so now we have pretty much an
array of a bunch of strings so now what
we want to do is take our array variable
right here and set it equal to X so then
they'll be one in the same so self dot
picker array which is pretty much our
main variable that we're using for your
a equals x so now whenever we use this
we're going to be able to use this all
over program since it's a global
variable and we won't be able to use X
so that's why we need to store this in
here so now that we are done with X it's
that its job obviously we allocated it
so therefore we need to release it so
let's go ahead and put X release so
that's actually all the time I have in
this tutorial but in the next tutorial
we're going to be actually building the
picker right from code and it's probably
the most important tutorial yet so make
sure that you learn all this again it's
really simple right in here what we're
doing is whatever item we selected in
the first wheel we're storing it as an
integer to index that choice and then
we're saying alright take that integer
and find the corresponding element in
your array easy enough so then we pretty
much just say whatever you selected up
spit it out on their lower box and here
is where we create the actual ray again
you should know how to create an array
and pretty much take that array and
store in another array that we made
earlier and then once we're done with it
release it so I mean this all looks
pretty good and uh yeah so actually let
me do this I am view did unload what we
want to do is self no
not that what we want to do is self dot
us single pecker set this equal to nil
so end of your outlets equal to no so
self the picker array set this equal to
no 2 and you also on your void
deallocate you also want to give back
all your memories so we also had really
release that so pretty much any outlets
you have to set the nail and release
them to I know it's confusing but picker
array and this doesn't have anything to
do with the program itself just memory
for your ipod so it just helps those two
simple rules will go on over memory
management left tutorial but just don't
forget to that so that's that for this
story please watch the next story teach
you a whole bunch and thanks for
watching and don't forget subscribe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
