working with forms and we're gonna see
what else we can do with user input I'm
going to delete the data that we just
worked with I'm gonna leave the form
here and I'm also gonna leave the input
submit so it should look like this so
what we're gonna do in this tutorial is
create a group of checkboxes checkboxes
can be used to select multiple choices
inside of our form so to do this we are
going to click checkbox a group in the
input tab and we're gonna give it a name
and what this does is it gives each
checkbox a name so for this example
let's do language and we're going to
create some checkboxes that allows a
user to click and say which languages
they speak so underneath underneath a
name we have check boxes and inside
those check boxes we have label and
value and the label is what is going to
show up beside the check box so the
first one let's say English and the
value is the actual checked value that's
going to be passed to the action or to
the server once we submit it and what
that means is if something is checked if
something has a checkbox inside of it
then it is gonna say whenever it's
received by the handler file it's going
to say English if English is checked and
let's give this on a label of Spanish
and so if this one is checked it's gonna
say Spanish and I would think that there
are some people that can speak more than
just English in Spanish so let's click
this plus right here and add another
language in let's save German all right
and I'm gonna add it one more let's call
that one French all right now we have
created four checkboxes English Spanish
German and French and we can use these
errors right here to click on one of our
labels or one of our values you can
click either one and you can press up
and down to move it in order of the way
you want it to display once you say ok
and right here it says layout using line
breaks or a table and basically it'll
it'll either put break tags in between
your checkboxes or it'll create a table
for you that will create individual rows
for each check box and label so for this
one we're just going to use the default
which is line break so we're gonna say
ok so let's inspect this a little bit
and see what we just generated here we
see that it is wrapped all of our check
boxes in a paragraph tag and right here
is our first input see it's of type
check box and it has the name language
which each one have and it also has the
value Spanish which is what would be
submitted if that checkbox is checked
and it also has an ID and in the last
tutorial we did a we do the labels a
little bit differently and there there
are two methods that you can use to
create a label and this is the second
method what you do is you create your
label or you create your input first
whichever one you want to create
I'm going to show you how to do it by
creating the label first you create a
label and you call it Spanish and then
inside of that label you put your input
just like that alright so now that we
have all of our checkboxes in place I'm
going to save this and I am going to run
it in Firefox so now you can see we can
check each one of these you can uncheck
and that is how you create a checkbox
inside Dreamweaver these are very useful
when people are selecting multiple
different things it makes it a lot
easier instead of typing it in you can
just check it yes or no and then they
can submit it to our sample Handler and
that's how you create check boxes inside
of Dreamweaver in the next tutorial I'll
be going over radio buttons and radio
groups and the differences that are in
between checkboxes and radio button and
groups so thanks for watching and don't
