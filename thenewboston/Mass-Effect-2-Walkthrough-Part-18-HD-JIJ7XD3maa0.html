word of it's a hair of course and we
have a deal maybe I'll at least sell
something to you what brought a nice kid

its course there's a Silurian named
mordin solus in the slums I've got to
get in there to find it the doctor yeah

district a few months ago the Blue Suns
went to happy when he moved in I hear
Morton's trying to deal with the plague
I wish him luck the area is still locked
down our orders are to wait and tell
either the plague of the Blue Suns kill
everyone then go in and clean up listen

is over that could take weeks what you
really need is to get this problem

district straightened out do you think
