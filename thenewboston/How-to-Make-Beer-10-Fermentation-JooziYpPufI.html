wort into the fermenter so go ahead and
make sure that your funnel that's been
sanitizing go ahead and stick that in
and go ahead and start pouring now as
you notice since we're using no rinse
sanitizer there's going to be a lot of
foam however this is fine it's not like
soap bubbles don't be afraid of the
bubbles they don't affect the taste or
the flavor or they don't hurt anything
in the theater now this is common sense
but it also helps the fermenters on the
ground it's going to be easier to pour
so once you're done pouring in guys if
you have any sludge left in your boiling
pot you don't need to pour that and go
ahead and leave the slug behind some
people actually like to pour everything
in it helps up they think it helps
flavor the beer doesn't really make that
big of a difference and now that we need
to do is we need to add water and get
this back up to five games all so now
Joby's going to go ahead and add water
and we want to get this to five gallons
so that's why it doesn't really matter
how much if you were off by a little bit
and you didn't mix exactly two and a
half gallons at first it has the same
amount of flavoring and aroma in it and
you always end up with five gallons of
beer so again you can see my mark right
here we'll just go it up go ahead and
not fill it up to that mark and again
you want to use nice quality high
quality drinking water for this if you
have a you know not the greatest quality
tap water or if it smells like sulfur
then I wouldn't recommend using that
remember good water makes good beer all
right perfect now the next thing we have
to do is we need to add the yeast
because remember right now we pretty
much have non-alcoholic beer so what
this yeast is going to do whenever we
add it through the fermentation process
and that is basically just letting it
sit for two weeks the yeast is basically
going to eat the sugar
that were in the syrup and is going to
convert them to alcohol and carbon
dioxide so go ahead and make sure that
you actually sanitize your scissors in
your hands and the yeast packet that's
why everything is wet right now cut this
and if you have a bucket you can
actually sprinkle it on but if you have
a fermenter and just pour it in slowly
and a lot of people actually think that
if they add more yeast then they'll get
more alcohol but that's not always the
case if your alcohol content is too high
then the yeast will actually start to
die off and another thing is if you add
a lot of yeast then you're going to have
a very nice tea taste which kind of
tastes like dirty socks if you ever ate
dirty socks now go ahead and take your
bum which is that rubber stopper this
should also be fully sanitized and go
ahead and jam that into the top of your
carboy just like that so now what you
want to do is you want to go ahead and
grab that airlock that was being
sanitized and there are different types
of airlocks these are my favorite one
and what you want to do is in these two
little compartments they usually have
little indicator lines right here these
lines indicate how much sanitizer to
fill this airlock with so these lines
are right here right where my finger is
if you can't see on the video so go
ahead and just dump them out and that's
pretty good right there
so now we're going to go ahead and take
this and again make sure that this is
sanitized and go ahead and stick it into
that bung so go ahead and take your
airlock right now and jam it right in
your bunker hole and what's going to
happen there in the fermentation process
is like I said the yeast is basically
going to eat the sugars that were in the
wort and produce alcohol which we want
in our beer and also carbon dioxide is a
by-product so whenever this happens the
carbon dioxide is going to flow out this
and out into the air so it doesn't just
build up in our fermenter and blow up
now the cool thing about this is that
this airlock right here does not allow
bacteria to flow
back into the war and contaminate the
beer this only allows the gas to flow in
one direction keeping our beer nice
clean sanitized in the bacteria outside
now if you can see on top that some of
the yeast is so dry don't worry about it
it'll saturate with time but anyways go
ahead and move this to a cool dark area
and let it sit for two weeks now the
length of time depends on your recipe so
go ahead and double-check your recipe
for how long
the recommended fermentation is but
basically you'll know when it's done
because you'll see in about two days
that there are bubbles that get produced
whenever the yeast gives up carbon
dioxide so whenever those bubbles stop
it can be a little before or a little
after two weeks then you know your
fermentation process is done and you're
ready to bottle the beer so for now
thank you for watching and I'll see you
on bottling day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
