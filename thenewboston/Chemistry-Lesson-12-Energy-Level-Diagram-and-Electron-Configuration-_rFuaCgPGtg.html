whenever we're studying chemical
reactions and that chart we figured out
in the last tutorial made it really easy
to follow along but there's even a
better tool and that's this thing right
here called the energy level diagram now
the energy level diagram allows us to
clearly visualize the electrons on an
atom so I know I probably don't even
have to explain this but I will since
you know I'm doing a tutorial and it's
kind of my job to explain things one in
two are just different energy levels and
these dashes represent those different
orbitals are pretty much the different
zones where electrons can orbit and
remember for each orbital you can have
two electrons one spinning clockwise and
another spinning counterclockwise so
each of these dashes can hold two
electrons and we just represent those
with the up arrow and a down arrow to
represent clockwise and counterclockwise
however before we start plopping
arrows and electrons down on these
orbitals we need to follow a couple
rules now the rules of the game is this
number one you need to fill up the
lowest vacant energy level before moving
on to the next one for example you need
to fill up 1s before you move on to to
us and you need to fill up to s before
you move on to 2p simple enough however
you may be thinking okay this makes
sense with 1 &amp;amp; 2 but whenever we get to
the higher energy levels like 3 4 &amp;amp; 5
there's a really weird method in order
to fill the lowest vacant energy levels
and I'm going to show it to you right
now so 1 &amp;amp; 2 are simple and you may be
thinking ok I'm going to fill up all my
ones than all my twos and then I
probably fill up all my 3s
before I move on to my fours and I fill
up all my fours before I move on my
thighs make sense right but that isn't
the way it works so here's how it really
works you fill up all your ones and then
you go to 2s once you fill up 1s you
fill up to us and then you go to 2p from
2 P you fill up 3s now from 3p you
phillup 4s and then you go 3d 4p 5s 4d
5p
4 F 5 D so I know this is really weird
and it would make a lot more sense if
you just went 1 2 3
but hey I didn't make up this method
that's just the way it works you're
going to have to take it up with whoever
invented electrons in the atom you know
take it up with them not my prob this is
my job there's something like that I
stole it from the office but not my job
not my prob is that what it is I don't
know I'm just going to go ahead and
continue with tutorial I don't know what
I'm talking about so anyways the next
rule is this it's called Haun's rule H
und this dude came up with another rule
he says that whenever there is more than
one orbital basically whenever there is
more than one tilt in the example of 2p
electrons fill each one until they're
all taken and once they're all taking
then they start pairing up with each
other
so pretty much electrons are greedy they
don't pair up with each other unless
they absolutely need to make sense so
let me go ahead and change my opacity
fix my colors and in this is tutorial or
this game we're going to play with
element fluorine now I know I didn't
cover the elements in the periodic table
but fluorine has 9 electrons in it so
let's go ahead and start plopping these
electrons in the nucleus so all the
protons and neutrons are chillin out
here in the nucleus time to plop some
electrons on here the first electron
goes on 1s and we'll just represent that
with the up arrow the second electron
before it can move the two us it has to
fill up one us so we'll go ahead and
we'll represent that with a down arrow
now whenever we have an up arrow in a
down arrow we have two electrons at the
same level or in the same orbital
spinning in different directions
that's called spin pairing it's just a
technical term but you know I thought
I'd throw it out there just a little
tidbit of information so the first two
electrons go on 1s the next to spin pair
on to us
now once those are filled up we can move
to 2p
now we have four of the nine electrons
taken care of we have five to go so how
they go on 2p is this they start filling
up one at a time and once all those
orbitals are filled up they say okay is
this room taken yup
someone already in there is this room
taken yup sardian someone already in
there is this room taken yup someone
already in there okay now I guess I need
a roommate so they go and they start
spin pairing so basically what we're
doing is we're following a hund rule
that says whenever there is more than
one tilt the electrons fill up until
they're all taken and only if they need
to then they start pairing up so that is
hund rule right there and again the
first rule is we need to fill up 1s
before we moved it to us and we need to
make sure to us is filled before we move
to 2p so that is how the electrons would
go one right here then one right here
then this one then this one and then
they would fill these ones up one at a
time until they are all filled and then
they start pairing up so that is
basically how you place electrons on an
atom and whenever we're looking at
chemical reactions it's going to make a
lot more sense because we talked about
well I'll talk about valence electrons
probably in the next tutorial but it
makes a lot more sense whenever you can
visually see the electrons on an atom so
you may be thinking alright so you're
telling me that any time I want to study
a chemical reaction I need to draw this
big diagram that's going to suck and
that's going to take a lot of time well
thankfully chemists and scientists are
really lazy and they came up with even a
better way to write these down and if
you're thinking this is going to take a
whole nother tutorial then you are wrong
check this out I probably don't even
need to explain this but I will what you
do is you write the notation 1s and then
you write how many electrons are in that
level 2 2s and I'm filling this out for
fluorine which has 9 electrons 2's 2
and to pee once was a five so pretty
much this is the notation and it's
called the electron configuration so I
don't even know if you guys can see that
I'll write it again down here I don't
know if the video is cutting that off
but pretty much what you do is you write
the notation for each one like we did in
the last or on the chart and you're
right how many electrons are in that
orbital so 1s2 2s2 2p5 is the electron
configuration for fluorine and if you
want to double check you just go ahead
and check the index five plus two plus
two equals nine and that's how many
electrons are in fluorine so we're good
to go so that's a simpler way and that's
how I'm probably going to be writing the
electron configuration for the rest of
these tutorials so no more drawing
graphs nor more doing anything like that
there you go so finally finally that's
all we have to cover with the quantum
mechanical model I think that's it I'm
pretty sure in the next story we can
finally move on to something more
interesting so thank you guys for
watching don't forget subscribe and I'll
see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
