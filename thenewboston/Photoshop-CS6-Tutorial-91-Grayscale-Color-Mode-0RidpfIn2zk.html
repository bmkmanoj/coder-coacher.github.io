Blackford here another Photoshop cs6
tutorial where today we're going to be
understanding the grayscale color mode
so grayscale is basically black and
white and it's like those pictures you
see that some people like putting up on
Photoshop it doesn't have any color
information whatsoever besides black
white and gray so when you have an image
that is in grayscale if I go over here
to the channels here we can see that
there is only a great Channel now that's
different from RGB where RGB would have
a red green and blue channel or CMYK
would have the cyan magenta yellow and
black channel so we've got only one
channel called the grey channel now it
has a one black one white and 254
different shades of grey in the channel
so a total of 256 colors in the
grayscale so it's not a whole lot of
colors and that's one of the defining
things about the grayscale so why would
you use grayscale color mode well you
can people or some people actually think
it looks pretty cool I mean I think it
looks cool well it's good for like
making something look kind of like
old-school if you wanted to do it but
the main reason that people work with a
grayscale color mode is when you need to
print onto what they call rag style
papers and that's like a newspaper and
when you print on like a rag style paper
the colors they like pretty much don't
print that great of detailed information
that you can get with the RGB channel so
it's kind of like a waste to use it
anyways the grayscale images are also
2/3 smaller than RGB images so when file
size is a is an important point but
colors aren't then go ahead and use
grayscale images so the way that you can
change these to grayscale is up in the
image and mode section so let me go back
because I changed this so right now it's
in RGB so all I did was go to my history
because I changed this earlier so we
could see what's going on go into image
go to mode and then go to grayscale and
it's going to ask you to rasterize just
hit rasterize and it'll ask you if you
want to discard the color information so
just hit discard make sure you want to
do it because let's try to go back to
RGB real quick image mode RGB color and
then we try to go back and it doesn't do
it
it doesn't work so the only way to get
back is to either can control Z to move
back which is the reduce which would
have to go to edit and go to step
backwards that's up ctrl alt Z and
that's basically like undoing you can do
undo or you can come up into your
history and move through the different
history states that you have and if
you're not familiar with history States
and moving back and forth of those you
can check out another one of my
tutorials that teaches it how to do that
so let's go back into the grayscale here
so if you have a grayscale image and you
need color in it you don't have to worry
about not being able being able to get
any color so what you need to do to be
able to do this is go back into your
image go to mode and then go to RGB
color you know you're not going to get
any color in your image here so we're
going to next what we're going to do is
select a color so we'll just change this
to red or we'll change it to something
like I like this blue color here we're
going to select our brush
there and we're going to set our mode
here let me change my brush to something
that's a halfway-decent looking here we
go we'll go with that brush we're going
to set our mode here to color if I start
drawing you can see that color is being
added so that's how you add color in by
brushing in new color with your new
blend or with your paintbrush tool so
that's how you add color in with a
grayscale image or that's at least one
way there's there's always several ways
to do things in Photoshop I'm sure you
can use other tools and things like that
if you want so there we go nice well
that's it for the grayscale color mode
and hopefully you guys understand it
through that tutorial and you get to
know a little bit more about why people
use it and what and stuff like that so
thanks for watching everybody have a
good one
give it a thumbs up if you liked the
video and thumbs down if you really
hated it see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
