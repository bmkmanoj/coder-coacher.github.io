amazing After Effects cs6 tutorial
I'm your host buddy Blackford and I want
to go over parenting today with you and
the first rule of parenting is to not
have a child unless you're ready to
support one that means not letting your
parents take over your child and raise
them for you Oh wrong parenting sorry
about that
well I'm talking about the parenting
here in the layer panel and up in your
comp and in After Effects and everything
like that so basically what parenting
does is allows you to transform other
other layers based on a certain layer
that you parented to so a parent so in a
parenting there is a parent and then
there is a child or multiple children
but there is only one parent so what I'm
talking about
is these what we want to do actually is
have these black teardrops here follow
the movement of this brown chair drop
and then we also want them these three
teardrops to be independent from this
text here but if we move the text we
want the teardrops to follow so it
sounds kind of complicated but we can do
that easily with parenting parenting
also only works on certain properties a
little work on transform or position
it'll work on rotation and a work on
scale it doesn't work on things like
opacity and Anchor Point and things like
that and I'll demonstrate that later on
so let's get started I'm gonna undo
everything I have here and what I said
before is that we wanted the black the
black teardrops here to move along with
the brown one so what we're gonna do is
make the brown the parent and
any other to the child so let's come
into our layers panel here and look and
we've got the brown on top and we got
the two black ones below and so we're
gonna come over here to this drop down
menu where it says parent and we're
going to be able to click on it and then
we're going to be able to select the
brown drop right here
now that's one way to be able to parent
things then the other way we comparing
things is by using this little spiral
here and this is called the pick whip if
you click on it and drag you can bring
it to the layer that you want and let go
of it and it creates this little whip
here you let go of it and then it'll
parent that way also so those are the
two different ways to parent now if I
try to move the brown drop here both of
these two are going to follow based on
the anchor point of the brown drop so we
can move rotation and we can move
position there you go
and they're both going to follow we can
move scale and it'll follow well we
can't move like I said before is opacity
so nothing does those other ones aren't
becoming opaque or transparent I mean
and we can't move anchor point now
Anchor Point looks like it's gonna move
but I'll show you that it's not really
so this is when we move the anchor point
but if I also click on these other two
look at the anchor points in the middle
here of the black teardrops and watch
how they stay with the black teardrops
and don't move so
well I got going here
there we go so the anchor points aren't
gonna move you can see that they're
really they're on together
I had them both selected so I was trying
to move anchor points of all of them but
that's not if I just moved the regular
the anchor point of the brown drop it's
going to not move the anchor points of
the others so just a little thing with
After Effects if you have them both
clicked it's gonna start moving
everything all the anchor points
together so hopefully that made sense
there so it's just position rotation and
scale now the other thing that the
client wants is for us to be able to
move our text and have everything follow
it but not be able to but be able to
move the teardrops in the background and
not have the text follow so what we're
gonna do is we're gonna parent the brown
drop to the text and I just use the pick
whip that time so now if I move the text
around the entire logo is gonna follow
but now I can move the I can move the
brown drop around and it can go wherever
I need it to go so that's how you do
that and now it sounded complicated in
the beginning but it's actually pretty
easy so that's how you do that
now you your layers do not need to be in
order to have them be able to parent to
each other so I could put this brown
drop all the way down here at the bottom
and move it around and everything is
still parented to it now if I move my
text down everything will still be
parented to the text but if I try to
like rotate around it it's the other
things are gonna come in front of the
Texas so it'll come in behind so that's
the reason why I have them in order
the last thing that I'd like to mention
is that if I put a in effect on one of
the on the parent the other child's
aren't children aren't going to get
affected so I'll just throw an effect on
this brown drop and I'll just do the
let's do a fast blur I'll drag it over
from here
and if I go to blur it the other ones
are not going to be blurred so you have
to put effects on each one so that's the
intro to parenting fairly simple not
very complicated neat sometimes people
try to teach it and it's complicated
hopefully I taught it and it was not
complicated so thanks for watching this
one subscribe if you want to see more
videos on After Effects and upcoming the
other Adobe programs after I finish the
After Effects series so see you guys
later have a good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
