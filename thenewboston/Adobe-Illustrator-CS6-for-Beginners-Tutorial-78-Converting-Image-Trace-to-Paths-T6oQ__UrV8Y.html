illustration cs6 tutorial I'm glad you
guys are watching today because I'm
going to be pretty much ending the image
tres little series that we had going on
there and this tutorial is going to be
about converting the traces to a path so
the first thing that you need to do is
make sure that your image has been image
traced already and to do that you can
just use one of the presets so this
image is image traced already and you
can tell because the view is tracing
result and here's the source image this
is what it was before now when you
finish image tracing an object you can
convert it to a path and that's also
called expanding and you can see that
the expand button is up here in the
control panel and when you expand an
image trace object it doesn't and it
pretty much isn't an image trace object
anymore it's no longer that it becomes a
standard path which you can reshape and
recolor if you want so now you have more
control after you've got your trace
perfect so let's go ahead and expand
this we're gonna click on expand and now
we can see that all the different paths
that we've got here I'm gonna grab my
direct selection tool and try to grab
something here it's grabbing a whole lot
of things but it looks like I'm getting
in the back let me fit this to the
screen so I can deselect stuff there we
go so now I can grab that little piece
there if I click on the sky is gonna
grab the entire sky and I could delete
it if I wanted to so that's a good way
to get the background out if you if you
wanted to and then I've got my different
parts here like I could delete out that
part of the wing and then it goes to
white so
now it's fully editable as well so you
can move these anchor points around and
this is where you would want to try to
keep your points down when you're doing
your image trace now when we were doing
it there was the little info panel that
had the amount of anchor points in the
amount of different colors and
everything in there so it's a good idea
to keep an eye on that when you're doing
image traces so let's go over here to
our layers panel and open it up and if
you don't have the layers panel showing
which are these two like little squares
on top of each other go to window and
then go to layers back key for it is f7
if I twirl down layer one and twirl down
the group we're gonna see all the
different little pieces that are in it
and this is what some companies will
actually do they'll grab an image off
the off like Google Images or something
like that and they'll do a live trace on
it and then they'll go back to one of
those websites that where you pay for
images and they'll pretty much just
resell it back to you after they live
traced it for like 30 bucks or something
like that and that's how some people
make money so if you're thinking about
doing that that could be a career path
for you
that you're thinking of or like a side
job just earn some extra money on the
side
so the only thing about it is make sure
you have like the rights from the people
that actually took the picture to be
able to use it or else you might end up
getting sued and it's also just kind of
like dishonest to be taking people's
work and making it into your own and
trying to make money off of it it's a
little okay it's it's okay if you're
using it just for your own personal
purposes but if you're trying to make
money off of it then you should at least
give credit so that's it for this
tutorial and I hope you like the series
the little mini series on image tracing
it's a very very helpful tool
and it allows you to take photos from
the real world and turn them into
vectors in Illustrator which you can if
you can think of is incredibly powerful
because you could make about anything
you want so if you have a say you have a
little photography a little studio or
something like that one of those shadow
boxes put some objects in there that you
want to make into vectors take pictures
of them and then image trace them into
vectors and then you go off and sell
them if you want or use them for your
project so that's all I got to tell you
about the image tracing so I'm really
glad you guys view the tutorials be sure
to subscribe and keep up the next
tutorial we're gonna learn how to apply
graphic styles which is kind of like
Photoshop filters to your objects so</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
