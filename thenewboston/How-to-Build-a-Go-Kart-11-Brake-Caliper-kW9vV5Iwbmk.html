this is a brake caliper right here and
it's connected to your brake lines and
it actually is really simple in order
for this to work what happens is
whenever you get brake fluid from these
hydraulic lines inside here are two
brake pads now what happens is the
hydraulic fluid causes these brake pads
to push or pinch together now of course
you're usually going to hit your brakes
when your go-kart or car is moving and
these brake pads are going to go over
this rotor so whenever they're spending
like this you're going to be good but
then whenever they pinch together and
check it out this rotor no longer spins
and since this rotor is connected to the
tire your go-kart is going to come to a
stop so pretty much the calipers job is
to tell when the brake pad should pinch
together foot on the brake they pinch
together go-cart stops moving so that's
pretty much how brake works brakes work
really easy
now how this bolts on to your frame is
really simple it bolts on through two
bolts right here one there and one there
so let me go ahead and show you guys how
to put this on first and by the way
whenever you need to replace your brake
pads just go ahead and I'm not going to
take them out because they're kind of a
pain get in but take a screwdriver and
pop these things out right here right
there so now let me go ahead and see if
I can put this on go ahead and slide the
brake pads right over your rotor and now
I'm going to go ahead and get a better
camera angle before I start bolting this
on so go ahead and find where your two
brake pads are one here one here slide
it over the rotor because of course one
has to go on each side so I can pinch it
now slide it through the piece on your
frame and into your caliper see if I can
get it it's a brake line in your way oh
well okay so that one's in you just have
to tighten it and now there's smaller
one and of course it goes like this your
frame and caliper then a regular washer
lock washer and then of course the head
of the bowl
so let's see if I can get this one's a
little bit more tricky get hardly in my
freakin hands in there alright so there
you have it the front caliper is
installed successfully
now all you guys need to do is do this
exact same thing to the other side and
you'll be good to go so that is how you
install a caliper
thank you guys for watching and I'll see
you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
