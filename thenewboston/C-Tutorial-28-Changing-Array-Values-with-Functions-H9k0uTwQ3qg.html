tutorial and in case your jaw just
popped in and felt like watching this
tutorial and didn't watch my last one in
the last tutorial we built a program and
I showed you guys how to protect data
when you pass an array into a function
so we entered a dollar amount for each
item using a function like 32 2 3 4 5
and then we just made another function
to spit it all out and in this tutorial
what I'm going to show you how to do is
instead of protecting that data so it
doesn't change what if we want to build
a function so that it does change well
let's do that right now so we int we got
a function called in populate which
created an array in void spit what spit
out the array or pretty much displayed
it let's go ahead and build another
function right now and what this is
going to do is change the value of the
array so we don't want it to return
anything so let's just put void re value
make sure I spell that right and it's
going to take three parameters the first
one is the factor that you want to
revalue it by so double and put
something like R for revalue and now
after this go ahead and insert your
array so double Bucky as a second
parameter so the second parameter is
going to take an array and then put it
in for just the limit of your array or
how many it has so our loop knows how
many times it go so now we just need to
build a basic for loop so just for a for
int I equals 0 just like last time I is
less than N and that's going to be how
big our array is that we passed in and
then our last parameter is I plus plus
so just so we can iterate through the
loop now you can put your curly braces
or not I always like to have mine just
because just because I do and now what
we wanted to do is take that array Bucky
not okey Bucky I and every time it gets
the element in array it's going to take
that value in oh man here we go
times equal to our and what this is
going to do is whenever it gets say the
value is like 32 it's going to times it
by R and say if R is 2 and then that is
going to be equal to 64
so Bucky I x equals R is the exact same
thing as Bucky I equals Bucky I times R
so now that we got this made let's go
ahead and prototype it go ahead and copy
it right here and then go ahead and your
beginning and paste it to prototype it
and now we need to go ahead and call the
function or the function that we just
built so let's just go ahead and first
make a prompt so put CL and then go
ahead like something enter factor 2 x
did I actually spell that right Wow
impressive and then I'm just put that
looks good right there
and make sure you end your line the
semicolon and then we need of course
what's call a variable there we go ahead
a mind blink for a second and then give
them an opportunity to enter that
variable so what entered whatever number
they enter is going to be stored in the
variable factor so now we need to pass
that in their function that we just
built so we had a function call to
revalue and it took three parameters
remember the first one is factor the
second one is the what did we name it
the second one is the array and we named
ours items and third one is the size of
the array and I think well let's just
pass in five there we go
looks good lets you spit yep looks good
so now we have a factor which is the
whatever number we're going to enter
items which is the array and since it
has five items in it right five now
after that what do we want to do after
we change your array well we need to
spit it out again or display it so go
and put spit items 5 put your semicolon
and then after this um let's just give
them something like a nice little done
and in the line for good measure so now
let's go ahead and first see if it works
and then if it does I'll walk you guys
through it and show you guys why did if
it doesn't I show you guys where I
messed up come on here we go enter
dollar for items 132 I would start with
32 I don't know why 45 676 and 21 and
now this spits out the exact same array
remember this is the one where we didn't
want to change the data so we use the
constant and now the one where you do
want to change data we don't use a
constant so go ahead and type a factor
by 2 or something now it spits out the
exact same array but all the numbers are
x by 2 see instead 30 to 45 you got 64
90 12 is double 6 152 is double 76 and
42 is double 21 so the point of these
tutorials to show you is this anytime
you want to keep an array the same use
constant anytime you want to change the
value of it when you're building a
function you don't use that constant
keyword so again if you want to just
keep it the same like when you're just
displaying data make sure you use
constant and when you're changing it do
not use constant or it isn't going to
work so again what we did in this
tutorial was we built a function that
took three parameters we went through
the loop or we went through the array
and gave each array item a new value and
then up here we just said alright what
do you want to multiply it by all right
that's what we're going to multiply it
by so that's the value we're going to
pass in our function and now we're just
going to spit it out and bam you're done
so thank you guys for watching hopefully
you learned how to protect data inner
array and also how to destroy data in
array so that's it for this tutorial
make sure you watch next tutorial and
don't forget subscribe I'll see you next
time thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
