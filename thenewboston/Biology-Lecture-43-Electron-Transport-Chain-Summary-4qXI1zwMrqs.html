explain what happens because wow this is
this diagram got very confusing very
quick basically let me go ahead and pick
white basically we start with NADH which
is an electron carrying molecule it's
going to give its electrons to nadh
dehydrogenase now as this happens per
electron one hydrogen ion is going to be
pumped out to the other side of the
membrane which is the inner membrane now
now what we basically have is the
electric electrons inside your NADH
dehydrogenase and they want to get over
to the cytochrome bc1 so in order to do
that they need to take the bus called
ubiquity now ubiquitin shuttles them
over from the NADH dehydrogenase to the
cytochrome bc1 now once they're in the
cytochrome bc1 two more hydrogen ions
are going to get shuttled outside the
matrix outside the inner membrane so now
we have electrons in the cytochrome bc1
what happens now is they want to go over
to the cytochrome oxidase so what
happens is the cytochrome C which is the
bus takes them one at a time this is
important actually one at a time back
and forth taking passengers from the
cytochrome bc1 to the cytochrome oxidase
so now in here once it has four
electrons what it's going to do is it's
going to grab an oxygen from the
environment and eight of these hydrogen
ions and it's going to combine them all
together in a weird recipe and you end
up with your final product which is two
water molecules now after it's done
baking that recipe it has a couple
ingredients left over and those
ingredients are four more hydrogen ions
so it just spits them out right here so
obviously through the spitting out or
transferring of ions from one side to
the other we end up with a very I don't
know a gradient a lot of hydrogen ions
over here and not so many over here so
you know you may think this is bad thing
but another molecule called ATP synthase
is actually going to take advantage of
this gradient what
going to do is it's gonna be aware that
whenever you have a gradient there's
energy that can be created so it's gonna
take these ions one by one and use them
to spin the turbine by shuttling them in
shuttling them out whenever they enter
an exit
it creates basically literally a
spinning motion now spinning just like a
turbine creates energy and it's energy
that the bottom half of the ATP synthase
molecule can use so whenever this gets
enough energy from these ions it can
take in ADP and a phosphate from the
matrix and it could crash them in
together because it takes energy to
combine molecules together so it's going
to take these two molecules and crash
them together to form a T P now just
remember that we don't just have one
NADH here through the process of
cellular respiration we made a lot of
NADH s so this NADH is gonna make a
crapload of ATP and there you go there
is your basic summary of electron
transport chain so guys pat yourself on
the back congratulations you now
understand cellular respiration and how
your body breaks down glucose to
ultimately form a crapload of ATP</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
