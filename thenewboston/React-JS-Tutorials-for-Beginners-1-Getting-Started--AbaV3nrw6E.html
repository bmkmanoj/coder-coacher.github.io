Roberts and welcome to your very first
react tutorial now question number one
what the heck is react react is a
JavaScript library for building user
interfaces specifically single page
applications now what I was going to do
is I was going to kind of tell you guys
the history about react and go into a
bunch of detail show you guys a bunch of
demos but then I was like let's just go
ahead and instead of looking the demos
let's just get our hands dirty and start
making them so what do we need to get
started with react well the very first
and probably most important thing we
need is the react library so this is the
code for the library then this is
actually made by Facebook so if you ever
go to this website in your like Facebook
github what the heck this entire library
was created by Facebook so that's some
background information but essentially
we need these two files react is in
react Dom is now we have a couple
options of how we can include these into
our HTML what we can do is we can just
go ahead and copy this and then plop
them right in here just like you include
any CSS or JavaScript file or what you
can do is you can actually download
these and have them stored on your own
machine now the benefit of kind of just
including them from here is you don't
have a bunch of files on your own
computer now the benefit of having them
on your computer is of course what
happens whenever your internet goes out
and you suddenly become in the mood to
write react well you can't because
you're not connected and you can't get
these files anymore so if you guys want
to kind of do it this way then feel free
but my setup and what I did is I
actually have them downloaded on my own
system and just to make it easier for
you guys if you go to this URL URL right
here and this is just my github page I
already downloaded all the files as well
as some additional ones that we're going
to need so I'll show you guys what to do
if you just go here clone or download
and hit download zip then it's going to
give you all the files and once you
extract it it's going to give you this
right here all of these juicy files so
from there what
I did is I went in demos I made a new
directory called simple demo and I made
a really basic HTML file and as you can
see I already included all the
JavaScript we need which is right in
here so you guys are looking at this and
you're like all right so you said that
we need to react react Dom j/s but what
the heck is this file you told me that
we only needed these two jobs for files
so what is this third one are you lying
to me bucky well believe it or not
whenever we write react even though that
this is a JavaScript library we're not
going to be writing plain old JavaScript
we're going to be using a flavor of
JavaScript called JSX so why are we
doing this instead of writing plain old
JavaScript well even though your browser
needs plain old JavaScript whenever we
write JSX we have some really cool
features for example we can basically
write this code that looks exactly like
HTML and if you guys ever try to do this
with plain old JavaScript it's a pain in
the butt so whenever we write JSX it's
just really intuitive and easy to
understand and learn react however like
I said whenever you run this in a
browser your browser cannot understand
JSX it can only understand JavaScript so
what we need to do before we actually
run it is we need a tool to convert it
to plain old JavaScript so again this is
what we're going to be writing on the
Left called JSX
and after we run our translator it's
actually called a transpiler it converts
it to plain old JavaScript and you can
just use a tool like this one online to
do it all for you or you can just go
ahead and include this link right here
which basically takes care of all of
that behind the scenes so we can you
write JSX right in here run it and it's
going to be beautiful or our browsers
going to understand it we're going to be
able to write JSX it's going to be
awesome so with that being said let's go
ahead and get started</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
