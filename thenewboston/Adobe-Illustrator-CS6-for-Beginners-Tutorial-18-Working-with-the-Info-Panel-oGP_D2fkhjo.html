illustration cs6 tutorial today we're
gonna be working with the info panel the
info panel gives you a bunch of data on
the current document depending on we
have selected or what object or tool
you're using and a whole bunch of stuff
so I'm gonna go over the different ways
you can use the info panel to be to be
working with your project here so the
first thing we need to do is go to
window and go to info and that'll open
up the info panel you can see that the
hotkey is control f8 if you ever want to
use that I just use it over here on the
side you can see that over here on the
side this is what the info panel looks
like and it's got the I like the little
information icon so the first thing you
want to start out with is select your
selection tool you can see that when you
move around the X&amp;amp;Y coordinates in this
case is displayed in pixels are showed
now let's go to another thing f we
selected object we have the X&amp;amp;Y
coordinates of it and then we've got the
width and height of the object here so
that'll be handy when you're trying to
figure out what something is and you
need to replicate it or something like
that okay and then the next thing I want
to show you is if you select multiple
objects it's going to show you the
combined width and height and the
combined x and y coordinates going on
there so if I go ahead and select this
we got 6 9 1 3 8 3 and we got 97 and 81
now these two dogs are the same height
so now we've got the same height still
the x and y coordinates are the same and
the width is what got longer because our
bounding box got longer as you can see
all right the next thing I want to show
you is if you select the zoom tool the
magnification gets displayed over here
that's pretty nice another thing that I
wanted to show was that what do you use
some of the transformation tools the
there will be different types of things
that are show up in the info panel so if
I go ahead and I select the doc here I
want to use the scale tool here I click
on that now you can see I've got with
100% 100% I go ahead and start scaling
this you can see the amount of increase
in percentage I'm getting when I scale
and that's pretty helpful when you're
trying to figure out so you client wants
you to scale up the dog to hundred
percent there you go now you can scale
it up to hundred percent and it's a
little hard it's like snapping and
everything like that but at least you
got some kind of identification there of
what you're doing so there's another
thing I wanted to show you you go over
to the options here you can click show
options and then you've got your color
so right now we've got our RGB color of
gray let's see if I change this if it
changes yep now we've got our pink color
here and the RGB changed and you got
your I think this is called a
hexadecimal number and this is what you
can use to get this exact color so
that's a some info on the info panel so
that would go in we learned a little bit
about that one more thing I want to show
you is that when you start using drawing
tools so let's go to the pen tool I'm
gonna click and then you can see on the
info panel
I've got angle I've got depth here we've
got width and height all that stuff so I
can see the angle that I'm trying to
make
so this is about a 30 degree angle and
this you can see is a hundred and eighty
degree angle that means I'm exactly
right across and their echo I can make a
triangle here with a thirty degree angle
and a 180 degree angle so keep that in
mind because that'll be really handy
when you're using the pen tool and you
need to make certain angles so that's it
for the info panel I'm sure there's a
bunch of other tools that'll show up
here and you can see different types of
things with the info panel I can't
remember all of them up my head but you
can go ahead and mess around with the
tools and check out different things
that might show up in the info panel
there is another thing I wanted to show
you that I didn't really go over yet but
I figured I just added in at the end of
the tutorial is about undoing and
redoing now it's probably like the best
thing that's ever happened to computer
programs is getting an undo button
because then you don't get or you can
basically change a mistake and undo a
mistake that you've made so if you go up
to edit we've got undo here and the
hotkey is control Z that's one of the
most used hotkeys you'll probably ever
use is control Z and it pretty much
works in every single program that there
is now and it's universal it's control Z
and then we've got redo which is shift
control Z and you use that when you
undid something and then you're like
crap I didn't want to undo that you can
redo it and bring it back to what it was
so those are two things I just wanted to
show you that it didn't officially go
over but now I can say that I did so
thanks a lot for watching the tutorial
and stay tuned for another awesome
