plates on tutorial and in this tutorial
I'm going to show you guys how to make a
sub class with multiple multiple parent
classes so if we want to make a sub
class with multiple lipid CF does this
get out of the white house if we want to
make a sub class with multiple planar
class is we first need multiple parent
classes so let's go ahead and make a
class call it mom she can be a parent
and let's go ahead and make a couple
variables in here there one arm equals a
I'm mom and that's good enough for you
mom let's let's go ahead and make a
class called dad and make variable to
make sure this is a different variable
that was inside class mom and variable
two we'll pull a their son I'm dead a
dad
same thing doesn't matter I'm a dad now
let's go ahead and make a class called
child getting ahead of myself here class
child and now if you want to inherit
multiple traits from different classes
all you have to do is type in the class
names right there mom and dad and as
your argument or not your argument
whatever this is called in here all you
have to do is press pass and what passed
means is do nothing because we don't
want to do anything we can actually have
another variable and we want ver three
and have it equal to I'm a new variable
and I know I typed everything wrong in
this entire tutorial but just bear with
me here and once you have this your
child class now inherited all the
variables from mom and dad so let's go
ahead and make a child object so child
object shouldn't have made it that long
but too late now equals child class and
let's go ahead and now once we have an
object we can access all the variables
from any of these classes mom dad or the
child class itself so let's go ahead and
child object
da ver 1 equals hi mom so what it did is
go into this class and says are I'm
inheriting all the variables of this so
even though we're using object in this
class we can still get the variables in
this and this works for VAR 2 as well
which was into that class originally so
what is was a child object VAR 2 so even
though you don't exactly write the
variables in the child class itself you
can use multiple arm classes or what
they're called super classes in the
smaller one where what inherits the
traits is called a subclasses and these
are also called parents and child even
though I wrote mom and dad and those are
actual parents funny how that works so
that is how you can use a class 10 hair
all the properties of a parent class so
this just saves you a bunch of typing if
like the mom in class in class had a
bunch of different variables that you
wanted to use but you didn't want to
type them all in the child class and
like usual usual you can also use the
variables that are in the child class
itself so again that is how you can use
um the different items in either classes
just by adding the name of the class in
your parameter so uh thank you guys for
watching I hope you learn a little bit
about how to get sub classes with
multiple parents and if you have any
questions you can just send me a message
other of your ways or I guess that's all
for now so don't forget to subscribe to
my channel thank you guys for watching
and I will see you next door</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
