welcome to your very first toriel in
cocos2d for the iPhone now in case you
just click on this story on have no idea
what cocos2d is whatsoever cocos2d is a
framework that you can put in your
program and it pretty much pretty much
allows you to create 2d games that's
mainly what people use it for now I know
you can create 2d games with you know
just the basic tools in objective-c and
the frameworks that the iPhone has on it
already but 2ds get or excuse me cocos2d
allows you to make your games much
better this includes things such as
animations sprites of course cool menus
special effects and pretty much anyone
who's serious about making games for the
iPhone
they always I don't want to say always
they usually start with cocos2d because
it's such a powerful tool and best of
all it's free so the first thing I
wanted you guys had to do is actually
how to get this and maybe if you go to a
website you'll see a little clear what
I'm talking about so what you need to do
is there a bunch of frameworks which is
pretty much like built-in methods that
you can use already on the iPhone but
this is a different framework we
actually need to download this and put
it on our iPhone so that anyone who's
using our project or playing our game
has access to it so here is how not only
downloading this framework but here's
pretty much if you come across any
framework they want to download here's
what you need to do so go ahead and we
already know the name of this it's
cocos2d so just go ahead search for in
Google and click on the first one the
pops up now as I said there are cocos2d
arm you know for regular computer
applications and there's also a special
cocos2d for the iphone so make sure
you're getting cocos2d for the iphone
and not for you know just a Mac or any
other computer program you're building
so go ahead and click cocos2d for the
iPhone it will take you to the sweet
special website
now of course if you want to learn a
little more about it or what games are
being made with this you can go ahead
search around but what we're worried
about right now is downloading the
framework itself now again like I said
whenever anyone says framework it pretty
much means a bunch of built-in methods
that people made that you have access to
so instead of having to you know create
your own method for special type of
animation there's already one in here
for creating basic animations so anyways
with that being said what you want to do
once you're in this download page is
download the latest stable version you
know probably one of the top arm links
so go ahead and click this right here I
already have it downloaded so no need to
download it twice but once you download
it let me exit a chrome it's going to go
into your download folders right here
and let's see mine is oh yeah I've got I
already dragged my now here but anyways
it's going to be in here and just double
click it so you already have mine that I
dragged out right here so what I'm going
to do is go ahead and double click this
and you see on archiving this pretty
much means unzipping if you're familiar
with Windows so it pretty much takes it
in a tiny package and turns it into a
folder that you can use and here is the
folder right over here it's called
cocos2d iPhone minus 0.99 point 4 or you
probably have a different version if
you're watching this tutorial later on
but anyways the basics are still going
to apply so this is probably the first
thing that you want to do just to make
sure you have everything downloaded
alright open your folder right here and
you're going to have a bunch of crap
that you don't really know I mean most
of this is just text files
I mean readme and stuff but anyways what
you want to look for is this Xcode
project go ahead and double click this
and a project is going to open up let's
go ahead and X out of that now this is
pretty much a default arm Xcode project
with all the built-in samples showing
you what cocos2d is capable of now again
like I said
you just need to download it you don't
need to do any of this but if you want
to view the examples of what it's
actually capable of here's what you need
to do go ahead and first before you do
anything just go ahead and build and run
it and what this is going to do is it's
going to compile everything and this
pretty much is just converting code to
you can understand to code the computer
can understand and it just needs to do
this one time and it's going to have a
bunch of errors because this isn't
anything we built on this is a bunch of
built in sample so don't even worry
about these errors we just want to
compile everything um I don't even know
if I really want to get in this but I
mean if you want to check out the
examples here's what you need to do
anyways what you have to worry about is
you're going to get a bunch of warnings
and errors don't worry about it at all
they're just compilation errors and you
know don't worry about it so now once
everything is compiled and you get a
bunch of errors and warnings and stuff
we can now actually view some examples
server saying alright you told me they
were like a hundred different examples
how do I get to them well in order to
get to them check this out go to project
set active target and see how it's on
build all tests you don't want to do it
you don't want to build all tests every
time so go ahead and just click on
chipmunk or anything or anything besides
build all tests you pretty much just
want to get it away from building all
tests now what you need to do is click
on the project you want to test out so
project set active executable and this
pretty much means what program do you
want to run and let's just go to you
know anyone chipmunk testbed and make
sure it's on the iPhone simulator and
make sure this is set the simulator
right here simulator and now we can go
ahead and build and run this and after
this stops freezing hopefully we can see
a little tester project start running so
there we go here's our first of the air
runs there we go so here is you know an
example of what it can do
cool little animation right there
alright now let's go ahead and click one
more project on set active executable
I don't let's go draw one I didn't do it
um box to the testbed let's see what
this one does again all this is doing is
pretty much arm showing you what cocos2d
is capable of um I don't character
collision right there and you can press
over this and you know see some
different examples and these are
programs that you're going to be able to
build with cocos2d but anyways that's</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
