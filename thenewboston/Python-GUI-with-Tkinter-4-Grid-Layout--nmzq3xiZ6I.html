to do is I want to talk to you guys
about a new and actually it's my
favorite way to organize your widgets on
the screen so at first the first couple
tutorials I showed you guys how to just
use this function called pack and it
packs them in there pretty much just
places them on your screen and you had
some control over it I mean you can put
stuff on top of each other and to the
left and to the right but it doesn't
give you a lot of control to say exactly
where you want to pack it in so in this
tutorial I'm going to show you guys how
to use a new type of layout it's called
the grid layout and it's a lot more
intuitive because what you can do is you
can line up your widgets in rows and
columns and then if you say something
okay put this in the first row second
column it's really easy to understand
instead of just trying to go in your
brain and say pack this in somewhere so
that's why it's my favorite easy to use
super easy to understand so let's get
started
so before I show you guys how to
organize stuff we probably need some
stuff to organize so what I'm going to
do is I'm just going to make two labels
and to entry widgets and it's going to
be kind of like a login screen where you
have your name we'll say it's like a
username and um like your password or
something who knows so of course we need
something to say name and password of
course whenever you want to write text
we just use a label so I'll make two
labels we already know how to make these
very simple and we'll just pack these
right in the root we won't make any
frames or anything and the text for this
one can just be name make it as easy as
possible all right so we got name
appearing on the screen and let's make
another label and this one can be for
the password we'll say alright so we've
got two labels now this is probably the
most easiest way I can explain it
whenever you want to use um whenever you
want to allow the user to enter like a
simple number or maybe just like their
name or password or anything you have to
use
thing called entry and it's the same
thing is it input in web design pretty
much is a blank single line of a text
form or text field so I'm just going to
store this in the variable entry one and
how you make these is you just write
entry that pretty much means give me a
blank field where the user could type
something in and of course where do you
want to put it well it's going to
display right in our main window so of
course we need one for the name and one
for the password so right now we have
two little text prompts and two little
input fields simple enough so now that
we got that crap I'll show you guys how
to organize it
now remember think of this like an excel
sheet pretty much we have rows that go
left and right and columns that go up
and down now by default if you don't
specify one it's just going to assume
the first so if we just put on row two
and that's it it's going to assume it's
the first column so let's go ahead and
place these labels first now in order to
place anything just right what do you
want to place just label and how do you
want to place it well we're not packing
it in anymore remember we're actually
using this new type of layout to
organize stuff and it's called the grid
layout now it says okay well we're on
the grid do you want me to put it well
just put it at row zero now you can also
have something like this column equals
zero but remember that I said by default
the column is always equal to zero
unless you explicitly change it so
there's no need to have that now for the
next label label two what we want to do
is we want to put this label under it so
the names going to go on top so that's
why we have it in row zero and the label
two is going to go in a row one so right
under it pretty much just like you see
right here this is going to be on top
this is going to be on bottom now what
we need to do after this is position
those entries those inputs so remember
this is on top
and this is on bottom of the first
column well we want to put this entry to
the right like right here in the second
entry to the right of that so text
prompt input text prompt input so let me
get rid of those and of course you guys
can probably figure out how to do this
so entry 1 grid well where we want this
to go is in the same row what we
actually want to go in the second column
and remember since computers start
counting is zero that's column one so in
this one for entry two which is the
second input of course this is going to
go in a row one which is down one and
also in column number one which is the
second column so now we can actually run
this right now and check it out and that
just move my freaking screen recorder
it's not what I wanted to grab so you
want to actually let me make sure that's
enough all right so again this is label
one name and that's in row zero the
first row and it's entry right here is
in the second column so column 1 and row
0 as well so I know that's kind of
confusing 0 1 but you know if I just
remember that computer start counting is
zero and you'll get used to it so
anytime you want to put something in the
second column column 1 boom simple
enough now there are a couple things
that annoy me a little bit right here
and first of all that's this if you look
in this first column right here
everything is Center aligned and what if
you ever looked at like a regular form
on the internet or in any software
application as well they're actually
right aligned so I want this name right
here to appear to the right pretty much
take column 1 and align everything text
the line right so how do we do that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
