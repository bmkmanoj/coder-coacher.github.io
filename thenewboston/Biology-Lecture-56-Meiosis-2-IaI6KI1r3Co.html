lesson and in this tutorial I want to
finish my osis 1 by talking about the
last phase which is telophase 1 and also
what we're gonna be doing is hopping
into meiosis 2 which is kind of the
second phase of meiosis so basically
after meiosis 1 we end up with 2 haploid
daughter cells so let me go ahead and
draw those right now here's one here's
another one and of course I'll go ahead
and draw everything and then explain it
means you're on my DNA I'll scattered in
here DNA DNA and some more right over
there alright so basically what's going
on is cytokinesis is going to complete
and that's what gives us our two
daughter cells so these are the two
daughter cells and remember they are
haploid h AP LOI D so what happen means
is they have one set of chromosomes so
remember I said that we started with
diploid cell which had 46 chromosomes or
two sets of chromosomes one from your
mom one from your dad well at the end of
meiosis one or telophase one what
happens is we have two daughter cells
each of which have 23 chromosomes or one
set another thing that happens that you
know noteworthy is that our nuclear
membrane is going to reform again in the
spindles as you can see there are no
spindles anymore they're gonna break
down so we're pretty much you know
restarting going back to our starting
point without the spindles and with our
nuclear membrane again now the last
thing as you can see is the chromosomes
are gonna uncoil and they're gonna
spread around the nucleus basically like
they were during interphase or during
the beginning of meiosis so that is
basically what telophase 1 is and
remember after this we hop over to
meiosis 2 now during meiosis 2
again this process is gonna look very
similar to meiosis one but there are a
couple key differences and that is
during meiosis two what's going to
happen is both your daughter cells from
meiosis one are gonna continue to divide
so the end result of meiosis two is
gonna be for sperm cell or for egg cells
of course if you're a girl so remember
that let me go ahead and draw my cells
remember that cells start meiosis two
with 23 chromosomes so 23 23
so unlike mitosis or meiosis one we're
actually starting with two cells so
that's a good way to remember meiosis
two you actually started with two cells
each of which have 23 chromosomes now
meiosis 2 is going to separate the
sister chromatids and send them to
opposite sides of the cell and we'll
talk about that whenever we talk about
prophase 2 so actually let me go ahead
and open up a new slide in actually I
want to write this in yellow prophase 2
so basically what happens is remember we
have two cells to start with I guess I
can draw those a little bit bigger a
cell right here and a seller right here
and another thing that's going to happen
is your spindles are going to start to
form in prophase 2 so here's a spindle
I'll just draw one over here one right
here and another one right here so we
have all these spindles forming and
another noteworthy thing is your nuclear
membrane is going to start to break down
again so this is no different and even
though we formed the nuclear membrane at
the end of meiosis 1 it's going to start
to break down again in prophase 2 now
again don't forget that we have these
chromosomes so we have these chromosomes
right here I'll just draw them real
quick so basically that's the key of
prophase 2 what we need to remember is
that the spindles are gonna form again
and your nuclear membrane is gonna break
down and the process of what happens
next is actually pretty um I don't want
to say interesting because I think it's
interesting but it's a lot different
than meiosis one in there are key
difference
that we need to know between meiosis 1
and meiosis 2 so before you think about
skipping ahead you know to the end of
meiosis to watch these videos because
there are a couple things that you
definitely need to remember</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
