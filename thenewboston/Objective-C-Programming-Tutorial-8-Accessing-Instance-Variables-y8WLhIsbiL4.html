to your eighth objective-c tutorial and
in this story I'm going to be talking to
you guys it's called data encapsulation
and how to access instance variables so
in building our program you notice that
anytime we wanted to change variables we
needed to add a method in this
implementation section so if we wanted
to change age we need to make a method
in implementation to change age if we
went down to our main method right here
and we try to set age equal to 32 and we
went ahead and try to build it and run
this we would get an error right here
and a set age undeclared so pretty much
you can't access these variables
anywhere besides your implementation
section so why did they do this and why
are you not allowed to access our
variables from inside our main method
well they did this because they didn't
want like if you had a company you
wouldn't want your programmers that were
creating objects and everything to be
able to F up the code that was inside
the class so they pretty much have a
separate where anyone who creates
objects can't mess with the code that's
already in the class so it's actually a
pretty nice system and that is called
the concept of data encapsulation so
what if you needed to use that age
variable in your main section or excuse
me your main method of your program well
what you would need to do is you need to
build a special method and it's called a
getter method but we'll talk about that
later on and all it does is it returns
to you the variables so let's go ahead
and do that right now
instead of returning void like we did in
these three methods what we need to do
is actually return these variables so go
ahead and put since they're both
integers go ahead and put int age
and this is going to be method and if
you're saying all right this is going to
be a method called H and you already
have a variable called age that's going
to get confusing isn't it well actually
this is a pretty common programming
practice and by default whenever you
have a method name the same thing as a
variable then it automatically is most
commonly a getter method so everyone in
programmer world understands what this
would mean already but anyways just how
to throw that out there so now that you
have age we need to make another method
called weight so now that we have the
methods declared we can go ahead and
implement them so let's go ahead and
just copy this our method header and put
it right there
paste it and now we need a method body
so let me just make this easier for you
guys to read and there we go
so what do we want our method to do the
only thing it needs to do needs to do is
return the variable H so return H and we
need to do this exact same thing for
weight so let's go ahead and put int
sensors returning an integer weight and
for the body the only thing it does
return weight so now whenever we call
these methods all it's going to do is
return that variable so this is kind of
a trick and since we can't access the
variables directly but we know that this
implementation section of our program
can we have to go through the
implementation section and that's how we
get to the variables so let's go ahead
and well let's the first thing we need
to do is set an age and wait for Bucky
so we already created our object I
didn't delete that from last oreal put
Bucky set or excuse me set age was first
I believe set age and set it equal to
like 25
and now give this object away and set my
weight equal to like 240 anything you
want and now that Bucky has an age and a
weight we can go ahead and print out our
variables so we do this in the NS log
and go ahead and put at and let's go
ahead and put something like Bucky is
percent I in ways percent I and now as
our variables we can just go ahead and
use the well you'll see in a second
Bucky Bucky age and Bucky forget the
path in brackets
Bucky wait so let's go ahead and run
this make sure we don't have any errors
and it says succeeded so go ahead and
put run console and it says Bucky is
whereas Bucky is 25 in ways to 40 so
what exactly did we do here
what we did is since we couldn't access
to the variable straight from our main
method right here we needed to build new
methods that all these methods methods
did is return variables this one
returned age in this method called
weight return weight so then instead of
just putting age in weight here like we
couldn't before we needed to put the
method in there as the variables and
whenever you came across this it said re
Bucky is some variable now what am I
supposed to put here well call the
method Bucky age which was this and
whatever value you got her in turn
that's why I want you to print out and
now it says and ways some variables so
what am I supposed to put in the place
of that
well it's Bucky weight which is the
return value for this method right there
so that's the basics of pretty much how
to access your variables from inside
your main method and that's all I want
to teach you guys essentially you can't
do it aside from making these methods so
anytime we want to access the variables
that's what we needed to do and it's
pretty much to protect the classes from
anyone pretty much to stop the people
that create objects from messing up the
class so that's it for this tutorial
thank you guys for watching don't forget
subscribe and I'll see you next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
