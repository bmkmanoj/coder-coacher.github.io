video we got a bunch of crap to cover
we're gonna be going over how to convert
s CSS to CSS which is useful for just
about everyone
and I also I'm going to show you guys
how to use plugins and how to chain a
bunch of commands together it's gonna be
incredible but first I want to take a
second and think head talk or calm for
pledging five bucks to my patron thank
you so much and also to people pledge
fifteen bucks and they also got a
t-shirt because of it so whoever you are
out there
I am mailing you your t-shirts tomorrow
so be expecting those in the mail but
anyways thank you guys I love you in
these tutorials are for you alright so
the first thing I want to show you guys
is how to take s CSS and convert it to
CSS something you guys probably do all
the time so I'm just gonna make a new
file and again this is in my app s CSS
directory so I'm gonna make a new file
and I'm just gonna name it
styles dot s CSS now if you guys don't
know what s CSS is it's basically this
it's kind of a goofy version of CSS but
you can do really awesome things with it
like use variables and use like math
equations and it's basically a way that
you can like program CSS it's awesome I
have a whole other tutorial series about
it if you don't know it check it out but
for now let me just go ahead and do
something simple just to demonstrate so
let's say I was working on this website
and I had this class called fatty and
whatever element I applied this to its
width was some percentage and the
percentage was 6 over 7 now of course
this is not valid CSS this is weird
s CSS so before we can actually use this
on our website we need to convert this
to CSS so how do we do that well the
first thing that we need to do is we
need to install a plugin so remember way
back in the very first tutorial I said
that the reason that gulp is kind of
hard to explain to a beginner is
because it doesn't just do one thing
it's kind of like a Swiss Army knife in
other words it's a bunch of tools in one
so whenever we need one of these tools
we actually need to download in a tool
is just called a plugin so basically
whenever I say tool I just mean plug-in
yada yada so how do we get these plugins
well what we can do is this go ahead and
open up your command line or if you're
using webstorm II and just use the
terminal right there well you know this
text is kind of small so I'm gonna use
PowerShell all right so whenever you
need to plug in just type NPM install
just like before and the plugins usually
are always preceded with word gulp and
then the plug-in name now I know that
the tool to convert SCSS to CSS is
called sass and by the way I can't just
go over all the plugins because there
are literally thousands of them
basically anything that you could
possibly imagine
you would want to do during your
development process someone already
wrote a plug-in for it so there's a huge
database online if you want to go check
them all out but I'll show you guys some
of the more common ones so I know that
this is called gulp sass and again
whenever someone's working on this
website they need to have this tool so I
want to go ahead and write - - save -
dev I'm gonna go ahead and hit enter and
let it do its thing and again oh you
didn't add a description you didn't add
a professional readme file shut up I
didn't have time for that grunt alright
so let it do its little thing and there
you go so after about 20 seconds or so
check out what happened first of all we
now have another plugin another tool
gulp - s so any time you install
something and you just want to verify
that you have installed just go ahead
and look at your note mud rolls boom
there you go and also if you go ahead
and look at package Jason you see that
you have another dependency so again
that means hey whenever you're working
on this project if you just download the
source code for the first time make sure
that you install gulp and all
so gulp says so there you go so now we
have this tool downloaded and look at
this we have this s CSS file but how do
we actually use this tool well it's
really easy you guys can probably
actually figure out most of it so back
in your gulp file J s you also need to
require what you just downloaded because
we already required gulp you need to do
the exact same thing with gulp - s so
I'm just gonna make a variable called
sass and you just raped require and that
is gulp - sass so whatever the name of
this directory is that's what your right
right there and now we pretty much just
imported all of that now I'm just gonna
overwrite this because we really don't
need a task called bacon for everything
so I'm gonna set this up - pretty much
I'm gonna name assess because I might as
well just stick with the variable name
and what this is gonna do is instead of
printing out Wow bacon is so juicy it's
gonna do this so let's think about this
for a second exactly what we're gonna do
before you just start writing code what
we're gonna do is we're going to look at
this file which is app a CSS Styles that
CSS and then with this file we're going
to go ahead and convert it to CSS so
that's what the tools is gonna do that's
what we just downloaded now once we have
a CSS file we're going to need to say
where we want it safe or the final
location of it the destination so I'm
just gonna save it in this directory
right here so again whenever I'm
developing I'm gonna have a bunch of s
CSS files here and I'm gonna convert it
to CSS it's sick I'm in this directory
so how do we tell gulp to do that well
what we do is we can do something like
this
it's a very cool trick I'm just gonna
return gulp dot source and what you can
do is you can use something called
piping and whenever you see the word
pipe it pretty much just means chain
something together
so the first thing is get the source or
the file that I tell you to and that's
just this file right here so the source
is app a CSS Styles a CSS so all we're
doing right here is we're saying hey go
ahead and get this file so that's that
now you can actually just go ahead and
write all of these commands on the same
line well what people usually do is
anytime they pipe something they read it
on a new line and this is just for
readability so what I want to do after I
got that file is I want to take the
results of that and I want to pass it
through sass so this is basically the
tool that we just downloaded and what
it's going to do is it's going to take
this and convert it to CSS so now we
have a bunch of CSS but we still need to
say okay where do we want to save that
file what do we want the file to be
named so on and so forth so I'm gonna
pipe it or take the results of that and
I'm gonna write to gulp the destination
what the heck is this
get out of here bookmarks how are you
the destination is app slash CSS so
again whatever this file name is you see
how it styles that s CSS it's just gonna
be renamed the same thing without this
first s so it's gonna convert it to CSS
and put it in this parent directory and
name it styles dot C SS that's all it's
going to do so let me go ahead and in
PowerShell let me clear out of here if
you guys remember how to use this
remember you always write gulp which is
gonna look in this file and then you
write the name of the task which is sass
so just writing gulp sass and let it do
its thing dented on took 25 milliseconds
how awesome is that and now you can see
in our CSS directory
we have proper formatted CSS so again
this is the SE SS this is what you or
your developers are going to write and
then once it has that source that
original file is going to go ahead and
take those results and convert it to CSS
and then it's gonna say okay what do you
want me to what's my ending destination
where should this go well here it is
right there so again we got the source
sent it through the plug-in and we
outputted the results the destination
file looking good so thank you guys for
watching don't forget subscribe and I'll
see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
