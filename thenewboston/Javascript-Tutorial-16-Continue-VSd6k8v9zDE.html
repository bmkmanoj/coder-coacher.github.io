JavaScript tutorial and this is probably
going to be the easiest tutorial on
JavaScript that I'm putting out so far
and I in order the watch says you need
to watch my last tutorial because I
talked about everything in my last
tutorial we talked about a break in
JavaScript and how it will stop the code
and in this scenario we went the integer
from 0 through 10 and we said once it
got to 5 we want to break the code and
stop doing whatever we're doing but
let's say you just wanted to skip the
number 5 and keep going through the rest
of the numbers to do this you would do
the exact same syntax but instead of the
word break your to write the word
continue and as you can see when you
write continue well let me tell you
what's going to happen first we have
variable 0 and it's going to loop
through and go all the way through 10
but once it gets to 5 we're saying hey
JavaScript when the variable equals
exact exactly 5 we don't want you to
execute that code but after that we want
you to continue so let's save this and
take a look as you can see you've got 0
1 2 3 4 as you can see right here
once it gets the 5 it skips it and
continues with the rest of the code 6 7
8 9 10 and this is unlike
the break statement where if you did
that it would just stop at five and not
continue the rest of code so if you just
want to skip one variable or one integer
you want to use the continue over the
break so that's all the time we have for
right now thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
