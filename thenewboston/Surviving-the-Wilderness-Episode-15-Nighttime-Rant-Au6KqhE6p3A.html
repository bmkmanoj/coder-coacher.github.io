I'm gonna go back down to the fire I
thought this would be a cool place to
tape from though today was a lot better
than it has been like ten times better
than yesterday was it was horrible I got
a nice little fire going I got some food
today that was awesome and feeling
pretty good i did break my knife though
which sucks but it what happens think
tomorrow i'm going to try and catch a
fish if i can make that whole fishing
thing work I got all rights awesome it
looked like they were trout there aren't
that big but there definitely are some
fish in there that I'm gonna be able to
catch so I guess we're going to see what
happens but I'm kind of tired already
which I always am but i'll probably just
put a fire for a while and then hit the
hay alright well i could not really
sleep tonight it was really really long
night so far it's just been a lot of
noises outside and everything but i did
have a really good day in summary caught
some food got that chipmunk earlier a
some crayfish i actually got a couple
more crayfish afterwards that I haven't
talked about yet but same thing come on
fire this time they actually didn't
follow though the whole can set up
worked out I got a little extra food but
the first time was kind of funny I mean
I thought everything was going good and
then right out of nowhere everything
fell right into the fire it was awesome
the easiest thing to catch so far as
easily been the crayfish they just are
kind of stupid actually to be honest
with you just a little fake with my hand
and they'll go right into the can drop
right into the pool cook them all up at
the same time
it's actually too easy the chipmunk
thing was kind of a fluke i think but
hey I'll take that too frogs they're
just stupid to be in general frogs are
dumb that's how I that was so easy but
crayfish I'm pretty sure I'm going to
catch a bunch tomorrow too but I'm going
to catch a fish too I guarantee it with
the whole sphere that I'm going to make
I'm nothing to make an awesome spear
tomorrow because that first one broke
but tomorrow spear is going to be
awesome because I already figured out
how to do it I know what I'm going to do
and it's going to be perfect I'm kind of
letting the fire smoldering ow because
I'm really feeling a little bit lazy and
don't feel like lectin wood and I
realized that I haven't gotten much of a
summary today so might as well do it
middle of the night got nothing else to
do tomorrow sat plant food food food
pretty hungry so it is going to be
either hit or miss in my book I'm going
to check out some new spots to catch
some more food the crayfish thing was
easy but starting a little harder as
owing on I mean I caught like four or
five and I couldn't find much got a
couple more after that the fish thing to
be honest with you the whole fishing
pool thing that I'm trying out and it's
going to happen or not that most likely
as a dream because you know i'm using a
tab from soda can so kind of hook is
that and I'm going to find bait so
hopefully it'll be the right bait for
the right fish I'm not exactly sure what
I'm pretty sure they're trout but i'm
not sure what they like hopefully it is
worms or any sort of smaller fish
because it's about all I'm going to find
and actually I could use parts from
crayfish so that I don't eat I feel like
300
better than I did this morning I was
totally drained in every way this
morning when I woke up soaking wet and
no food and now I'm actually dry hasn't
rained much at all a little sprinkling
earlier but other than that nothing had
a full fire to keep me warm still got a
smoldering which is awesome and I got a
bunch of food in me now so this is
actually turned like 180 degrees easily
good night in total broke my knife
that's it i'm definitely going to go to
bed now though try and get more sleep
and try and make tomorrow about as good
as i can today may be better if I get
lucky and see ya</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
