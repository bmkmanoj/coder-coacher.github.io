I'm gonna go back down to the fire I
thought this would be a cool place to
tape from though today was a lot better
than it has been like ten times better
than yesterday was was horrible I got a
nice little fire going I got some food
today that was awesome and feeling
pretty good I did break my knife though
which sucks but it will happens I think
tomorrow I'm gonna try and catch a fish
if I can make that whole fishing thing
work I got all rights awesome it looked
like they were trout there aren't that
big but there definitely are some fish
in there that I'm gonna be able to catch
so I guess we're gonna see what happens
but I'm kind of tired already which I
always am but I'll probably just gonna
fire for a while and then uh hit the hay
alright well I could not really sleep
tonight it was really really a long
night so far it's just been a lot of
noises outside and everything but I did
have a really good day in summary caught
some food got that chipmunk earlier some
crayfish I actually got a couple more
crayfish afterwards that I haven't
talked about yet but same thing come on
farther this time they actually didn't
follow though the whole can set up
worked out I got a little extra food but
the first time was kind of funny I mean
I thought everything was going good and
then right out of nowhere everything
fell right into the fire it was awesome
the easiest thing to catch so far it's
easily been the crayfish they just are
kind of stupid actually to be honest
with you just a little fake with my hand
and they'll go right into the can drop
them right into the pool cook them all
up at the same time
it's actually too easy the chipmunk
thing was kind of a fluke I think but
hey I'll take that too frogs they're
just stupid to be in general
frogs are dumb that's all that was so
easy but crayfish I'm pretty sure I'm
going to catch a bunch tomorrow too but
I'm gonna catch a fish too
I guarantee it with the whole sphere
that I'm gonna make I'm nothing to make
an awesome spear tomorrow cuz that first
one broke
but tomorrow spear is going to be
awesome because I already figured out
how to do it I know what I'm going to do
and it's gonna be perfect I'm kind of
letting the fire smoldering ow because
I'm really feeling a little bit lazy and
don't feel like liking wood and I
realized that I haven't gotten much of a
summary today so might as well do it
middle of the night got nothing else to
do tomorrow set planned food food food
pretty hungry so it is going to be
either hit or miss on my book I'm gonna
check out some new spots to catch some
more food the crayfish thing was easy
but started getting a little harder as
going on I mean I caught like four or
five and I couldn't find much got a
couple more after that the fish thing to
be honest with you the whole fishing
pool thing that I'm trying out and it's
gonna happen or not that most likely as
a dream because you know I'm using a tab
from soda cans so kind of hook is that
and I'm gonna find bait so hopefully
it'll be the right bait for the right
fish I'm not exactly sure what I'm
pretty sure they're trout but I'm not
sure what they like hopefully it is
worms or any sort of smaller fish
because it's about all I'm going to find
and actually I could use parts from
crayfish so that I don't eat I feel like
300
better than I did this morning I was
totally drained in every way this
morning when I woke up soaking wet and
no food and actually dry hasn't rained
much at all a little sprinkling earlier
but other than that nothing I had a full
fire to keep me warm still got a
smouldering which is awesome and I got a
bunch of food in me now so this is
actually turned like 180 degrees easily
goodnight
in total broke my knife that's it I'm
definitely going to go to bed now though
try and get more sleep and try and make
tomorrow about as good as I can today
maybe better if I get lucky and see ya</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
