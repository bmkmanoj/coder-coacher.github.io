just want to make a video real quick to
let you guys know that I have decided to
give away 100 brand-new the New Boston
t-shirts actually made of myself by the
way no big deal but uh as you can see
they're black t-shirts and they have the
New Boston logo and they say the new
bust and right at the bottom and these
are my favorite t-shirts they're super
comfortable and they're light and I love
the way they fit so look at that model
pretty good looking so uh that's it in
if you guys want one this is what you do
I'm not going to ask you to you know
even favorite the video or like it or
comment you don't have to post it on
another website you don't have to do
anything you just have to be a
subscriber and I'm guessing that if
you're watching this video then you
probably already our subscriber so part
number one taken care of so if your
subscriber to the New Boston then just
go ahead and private message me through
youtube and send me a your t-shirt size
be your name and see your address I need
all of these pieces of information in
order for me to send you a good teacher
I had like a mini giveaway on google
plus a couple weeks ago and so many
people forgot to either send me their
t-shirt size or their name or address in
people please I need all of these pieces
of information and then I can send you a
t-shirt so like I said just go ahead and
send me a private message and hopefully
you should be receiving your t-shirt
t-shirt thanks it on the cusp t shirt in
the mail in a couple days so that's
another thing I'm not asking you guys
that pay for shipping I'm going to take
care of the shipping the cost of shirts
everything so like I said I just want to
do this to pretty much say thank you to
all my subscribers for supporting my
channel supporting the New Boston
supporting all my videos and it's the
least I can do so speaking of Google+
earlier my next giveaway is going to be
through Google+ so if you have not added
me yet then make sure to do that i'll
put a link to my Google+ in the
description below so definitely make
sure to add me on Google+ if you want
another chance to win another teacher so
that's pretty much it
the only thing I had to say in this
video hopefully 100 people in a couple
days will be wearing sweet brand-new the
New Boston t-shirts and like I said
that's it thank you guys and if any of
you guys want to stick around what I'm
going to do is as you can clearly see
I'm not in my office right now I'm in
the dungeon aka my basement so if you
want a little toward my basement to see
where I make t-shirts and I make some
videos then stick around but for
everyone else if you're just interested
in t-shirts than a good luck and I'll
see you later all right guys welcome to
my dirty basement and here is the tour
let me show you guys around so this is
actually where I spend a lot of my time
as you can see I bought eight hundred
t-shirts recently and a lot of these I
didn't make it but I set up racks here
are some blue and red ones here's some
other ones that oh maybe I'm going to be
having another giveaway soon well are
those follow your heart t-shirts anyways
that's a little preview of what's to
come but there's some more search all of
these I didn't print yet in here is just
some screen printing stuff for making
t-shirts what you do is you actually
have to make the design and these are
designs right here they're ready to be
made ready to become a t-shirt and these
t-shirts right here are for the giveaway
that I'm having right now so check out
all those that's what I gotta put in the
mail and mail to all you guys I gotta
feeling whenever I take this to the post
office and dump it in front of the lady
she's not going to be happy that she has
to send all those packages many ways
tough luck because you know the New
Boston fans they need them so here's my
little setup that I have for podcasting
I have my main computer this is the one
that I am totally in love with I call it
r2d2 and this is the bumblebee I use
that from time to time and over here
it's kind of not so much the work area
that's when my friends whenever they had
too much to drink they usually pass out
on that couch and here are two more
computers one of
one is a PC and this is my Mac hello and
of course some Nintendo games the best
nintendo game ever Super Mario 3 or
contra it's highly debatable but both of
them are awesome games of course you
gotta go best system ever classic
Nintendo and of course you know everyone
needs a ps3 so I got one too NHL 11
awesome game and there we go there's my
little TV not the greatest TV but hey
I'll take it and here's some more
t-shirts right here I got to print those
tomorrow actually was supposed to print
them today but I got a little bit lazy
so you know no big deal and I do my wash
over here and check this out the video i
just made i only had like three things
to say but i actually needed a note card
so I didn't you know forget anything and
I probably still forgot something that's
a silly I am oh great my furnace is
kicking on right in the middle of a
video awesome I'm going to drop kick
that after i'm done with this and this
little baby right here i call it big
blue even though it's kind of green this
is where I make all the t-shirts you put
them on that platform those white
platforms and you put the designs on
their spin them around and bam janna put
the t-shirt so there you go oops that's
embarrassing I just tripped over that
but uh there you go there's a little
tour and um I'm actually thinking about
making some t-shirt like screen printing
tutorial soon so you guys are interested
in the full process and you know of
course this video right here was kind of
quick and dirty but that's it I know a
lot of you guys might be interested
about you know where I make videos and
t-shirt so there you go thought I'd give
you guys a quick little tour but anyways
like I said good luck with everyone on
winning the t-shirt and if you don't win
this contest I'm going to have a bunch
of other contests as you can see I have
kind of a lot of t-shirts that I need to
get rid of here so a good luck on this
contest make sure to send me all the
information and thank you to all of my
subscribers for everything and for all
your support so uh thank you guys and
I'll see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
