tutorial I finally typed all this code
and finished up our program and see look
at all this you really didn't want to
have to sit there and watch me type all
this did you but anyways now that I
typed it on show you guys what I did and
how it works the first thing we did is
we synthesize all of our outlets I mean
this is nothing new just housekeeping
stuff and after this the really first
thing we did is we called this method
called will animate rotation to
interface orientation and go ahead and
start typing that and all your
parameters are going to pop up just keep
everything good by default and what this
method is it's a built-in method and
what we just did is well we inherited it
from our parent class and we needed to
overwrite it so this method by default
gets called after you rotate your ipod
touch or iphone and what it does is it
looks at the interface and it pretty
much what it does is it looks at the
orientation of how you're holding it in
depending on how you're holding it
displays your objects a certain way so i
mean by default it has all your default
settings of course but if you override
it you can manually type in the exact
location of where and when you want to
position each object so what we did is
we made one if statement if the
orientation is portrait that means if
you're just holding it up and down like
you were talking on the phone what you
need to do is you need to change each
frame and put it in a specific location
now each button has a property cult of
frame and a frame is pretty much the
container that holds that object in this
case the button so you always want your
frame to be the same size of your object
and remember ours were 125 x 125 this is
the last two things you need to drop the
first two things are the location on
your screen so this first one is
20 pixels across 20 pixels down draw a
frame that's 125 wide x 125 top and by
the way the CG rectangle make is we're
going to be getting into drawing later
but CG means core graphics and whenever
you make a CG object it pretty much just
draw something on screen so what we did
is we pretty much drew a rectangle I
mean you couldn't actually see of course
as invisible but it pretty much was a
container AKA frame to hold the button
so by default when you're holding your
phone straight up and down we drew each
frame pretty much giving it coordinates
of where we want our button to go and
this else statement right here this is
what this means alright by default if
the orientation is equal to holding it
straight up and down then go ahead and
dry it appropriately else if you're
holding it sideways go ahead and redraw
them so I mean so they're standing next
to each other instead of overlapping you
can pretty much drama anywhere on the
screen you can even draw them to make a
shape of a hotdog if you want but
anyways since we didn't have upside down
remember in our properties we can never
hold it upside down so this handles the
orientation if it's being hold straight
up and down this handles it if it's
being holding in landscape remember we
can't even hold it upside down we didn't
specify those attributes so we don't
even have to worry about that so after I
pretty much over road this method right
here and called it if statement handle
how you want to draw the objects and
when you want to drum the only other
things i did is set all of our outlets
equal to nil this is just a free up
memory will be talking about this later
when we talk about different views and
we also released all of our buns because
remember we retained them so then we
need to do really some when we were done
with them so again this just memory
stuff down there you don't
really need up know about that I mean
you do need to know about but no so
check this out I'll give you guys one
example let me go up and right now we're
holding it in portrait so check this out
this button number one right here is 20
pixels over 20 pixels down and it is 125
wide and 125 tall so this button number
two is a hundred and seventy-five pixels
over twenty pixels down and of course
125 125 we didn't change that for
anything so now let's go ahead and put
hardware rotate left and see what we got
now loan now let's go ahead and look at
button to button to right here is in the
bottom left that means it's 20 pixels /
150 5 pixels down and 125 x 125 because
you know that's just the size of the
button and how we reposition all these
buttons to make sure that they all fit
on the screen next to each other besides
instead of overlapping we just pretty
much figured out how wider iphone screen
was and we pretty much just you know
went through this stuff you probably
need a calculator in your hand to figure
out all this stuff but this is a really
pretty much position everything to make
sure just fits nicely on the screen and
yeah that's pretty much it I mean it's
pretty self-explanatory just want to
show you guys the key thing is this is
the method that you need to pass in and
to interface orientation set this equal
to whatever orientation you're using and
then the conditions is how you want your
objects to display so if you have any
questions just go ahead and ask me on my
forum the link is below in the iphone
development section and also i posted
all the source code for this so you
don't have to you know keep rewinding it
and watch this story you can just go
ahead and copy all of my source code
post it in your Xcode and watch it run
and once you do it'll make a whole lot
more sense so for now I just wanna I
mean
only one do anything right now except
eat pudding but thank you guys for
watching and don't forget subscribe and
in the next tutorial we're going to be
going over multiple views that means a
program that has more than one screen we
haven't done yet it's going to be super
awesome I'm more excited for it than
I've ever been before in my entire life
so thank you for watching over get
subscribe and I'll see you guys next
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
