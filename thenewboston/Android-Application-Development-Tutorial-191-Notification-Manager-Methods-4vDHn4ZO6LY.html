Android tutorial for the new boss in
what we're gonna do now is refer to this
notification manager pretty much that's
all we're gonna do for this tutorial
let's learn about some of the methods it
has and how we actually send this
notification again to the notification
service it's going to be pretty simple
for the most part but there's some key
factors that you guys have to remember
when working with the notification
manager so what we're gonna do is again
within our on click method we're just an
estate a notification manager now we're
going to say notify and basically what
we need to do is we need to pass in a
certain key or a unique ID and also
which notification we want to set up so
we're just gonna say unique ID and we'll
set that up in a second and then we also
have to pass in which notification again
we have this notification called in so
that's we're gonna pass in the reason we
need an unique ID is well actually I'll
show you but we're gonna copy this and
we're gonna go above our class and we're
gonna set this equal to static final and
then paste equals and then some kind of
a unique number oh and also we say it's
an int so there we go we set up set up
that unique number and basically now if
we run our application I'll show you
guys the problem that we're having and
why we need that unique ID
so if you go down to our status bar
class hits button as you can see we get
this message and you know that's cool
but we're gonna go down and we're gonna
hit our message it's still gonna open up
our tent and open up that pending intent
but as you can see your notification
never went away it's still there you're
like what's going on why didn't that
clear well we can hit the Clear button
there and it'll clear it but we want to
clear right when we you know open up our
pending intent so how we're gonna do
that is refer to the unique ID within
our on create method and again if you
guys want to check out the sample code I
believe with the Google sample code it
starts up a service and it cancels it
that way but this is just kind of you
know a quick tutorial on notification so
I didn't want to go into building a
whole service that handles our
notification and all that stuff but what
we're gonna do is refer to this unique
ID within our on create method because
again once we you know start up our
pending intent it's gonna call this on
create method and that's where we're
gonna clear the notification it's just a
quick fix probably not the best way to
do it but what we're going to do is
we're going to refer to our notification
manager and we're just gonna say dot
cancel and as you can see it takes an
int or an ID and that's we're gonna
refer to our unique ID because you know
we don't want it to cancel other
people's notifications and stuff like
that so we need to have a unique ID of
some sort and here's just our unique ID
it's just a random number but that's
kind of why again that's kind of why we
need that unique ID so we can actually
cancel the notification and then quickly
also just because and again I'm not
gonna run it it's still gonna be the old
running but just to show you guys
another problem we're having is if we
you know hit the button we get this
notification we hit our notification it
opens up another intent opens up another
activity the same activity then once we
hit the back button oh you know we have
all these activities open so just again
a quick fix for that we're just gonna
say
within our on click method after we know
called and notify method we're just
gonna say finish and after we hear a
button it will send our notification
finish the activity and then once they
hit the notification it's gonna start up
our class and it's going to start up our
notification manager and it's going to
cancel that unique ID that that
notification so that's pretty much it
for this tutorial hopefully you guys
understood what we're you know hopefully
you guys understand the purpose of the
unique ID and how to notify you know
actually create our notification on the
status bar and also how to cancel that
notification on the status bar so that's
pretty much the purpose of this tutorial
and again thanks for watching I'll catch
you guys in the next tutorial hope you
have a good one and see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
