physics lesson and in this lesson I want
to talk to you guys about sound waves
now of course I talked about sound waves
before but I never really explained what
they are how they're created and why
they work so remember that I said that
sound is a wave now a wave remember it's
just something that transfers energy
from a source to a destination like when
Bob and Gina were holding the slinky the
slinky itself didn't get absorbed into
Gina's body it was just the energy that
bob was causing that transferred along
the slinky into Gina
now with sound it's a little bit
different because there is no source
like Bob and there is no destination
like Gina the source would be something
like a guitar string and the destination
would be something like our ears so let
me go ahead and draw or try to draw a
guitar real quick okay that kind of
looks like a really messed up squash but
you know that's okay we can live with it
actually this is kind of looking like an
alien that's about to get a rectal exam
but you know not important so here are
the guitar strings a beautiful looking
guitar with some strings on it in here
is my head over here Wow
I need to take an art class before I
teach any more tutorials and okay I'm
happy that's me smiling so basically
here's the guitar string and there's my
head over here now whenever someone
plucks a string on this guitar it's
going to create sound waves that are
going to ripple through the air right
here and eventually reach my air I mean
excusing my ear mmm funny I said that so
what exactly is happening when these
sound waves are going through the air
into my ear well obviously there isn't a
little slinky that's connected to this
sound hole to my ear or else you know
that would look first of all very weird
and second of all you know it just
doesn't exist so what is happening what
medium is transferring the energy from
the guitar to my ear well even though
the air may look invisible to us it's
actually made up of billions and
trillions of invisible molecules
molecules like nitrogen
oxygen is property some co2 in there
maybe some water vapor h2o so basically
when a guitar plays these strings right
here are going to vibrate back and forth
and push against these particles in the
air
now these particles don't go flying into
your head of course and cause you you
know your head to start bleeding
they just bump into the particles next
to them and those bump into the
particles next to them and they
eventually cause this ripple of air
particles and these molecules eventually
reach your ear now of course whenever it
gets to your ear that's more biology and
chemistry and less physics but what your
nerve signals in your ear is going to do
is they're going to notice that
vibration in your brain is going to
interpret it and understand that s sound
so if we took a closer look at what's
going on we would see something like
this we would have the source which is
the guitar and we would have the
destination which is your ear and
remember that I said is sound works as a
wave so let's go ahead and take a look
at this wave we could graph it something
that look like that but in real life
let's go ahead and take a look at the
air particles so whenever we have a
ripple in the wave the air particles
would might be you know very compressed
like this and like this and in between
the waves they wouldn't be so compressed
so let me finish drawing my dots and I
don't know if this is going to show up
on YouTube but uh let me make my brush
size a little bigger get the point
across alright that's a pretty good drug
if I don't say so myself so basically
what's going to happen is that these
particles in all of these dots represent
a molecule in the air like carbon oxygen
nitrogen and co2 something like that all
of these molecules in the air aren't
moving that much they're just vibrating
slightly causing them to bump into the
molecules next to them and transfer
energy from the guitar strings over here
to your ear which is over here so that
is what
happens whenever you pluck a guitar and
it makes that sound that sound is the
string of the guitar vibrating back and
forth and whenever or each time it
vibrates it pushes against the molecules
in the air and causes them to compress
like this so that way whenever your ear
picks up on these slight vibrations your
brain know that that bring knows that
that is actually sound and not just
random vibrations now a cool fun fact
one last thing before I let you guys go
is you guys may be thinking what if you
could take all of the molecules all of
the particles out of the air would that
mean that sound is impossible well yes
it does scientists can create these
things and they actually call them
vacuums where they suck out all of the
molecules in the air
no more carbon and oxygen and nitrogen
nothing and whenever you try to have
sound in this there is no sound because
there's nothing or no medium for the
sound energy to travel through so that's
just a little fun fact you know not the
basics of the store the soil is
basically explaining how sound waves
work so hopefully you understand that if
you have any questions though then just
go ahead and ask me on my forum anyways
