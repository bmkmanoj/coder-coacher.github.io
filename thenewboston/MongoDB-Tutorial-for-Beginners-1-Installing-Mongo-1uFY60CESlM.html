Roberts and welcome to your very first
tutorial in Mongo DB now I'm sure a lot
of you watching this video already know
exactly what Mongo DB is and what it's
used for but for those of you who may
have just heard the name before and
aren't really sure exactly what it is
I'll give you guys like the quick
one-minute introduction so Mongo DB is
the most popular no SQL database so why
would we actually need this well say
that you're making a website and I know
let's say it was a social network and
you want to store a bunch of user
information well you could use MongoDB
for that say that you're making some
mobile app and I don't know like it was
a game and you wanted to save a bunch of
scores from all the users well you can
use MongoDB for that anytime you want to
save information on a server you can use
MongoDB so that's what a database is but
what is the no SQL part well
traditionally before the big no SQL
movement whenever you wanted to save
information in the database you did so
in kind of a tabular format so think of
a spreadsheet where you have a bunch of
rows in columns this is pretty much how
you save data before but what this no
SQL thing is all about is pretty much a
movement where you can now save data to
a database without using tables so if
you guys are like alright that sounds a
lot more confusing well it is at first
if you're used to let's say MySQL or
something but it actually gives you a
lot of benefits not only performance and
speed but also a lot more flexibility
with your programs as well so it's
pretty awesome in will actually see a
lot of benefits later on but for now of
course the first thing we need to do is
actually um you know download and
install it so if you go to the website
Mongo DB org
you're going to see a big green download
button maybe somewhere else they
probably change the website you know
depending on when you're watching this
but find the download section and click
it
and this is going to give you a couple
options if you scroll down now of course
the first thing we have to decide is
what operating system are we trying to
install this one that shouldn't be that
hard
I'm running Windows in this tutorial the
next option is what version do you want
so you're going to see a couple choices
whenever you have Windows 7 or newer
for example I'm running Windows 7 in
this video you're going to want to
choose the default one legacy means
Vista or older so any windows 7 or near
7 8
what's next 110 since they skip 9 you're
going to want to choose this one
anything older that's what the legacy is
so I'm going to go ahead and download
this MSI and this is pretty much just an
installer so whenever it downloads you
double click it and it's a wizard that
you click Next a bunch of times and then
you're going to have MongoDB on your
computer alright so it finished
installing let's go ahead and double
click this opens it up yes I want to run
it let me minimize my window right there
alright so we're pretty much going to
stick with all defaults just go ahead
and click Next
let me read through this dudududu - I
read it I read it trust me guys alright
next now here what we want to do is we
want to install the complete and this is
pretty much like it says is going to
give you all the features no need to
customize this right now this is the
first tutorial so complete and install
so it's going to do its thing and
windows is probably going to ask me for
permission so yep there you go yes I'll
allow it
I trust it and it's actually a real
quick installation
alright so apparently we now have
MongoDB on our machine so now what we
can do is we can go to our Start menu
computer and double-click on our hard
drive now in our Program Files
we're going to see that we now have
directory called Mongo DB so double
click that and go into your server 3.0
and look for a directory called bin and
by the way the path of bin may change
depending on if they decide to you know
up
location in future versions of Mongo but
essentially look for the directory
called bin double-click it and inside
here you're going to see a bunch of
Mongo executables so these are a bunch
of different tools that you can use with
Mongo the only two that we're going to
be worried about in the first couple
tutorials are this one Mongo B and this
one Mongo so Mongo D this is the actual
Mongo database so eventually what we're
going to be doing is we're going to be
running this program right here and it's
pretty much it's going to run in the
background but once you run it you can
start using your computer as a Mongo
database so if you guys are like alright
well where do I actually do the typing
writing all my commands and stuff for
that you use Mongo the regular Mongo
application so Mongo is a command line
interface where you can type all your
database commands um you know add data
remove data all that good stuff so again
Mongo D is going to run in the
background and we're going to be doing
all of our typing inside this Mongo
command-line application so let's go
ahead and figure out how to set
everything up what we need to do is we
actually need to open up in the Start
menu again type CMD and open up the
command line I actually have it pinned
to my taskbar I recommend you do that
but if you don't want to then just type
CMD and click this and it opens up your
Windows command line so what we need to
do from here is we actually need to
navigate to this directory and we need
to start Mongo D and by the way anytime
you want to run an executable through
your command line all you do is you
navigate to the location and type the
name without the dot exe extension so
just Mongo D so if we never use a
command line before it's actually really
easy I'll show you guys the really
simple commands that you need for this
tutorial so obviously the location of
this is in C program files MongoDB
server whatever whatever so right now
we're in C users
Bucky we need to get back to C or
a hard drive so if you type cd' this
means change directory and you can type
dot dot and that will move you up one
directory so now we're in user so let's
do that again and now we are in C now
anytime you want to move into a folder
for example if you want to go back into
users you type CD users and hit enter
but what we want to do is we actually
want to go to this location right here
Program Files my ODB server 3.0 bin so
we can actually type that all in one
long path and hopefully it won't mess
anything up
so Program Files what was it
Mongo DB server 3.0 bin all right now
hit enter and there you go so now we are
in this directory pretty much so in
actually if you want to verify that then
you can type dir and it's going to list
all the contents or all the files in
that directory so as you can see we now
have a bunch of different executables
Mongo Mongo di XE so remember I told you
anytime you want to run an executable
just type the name Mongo D simple as
that so whenever we try to run it right
off the bat as you can see things aren't
going smoothly we have one little issue
that we need to take care of first and
that's this it this uh you know little
message is kind of hard to sift through
but this is essentially saying you need
a data directory and that's what the C
data
DB not found terminating means it's
pretty much yelling at you because it's
saying all right you're trying to set up
a database to store a bunch of
information you need to give me a
directory or a location to store all
that info what am I supposed to do just
pick some random place on your desktop
now where am I supposed to store this
info and the standard location the story
is on your hard drive make a directory
called data and then in there make a
directory called DB so what we can
actually do is
is just go to your computer in your hard
drive right click here make a folder
called data DB or a really simple way is
through our command line if we just type
the command mkdir right so right now as
you can see we have no directory called
data or DB at all so I'm going to type M
caterer which means make a directory and
then type data DB and hit enter and
check it out so now if we go back into
our hard drive we now have a directory
called data DB so any information that
we store using Mongo DB is going to go
right in here pretty awesome so what we
do from here is just run the Mongo D
command again and check it out now since
we have that directory gave a place to
store the information the database is
running correctly and it says waiting
for connections on port 2 701 7 so
everything is going awesome nice and
smooth we can start typing commands
working with MongoDB however I'm going
to show you guys one little shortcut and
by the way if you want to stop watching
the video right now and just um you know
whenever you want to run the server
navigate to this long string right here
you can do that move on to the next
video but if you want to uh you know
pretty much save yourself of having the
type all this I'll show you guys a cool
little shortcut so back in your Windows
Explorer navigate back to Program Files
Mongo DB server 3.0 bin now inside here
right-click any of these files and
choose properties so we want to copy
this location right here because we're
going to be setting up a shortcut where
we're pretty much going to say whenever
we type Mongo D look in this location so
that way we don't have to type it out
every single time in the command line
because that was
pain in the bow so once you have this
copied you can actually close out of
here
and actually let me close out of my
entire database right now so if you go
to your Start menu right click computer
and hit properties what you can do from
here is go to advanced system settings
and this gives you an option of
environment variables so click this
button and what you want to do is you
want to create a new variable and name
it p-a-t-h all in capital letters and
paste in that location so now in our
command line whenever we type Mongo it's
going to look in this location for
default so we don't have to navigate to
it and by the way I already have my path
set up because I actually had Mongo
installed on my computer I just
uninstalled it for this tutorial
but anyways once you have it click OK
and make sure you click OK right there
and check this out
you can now from your command line type
Mongo Dee and it starts up without
having to navigate to that weird
location so definitely a lot more handy
and now as you can see our Mongo
database is now sitting waiting for
connections now obviously if you try to
type in here you can't because I said
this is just the database it's just a
program that runs in the background
while you're listening for connections
from like users to your website or
whatever if you ever want to start using
these commands and testing everything
out go to your command line again and
since I have it open already I need to
open another one and remember the
program to type all of our commands is
Mongo so just hit enter so as you can
see it gives you a little cursor this is
actually where you type commands I'm
going to be teaching you guys about all
the commands in the future tutorials for
now just to ensure that everything is
working type DB and hit enter and that
just prints out the name of a default
database that it gave you but now we
know it's working in actually as you can
see it says 1 connection now open
which pretty much simulates that we're
user writing some requests or commands
right here
and we are now successfully connected to
our database so pretty simple there you
go now that we got all the Hart stuff
out of the way in the next couple
tutorials we get into the really fun
stuff so I'll see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
