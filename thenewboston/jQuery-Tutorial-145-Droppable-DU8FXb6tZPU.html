style.css we want to create a new class
called border and this is going to
essentially just contain CSS that would
outline a thin black border on this
element then what we're going to do is
as we draw as we hover over this we're
going to change the border of this to
black and then it will make it look a
bit more like we're able to drop
something so this border class here is
just going to be border one pixel it's
going to be solid and black so now that
we've got this class set up with a
border of one pixel solid and black we
can apply it into here so I'm just going
to write border okay so now as we drop
any element over this drop droppable div
the class of it will be added the border
class will be added to it so let's go
ahead and test this when we drag over
you can see that the border changes so
now it looks more like that we can
actually you know we can like you know
it's more feasible that you could drop
something into this box than if nothing
changed at all so it works as you hover
out as you come out as well so it's only
as we're hovering over this that we
actually get this this border appear
okay so now that we've created this we
need to find a way of creating a
tolerance as to when this is actually
classed as hovering over and is has the
ability to drop inside so at the moment
we have the default tolerance set
however what we're going to do is change
this so I'm gonna create a new option
tolerance and this is going to be equal
to either fit intersect pointer or touch
so the fit let's go through the first
option or the value for this first
option is fit now fit means that the the
draggable which is this here has to
completely be inside of this div here so
as at the moment you can see that
supposed to drag it from here
as my cursor reaches the first part of
this element or sorry the middle of this
the middle of this draggable object
reaches the first part of this element
that's overlapped by at least 50% and
that's the intersect option so that's
the default option so at the moment 50%
and it looks true and it looks droppable
so fit will mean if we refresh that we
can that we notice now that we have to
have the whole of the element inside of
this innate to be able to drop it so it
works I guess a bit better you could say
a bit more sort of like naturally as we
fit the whole of the element inside that
then means that we're able to drop it
inside so that's the fit as I showed as
I said before intersect is the default
it works exactly the same way so at
least 50% of it inside means that it's
droppable let's look at the next option
which is pointer and this is when the
amount the mouse pointer itself overlaps
the dropper ball so if I grab this
element from the very end and force that
in as soon as my mouse pointer enters
this div that means that it is droppable
so I could do it from the front or there
take it there and drop it just in like
that
so that's the pointer value for this
tolerance option we've also got touch
which is when the element that you are
dragging touches it by any amount
whatsoever
so this is somewhat of a you know you
could regard it as somewhat of an
illogical choice to make however you
want to create something that feels
natural to both yourself and your user
and that you think will be beneficial
when you're drag dragging and dropping
objects so that is the tolerance
personally I prefer the pointer because
the user generally tends to look at
their pointer as their point of dropping
something in and for me it just feels a
lot more natural when you you know as
soon as your pointers
inside somewhere that means that you can
drop it so for now we'll leave this
tolerance as pointer okay so the last
thing we want to go ahead and look at is
the accept option and we're going to
have to change a few things around for
this now accept looks like this it's
just the option name is accept and we
can we can provide a particular group of
objects by class that we want to allow
to be dropped into here so for example
let's go ahead and change this span from
drag me and let's create a few more
names but first of all I'm going to give
this a class of name and I'm going to
copy this and paste that down and I'm
gonna enter say Alex in there and Billy
in there just put a slash after that and
then the last one I'm gonna give a class
of place and I am going to write London
so now we have something that looks like
this at the moment nothing is dragging
at all because we haven't picked up on
this in UI j s here however we're going
to be changing that around in just a
moment so this is our drop area it's
remained the same however what we want
is only specific elements based on the
class so name or place to be allowed to
dropped in drop inside here now you
might be wondering why we do this now
let's just say you had particular
elements you wanted in particular boxes
for example you might have another div
next to this one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
