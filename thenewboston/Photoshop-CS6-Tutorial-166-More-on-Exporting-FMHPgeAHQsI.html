going to learn how to export paths to
illustrator using the export method and
Photoshop cs6 so let's go ahead and get
started go ahead and draw a make a path
and I'm just going to use the custom
shape tool to make a path and you can
see that there is a path in there when
you draw something with the custom shape
tool automatically makes a path and
we're going to use the different method
let's go to a file and then we're going
to go to export and we're going to go to
paths to illustrator and we've got our
paths here so if you need a different
name you need to rename it here in the
past menu just by double clicking on the
name there and hit okay now I gotta go
to my files here where we got new boston
okay and here we go vectors because it
saves it as in a w illustrator file and
this is sheriff will save that now i can
open this up file open and illustrator
and there Sheriff right there now open
that up these are good and now we can
see that my path has been exported into
illustrator and you can see that the
color information has not but we do have
the path in there so that's how you do
it without exporting in like the color
and everything like that so you've got
different two different methods if you
check if you look at the last tutorial
that I made that one right before this
we use a save as method and this one we
just exported the path so that's all I
wanted to show you here and that weighs
a lot a little bit faster and you don't
have to deal with the color and stuff
like that so that's a pretty nice you
can obviously add color in here if you
would like to wherever the paint bucket
tool is
here's a gradient tool that'll that'll
do something no I don't have any color
selected anyways I'm not teaching
illustrator right now we're just
teaching a Photoshop so now you guys get
the idea and you can use this to your
advantage so see you guys in the next
tutorial we're going to start a whole
new section where we're going to be
working with the layer styles hopefully
I see you guys in those ones see you
guys later have a good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
