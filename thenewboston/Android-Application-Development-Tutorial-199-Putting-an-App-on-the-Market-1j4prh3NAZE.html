and ninety-ninth Android tutorial for
the new Boston and we're getting towards
in there so we're going to do now is put
our application on the marketplace so
you know you can share all of your hard
work with the world so what we're going
to do is again just pretty much what we
did with our Maps activity first we need
to sign our project and all that great
stuff so we're just going to right click
on our project go to prop or Android
tools and go to export signed
application and we're just going to
click that hit next and then we can
either use our existing key store that
we use for the Maps activity as well the
same certificate if you choose but we're
just going to create a new one and again
we're just going to browse the location
where we keep our key stores or whatever
and again mine is just within and
documents and then Android apps here and
that's where I'm going to save it as I'm
just going to call this T and B for the
new Boston and I'm just going to say key
store hit enter and then we have to say
a password so just make a password that
you guys will remember in this kind of
review so I'm just going to kind of
quickly through this again we just need
create an alias so I'm just going to say
the New Boston alias and make sure I
spell right there and then again just a
password that you guys will remember
again your keystore password and your
alias password can be the same that
doesn't matter we're going to say a
thousand years validity and also first
name and just hit next then we got a
locate where we want to say that save
the APK and i'm just going to save it in
the same folder as well and there we go
we're just going to hit finish so so far
nothing new now what we're going to have
to do is we're going to go into the
android marketplace which is just market
android.com ford slash publish and
become a publisher for the android it
only cost twenty-five bucks
whereas like apple i think it's like 100
bucks a year Android it's just a
one-time fee of 25 bucks so
that's pretty awesome as of right now I
don't I don't know if they're going to
change in the future so you guys might
just want to sign up now I don't know if
you have 25 bucks but it's pretty cheap
and once you get signed in you'll have a
screen like this once you're once you're
logged in and you're a developer and
everything you're just going to go to
upload application pretty simple we got
to choose the apk so we're going to
locate where we just save that apk again
the documents Android apps and the new
Boston
apk just going to hit that and open and
then hit upload takes a little bit not
too long here so it's about 2 megabytes
and then it's uploaded our apk shows all
of our permissions that we're using
we're just going to save that and then
what we need to do is we need to add at
least two screenshots and they have to
be by these dimensions so if you guys
want to use your computer to take like
you know run your application on your
emulator or something take a screenshot
and then you know use like a paint or
GIMP or something to edit it to these
exact portions what you will need to
have these specific dimensions to upload
so then we're just going to locate those
files pretty simple I saved a few on my
desktop
somewhere I save so much stuff on my
desktop it's ridiculous
but no that's not that one so I'm just
going to pick one screenshot open it and
then we just hit upload and again we
need at least two so I'm just going to
add another one by just down here we
choose another file so I'm going to pick
this maps one even though the maps isn't
in this actual this and this project so
I don't know if that's going to confuse
people or not but whatever so now we
have two pictures and then we may need
to add a high resolution picture again
by a specific dimension of 100 mm sorry
512 by 512 pixels either PNG or JPEG
with a maximum of you know that many
kilobytes so again we're just going to
pick a
picture after you guys edit one so I've
already created one here and then again
we just hit upload pretty simple stuff I
mean it's a pretty easy walkthrough we
select the title we're just going to say
the new Boston basics and we're just
going to say this app you know add a
description so just you know create a
brief description something that will be
displayed when the user is looking at
the app see if they want to download it
so you know sell them get them
interested there and then we cannot also
you know make some recent changes if we
want to update to our description later
and all that good stuff as well as promo
text we're also going to select the
application type so we're going to say
this is the application because it's not
really too much of a game I guess and a
category so we're just going to say like
education copyright you can either turn
that on or off basically we're just
going to leave it off because we don't
really care for the most part okay for
this application anyways and then also
the content rating everyone should be
able to use this I don't think we did
anything too offensive but so we're just
going to say everyone and then all
countries pricing is free you can also
set up a merchant account so you can you
know get paid for your applications as
well and so there we go
we have that set up might want to you
know give some additional information
that they can contact us with I'm just
going to leave the website and again we
just have to agree to the guidelines and
you know all that all that good stuff so
we're just going to hit accept those and
then we're going to go over to this apk
files up here and say active so that
attaches our apk and there we go we're
just can hit publish and we are in the
market gasps so again I hope you liked
liked this tutorial as you can see here
is our application
be able to be downloaded as of now and
I'll catch guys in the next tutorial
where we're going to learn about updates
so it's going to be pretty important
because again you guys when you do an
update you need to remember your
password for your certificate or your
key store and your alias and all that
stuff so make sure you check out that
last tutorial and before you before you
forget so I'll see you guys in and have
a good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
