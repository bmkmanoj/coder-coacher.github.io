tutorial that I'm making for the new
Boston and in this tutorial I may be
showing you how to create your own XML
file using a c-sharp so for this
tutorial you may need to have a button a
name text box and a generic up/down and
email text box so once you have all
these on your form let's go ahead and
double click on your create file button
the first thing I'm going to do is
create a new instance of the XML text
writer class we're gonna say XML text
writer I'll call it study you can do a
new instance of five the first thing
that it calls for the parameter is a
path to the file that we want to create
and this does include the name of the
file that we want to create just like
them you're creating other types of
files you can stream writer class so I
already have it all copied off but you
can use a save file dialog here if you
want but I think it's necessary so just
have the folder that's going in my doing
the test folder and then the name of the
file that you have three mines in you
called X doc one XML the second
parameter that it calls for the type of
encoding so just put encoding got utf-8
it's just a type of encoding for text
you don't really know what it is it so
the first thing we're going to do is
write a star column to write start and
with the start start element means is
well in our XML document we had like a
person node for the people node and that
would be our start element so we're
going to put people right they the next
thing that we're going to want to do is
write another start out of it we're
going to want to write our person
element so I'm going to say X writer
doctor right start going up again and
then be writing the person here person
and again we're going to want to write
another start Melvin and that isn't me
for the person's name so right start
element and then just
name sighs all right so now in order to
have the inner text or this node we're
going to want to do the right string to
x-ray about right all right and we're
just going to run or write the name that
the user puts in this text box so this
text box once taxed all right and then
we're going to want to write end element
so this is basically going to be writing
name this will be writing well Xbox one
Xbox one back here and then the right
end element right end element will be
writing me and the elements that will be
writing name so let's be closing off of
this node right here so basically it's
just writing an onion node called name
so now we're going to want to write the
end element for person so you can start
element it basically just person we're
going to write the end element to that X
writers write end Elliman so basically
it's just write this the end of this and
then we're going to write the end
element for people and I'm not going to
comment that out I can pretty sure you
know if this move by that so right end
element so that so now we have to do is
we just have to close the writer so that
if we were to read this or something
which we're not going to then we
wouldn't get an aerial view by the
process or if we try to open the file
then the program still running female so
over here we're going to enter someone's
name Adam click create file and it
shouldn't free an XML file yeah perfect
but this formatting here like we can't
see it so what you can do is go right
here and change the form
heading to my Prius all good
formatting equals formatting invented
yeah so this just makes it look a lot
better and now you can actually read it
and this is just how we wrote it before
so we now create the file and open it
yeah now it's much easier just about all
on one line and if we wanted to create
more nodes inside of here such as for
their aging email we could do that very
easily so all we have to do really is
copy this new writing name node we'll
just copy this twice we'll be right in
age and we'll be ready now so we'll just
do the email of the text box threes text
and age of the marriage up-downs value
down here up your cup down one dot you
man where's my finger with that into the
string because it represents a definite
two so now we should just pretty much be
writing a new XML file with things for a
person such as their age email and name
all stored in this XML box three Adam
the keen alright file perfect wrote the
name age and the email so that's pretty
much it for this tutorial on writing
your own XML file so see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
