tutorial and actually before I even get
started with this video I want to
mention that from here on out make sure
that you're watching these tutorials in
1080 high def and also full screen since
YouTube thinks it's a great idea to
change your layout every other second
I'm going to just film all my tutorials
in 1080 high-definition they're going to
be crystal clear but anyways like I was
saying in this video what I'm going to
be doing is I want to teach you guys how
to run a very basic art program so go
ahead in our studio and click file new
file our script or if you're too lazy
you can just hit ctrl shift and N but
once you click that you can see that a
new panel opens in our studio and that's
this little panel right here and as you
can see it's just named untitled one
right now but basically what's going to
happen is whenever we run a basic
program in our studio we're going to be
typing all of our code up here and then
we're going to run it and then the
output of it or the result is going to
appear down here in the console so again
you're going to be doing all of your
coding up here and the result you're
going to see right here so the first
thing I want to do is actually clear
this console so if you hold ctrl on your
keyboard and press L as you can see that
wipes out that error message and if ever
your console is getting too messy from
you know outputting too much crap just
hold ctrl + L and it will clear your
console so let's go ahead and make a
very in by very I mean incredibly simple
program right now so of course like any
programming language the first thing
that we can do with our programming is
just very basic math function so if we
do something like 12 + 8 what we can do
is we can type that equation and hit run
and as you can see it gives us the
result in the console 12 + 8 this was
our code the result is 20 so we can do
something like um 12 times 80 or 64 and
whenever you want to multiply I'm just
teaching you guys if you guys
no idea about a program before I know a
lot of you guys probably know this but
multiplication is that little asterisk
above the 8th division is that forward
slash and of course we can - is as well
so now if we run that we can see 12
minus 64 is negative 52 so let's go
ahead and clear that console and right
now you guys can see that whenever my
cursor is on the line and I hit run it's
going to run that single line but if I
highlight both lines or multiple lines
actually let me just go ahead and type
something like 32 times 54 and also 87
divided by whatever that is so we know
how to run one line by putting our
cursor on that line and clicking run but
also the cool thing about our studio is
if you highlight multiple lines and
click this Run button right here then
what's going to happen is your entire
selection of code that you highlighted
it's all going to run so some time that
that's necessary in other times you know
it's just cool to run multiple lines at
once but that's how you do it so let me
just go ahead and clear the console and
delete this as well and the last thing I
want to point out is that I this is
basically like math program is just a
lot like reading a math problem whenever
you want to run one operation before the
other you can use parentheses as well so
if you want to do 543 plus whatever that
is and then multiply it by 7 we're going
to go ahead and stick this operation in
parentheses first so it's going to add
this up and then times the sum of that
by 7 so let's just go ahead and run that
and this is our outcome right here so
again that's the pee-mis I think it's
like pee Moss whatever parentheses
exponents multiplication and addition
subtraction or PEMDAS you know I forgot
the D there zing anyways um so that's
the very basics of how you run a very
simple program in our studio again
coding up here result down here pretty
friggin easy so in the next video I
think we're ready to move on
then a little more complex so I'll see
you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
