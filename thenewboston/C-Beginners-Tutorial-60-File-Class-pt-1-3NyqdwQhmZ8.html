tutorial that I'm making for the New
Boston and in this tutorial I'm going to
be showing you how to use the file class
a little bit so all you're going to need
for this tutorial is a button and a few
lines of code and once you have the
button on your form let's go ahead and
double click on it you're going to need
an open file dialog and you're also
going to and if statement checking to
see if the user actually selects the
file in the open file dialog you're
going to need to be using the system
Daioh namespace because the file class
is located in there so once you have
this all typed out let's go ahead and do
the file dot and then you can see all
the methods inside of the file class now
previously in other tutorials such as
when we went over the binary reader and
writer and the screen reader and writer
we use methods like create and open read
and open to write well today we're going
to be going over the exists method so
I'll just do file that exists and then
this method calls for a path to this our
path to the file that you want to check
to see if it exists or not so we're
going to check to see if the file that
the user opens in the Open File dialog
exists so we're going to go up the file
name so once again this will just check
to see if the file that the user opens
in the Open File dialog exists so we're
just going to display the result of that
in message box so that the user can see
we're going to do mess box show result
of this and sense this return to rule
we're going to have to use the docking
string method to convert it into a
string so now I need you both click this
button to get an open file dialog and
now we can on select a file to check to
see if it exists in our so open and yep
the file does exist and well of course
it exists because we just open it your
the file dialog so the file exists
method isn't really used when you're
using Open File dialog it's usually used
when you're not sure if the file exists
so say we are looking for the settings
file or a specific file on someone's
computer well you're not
use it with an open file dialog instead
you're going to like type out the path
to the file so we're just going to do C
slash users yep users slash Adam and
we're just going to do a text document
see if like some random text document
this text check and sense a file that
this name doesn't exist in the Adam
folder we should get false
and since we're we already throw it out
the path we don't need this open file
dialog so just go ahead and comment that
out so now I need to go up here and
click on this button we should get false
in a message box because this file does
not do this you have false that file
does not exist so the next method I'm
going to be showing you how to use is
the delimiter method and the delete
method will simply delete the file so
we're just going to view file dot delete
and this will just simply like I said
delete a file and we're just going to
have it delete the file that the user
opens in the open file dialog so we're
going to do ofg dot file name because
this method just simply calls for a path
to the file that you want to delete and
since this is a void we cannot display
it in a message box so it's not people
haven't believed that message box out
there so now whatever file that we open
an open file dialog will be deleted so
we're going to go ahead here and open to
leave this text document right here
should now be deleted so if we're to go
back and browse that folder again text
document 2 should not be there anymore
it was gone so that's it for this
tutorial
in the next tutorial we're going to be
getting into the file class a little bit
more so see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
