brake oh yeah now the parking brake is
actually going to go right in between
the two seats right next to the shifter
and it actually works pretty much the
same way the hydraulic brakes work it
just doesn't manually by hand instead of
using your foot oh and by the way look
at this my dumb cat just pooped in my
garage and he was too lazy to cover it
up just anything like supposed to roll
that in kitty litter or something look
at that means like yeah I'm too lazy to
I got stuff to do I'm just going to roll
in kitty litter tomorrow
I just thought let us think for now
goodnight so it's probably going to be
the easiest to start with the back of
the parking brake so go ahead and grab
the back looks like this and now the
first thing you want to do is put this
little nub where it connects the brake
now of course this brake is the one
that's on the passenger side rear of the
go-kart and you can tell where you want
to slide it because there's a little
slit now on yours it may be on the back
end but mine it's on the outside end so
it's easy to find now go ahead and slide
that towards the front now you can see
they can move around it's not going to
fall out now what you want to do now is
slide the cable through this other slit
now this slit right here is where you're
going to make all your adjustments and
what you want to do is there are two
bolts that come on your parking brake
one of them you want to make sure is on
one side one of them you want to make
sure is on the other side this is the
main one you do the adjustment with so
again like I said slide that cable
through and now feed that bolt through
now later on when we fine-tune
everything we're going to get this
adjusted perfectly but for now just go
ahead and slide it all the way to the
top now the reason you do this is
because we didn't put the other side of
the parking brake on the handle side
that goes to make doing seats so in
order to make sure we have enough cable
we want to get this as loose as possible
before we make any adjustments just for
installation purposes now the point of
this knot is just to keep everything
tight so go ahead and tighten that up
and now check it out it's good to go so
you see how this is a looser right here
I'm just going to show you guys
how to adjust this right now while I'm
here if this is loosen if the handle was
already installed and what you would do
is you would unscrew this a little bit
tighten this one up a little bit until
this gets a little bit tighter so that's
how you adjust it but for now I'm just
going to loosen the back up not worry
about it because we've got the parking
brake or the handle side to take care of
now now to install that handle section
of your parking brake go ahead and bolt
to end with the two bolts that you got
with your parking brake one of those in
the front and one goes in the back
alright now that the handle is securely
bracketed on your frame what you want to
do now is loosen all of the adjustment
bolts as loose as you can go and this is
just so we make sure that everything
gets into place before start tightening
things now take the cable and loop it
around this little loop and for this
bolt right here what you need to do is
again just like the back make sure you
have one knot on one side stick your
bolt through there we go and then you
can tighten that nut up if I can prick
and get it on the bolt there we go just
like that
now is where you make all your
adjustments so make your adjustments and
usually you want to use wrenches for
these budgets tighten them by hand for
demonstration go ahead and adjust this
one first
and then go ahead and adjust this one
and once you have your back one adjusted
this is good to go now use this parking
brake pull it up and you'll know that
it's tight enough because when it's
fully tight you'll see in the back that
that's when it hits the very end and
you'll be able to feel the tension on it
but anyways that's how you install a
parking brake so in the next tutorial
what are we going to do I think we're
going to install the tire so it sounds
pretty cool see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
