welcome to your third java tutorial now
in this story only showing you guys how
to download something called a IDE where
we're going to be writing our Java code
so again there's one more last thing I
need you guys download I promise and
then we're actually going to be start
program in Java so I'm in the less it's
order I showed you guys how to create a
program in any notepad or any text
editor and how you can run it from your
command line but the only problem with
this and it's kind of a big problem
whenever you have program like this in a
regular text editor and say you have
like a thousand line program whenever
you try to compile it and run it if
something is wrong with it you have no
idea what's wrong and you don't even
know where to look
therefore it's sometimes useful to get a
better editor just for Java made
specifically so that's why we need to
down something download something called
I de and I'm going to show you guys how
to do that right now go ahead and open
up your internet browser and go ahead
and click eclipse.org in eclipse is
pretty much a special text editor for
only Java so once this loads go ahead
and on the main page you're going to see
something called downloads go ahead and
click downloads now this is going to
give you a couple on downloads to click
from what you want is either the first
one or the second one I got the first
one just because it includes a little
more and go ahead and if you're on
Windows go ahead and click Windows and
what this is going to do is it's going
to download um an Eclipse IDE and that's
pretty much arm pretty much the text
editor for Java I'll show you guys what
it is in a little bit but where it's
going to be is if you go to computer and
then go to whatever wherever your
downloads are you're going to have
something called a zip folder what you
need to do is extract you're going to
have a folder like this right here we
need to do is right-click it and press
extract all then once you click extract
all it's going
give you a little wizard once you
extract all that information you're
going to get a regular folder like this
this is pretty much like a compressed
stuff and get all the information that
you need to extract it that's what you
do with any zip folder by the way now
once you have your regular folder you
can double click it and now your Eclipse
program is in this and it's the little
one that says application with a little
Eclipse logo next to it and what I did
is I right clicked it and I created a
shortcut or you can press send a desktop
and this gives you instead of having to
go through your computer hard drive you
have a nice little shortcut on your
computer right here where you can just
click it and start writing Java programs
so again it's just a basic download I
just want to show you guys walk you
through a little bit but once you do all
that you have the Eclipse program on
your computer so double click that and
your Eclipse program starts running just
select a default workspace anyone is
fine and what this program does is allow
you to edit code so in another cool
thing about this it has a compiler built
right into it so we can just run our
code right from the same program you
don't have to mess around in the command
line so what we need to do first is go
ahead and press file new project or Java
project doesn't matter one go ahead and
press a Java project now you need a
project name I'm going to name my Bucky
and go ahead and press next and then go
ahead and press finish you probably
could press finish but now you have a
project named Bucky and it just puts
everything into a project so you can if
you're working on like a different Java
thing for a different company but for
here we're only going to be working with
one project so we only needed to do that
once next you have a project called
Bucky on the left hand side of your
screen and go ahead and press this
little arrow and it D collapses or
expands this little pain and you're
going to see something called a JRE
system library and a source we want to
work with the source file so go ahead
and right click this
and press new class since we want to
create if you remember everything is in
class in Java so go ahead and click this
and you got a neighbor class something
go ahead and I'm going to name mine
apples and go ahead and press finish now
as you can see it already starts writing
the code for us
public class now I'm not going to be
teaching you how to write code in this
tutorial I already have a class named
apples from last tutorial so I'm just
pretty much I just wanted to eat you
guys set up an eclipse in this tutorial
so um let me go ahead and paste a
program I already wrote it's the same
program I wrote in the last tutorial and
now once you have a program I'm just
going to show you guys how to run it and
then next story I'm showing you how to
write a thing how to run programs in
Eclipse what you do is press this little
circle with a triangle in it and that
says run and if you go ahead and press
that what your program does is just go
ahead and run as java application go
ahead and click OK
ok and down here it just runs your
program so that saves you a ton of time
from saving it finding the path going in
command line this is about eight
thousand times easier than using a
command line so again follow those
instructions and I want to show you guys
one more reason why this is useful in
the command line in notepad if we had an
error then it would just mess up in a
wouldn't tell us what's wrong in this
one say instead a system where you wrote
cysts something like that that isn't a
valid code so whenever we try to run
this and press ok it says error error
exists and then down here it says all
right where does it exist on line three
right here so you go one two three
here's where your error is
BAM you know exactly where is and what
you need to fix
so again eclipse is a really powerful
tool and that's the last thing I wanted
to teach you guys and now we are finally
ready to learn the java language
so now that you have done all that make
sure to check out my next tutorial or
i'm going to be teaching you all this
crap
finally means and finally how to write
the Java of language in syntax so again
I want to thank you guys for watching I
thank you guys for sticking with me
running all of these programs and
getting java set up I know it's pain in
the butt but thank you guys and again
make sure to subscribe my channel thanks
for watching I'll see you next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
