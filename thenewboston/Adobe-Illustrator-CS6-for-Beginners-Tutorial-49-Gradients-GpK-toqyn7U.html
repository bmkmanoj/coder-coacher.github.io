another Illustrator cs6 tutorial my name
is buddy today we're gonna learn how to
apply gradients and I'll tell you a
little bit about them so gradients are
going from one color to another or going
from one color to several and blending
the way in between and gradients are
used all the time in art and graphics
and all that stuff
so it's a good idea to know how to use
them so we're gonna start out just go
ahead and make a square and I'm gonna
put this back out to what it was to
something some color and I'm just gonna
go ahead and create my square and the
other thing I'm going to create is a
line segment and this line segment is
only gonna have a stroke on it and
that's what we got there okay all right
so now what we need to do is just go
ahead and apply our new gradient that we
want to use so we go into the swatches
panel make sure your object is selected
go into the swatches panel and then you
might have some gradients already on
here if you do you can go ahead and
select one of those it'll create one of
those or you can go into the gradient
library click on this button here on the
bottom left of the swatches panel and
then come down to gradients and then you
get a whole bunch of things that you can
use so let's go to something like metals
and click on this to get some different
metal color and so on now there is a
gradient panel which is right here I
click on
I hit some more options for my gradient
I can choose to use the fill or the
stroke as a gradient and since this box
has no stroke on it I'm gonna have to
use fill I'm gonna click I can click on
the gradient
I've got gradient type here linear or
radial and then I've got my angle I can
change the angle if I want to and then
right here is reverse gradient and then
I'll just switch the gradient back and
forth let's select our line segment here
that's only basically a stroke I'll put
this Grady on there what I'm gonna have
to do is switch to here to the stroke
and then I'm gonna have to go ahead and
apply one of the swatches to it
now I've got my Grady on there I can go
down to my gradients panel and start
messing around in here with a stroke now
we've got a couple different things here
we've got apply gradient within stroke
apply gradient a long stroke or apply
grain across stroke so if you click on
these they could do certain things but
it's not really in this one if I apply a
stroke to this we might be able to see
it a little better so I just made a huge
stroke and you can see that the gradient
is working differently the way I click
these strokes here so the next thing
that we can check out is how we create
our own gradients you can do this in
this gradient panel here so I'm gonna
try to see if I can make this a little
bigger yep there we go so that way we
can see it better
and what you're gonna do is we're on
this gradient slider you can move these
sliders over to move where the gradient
colors are all right double click on the
color I can go ahead and change it if I
need to there's purple
and I double-click on this one I could
maybe make that purple and should be
able to switch these yep
and that's how you create your gradients
if you have one of these and you don't
want it on there just click and hold on
it and pull it off and it'll come off so
I could pull these off if I wanted to
and now I've just got a straight
gradient going on there if I want to add
more colors you see the mouse turns into
a plus it has a plus sign next to if I
click that it's gonna add a spot where I
can add another color in there and there
I can do it now we've got these little
diamonds at the top if I click those and
move them around it's going to increase
the amount of color that I'm getting
from one side or the other if I move it
to the right more purple is going to
dominate the gradient if I move it to
the left left less purple and more
oranges Brown is going to dominate the
gradient same with this side so maybe I
only want just like some small line here
in the middle that's how I can do it so
that's how you go ahead and create your
gradients we learned how to use the
library of gradients up here so there's
gonna be there's a whole bunch of
gradients that you can use and then we
can pick gradients from the swatches and
apply them and that's pretty much it
using gradients is pretty cool and if
there's anything else I should go over
oh and I can't forget that we probably
want to show you the gradient tool which
is right here and the hotkey is G click
on that then you want to go into view
real quick and make sure that this says
you want it to say hide raining gradient
annotator you want it because that way
it's going to show so click on the
gradient that you want to edit and then
the gradient annotator will come
now it's just like using the gradient
editor that we looked at before you can
drag this here to make to move the part
of the gradient and move the colors
around we've got the squares here where
we can increase the color these are kind
of like the diamonds we can move the
gradient using these edges here we can
hover over the right side here and when
it turns into a box we can drag and
it'll make the gradient smaller and
effli when it turns into a circular we
can move the gradient so it slants or
whatever we're doing there so that's how
I use the gradient tool it's a handy
pretty cool now you guys know all about
using it you can use it on stroke you
can use it on fill and that's it so
thanks a lot for watching give a thumbs
up if you liked the video and learn some
new stuff and otherwise you guys have a
great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
