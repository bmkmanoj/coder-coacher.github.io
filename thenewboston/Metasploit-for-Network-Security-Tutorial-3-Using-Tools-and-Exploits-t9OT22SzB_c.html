you to test the security of their
website and make sure that there's no
vulnerabilities or whatever then what
you're usually going to do first is
you're just going to go to their website
with you know just through a browser
nothing unusual and you're just going to
start clicking around and getting a real
brief overview of what the website is
all about and this is called
intelligence-gathering and it's not just
the website but you also probably want
to check out their social media accounts
their facebook their twitter and it just
helps give you a general idea of you
know some background of the company now
another thing that I always recommend is
running a simple Whois of their website
domain so if I run a Whois of the New
Boston com
then what this is is it gives you some
real basic information of the domain
name in whoever registered the domain
name if they didn't choose who is domain
privacy then it's going to give you a
bunch of personal information about them
that you can use but it's going to give
you their name who they registered it
through and some basic info so check
that out now another thing that you
probably want to do is you need to get
the IP address of their website so a lot
of tools that we're going to use later
on you just can't use the domain name
like the New Boston com
but if you type host the new boston.com
and hit enter then it's going to give
you the IP address of the web server so
all the tools arm even if they can use
the domain name you should always put
the IP address so that way you know
exactly what device you're targeting so
that's how you get the IP address now
from here what I like to do is I like to
run a simple n Maps game now again all
of this what I'm teaching you right now
this isn't Metasploit specific this is
just intelligence gathering so we can
get the info that we need to properly
use the tools in Metasploit it's kind of
a tongue twister Metasploit later on so
let me just run this real quick and map
minus F and hopefully you guys watch my
nmap tutorials
and let me actually do it for this now
before this tutorial series
I just bought like I said a real crappy
five-dollar web server so I know the IP
address of this is 40 5.50 5.2 48 208
actually let me copy that so I don't
have to type it again so now what I want
to do is I want to run a quick end map
scan and all this does is it tells me
what services are running on the server
what ports are open gives me a real you
know broad overview of it so now I can
see okay
they have FTP and by day I actually mean
me because it's my server and they also
have SSH and they also have HTTP so we
can tell by HTTP that they're probably
hosting a website on this which is true
and some attack points are probably HTTP
or excuse me FTP and SSH so let's go
ahead and see if there are any
Metasploit vulnerabilities or exploits
that we can fight it related to SSH
first now I happen to know that there is
an exploit that you can use and it tells
you the version of SSH that you're using
so I'm just going to write search SSH
underscore version now you can actually
just search SSH and it's going to pop up
I already know the name of the exploit
so I'm just going to hit enter and it's
going to say okay so these are all the
exploits related to SSH version and the
one that I'm looking for is just this
just a real basic SSH version scanner so
let me go ahead and copy the name of
this and again what we're trying to do
here is we just want to get what version
of SSH is running on their server so
then we can go on Google and find if
there are any vulnerabilities with that
version maybe they didn't update it in a
while and then well it could be very bad
for that company so I want to get more
info about that right there so I'm going
to hit enter and it says all right I
don't really care who made it pretty
cool that they did though and this tool
detects the SSH version
boom roasted that's exactly what I'm
looking for so let me clear out of here
and now that I decided I want to use
this tool I'm just going to write use
this tool and now I'm in now in order to
use this tool we actually need to give
it some more information now if you
right show options and you can right
show options for every single tool and
right after you choose to use the tool
this is the very first command that you
should always type show options what
this is going to do is say ok this is
the additional information that I need
some of it is required so for example
the IP address we need to type in
obviously because it needs to know what
device the target some other arm
variables may be optional like um I
don't know like if you want to target
multiple ones or just something like you
know weird settings that you can have
but right now it says ok this tool
requires 4 pieces of information now
three of these have been set by us they
give a default value so the default pour
of SSH is 22 we're just going to use one
thread and if we are attacking like
multiple devices like 30 different ones
then we may want to bump it up to like
20 or 30 threads but right now we're
just going to run this attack on one
server so we can just use one thread it
doesn't really matter and the timeout as
well now it also requires another piece
of information and that's actually the
IP address of my server so that's the
target and it says um
address range because you can actually
use this on a range of you know let's
say you're targeting entire network as
well but we're not so we don't have to
worry about that so in order to set the
setting of our host then we just type
set our host and it has autocomplete so
if you just start typing it and hit tab
it's going to complete and then we need
to set the IP address which is 45 dot
55.2 48.2 o8 so hit enter and it says
okay we now set the IP address
of the server you want to target to that
now if you're right show options again
you can see that that setting has now
been set so re this is the IP address
this is what port we want to use this is
how many threads and the timeout looks
good and by the way you can overwrite
these settings as well so say that we
actually wanted to use five threads for
some reason then we can set threads to
five show options and look at that
threats the five Simplenote so let me
clear out of there and now that all of
our settings are taken care of all we do
is we write run now hit enter and the
tool is going to run so again the output
is displayed right after you type it and
all this tool did is it gave us the
version of SSH at running so depending
on what tool you use of course the
outputs going to be different but now we
got some real basic information okay
they're using Linux pretty cool they're
running a boon to and this is the
version right there so pretty sweet and
that ladies and gentlemen is the basics
of how you use a simple tool and if you
ever want to go back like I said just
like back and now we're back to home
base so again whenever you want to use a
tool search for it get info about it if
you want and type use and then the name
of the tool and then set all of your
options and then hit run and that's
basically how it's going to work for
every single exploit um there are some
weird things for some different exploits
but that's the basics of it so in the
next couple tutorials we're going to go
over some practical usages usages little
and uh yeah I'm going to be showing you
guys how to crack a ftp password and you
know some other cool stuff it's going to
be awesome
see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
