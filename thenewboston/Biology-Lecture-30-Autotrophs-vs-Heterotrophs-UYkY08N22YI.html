tutorial and in this video I want to
talk to you guys about
autotrophs and heterotrophs now of
course we already know that all
organisms all living things on earth
need food for energy however what
biologists did is they categorized the
different types of organisms based on
how they obtained their food so of
course we get food different than how
plants for example get food so an
autotroph would be like a plant and of
course plants get food through process
called photosynthesis and we're going to
be talking about this later on but it's
not even that specific autotrophs are
just organisms organisms that make their
own food and of course a heterotroph
would be the opposite of that
heterotrophs mean--you we just can't you
know get energy from the Sun and you
know make your own food would be nice
but we eat other organisms so this would
pretty much be any animal so of course
one more time what biologists did is
they categorized organisms based on how
they obtain their food they categorize
them into two different categories
autotrophs and these would be things
like plants and algae that make their
own food through process called
photosynthesis and you know me my dog
all other animals we eat other organisms
and by organisms I mean other plants
other animals that's how we obtain our
food as a source of energy so now that
you know I cover that let me go ahead
and detail and discuss photo synthesis
how come every word in biology is like
80 years long anyways so here is the
quick you know 1/2 a photosynthesis say
that we have a plant right here and it's
getting pretty hungry and need some
energy it needs to create its own food
well the ingredients needed for
photosynthesis are pretty simple but let
me
go ahead and draw them out the first
ingredient needed is energy from the Sun
so let me just go ahead and put an e
right there the second ingredient needed
is carbon dioxide now carbon dioxide is
of course a molecule in whenever a plant
needs carbon dioxide it just finds it in
the air in the environment and the last
ingredient it needs is water now water
is usually stored in the ground and
that's why you know plants have roots to
get that but sometimes when it's really
dry out then it can actually wait for it
to rain and that's of course why it dies
if it doesn't rain for a long amount of
time but basically those are the three
ingredients needed for photosynthesis
energy from the Sun carbon dioxide and
water from the ground now what happens
during this process is whenever it
obtains the water molecule from the
ground your plant uses the hydrogen from
it but the oxygen it doesn't really need
so that's why it gives off the oxygen
whenever it breaks up this water
molecule so gives off oxygen that's why
people say that plants give off oxygen
and humans give off carbon dioxide will
talk about why humans give off carbon
dioxide later on but for right now this
is the really really quick and basic
summary of photosynthesis in order for a
plant to make food it needs energy from
the Sun carbon dioxide in water from
either the rain or if it rain already
it's in the ground and whenever it
obtains that water molecule to break
apart it gives off oxygen because it's
mostly concerned with a hydrogen now of
course humans in animals they don't go
through photosynthesis me in you in my
dog we can't just turn the Sun into food
it would be nice but you know it doesn't
happen instead we use a process called
let me change my color here cellular
respiration now what happens in cellular
respiration is humans use oxygen to
break up food now I already talked to
guys a little bit about this process
later on I mean earlier on but basically
whenever we use oxygen in of course we
breathe oxygen from the environment to
break up food what happens is this food
releases energy and it stores it in a
molecule in our cells called a TP now if
you guys don't understand what ATP is
watch my last video but basically ATP
gives us cells energies or energy that
they can use and whenever your cell uses
energy so I'll just go ahead and write
this would be of course the cell using
energy it gives off a byproduct of
carbon dioxide and water let me go draw
my water is blue and water which of
course is h2o so of course cellular
respiration is the process that we go
through to obtain energy from food and
this food would be plants or animals or
any other organisms that we consume or
eat so whenever we turn that food into
ATP the process of you know giving
energy or cells creating energy gives
off co2 which is carbon dioxide and
water so that's why we say that human
beings whenever they you know they
pretty much give off carbon dioxide and
plants give off oxygen now take a note
of this in order for plants to create
food they need carbon dioxide which
humans and animals give off and in order
for animals to make food they need
oxygen which is a byproduct of
photosynthesis so as you can see it's
pretty cool that it's nice and balanced
and then the next sort of what I'm going
to do is I'm going to show you guys the
exact chemical formula of photosynthesis
and cellular respiration and you guys
are going to see how perfect and how
awesome imbalanced life is here on earth</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
