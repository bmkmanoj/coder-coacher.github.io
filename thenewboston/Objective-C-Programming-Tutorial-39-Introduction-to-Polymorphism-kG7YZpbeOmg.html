objective-c tutorial and in this
tutorial I'm going to be talking about
polymorphism now my guess is that you
probably heard polymorphism before and
you heard it's one of the most confusing
topics in objective oriented programming
but trust me it's not especially when
I'm teaching T because I'm gonna make it
real simple real easy crystal clear so
the first thing we're going to need to
do is I went ahead and we're starting
from a blank program the only thing I
typed in already is you know all the
housekeeping stuff so let's go ahead and
add some new classes so go ahead right
click source add new file and go ahead
and let me show you what guys what I'm
doing here go ahead and click Next and
I'm gonna have a numbers class in the
characters class name the numbers class
like nums or something like that finish
and now we have a header for our numbers
class so first of all we want to import
from foundation and you see what time it
is say 38 so now I know when I run out
of time all right so go ahead and import
from a foundation tighten this up a bit
that's what she said and for your
interface for your numbers class let's
just go ahead and add three variables
and num1 and num2 and int answer what
we're gonna be doing is adding number
one and number two and getting an answer
in case you were curious so let's go
ahead and make three methods the first
one will be void set numbers to give
them you know a value but of course we
need to do int a and you know I guess
you can see what's going on here and B
let me see if that looks good yep looks
good me and now let's go ahead and add
an add method to add them together it's
not gonna take any parameters just gonna
add them and let's go ahead and void
print to print out some
so let me make sure that looks good set
numbers not too bad to tell you the
truth not bad at all so let's go ahead
and copy these right here and in our
implementation file first of all get rid
of all these comments because I hate
them and place it all and to set the
numbers what we want to do is just go
ahead and set number one remember that's
a variable we have in our class set that
equal to a what we pass in and num to
set that equal to be the value that we
pass in and when we want to add them
together all we have to do is take that
answer variable that third variable and
set it equal to num 1 plus num2 pretty
cool way and for the print let's just go
ahead and print out something crazy
let's go ahead and NS log this stuff
right here and one my computer just make
a sound not cool not cool so let's go
ahead and NS log be like I am from the
numbers class biatch and then just go
ahead and you know explanation point
with emphasis % I and let's just go
ahead and print out the answer so pretty
odd classes we got going on right now
but you know I just want to demonstrate
you know a couple simple things so don't
forget in this class we have a set
numbers method that takes two method
that takes two arguments and set some
equal to numbers add a method which
pretty much since answer equal to the
sum of num1 num2 and print method that
prints everything out so now that we
have that good to go
let's go ahead and create a new class
add new file next and name this one
charge with Z I don't like to name it my
class is like numbers or characters
because I mean there might be a built-in
method already so I like to you know no
one's gonna build a method that includes
Z at the end besides me so that's why I
like to do this so let's go ahead
foundation
and foundation there we go and interface
that interface looks good so far
so for our interface let's just have two
variables chart and I guess I didn't
even mention this before a char is
pretty much a character like W or B
that's all it is so that's what class
we're going to be working with two
variables in here char C one char C two
and let's just go ahead and add three
methods void set chars and we're gonna
be using a similar name go ahead and put
add and print so now you're already
seeing one thing right now all right we
have three methods in each class than
nums and the chars but look two methods
have the same name they both have ADD
and print oh I see so uh you know this
can get confusing potentially later down
the line
so let's anyways that's what we're gonna
be talking about so copy and in your
implementation file control V all you
want to do is set the characters and to
do that let's go ahead and put like c1
equal to and make sure you put it in
single quotes put it equal to any
capital letter you want like B and C to
equal to W that looks good it doesn't
really matter your letters and for add
what we want to do is let's just have a
NS log print statement and let's just go
ahead and add these letters together so
% I is for working with integers and % c
is for working with characters so let's
go ahead and print out two characters
right next to each other that are going
to be C 1 and C 2 or B W so B W should
appear whenever we call this method now
for our print statement let's just go
ahead and my
NS log NS logs nice and it's Lincoln
Logs I ramble a lot so let's go ahead
and print out back I am from the chars
class mofo wasn't chars a pokémon
Charmander or something
Charizard I can't remember but anyways
I'll show you what's going on right here
make sure we got everything set good to
go so what we did in this tutorial is we
built two classes we built a numbers
class that had three variables and add
in the print method and we built a
character class that had two variables
and add in the print method huh so
whenever we go in our main method and
try to call that add and print method
how's it gonna know won't one to pick
and we're probably going to get a ton of
errors or are we bump-bump all and leave
into the next tutorial so that's what
we're gonna be talking about in the next
tutorial and that is pretty much
polymorphism again I know I explained
nothing just type a bunch of code in
this tutorial the next sort was all the
explaining and all how everything works
and what polymorphism is so thank you
guys for sticking with me and make sure
to check out the next tutorial for our
continuation of this program and for an
awesome explanation of polymorphism so
don't forget if you want the source code

see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
