tutorial that I'm making for the new
Boston and in this tutorial we're going
to continue looking at if statements so
all you're going to need for this
tutorial is a button and a checkbox and
once you have both of these on your form
just go ahead and double click on the
button alright so in the previous
tutorial we learnt how to set up an if
statement so let's just create an if
statement checking to see if user check
the checkbox so we're going to say gift
and then check box one so for our check
box and then we're going to want to see
if it's checked property is equal to
true and the checked property is
basically just a pool indicating whether
the user has checked the checkbox now
we're going to say you have check box
one dot check equals true then we're
just going to have a message box show
saying the check box is checked so nice
box to show I'm just going to stay right
here check box is check all right so
let's just go how to debug and see if
this works
all right so currently the check box is
in check so when we flip this button we
shouldn't get a message box but when we
do check this check box we should
because if check box one got checked
equals true well it's checked so then
we're going to get that message box yep
all right and there's actually an easier
way of writing this so since this is a
pool we can just go ahead and delete
this equal equals true and doing this
just if check box one check is the same
as saying if checkbox one check two
equal equals true so let's just go ahead
and debug and see if it works the same
so currently the check box isn't checked
so we shouldn't get this message box let
me click the button nope but when we do
check the check box and click the button
we should get a message box saying the
check box is checked because if the
check box is checked and we'll get a
message box saying the check box is
checked
all right but what if you wanted to say
if check box will not check equals false
well what you can do is just put an
exclamation point right at the beginning
and this is the exact same as saying
check box 1 dot checked equals false so
since the check box isn't checked at the
moment we should get a message box yep
the checkbox is checked then we won't
get a message box because if checkbox
one isn't checked then we're going to
get a message box but if it is checked
then we won't all right and you can do
this with any pool so if we were to go
ahead right here and just create our own
pool let's call it cool my cool and
study keep in touch so we can just say
gif and then my pool then we're just
going to have a message box show saying
true say right here my rule is true all
right
so if my bool is true this is just the
same thing as saying if my pool equals
true then we're going to get a message
box and since my pool is equal to true
then we're going to get a message box
yep but if we wanted to check to see if
my ghoul is equal to false we would just
put an exclamation point or right before
my Google right there so this is just
saying if my bool equals false then we
just want to get a message box saying my
ghoul is fast all right so let's just go
ahead and debug and see if this works
and yep since my ghoul isn't false it's
equal to true and we didn't get that
message box but if we were to go back
here and set my Google put false then
we'll get that message box yep all right
perfect okay and a few more things here
I'm going to show you is dealing with
integers so let's just go ahead right
here and create a few integers so int I
equals 3 and B equals 6 and and C equals
0 all right so let's just go ahead here
and create a couple if statements check
in the C which is greater than the other
so we can just go ahead right here and
say if I is greater than C then we'll
just have a message box show saying if I
is greater than C
I is greater than C all right so
basically what this is doing here is
it's checking to see if integer I is
greater than integer C and since I is
equal to 3 is 3 greater than 0 yes it is
so we're going to get a message box
saying I is greater than C yep I is
greater than C and you could just put a
number here if you wanted to so if we
wanted to see if I is greater than 2 is
I greater than 2 well yes it is so we're
going to get a message box if we put is
I greater than 6 no it's not so I mean
we're so I'm not going to get a message
box and we could also do less than so is
I less than 6 yes it is so now we're
going to get a message box yep and you
can compare other integers as well so if
we wanted to say is I less than B and
since B is equal to 6 you'll get this
message box yep perfect all right and
there's also something called on less
than or equal to so if you just put an
equal sign here it's the same saying
it's the same as saying if I is less
than or equal to B then we're going to
message box so if you just debug here is
I less than or equal to B yes it is but
B is equal to 6 so if we were to just
put a 6 here we'd say if 6 is less than
or equal to B then we should get a
message box since 6 is equal to B we'll
get a message box yep what if we were to
just do regular is 6 less than B no it's
not because there's the same yeah we
won't get a message box and you can also
do greater than or equal to so is 6
greater than or equal to B well it's
equal to B so we should get a message
box yep and if we were to pull like 100
here is a hundred greater than or equal
to B 100 is greater than 6 so we're
going to get a message box all right so
those are pretty simple it's not really
much explaining to do on those but
that's
much it for this tutorial so see you
