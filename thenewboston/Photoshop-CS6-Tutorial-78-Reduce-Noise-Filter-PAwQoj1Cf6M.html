Photoshop cs6 tutorial my name is buddy
Blackford and I'm gonna teach you how to
use the reduced noise filter and the
reduced noise filter just does exactly
what it says reduces noise in an image
and what noise is is pretty much just
random pixels of color that come in when
you are compressing an image or when you
are using something like a scanner or a
sometimes some of the crappier digital
cameras that it'll add in this extra
extra pixels on top that reduce the
quality of the image now we're gonna
show you how to reduce that kind of
stuff
now for example I think the part in this
image that has a lot of noise in it is
this ceiling up here now if i zoom in
into the image you can see that there is
a pretty decent amount of noise in this
section here you can see a bunch of
colors that are weird and some
blockiness and stuff like that we're
gonna get that out of there
so the first thing you want to do so we
can do comparisons and stuff like that
create a new layer just by duplicating
your current layer and we're going to go
to filter we're going to go to the noise
section we're going to go to reduce
noise now mine showed up with these
default settings here
but if you want to you can just bring
them all back to zero maybe bring the
strength up a one so you can mess with
the preserve details I'll bring that to
zero also so let's just start by coming
down into these the sliders area the
strength is the amount you want the
reduced noise filter to to be applied to
the image affects the luminance values
which is the also which is also called
luminosity and if you you may need to
look that up if you really need to but
it's kind of like the brightness a
little bit so the next one we've got
here
what'swhat's add bring this up here and
the key to using the reduce noise is to
balance it in a way that it reduces a
noise but without adding a whole ton of
other kind of like junk into your image
and I'll show you that preserve details
brings out the small details in the
inside the like small parts of the image
so like maybe like this little wisp
that's coming off my hat there or some
of the stuff in the background or other
small things in the image so if you if
we bring that up a little bit it'll
preserve some of the details while
taking out some of the noise so
somewhere around sixty fifty to sixty
percent is good for this image if I
brought it up all the way it would
preserve all the little details but it
would keep it keeps the noise in there
so if you'll look at the image here at a
hundred percent and then if I bring it
back down to like fifty percent you can
see that there's a difference reduce
color noises it reduces like random
color pixels that it can find within the
image if you reduce it a whole lot it's
gonna start saturating the image even
more and it doesn't do it as much on
this but image but the strength is also
done kind of in the middle and
everything like that if you go too hard
with this it'll start saturating your
image oh so go somewhere on forty to
sixty as well remember to keep a good
balance
now when you start reducing noise it
reduces some of the image quality a bit
that's where the sharpen details comes
in very handy it'll bring out the extra
details with our image so let's bring
that up and to it something that we that
look somewhat decent if I bring it up
all the way you can see what it does to
the image and it's a little too well
it's way too hard so let's back off
let's bring this up to something like
this
now I'm gonna go over this Advanced tab
with you really quick you go to advance
you're able to go per the different
channels in your image so if I go over
here to the channels tab we've got a red
green and blue channel here and you're
able to adjust these on each one now
each of these is a note has a different
like noise level and I think that
usually blue is the noisiest so if I go
into a per channel you can click and
drag to move around but you can see the
different channels and adjust them the
way that you the way that you need to
just get what you are looking for so you
got green here and then you got blue but
if you really need to adjust those per
channel go ahead and do it that way now
the remove jpg artifact there if you
check this it'll get rid of some of the
artifact in like the blocks and some of
the stuff that comes around and like
crisp edges and stuff like that when you
are saving a low quality resolution JPEG
so I'm gonna uncheck that I'm going to
okay I'm gonna come back to my layers
panel and then I'll just zoom out a
little bit come in a little bit more
forward for you so we can see a little
better and just we'll just check out to
see how much noise has actually been
reduced so I could turn this is with the
noise reduction off so there is no noise
reduction right now and check out the
ceiling check out how noisy it is when I
turn this on it's a lot smoother and has
been reduced some of the noise and you
can see that throughout the image and it
basically is like smoothing everything
out bringing out the noise and it's
pretty useful for trying to make your
images a little nicer now the reduced
noise filter may not always get all the
noise out that you really want see
there's like a little image there you
might want to use some tools like the
patch tool here to fix up some of your
image
Shh let's see how good it does I don't
even think I'm on the patch tool the
patch tool okay I was wondering why I
was painting in but there we go use the
patch tool to like patch up the image
and fix little spots like that so that's
not very looking very good but just keep
that in mind that you can use the
different tools to help further clean up
problem areas in your image the Spot
Healing Brush the patch tool if you
really want to use the clone stamp tool
and other tools like that so that's
that's yeah that's it for how to use the
reduce noise filter use it to sharpen up
your images reduce noise obviously and
it works on interval and I just wanted
to let you know it works on individual
layers and not the entire document so
you've to apply this to each layer that
you want to get the noise out of so just
keep that in mind so thanks for watching
this tutorial I'm glad you guys took the
time to check it out and watch the video
and I'll see you guys in the next video
we're gonna keep on going over different
filters and see how cool all of them are
so see you guys later have a good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
