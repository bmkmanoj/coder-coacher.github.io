ninth toriel and robotics and
electronics and in this tutorial I'm
going to be teaching you guys about
something called LEDs now what LED
stands for is light-emitting diode and
it's pretty much a fancy word for mini
light bulb now here's what they look
like right here you see if I can get it
to zoom in right there that's what they
are and as you can probably tell already
they come in a whole bunch of different
sizes and shapes
now when you're going to look for LEDs
you're going to see something like the
most common type is called t 1 and 3/4
now let me break down and tell you guys
what 2 stands for the T in the most
common name is let me show you guys one
more time it stands for the shape of the
LED now what T means is you see how
these are square or anything they're
kind of bullet shaped that's what the T
means anytime you see a T it means your
LED is going to be bullet shaped now
they also come in different sizes such
as this let me show you guys hopefully
you guys can see that now this is a t1
the smaller one and this is a t1 and 3/4
and what those numbers mean is the sizes
of an LED is measured in 1/8 of an inch
so whenever you see one um or 1/2 3/4
that's in reference to how many eighths
of an inch that is and I know it's a
really odd standard but that's just what
it is can't change it they actually
started putting the millimeters so that
might help you figure out when you're
buying LEDs and stuff like that but
remember remember you see a letter in
the number it's usually the shape and
the size of that diameter now aside from
this there are also different types of
LEDs you have your clear LEDs which is
pretty much the class around it is clear
like glass you'd have in your windows
you have what diffused in what
this means is the class is kind of white
and diffused I don't know if you could
figure that out and it's kind of like
milky or foggy or kind of like wax paper
kinda they can kind of transparent and
lastly the ones I showed you right here
you also have colored and they come in a
bunch of different colors and of course
whenever you see colored it means it's
colored plain simple now the last thing
I want to talk to you guys about before
you go hooking up your LEDs in any
direction they aren't like resistors
root it doesn't matter what end you
connect to what end these have a very
specific positive and negative end and I
know if I told you guys this in any of
the less stores but the negative end is
called the cathode and the positive end
is called the anode now what the kit
well let me show you guys as you guys
can see you have a longer in a shorter
arm what they're called leads in the
shorter one is called the cathode and
that's the negative the longer one which
is right there that's called the anode
and the longer one is the positive in
all LEDs now you guys can't probably see
even with my magnificent zoom in but on
the cathode side which is the negative
when it when you look at this it's going
to look like it's perfectly round but
actually there's a little flat knot
right there on the cathode type and
that's a different way that you can tell
which side is positive and which side is
negative so again the cathode which is
negative is shorter and it has a notch
the anode which is positive is longer no
not round and on the side
so that's your quick tutorial on LEDs um
what you probably want to do is go out
and buy an assortment pack and this
should give you all the LEDs you're
going to work will work with and that'll
give you all that when I'm going through
these tutorials you have a wide
assortment so um that's pretty much it
so in the next tutorial we're actually
going to be building our first circuit
and I'm
teach you guys how to use all the
components I tell you guys about so far
and we're actually going to be letting
these babies up so don't forget to watch
my next tutorial don't forget to
subscribe thank you guys for watching
and I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
