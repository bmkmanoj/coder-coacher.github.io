for its voltage level to see if it's dud
or if it's actually a good battery but
you can't just stick these on your
battery any way you want what you got to
look for is a negative and positive
terminal and this is labeled quite
appropriately by a negative right there
and a positive it's going to be labeled
somewhere on your battery so go ahead
and what you want to do is hook the
black one your black probe up to
negative and just touch it on its tip
anywhere and take your red probe right
here and touch it on the tip that says
positive so again black is negative red
is positive so remember that and touch
it on your tip now I'm going to show you
guys right now with my a digital a
reader show them right now and I will
switch it to you right then now as you
can see whenever I touch those probes
and they're connecting right now my
multimeter shows somewhere between nine
point five two volts that little V if
you can see right down here that means
volts so this is kind of typical that
they give you more votes than expected
and remember that's not a bad thing we
can always limit it it's when you get
below like six or five volts this is
when you usually need to replace your
battery so anywhere around eight or nine
or even a little higher that's what
you're looking for and if you see this
reading it means that you have a good
battery and we are ready to go so thank
you guys for watching make sure to
subscribe and I don't forget to check
out my next tutorial
thanks alright guys now that you know
how to use your multimeter to test your
battery I want to sum up everything and
point out a couple things that you guys
are going to need to know when buying
9-volt batteries there are a couple
different kinds of 9-volt batteries you
can buy you can buy something called
nickel metal hydride and this is a
rechargeable battery these are kind of
expensive but they were chargeable so
you gotta kind of weigh your options
there
I always use basic alkaline batteries
and this is your basic store-brand or
Duracell or energizer and what you don't
want to get is the special batteries
that say lithium or titanium and ultra
or anything I fit these are kind of just
marketing gimmicks and they do have a
little little better performance but for
the cost it's not worth it at all so
just go with your basic alkaline
batteries this here this is going to
give you the best bang for the buck it's
more than powerful and love to do
anything we're going to be building for
now and now that you learn everything
now that you hopefully went and
purchased a nine volt alkaline battery
to power your robot we're ready to move
on to the next component and we now have
power for a robot in our circuit so make
sure to check out the next tutorial and
I'll see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
