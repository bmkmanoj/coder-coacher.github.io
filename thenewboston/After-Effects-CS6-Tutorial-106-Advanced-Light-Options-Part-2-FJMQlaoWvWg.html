light affects this layer so right now I
don't have an ambient light on but I
created one for this parameter here so
I'm going to turn it on and as you see
it's gonna blow out that layer it's
gonna make it really bright now maybe I
don't want the ambient light or ambient
light to affect that layer as much but I
wanted to stay on the back background
layer how much it is I can take down
this ambient on this layer itself and I
could take it off if I want completely
or I can reduce the amount that it
affects it so that's how this parameter
for ambient works I'm gonna turn that
off and if I try to move around the
slider when there's no ambient light on
it does nothing so it only works when
there's ambient there now when you have
a layer it has both diffuse lighting and
specular lighting and these both
combined together help illuminate the
layer so if I turn this to zero the
specular intensity will still help
illuminate the layer I turned that to
both of them to zero it's not going to
be illuminated at all and diffuse is
mainly how much light is allowed in from
the light obviously and if I turn that
two to zero and I turn the specular
intensity specular is the hotspots or
almost like the reflections so that's
what specular intensity looks like at a
hundred percent and you want to use like
a combination of these to get a look
that you're really looking at so fifty
and fifty is their default setting and
you can mess with them individually to
get some cool
looking lighting effects and to
fine-tune it the way you want to the
specular shininess deals with the
specular intensity here and it's mainly
used for I mean when things are metallic
so when you have something that's like
shiny like metal it's gonna have a
smaller hotspot for this specular
intensity so I'm going to turn this
intensity all the way up to 100 so we
can demonstrate this and here is the hot
spot that's going on on our image here
now that seems like it may be a little
too big but we want the specular
intensity to still be at 100 the
specular shininess increases or
decreases the the fall-off of this
hotspot here so if I increase this now
we have the hotspot being decreased and
put more into condensed more into a
condensed area I'm gonna set this back
down to 5% to keep it where it was
before now metal here doesn't have to do
exactly with the object looking metal
like you may think it actually decides
if the color of the specular intensity
there comes from the layer if it's at
100% or from the light if it's at 0% so
if I put this down to zero you can see
that the specular lighting is going to
come from the light and the light that
we have is a completely white light so
if I change the color of this light now
the lighting and the metal that we got
that we turn down to zero is going to be
the color of the light let me change it
to a
different color - probably it illustrate
this a little better not the same color
that what I had so there we go
now oops now if I come down into here
and change it to a hundred again now the
specular lighting is going to come from
the object the color of the object so
those are the all the material options
covered in depth here and how to use
them and just mess around to get the
lighting options that you'll that you
like and when you're working with your
client and you twirl down into the
material options and you start messing
with this stuff they're going to be
impressed because a lot of people don't
use these and it's a mistake that those
people make by just accepting that the
lights only properties can come from the
light itself so use those properties to
your advantage to get ahead in in
whatever you're doing
so you can be ahead of all the other
people that you're working with so I
think thank you for watching the
tutorial and have a good one everybody
thanks for watching again</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
