tutorial and robotics in electronics and
in this tutorial I'm going to be
teaching you guys how to build this
circuit now this is pretty much a
circuit just to light up an LED and just
to show you guys that it is lit up let
me switch it off and on off and on now
what you need for this is of course a
battery your battery cables an LED any
kind will do a resistor any kind of will
do depending on how bright you want your
LED light and of course one jumper water
so with that being said let's get
started alright guys the first thing
that you're going to want to do is go
ahead and take your battery and hook it
up to your wires and you can put it
through the binding posts if you want I
chose to just because it helps stabilize
it but you don't have to but once it's
hooked up the battery go ahead and take
the red wire from your battery the
positive terminal and connect it into
that red bus and go ahead and take that
black one and hook it into the negative
bus and what this does is instead of
having to connect every five holes it
distributes the power the positive power
through here and there returning
negative power through here so that way
we don't have to worry about connecting
each different hole we have an easy
access power strip all along our
breadboard right here so once you have
your power strips the next thing you
want to do is take your resistor let's
see if I can get focused in take your
resistor right there and hook it up from
anywhere on the positive bus to any of
these breadboard breadboard holes so I'm
going to hook mine up right there and
again make sure that one is in the
positive not the negative and one is in
your main breadboard on one of the holes
after that what you want to do is take
your LED light let's see if I can get
this focused maybe not there you go and
remember the longer one is positive so
what I did is bend it because these have
to be
even or else it'll be kind of tilted on
your breadboard so take the bent one
which should be the longer one and
insert it into the one see how this is
inserted into the top hole all alongside
where are all the wires that connect to
it this is actually if you can see if
you ever play battleship these are a
number numbered of 1 2 3 4 5 going down
and F G H I J going left to right
so anything in the first row is going to
connect so let's connect the positive
one to the first row and connect your
negative 1 anywhere else
I'm going to connect my negative 1 to it
J 5 and my positive 1 to J 1 so now we
have electricity phone from the positive
bus to the resistor to the LED light and
now the only thing we need to do is
connect that negative terminal on LED
light to our negative power bus and this
is going to complete the circuit now
once you connect the last jumper wire
right there as you can see my LED light
lit up so let me explain you guys one
more time how this works something it my
trusty pointer pen there we go
the electricity is flowing from this
positive bus and then provides
electricity for anything in this
positive line right here the only thing
connected to is this resistor right here
so the electricity flows through the
resistor and it goes to any of the top
line
now the only thing connected to that top
line is the LED light the positive end
of it and that's what we wanted so it
flows through the positive end of the
LED light through the negative and to
escape it hits this jumper or wire right
here and remember it doesn't connect to
anything else because it's not in the
same row and it hops through the jumper
wire goes back to the negative and
completes the circuit
so that is your first circuit um this is
a very basic circuit we're building more
complex complex ones below so that is
your intro to bread boarding uh stay
tuned for my next tutorials I just want
to thank you guys again for watching
don't forget to subscribe and don't
forget to check out my contests so again
thank you and I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
