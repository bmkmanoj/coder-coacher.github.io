your 49th objective-c tutorial and in
this tutorial we're going to be talking
about the define statement now what the
defined statement is is it's a statement
that usually goes underneath the import
statement right here in your program and
it essentially is built in replacer it
takes something and replaces it with
something else literally it's a way to
define names to constant program values
that's like the definition of it but in
all simplicity what it does is replace
something with something else so like I
said let's go ahead and create an
example right here the syntax for it is
pound define and then go ahead and type
the name you want to use and this is
going to be kind of like a variable
except you can't change it so I'm going
to go ahead and type PI and now you type
what you want every time your program
comes across the word pi what do you
want it to replace with so 3.14159 so
the cool thing about this is you don't
have to cite 3.14159 anymore you can
just type the word pi and it will fill
the rest in for you so let's go ahead
and put this baby to work so let's go
ahead and make a variable called flow X
and flow is just a number that can use
decimal points so set it equal to PI and
this will set it equal to 3.14159 but
let's go ahead and set equal to PI plus
6 so now what this does is before your
program even runs it goes through your
entire program and looks for any
instance of pi and since it's say
alright i saw one right here i'm going
to take this out and change it 3.14159
so now instead of X being equal to
whatever this weird word is it's now
equal to nine point one four one five
nine so let's go ahead and print that
out and another thing I'll tell you in a
second use percent f2a for floats and go
ahead and what we're print out x
building around this and save
and we see print out successfully nine
point one four one five nine zero so as
you can see all define those is it
defines a word that you want to use
instead of a value and before your
programmer one runs it takes out that
word and replaces the value instead
simple enough but check this out even
cooler let me delete all this going to
be typing a bunch of examples in here it
can't only replace one value but it can
also be used in expressions as well so
go ahead and define whoa easy at sign
define two pi
and yeah I know I spelt Pi wrong and you
actually want to capitalize this because
in order to I mean you don't need to but
it's common practice that you want to
capitalize every work because then when
you're looking at a program you can
easily see which are your program
constants and which aren't so I mean as
a general rule you want to capitalize it
so anyways two pi and what do we want to
set it equal to let's just go ahead and
put 3.14159265 times two so now once
you're doing the area which is two PI R
I think that's the area maybe
circumference or something but instead
of having to type this for two pi all
you have to do is type two pi and then
times it by the radius so how easy or a
lot easier than that then typing all
this so what this would do is this would
be equivalent to this copy this
times are so what your program would do
is when it's running through it would
take this out and replace it with this
so these pretty much are the same thing
but this you can see is a lot easier to
use and now I want to take note of one
thing check this out
sense it is pretty much a built-in
replacer that is why you don't add a
semicolon at the top right here so see
right now this runs fine just like this
but if you added a semicolon right here
then what it would do is anytime it took
out two pi it would replace this thing
exactly so it would have a semicolon
right there and one at the end so that's
why you don't want to add a semicolon
unless you know it's going at the end of
an expression so anyway sense it's
literally replacing two pi it would
replace the whole thing and the
semicolon since you put a semicolon
right there so is this general rule
always leave one out I guess that's not
a general rule if you do it all the time
just a pretty much just a basic rule so
that's why you don't use semicolons so
another cool thing about this define is
you don't even have to use it with
dealing with numbers at all you can
define like the keyword and instead of
using 2 ampere signs you can define the
keyword arm or instead of using two
pipelines in equals instead of using two
equal signs so if you're saying alright
if x equals y you know instead of
writing that two equal signs every time
it would be the same thing so not only I
mean if you guys want another example if
let's make an if statement if age is
greater than 10 and age is less than 40
I mean you can even use it an if
statement if this was a hand
so something like that so then I would
date you just you know you got to finish
off the if statement so the last thing I
want to go over is the fact that the
last thing it can do I want to teach is
actually reference itself so let's go
back to other PI thing so let's set pi
equal 3.1415926
and now what we want to do is we want to
define two pi and what we can actually
do is put to go to 2.0 times pi and
you're actually using this in another
expression so that is a way that you can
reference other definitions as well and
there's one more thing I want to go over
but I really don't have time in this
tutorial I thought I was going to get to
it but I didn't but uh yeah I really
don't have time but anyways I hope you
learned a little bit about definitions
and I mean don't get confused that it's
called a definition it's pretty much a
bill in a replacer it takes the word out
and replaces it with whatever value or
whatever you put in so that's all well
that's pretty much all I have time for
so thank you guys for watching I'm
actually going to be making a bunch of
examples and putting them in the link
below in my forum under the objective-c
section so once again thank you guys for
watching don't forget subscribe don't
forget to check out my forum for all the
free examples and I'll see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
