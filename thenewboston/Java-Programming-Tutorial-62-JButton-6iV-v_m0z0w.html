60 second java tutorial and in this
tutorial we're going to be getting back
to what everyone loves most and that is
gooeys so as you can see I already
created a new class called GUI and I
already went ahead and imported
everything and you should all know what
this stuff means for my last tutorials I
just didn't feel like um having to type
it all again you guys didn't want to
watch me type it anyway so I went ahead
and imported everything we need to
import we'll figure out what these do
later so if you watch my other tutorials
you're already know what to do but
anyways go ahead and make a new class
called GUI and have it extends jframe
and I'll leave that up if you guys want
to copy I guess and what extends mean is
it pretty much inherits everything from
jframe and we're going to be making
buttons in this tutorial in jframe has
some built in stuff for us to create
buttons and the first thing we're going
to need to do is create two variables so
go ahead and put private j button and
we'll create two buttons first one will
be a regular one and then we'll go ahead
and create another one J button and
we'll just make this one a custom one
one of them is just going to be a
regular button in other one if we spoke
private right it's going to be a button
with our own images on it and I'll show
you where to put the images and how to
do all that good stuff so I'm going to
go ahead and minimize this so hopefully
you guys have that copy down because it
well just because it's annoying me so
the first thing we're going to need to
do is build a constructor so go ahead
and put public and just go ahead and put
GUI or whatever you name your class
right here and we need to build a
constructor because whenever we create
an object from this class we want this
window to automatically pop up we don't
want to have to call a method for it to
pop up so go ahead and add no parameters
and in your constructor body this is
where we're going to be doing the meat
of the programming the first thing we're
going to want to do is add a title now
this super right here this super keyword
is how you call methods from the
superclass so since we're extending
jframe
this is the jframe constructor so go
ahead in the constructor for the jframe
is pretty much the title so go ahead and
write the title so um you know you guys
didn't need to know that all you guys
need to know is in order to add a title
to your window just put super the title
I just want to tell you guys um if you
don't know what the super does it allows
you access to your super class so you
know a little bit of information for
everyone so now that we have a title on
our window we can go ahead and make the
layout for the buttons we do this set
layout and you guys should know this
still from the last tutorial when you're
working on gooeys and we'll just go
ahead and put new flow layout just like
that and now this just gives us a
default layout so we don't have to code
it ourselves and now let's go ahead and
add our first button to our screen so
we'll take that variable we made I am
named my reg you can name as your wood
you can name yours whatever it was new J
button in this J button method is a
method to add a button and it takes one
parameter for here and it's pretty much
the text that's going to be on the
button I'm just going to name it a reg
button so now if we go ahead and add
this to the screen we now have a blank
screen that has a title of the title on
the title bar and we have a button that
says reg button on it well that's pretty
good pretty neat but we can do better
let's go ahead and make a button using
our own custom picture in it and when
you roll over it you get another picture
so the first thing I want to show you
guys is that I have two pictures already
um right here and how did I get these
pictures here so I can use first of all
I want to tell you guys when you create
your buttons make them like 40 by 40 and
make sure you save them as ping I tried
to save them as gif or JPEG and ping is
the only one that like gave me so it
could work all the time it Java supports
like a gif and JPEG and all the regular
image file
but for some reason only pin was working
on my computer
maybe it's vista thing maybe it's not
but once you create these images here's
where you put them go ahead to my
computer and you need to find the files
you're working on these class files mind
the default workspace are insi users
Greg and then is in a workspace and go
ahead and go to let's see mine is in
Bucky source and then this is where all
your class files are like apples that
GUI one we've just created put them in
the same directory is that so then you
don't have to write a bunch of image
paths you can just write the file name
in you're good go so your workspace
might be a little different and if you
don't know where your workspace is as
soon as you open eclipse it tells you
where your workspace is so just copy
that find it and that is where you want
to put your ping files right there so
now that you got your ping files in your
same directory is your class we can go
ahead and uh well make some fancy
buttons so let's go ahead and how you do
that is in your icon class and you have
to name it icon go ahead and give it an
object name such as B and what we need
to do is put new image icon and this is
built-in so you can't change any of this
let's go ahead and get class which is
this class and then put get resource and
this resource is going to be the file
and the resource is going to be well I
named mine be ping and what this does is
pretty much take that image and save it
an object named B so now we actually
have two images or at least I do have
one named B and one named X so let's go
ahead and create a new one by pasting
that in icon X is equal to new image X
dot ping if you're wondering all right
what's this beat-up ping an x-up ping
they're actually just two images I made
in Photoshop earlier so you guys won't
have them on your computer but I just
want needed a little
something to test on so that's what I
did so now that I have an image named B
and an image named X I can go ahead and
change those in the buttons so what I'm
going to do is take that custom button
remember I named a custom out here and
do custom and for the value I'm going to
set equal to a set equal to nu J button
and for my parameters it first takes the
name what's on the bun and I'm going to
name a custom and for the second
parameter this is optional parameter you
can have the image you want to appear on
the button as well so I'm going to have
B and this is pretty much just a little
graphic it's a 40 by 40 graphic and it's
like well I guess you guys are going to
see and another cool thing that we can
do with it if we said all right on that
on the button we just created there's an
image okay I got that but what are you
going to do with this X image right here
well that X image is going to be the
rollover for it so whenever we do
whenever we want to create a rollover
what we do is type the name of that
button right there
and you need to put set roll over icon
right there actually set rollover I
selected around one embarrassing and the
argument for this is of course the image
you want to roll over and now let's just
add the custom button to the screen so
now we got two buttons on the screen
right here we have a regular button and
we have a custom button so in the next
tutorial we're going to be creating a
class too so when we click the button
it's going to handle the event and we're
also going to be um you know that's it
we're going to be seeing these buttons
in action so and I'll also go over
everything I did in case I kind of
confuse the by gone too fast but for now
my tutorials getting too long so thank
you guys for watching make sure you
check out the next tutorial where we see
these buttons in action so again thank
you don't forget to subscribe and
see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
