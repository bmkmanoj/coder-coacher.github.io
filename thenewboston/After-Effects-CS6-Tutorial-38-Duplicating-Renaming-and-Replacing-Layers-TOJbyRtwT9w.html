another adult be After Effects cs6
tutorial my name is buddy Blackford
we're going to be going over duplicating
layers and how to rename layers and how
to replace layers like exchange them out
I it's hot it's hotter than Satan's
nipples in my room right now because
there's not a lot of ventilation and I
opened up the window and all of a sudden
this guy started running a chainsaw
outside so hopefully he doesn't do it in
the middle of the tutorial I mean he
hasn't been running the chainsaw all day
so I mean it's like the perfect time for
my guess so let's uh start with the
tutorial the first thing I wanted to
show you guys is how to duplicate layers
and you use this a lot of times so it's
a handy to know the shortcut for this
one I'll show you how to just duplicate
it first so let's click on the squish
here go to edit and then duplicate and
now you have another squish there see
you can take them off and it appears
right in the same position the hotkey as
you might have seen was ctrl D so I can
hit ctrl D and you can hit it a bunch of
times if you want now you've got tons of
them so you can click on a layer and
then click on a layer below it holding
shift and it will select all the layers
in between or you can and ya just hit
delete and I mean I got rid to get rid
of all those you can select a layer and
hold ctrl to select layers without
selecting multiple layers without
selecting the ones in between if you
don't want and another cool feature is
if you have these layers selected and
you want to edit them and then the next
layers you want to edit are the opposite
ones you can right-click and invert
selection and now it will select the
other ones that you didn't
that you didn't mess with yet or that
you didn't have click before I guess so
the next option here we are going to
rename layers so the way you do that is
you might think it's by double clicking
but it's not if you double click a layer
it brings you to the layer panel up here
so don't do that you need to press ENTER
on your keyboard press ENTER on the
keyboard and then you can just type it
in hello nurse
and press ENTER there to get it back to
what it was before go back to editing it
and delete everything you have press
ENTER again and it'll go back to what
the original name was another cool
feature that we have in After Effects is
the ability to replace layers so if I
want to let me turn some of these things
off so I can show you let's turn off the
tuna and the bit picture oh I'm on it
there we go so I want to animate this
layer and I'm going to add a couple
keyframes on it position and just move
it over here and then I'll just move it
one more time doesn't matter where I
move it really so I'm going to you see
it has a motion path there I'm going to
replace it with this MTV vector that I
have so you hold down you click on the
MTV vector you also click down here on
what you want to replace and hold alt
and drag from the project panel over top
and it will switch it out for you and
what it what's cool about it is it kept
all the keyframes that we had so that
way you don't have to re-edit everything
it looks like the parenting got a little
messed up
so we'll just unparent so keep that in
mind when you do it the parenting might
not work as well but let's see if we can
reap errant it yeah it just reap errant
it it's probably just a glitch and
after-effects just reap errant it and
you're good another way to do that you
can do the same thing click on the
object you want to replace with in the
project panel and then what you want to
be replaced down here make sure they're
both selected hold alt you can just drag
it right out of the comp right onto the
comp panel there like I just showed you
I'll do it again real quick they're both
selected hold alt drag onto the comp and
it can be anywhere and it replaces it so
that I thought that was a really awesome
feature that's it for this tutorial
sounds like the chainsaw didn't go off
which is Rio which is a great I guess
that would have been cooler if it went
off because ice chainsaw sound pretty
cool and I would have gotten mad and had
to cut it out but I don't have to it's
awesome thanks for watching this
tutorial
thumbs up if you liked it thumbs down it
if you hate duplicating layers so we'll
see you in the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
