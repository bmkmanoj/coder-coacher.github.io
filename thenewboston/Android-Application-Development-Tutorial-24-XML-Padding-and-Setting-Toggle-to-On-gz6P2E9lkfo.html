your 24th Android tutorial for the new
boss in again it's me Travis and what
we're going to do in this tutorial II
just kind of clean up this list little
activity with some padding I'm going to
introduce you to that method as well as
kind of move this toggle button up a
little bit or cut off the bottom a
little bit for the most part and also
we're going to kind of set this to on
when our when our java starts or this
activity for the most part we want it to
start with the toggle on and we'll also
change this text I guess so nothing too
big and it's going to be a quick
tutorial basically what I want you guys
to do is go up to your first linear
layout this is the one that will fill
the whole screen and defines everything
else within it and just add a line of
code within the opening bracket pretty
simple we're going to say Android
padding and we're gonna put like 10 DP
something like that now let's do like 25
DP just so we get a desired result there
you go there's just a 25 density pickled
pixels of padding throughout this whole
linear layout that defines the whole
basically edge of this of this XML
layout
you know padding is good for cleaning up
your application making it look a little
bit nicer as well as I know like my
rooms padded I don't know why there's
padding all over my walls but you know
it's good for safety as well for the
most part but for for XML it's good just
to kind of clean up your code and get
things organized a little bit better now
what we're going to do is just basically
you can add padding within a direction
so what we're going to do is use that on
this toggle button and just basically
cut off the bottom 10 pixels so we're
going to find our toggle button and as
you can see I started right there but
we're just going to add again one line
of code Android padding and as you can
see you can do padding around the whole
thing padding to the left batting to the
top bottom right and we're just going to
select bottom and do 10 density pixels
as well and check that out
that looks pretty good for the most part
now we're also going to add one more
line of code to you know get that to
turn on when it went up for this XML for
the most part again you can't really
change anything in the XML once your
activity starts you have to define
everything within Java so we want kind
of you know our XML looking the way that
we want it to look when our Java class
starts or creates sets the content view
so what we're going to do is we're going
to say Android again if you just put the
cool and you can see all the methods you
can use for the toggle button and
there's one called checked we're going
to set checked equal to true and you can
set that equal to true or false
basically if it's false it'd be off and
true it's on so there we go
that looks pretty good let's set this
button up now to or just set the change
the text to try command and hopefully
this will all make sense what I'm
actually building here in the next
tutorial where we kind of define
everything or setup the Java and build
our application I'm also going to change
this button reference I thought I said
you guys might have it change already
but I'm gonna say TG I'm sorry toggle
button TB and we're gonna call it
password I believe I said that I don't
know if I did or not but just change the
reference to TB toggle button password
the most part and then we're good to go
and I will see you guys in the next
tutorial well where we're going to start
with the Java so I'll catch you guys
then have a good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
