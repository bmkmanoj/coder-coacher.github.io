illustration cs6 tutorial today we're
gonna learn about creating a new
document and we're gonna go over some of
the things in the document new document
window then it didn't go over when we
first started out that way you can know
exactly what you're doing and everything
so you get a better experience in
Illustrator so let's go to file and
we're going to go to new here's the new
document panel you can you name your
document preferably something thats
related to your document and I'll just
name this start and then we've got here
profile most of the time it's going to
be on whatever you use the last so we've
got web that's going on right here right
now if I start changing things around in
it it's going to start it's gonna change
the custom and then you're able to use
more things in or you're able to use
more of the options here so let's start
up with a number of artboards now you
can select a number of artboards and
that's basically going to make like
different pages within your document and
on each of these pages you can have
different images or vectors or whatever
you were working on so use this to make
a number of our ports and down here at
the bottom as you can see where my
cursor is down here in the bottom left
you can switch between the different
artboards down here to the right are
some buttons here that are how your
artboards are arranged and this is grid
by row by column arranged by row
arranged by column and then change to
right left layout so go ahead when
you're messing with this after the
tutorial go ahead and check out these
different buttons and see what they do
for you now we've got the spacing here
and that's just the spacing between the
columns and how many columns you've got
here so
if I hold my cursor over top of this we
got number of artboards per row and then
this is the spacing between them and it
uses pixels size here you can select
from a bunch of sizes that you want that
are preset or you can come down here and
type them in and you can get your custom
sizes so this size right here is like
the size of some monitors 102 4 by 768
you can come over here and select the
unit of measurement that you want to use
most of the time you're going to want to
use pixels but if you're working on like
a print document you might want to use
millimeters or inches or whatever the
client decides that you need to use so
if he tells you that you need to make a
billboard that is or I mean a brochure
that is I don't know I'm just gonna say
20 inches long then you're going to want
to go ahead and use inches as your unit
of measurement that way you can figure
out what you're doing now we've got
orientation here and this is portrait
and over here to the right is a
landscape so one's going to be up and
down like the the longest is going to be
up and down and the other one's going to
be left to right so that's you can see
as it switches the width and the height
there most of the time you're gonna be
want to be on the long one where the
width is longer than the height because
that's how most computer screens are
they're longer in width than they are in
height the next thing we got here is the
bleed and what that is is pretty much
bleed allows you to run the artwork to
the end of a page and this is more for
when you're doing work with print
sometimes the printer doesn't print
towards the end of the page so you'll
need to set these bleeds to what the
printer specifies go down here to click
on this little triangle button here to
open up the Advanced Options color mode
we've got color modes are used
depending on what you're using your
document for if you're trying to make
something for printing on the internet
or for use on the internet or in like a
video you're going to want to use RGB so
RGB stands for red green and blue and
that's the one of the most common color
modes probably is the most common and
it's best for online in multimedia so
the next one that we can look at that's
a popular is CMYK and what that is is
cyan magenta yellow and black and that's
good or that's the best for commercial
printing so like if you're printing out
like a brochure again or if you're
working with photos then you're going to
want to use that CMYK most of the time
you're not going to be working with
photos in Illustrator but that's just an
example because you will be able to
choose in Photoshop if you're going to
be using that as well we've got our
raster effects going on here and you're
gonna select the resolution for that you
have three resolutions and the next one
is the preview mode got pixel or over
point so I'll go over these a little bit
so the default displays your artwork and
vector view pixel displays the artwork
with a rasterized looked and over print
The Stray displays it with an ink
preview so use those according to what
you need to you or what you're doing and
we've got online new objects to the
pixel grid you can uncheck or check that
if you want to and now that we've gone
over everything I want to show you some
cool things with the presets that we got
going on here so we've got these
different presets web is new in cs6
devices is new in cs6 and Flash Builder
is new and Flash Builder is pretty much
a development tool so you don't have to
worry about that unless you know what
you're actually you know that you're
actually using Flash Builder so
you'll know if you have to use that
devices I wanted to go to that so we've
got the size here is what I want to come
to you can see that it has Galaxy S the
Kindle Fire iPhone iPad so now you don't
have to guess the size of these anymore
you can see that this the resolutions
already there which is the width in the
height it's already there for you which
is really cool zoom there's the Kindle
Fire or the Nook which I think was a sum
that Barnes &amp;amp; Noble came out with a long
time ago so that's just something I
wanted to show you out
so we've got other things here we got
print and that's for a letter or a legal
paper web you have a bunch of different
preset sizes for things on the web for
monitors video and film if you're making
stuff for a video on film then these
have guides on them that you can use now
I do a lot of work in video and films
all right that's what I use most of the
time okay and then we've got our other
two here basic RGB which you don't
really you won't really use that much so
leather legal and then tabloids and all
that stuff in print so I just wanted to
show you those and that's about it for
this tutorial and I hope you guys
learned a lot about creating new
documents and now you understand this
actual window here when you're done and
you're everything's all ready you just
hit OK and then it brings up your new
document that you wanted so thanks a lot
for watching this tutorial everybody and
I hope you guys have a nice day and
learned a lot</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
