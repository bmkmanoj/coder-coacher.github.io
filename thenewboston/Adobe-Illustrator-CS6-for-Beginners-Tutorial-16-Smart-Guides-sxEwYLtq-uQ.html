illustration cs6 tutorial my name is
buddy Blackford today we're going to
start going over smart guides and
basically what smart guides are is
they're temporary guides that pop up
when you start dragging stuff along and
you're able to use them as like a snap
to kind of thing so they'll they'll show
up along anchor points and edges and
things like that so what you need to do
to get started here is open up or create
a document that has multiple layers or
multiple objects in it and now each of
these dogs I've got here is its own
little layer so we've got that going on
here and once you get that done go ahead
and select your selection tool and then
go ahead and click on one of your
objects and start dragging it now you
can see these green lines that are
popping up now those are actual actually
your smart guides and the smart guides
they appear when you start clicking and
dragging and they disappear when you let
go of the actual mouse button so as you
can see they're moving along now there's
a couple cool things I can tell you
about using smart guides the first thing
is there's a hotkey that you can use to
show and hide the smart guides and that
is a control u so if I press control u
right now it should have hid the smart
guides which I just pressed it and now
I'm moving this along and now you don't
see them but the smart guides are
annoying to you then go ahead and do
that you can also do it by going up to
the View menu go to view and then smart
guides is on here right here and that
way I just turned them back on and these
I like to keep the bond because they
help me align things correctly now if I
click and drag notice where the lines
are at our show egg up there just that
um random
bots they're not really random but
they're at different spots various areas
of my dog that I'm moving around if I go
ahead and I hold down control it's going
to always use the center of the object
here and that way you can line things up
with the center I can line it up with
the center of this dog and right now
this is trying to line it up with the
center of that line down there I can
line it up with the center of the
mustache that pink mustache down there
so holding down control will get you the
center alignment going on there and then
as well on a Mac if you're using a Mac
that's going to be the command key so
control and command are interchangeable
on Mac and on Mac and PC now we have the
ability to adjusted these smart guides
and change the color remove that little
box and stuff like that so let's go
ahead and figure out how to do that go
it's in the preferences so go up here to
your menu bar and go to edit preferences
and then smart guides is the one that we
want to go to we can change the color
here and then there's all these
different checkboxes that are going on
here
we've got alignment guides and that
displays the guides along the center and
the edges of the objects it can go along
the artboard or it can go along the
bleeds as well then we've got anchor
anchor and path labels and that's just
going to display the path intersection
and anchor point information so we like
to wear the little X's are when you're
dragging around oops sorry about that
forgot that that's going to make that
big annoying noise so the next thing
that we got is object highlighting and
this highlights objects below the
pointer as you drag then we've got
measurement labels
and you can select this or deselect it
if you want to display the tool or
object location that the information
we've got transform tools here and if
you want to select that it will display
the information when you scale a rotate
or shear the objects and I haven't gone
over those yet but you can kind of get
an idea of how that would work and we
got construction guides and when you
select this it displays guides as you
draw new objects and you can specify the
points here
so pretty much 90 degrees and 45 degree
angles when you're drying these will
help you be able to figure out what a 90
degree angle is and what a 45 degree
angle is when you're drawing it'll show
up as a smart guide that way you can
draw a perfect angles if you think
you're going to be drawing 30 degree
angles and go ahead and set that and
then there are custom angles so I select
this then we got our custom angles down
here and then we got snapping tolerance
and that's how close the object has to
be before it snaps to the guide so
that's a there are objects here so let's
go ahead and try some things we'll
change this to magenta and I'm going to
take off measurement labels and hit OK
and now when I'm dragging that little
box isn't showing up and I've got a
different color so if you're working in
in a project and a lot of your things
are bright green you might want to
change it to a different color so that
your guides aren't the same color as
your your project so that's pretty much
it on smart guides now you guys know all
about them and how to use them correctly
and everything and go ahead into the
preferences and uncheck and and go ahead
and mess around with things so you can
figure out what's going on and what they
do so thanks a lot for watching and
everybody I hope you have a good day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
