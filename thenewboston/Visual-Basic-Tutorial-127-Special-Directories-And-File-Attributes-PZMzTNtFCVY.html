youtube.com slash on live gamer for the
new Boston and in this tutorial we're
gonna be taking a look a couple of
things we're gonna look at getting
special directories from the computer
and also setting attributes for files so
you can even write hidden files to a
computer to store information that you
don't want the user to change by
accident so let's go ahead and delete
this right here from form one load and
what we're gonna do is we're gonna get
the My Documents folder so we'll type
text box 1 dot txt and we're gonna set
that equal to my dot computer dot file
system dot special directories dot and
you can see that we have desktop My
Documents my music my pictures Program
Files programs temp and a whole bunch of
other stuff we're gonna be using My
Documents
so now all we need to do is we need to
read a file from that so we'll type file
dot read all text and we're gonna use
the path from My Documents now we're
gonna need to add a string to this so in
order to allow us to use the backslash
we have to type the @ character
backslash hello dot txt
and let's see here
looks like I was getting my c-sharp
mixed up with Visual Basic we don't
actually need the @ character right
there so we're gonna read all the text
from my documents and then hello text so
let's go ahead and open up my documents
and I will find hello dot text so here
it is right here we'll just write some
stuff in there YouTube Visual Basic will
go ahead and save that close out okay so
now let's go ahead and run this and you
can see that it's going to load on live
gamer YouTube and Visual Basic into our
text box one dot txt so we can also use
like I said we can get pictures we can
get program files whatever you want and
this is very useful if you want to get
certain files from the computer and you
don't know where those will be let's say
you just should be distributing your app
and not everybody's gonna use the same
folder for my documents so you're gonna
want to use this to get special
directories now we can also set
attributes of a file to make it hidden
so now that we've read all the text of
this let's go ahead and make it a hidden
so file dot set attributes and for the
first argument we're gonna need path a
string so we'll just type my computer
dot file system dot special directories
dot My Documents then we'll go ahead and
get hello dot text for our second
arguments we're going to need our file
attributes so since we've already
imported system Daioh all we need to do
is type file attributes instead of
system dot IO dot file attributes and
you can see here that we've got archive
compressed device directory and crib
did hidden normal offline whatever we
want now let's go ahead and set this to
hit him so let's go ahead and run this
it's going to load everything into our
text box let's close out of that and
head back into the My Documents folder
and let's see where is hello it is not
there let me set this - pretty sure I
have a set to view hidden ah so it's a
view hidden files and folders and hello
is there it is hidden let me shrink this
down a bit
for you so
here is our hello file and you can see
that a hat and has a sort of transparent
text document right there now that means
that it is hidden so go ahead play
around with getting special directories
and setting file attributes and then
once you've done that go ahead and move
on to the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
