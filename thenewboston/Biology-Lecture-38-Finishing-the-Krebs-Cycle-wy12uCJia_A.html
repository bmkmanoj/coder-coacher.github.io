biology video and in this video we're
gonna be finishing up the krebs cycle
because right now we are in step number
6 there's only eight to go
and whenever we left off we left with a
molecule called succinate so what
happens in step number six is the very
first thing that happens are two
hydrogen atoms from the succinate
molecule are actually stripped off so
two hydrogen's get stripped off and
they're donated to another molecule
called F ad now of course whenever you
add two hydrogen atoms to FA D molecule
you end up with fadh2 to point this out
actually fadh2 because there are two of
course right here
and I wanted to point this out because
even though we're not going to talk
anymore about this molecule right now
it's very important later on whenever we
want to generate some more ATP's
so remember if your teacher ever asked
you what step was fadh2 produced you can
say step number six actually pretty
important so of course now that this
succinate went through a chemical
reaction and lost some hydrogens it's no
longer called succinate it's actually
called fumarate so f um a ra te now that
is all step number six but I'm not going
to change I'm not going to change my
slide for step number seven because step
number seven is incredibly easy all you
do for step number seven is you add a
water molecule to fumarate and it
actually makes a brand new molecule
called malli so this is step number
seven right here and go ahead and
separate it with a little squiggly line
you take fumarate which was your new and
improved succinate molecule and you add
a water to it and you end up with malate
so now you can go ahead and take malli
and move on to step number eight which
is our last step thank God mal 8ee so
that's our starting point and what
happens in step number eight is malli
gives a hydrogen
to nad and of course whenever this
happens it forms can yes NADH because it
lost the hydrogen and nad gained it
forming NADH like I just said and
another hydrogen is also released but
don't worry about this one it's just
going to go ahead and float around do
whatever hydrogens do and the important
part is this losing of hydrogens turns
malate into let me change my color
oxaloacetate now if this molecule looks
familiar remember that this was the
molecule in step number one that
combined to form citric acid so wait a
minute you're telling me that after all
that time we got back to a molecule that
we started with in step number one well
what happens to this molecule right now
does it just disappear well no this
molecule actually attaches and forms
another citric acid and repeats the
whole entire process again so that's why
this entire thing is called the Krebs
cycle or the citric acid cycle because
this molecule that pretty much was
formed in the very last step is part of
the molecule that gets combined into
citric acid which of course the first
step so in the next tutorial what I want
to do is I want to take you guys through
the entire summary and I'm going to show
you guys a cool little diagram and it's
gonna simplify everything so what I did
is I pretty much went over the details
of how every molecule becomes another
molecule where everything gets created
all these nadh --is but in the next
tutorial i'm gonna summarize everything
so if you have any questions or any
confusion you guys are gonna understand
in the next video but for now thank you
guys for watching don't forget subscribe
and I'll see you guys then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
