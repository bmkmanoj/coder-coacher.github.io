Android tutorial for the new boss in
we're going to do in this tutorial we're
basically going to learn about this
modify or set up or modify button again
what this is going to do is if we were
too drunk and we put in someone's you
know information whether we misspelled
their name or we gave them higher
attractiveness rating than they deserve
we're going to allow a button that we
can modify that entry so what we're
going to need is we're going to need
both the the edit text for the name and
that it text for the hotness ranking and
also our row ID so let's just copy and
paste again first a row which converts
into a long from our get information and
let's just change this to string row and
long row something like that and we're
going to convert the string row so there
we go we have a new long and again we
can just copy and paste our string name
and hotness from our update button so
we're just going to copy that and paste
it below as well and just you know maybe
change the name a bit don't have to but
um hotness and all that good stuff so
again that's just going to convert our
our string name and or edit text into a
string for both the name and the hotness
and we're also going to see what row the
person wants to update or modify and
then we just again need to create a hot
or not class or object we're going to
call it X I don't know new hot or not
passing the context this and then just
the X open oh and the X close
and then this is the the method that
we're going to create so we're going to
say e X dot update entry something like
that if we want to pass in all of our
information for the most part so we're
going to pass in a which row work it
come working with the long and then
we're going to pass in the name and the
hotness so we're just going to say L row
for the first parameter which is going
to long
mm name and M hotness and so again we
have to create this method within our
hot-or-not class so we just hover over
here and say create method called update
entry that takes a long-ass string and a
string so you're going to click that and
here we go we have our update method
update entry and all the information
that we're passing in from the previous
class what we want to do is we want to
set up a content values whoa
content values and we're going to call
this CV update something like that
and we're going to set this equal to new
content values and then we just have to
say CV update dot put and again we just
refer to our key name which we're going
to say key underscore name and value we
want so we want the value that's being
passed in so there we go we set that up
oops except it's M name and again we
just need this CV update for our
attractiveness or hotness so again we're
just going to say key hotness and what's
being passed in which is M hotness and
then we just have to update our database
so again we're going to refer to our
database variable and we've used the
method you know Cori we've used the
method in
serve but now we're going to use the
method called update so again we just
have to put in our table which is going
to be our database table our values
which is our content values here that we
just updated the where clause is going
to be kind of similar to what we did in
last tutorial where we got the
information the specific row so again
we're just going to say a row or we're
going to say key underscore row ID plus
and quotations again equals and then
whatever is being passed in which we
call del row but L row like that and
then the fourth parameter we're going to
set to null and again I'm sorry we have
to put a plus here as well so now that's
just going to update our database
according to whatever again we passed in
to our update entry so that's going to
update our database and that's pretty
much it for this tutorial guys and I'll
catch you in the next one have a good
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
