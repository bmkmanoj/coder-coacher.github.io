welcome to your eighth physics tutorial
and in this story I want to talk to you
guys about something called significant
figures now a significant figure is
basically a way of saying how precise
should your answers be whenever you're
working with scientific notation so you
know before when we were working in
scientific notation we got numbers like
one point five three two one seven and
maybe those numbers went on and on
forever well if we're saying all right
so how do I know how many decimal places
I'm supposed to write in my answer well
there actually is an answer to that
question and it isn't just basically
however many you feel like there's
actually a rhyme and a reason to it and
it makes a lot of sense so hopefully by
the end of these tutorials you guys are
gonna understand the importance and the
significance two significant figures
should I have said it like that probably
not but you guys know what I mean so
basically let me go ahead and tell you
story for my childhood and this is gonna
you know definitely explain you guys how
and why significant figures are
important so when I was in high school
I used to be on the wrestling team and I
was always obsessed about my weight so I
had a scale at my house that I weighed
myself multiple times a day so one day I
weighed myself in the scale said 165
pounds it only had enough data to round
it to the nearest pound again if you
wanted to buy a scale that you know gave
you a tenth of a pound like 160 and 5.17
five those cost like thousands and
thousands of dollars to get a scale that
accurate so we only had you know a dumb
scale that we bought at Kmart so it only
gave us my way to the nearest pound so I
walk into a wrestling practice one day
and I my coach says all right Bucky how
much do you weigh and I tell him 165
pounds and he looks at me I look a
little bit chubby like I'm overweight
like I'm not gonna make way for the
tournament and he says you know what I
don't believe you get on the scale so I
go ahead and hop on the scale
if you never wrestled in high school
before they have really precise
expensive scales so in fact whenever I
got on that scale it said 165 0.38
so he's like Bucky Bucky Bucky you lied
to me you told me you weighed 165 and
whenever I said that he was assuming it
was 160 5.00 when in fact I weighed more
than 165 so was i lying to him well I
wasn't exactly lying to him but you know
the results were different so with that
being said that is basically the
importance of significant figures
whenever you're working with significant
figures you can only claim your answer
to be as accurate is the least accurate
factor and you're gonna see what I'm
talking about whenever I'm working with
this in scientific notation but
basically what I'm trying to say is
whenever you're using scientific
notation especially when multiplication
and division your answer can't be more
precise than your least precise factor
and by that I mean you can't assume this
number is 165 point zero zero because we
don't have the equipment to verify that
we can only assume we can only basically
work with whole numbers since this
information right here is unknown so we
can't just claim it to be whatever we
want it to so let me go ahead and give
you guys another example go ahead and
change my color a little bit
no I changed it to green or something
like that so basically say you and your
friend wanted to start uh I don't know
like selling potatoes on the side of the
road like that's a good idea
so you go ahead and I'm gonna go ahead
and weigh all the potatoes I own first
and remember I had that cheap scale from
Kmart or Walmart wherever I said I got
it from so I only can wait to the
nearest whole pound so it says I have 20
pounds of potatoes pretty cool so I call
it my friend and his dad as a doctor
he always gets the nicest clothes the
nicest shoes so he has a super fancy
mega scale so he weighs his potatoes and
of course he has more potatoes than I do
he has 32 0.87 pounds of potatoes so we
say re we're gonna go ahead and add up
our potatoes to see how much money we
can make however we can't say that we
have fifty two point eight seven pounds
of potatoes because that number may or
may not be accurate and the reason for
that is because if you guys don't
understand this 20 right here it may or
may not be 20.00 this number 20
accidentally deleted that okay let's
clear this up this number 20 right here
can be anything from like nineteen point
five to twenty point four nine and we
really don't know to add nineteen point
five to this or to add twenty point four
nine or anything in between so really
all this information to the right of the
decimal point is pretty much just a
guess so the only information that we
really want to work with is this what we
need to do is whenever we add this
together together what the heck together
we basically need to round in other
words get rid of this so we can only say
we have 53 and we can't even use a
decimal place we can only say we have 53
pounds of potatoes if we want around or
to be on the safe side we can just say
we have 52 and you know it will work out
like that but basically what I'm trying
to say is whenever you work with
significant figures you can't claim to
have more information than you really do
because these numbers right here or
basically just question marks so you
can't just go ahead and throw in
anything there you like you can only
have an answer that's as accurate is
your release precise piece of equipment
so that's basically what I'm trying to
say hopefully you understand
the importance of significant figures
and why and how we need to use them so
in the next story what I'm gonna be
doing is I'm gonna be showing you a real
quick example of multiplication and
division and I'm gonna show you how what
we did in the last serials were wrong
and how to correct it so with that being
said thank you guys for watching don't
forget subscribe and I'll see is in the
next story</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
