time I'm playing another team deathmatch
game with using the famas on karachi
taking down same setup scavenger ninja
and a scavenger stopping power in ninja
ah seems to be what I use a lot ah
anyway um karachi i just want to talk
about that real quick karachi i just
know a lot of people who don't really
like this math we can unless you playing
Search and Destroy that's a little
different but um well it's the payments
this game is either really good or
really bad depending on where you're
spawning um this game this map is what i
meant um see where i'm at you could
basically see at least have about half
the map from this one point which is
usually that's either a really good
thing for you or a really bad thing for
the other team almost an epic fail right
there okay um I think I stay up here for
a little amount that Easton amount of
time think I got pretty lucky right
there Oh
and letting you know a intent if people
know where you are move this just a
little tip oh I wanted to share with you
guys oh and one other quick thing we
don't use Gavin don't use no not yet no
don't you use scavenger do not use
scrambler excuse me scrambler the
terrible perk I've even seen people use
it in search and destroy it just
completely shows your position it's it's
not good at all and here i get an attack
helicopter which i think it only gets me
like two kills maybe three cops anyway
this game right here I I think that is
either a guy in the building or the guy
walking over here trying to figure out
where he is I got him with my grenade
right there which brings me my predator
missile which means I'm about it gets by
again Perry your strength which most
likely um this one thing I want to get
straight just one out of the way real
quick there's my hair strike um mine
book Bucky's killstreak setups when he
started playing this game he didn't know
that you can choose what order it was so
I just have to deal with up to carrier
strike which I'm not complaining but I'm
just saying I probably if I used like
chopper gunner ac-130 year new could
probably most likely get one against
people
just saying oh not really completely but
okay at this content I'm running around
trying to get into their either their
spawn or just try and get to a new area
if I didn't say this before i'm using
the moss if he actually didn't realize
we good um was it um the score is about
32 and um does anybody actually
something I actually didn't want to know
about this game why did Infinity Ward
put it up another zero like everything
gets up another zero compared to the
what it was for call of duty 4 rolled or
can anybody leave a comment on that just
curiosity I really don't know or I'm not
certain actually the word and get that
guy from pretty long range see I see
another guy with scrambler trying to run
around trying to see what area he is and
I got a challenge I didn't even know
existed this best actually I'm not sure
spas-12 is a very good weapon
as bad as 12 highly recommended unless
you have raffica unless you have the
raffica watch it as another very good
weapon so you know here see what we're
doing I think there's a guy behind me I
wasn't sure make a guy spawn spawn
behind me so guys scrambler trying to
figure yep there goes my ended my set
awesome 17 kill streak with my famas one
thing i do recommend as a tip
quote-unquote to it tip for anybody that
wants to like go around in their spawn I
know probably people probably do this a
lot with the ump45 use a silenced gun it
says it gets down the range but that's
only for guns like tar 21 the tar 21
where the accuracy isn't all that great
like that's probably the only gun I
wouldn't use a silencer on excluding
shot guns shotguns and sniper rifles as
a sniper rifle is supposed to be a
one-hit kill like a bear from cal /
intervention I weapon and it's just
supposed and its most of the time even
if you have like FMJ you to blame coming
most of the time it's not and that kind
of ruins the sniping part of it so don't
really recommend it using for on a
sniping class or a shotgun class
actually I would kind of recommend it if
you're playing search icon espace 12a a
12 pack type of weapon other than that
I'd probably say don't use it because it
has no range it really doesn't like you
can use an m10 with a sniper rifle on it
or are we not not with a sniper rifle
with a silencer on it excuse me and it
has absolutely no range you could be two
feet in front of the person that's about
as far as always you can probably kill
him with this and what I do recommend
though is using FMJ for both a shot
shotgun and I Tom and a sniper rifle I
do highly recommend that okay well let's
get back to the game okay at this point
still trying to run around as well as
basically what I've been doing most of
this game let's see think the game's
starting to get close to the end that's
just trying to trying to just can't
belittle bit still live just a little
bit and let's see what I see a guy my
right a couple guys on my radar over
here and I tried try to find somebody I
don't think I think I might either that
or get shot or something like that no
yep there is proof using science weapons
are awesome see I would have never found
that guy who was using a songs gun like
I would have never found any of these
guys if they reason
repeat care package waiting for your
mark and I think I just Chuck yeah nope
hear back and I got you do what you want
it that's actually one thing I want to
talk about really quickly why did
infinity ward invent on youtube yes it
is a real weapon but it is a cheap
weapon I mean I'd have to say that is
definitely one of the cheapest weapon
ever invented in a video game in general
I mean just come on really it's just
it's not a very good weapon at all like
at all I think I get the gift here's the
game when he killed right there mission
accomplished nice meant three kills just
as I spawn okay well there it is game
winning kill see what my Katie spread is
it is
get it much money kill awesome my KD is
28 and five not the best can't not the
best game not the worst game I'll elves</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
