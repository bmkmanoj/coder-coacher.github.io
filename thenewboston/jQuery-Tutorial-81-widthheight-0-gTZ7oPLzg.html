with a video tutorial for the new Boston
in this video we're going to be taking a
look at the height and width properties
in jQuery and how we can retrieve the
height and the width of any particular
element obviously we can also then apply
this to the document window or the
document itself or the browser window
and the document itself so the first
thing I'm gonna go ahead and do is
create a div on the page and we'll just
put some content in here it doesn't
really matter what we do with regards to
the ID let's go ahead and give it a name
something just like div something
generic and then gonna go ahead and
style this so we can actually set some
properties to it ourself so the first
thing I'm just gonna do is give it a
background color just so we can see the
sort of physical height and width of it
and then I'm gonna go ahead and actually
set a height and width to it so I'm
going to give it a hundred pixel and the
width I'm gonna give it to 50 pixels so
on our page now we can see that we've
got a div here with some content and
it's 250 width and a hundred height so
now what I'm going to do is I'm gonna go
ahead in an actual fact probably about
to get rid of this content and I'm gonna
replace the content inside of the div
with the height and the width of the div
so we come over to ext j/s which I have
included on my page as well as jQuery
and we can start to write our code down
here so I'm first of all going to say
document dot ready just when the Dom's
loaded and we're ready to start you know
start outputting we just do this usually
in Java in jQuery and I'm gonna go ahead
and set two variables the first is div
height and this is going to equal two
and we're gonna reference or we're going
to select this div and that's just
called div so we can go ahead and say
hash div and all we need to do is go
ahead and apply the height property so
yeah I knew I spelled that wrong so yeah
okay now we're gonna go ahead and get
the width so we do exactly the same
thing but this time obviously it's quite
easy to guess we would just apply dot
width to the end so now I'm gonna go
ahead and output this to the Dib itself
so div dot txt and in here I can go
ahead and write something like width
width
yeah that's right width x and or width x
height X so X I'm just going to go ahead
and replace with by appending this on
and I'm gonna replace the div width and
I'm gonna do the same as X so I can just
append this on to the end of this string
and that is div right so this is
obviously in pixels when we refresh you
can see that we get a representation of
the div width and the div height there
are other ways to do this for example we
could go ahead and use the CSS property
so we could go ahead and use CSS here
and then supply or ask for the height
and we could go ahead and then say CSS
and then supply width in that and what
this will do is it will return more or
less the same thing but you'll see that
we'll get the PX on the end of it and
the there's two ways that why this is
unreliable and may require more
processing power the reason being is
that for example if we were to use this
and we wanted to use it as an integer
this doesn't return it as an integer
only returns with the absolute value in
the style dot CSS file or the CSS and
that's applied to it so what we would
need to do is go ahead and use pass int
now obviously the first downfall of this
or the downside to this is that we're
unnecessarily processing the
and passing it as an integer and Parsons
just gonna obviously pass the value as
an integer and just go ahead and remove
px so we can we can do it that way but
you know why write this all this out
when it's completely unnecessary and you
could go ahead and use the width and
height options like this and like this
so the other reason that we would go
ahead and do it like this is because we
might not have predefined a height and a
width to this div for example the
content might have filled up the div to
the point where it's a size that we
haven't defined you know the content
might not overlap but push the div and
create more width or more height width
so using height and width will always
return an integer which is one benefit
less processing power and not having to
use pass in and the other benefit is
that it will get the height and the
width reliably you know regardless of
the content that we add so for example
at the moment you can see it with 250
and height 100 if I was to go ahead and
inside of the div right let's just say
text and then break and that's just copy
and paste this a few times and then in
ext changed this to append because we
obviously don't want to rewrite over our
content you can now see that oh okay
yeah so right let's just go ahead and
get rid of style in here so we have a
div now that will just sort of like
overflow the content you can now see
that the you know the properties have
changed for this we've got different
width I'm not sure what oh that's just
because it automatically went to the
edge of the document</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
