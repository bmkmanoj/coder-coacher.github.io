eleventh tutorial on C++ and this time
it's going to be a real quick tutorial
and I'm going to be teaching you guys
how to make a raise a lot easier in a
lot faster now hopefully you watch my
last tutorial and you're just watching
this one right after it and as you can
see the first thing we did was create
our array right here and then we assign
a value to each of the elements
individually 0 1 2 but there's a lot
easier way to do this so let's get rid
of all this actually and let's do it all
at the same time the first thing we have
to do is create our array just adjust 4
so let's put in ages and then of course
they're going to be three elements in it
as usual but this time instead of just
ending it we're going to write we're
going to create it and initialize it all
at the same time and we're going to
assign all our values so instead of
typing ages 0 equals all we have to do
is in curly brackets alright three
numbers 21 19 and 9
just like we did before and end it with
a semicolon and this is the exact same
thing as putting ages 0 equal 21 ages 1
equals 19 ages 2 equals 9 right here C++
knows automatically to assign the values
ages 0 since this is the first one and
remember C++ counts 0 1 2 instead of 1 2
3 that H is 0 is going to be the first
one ages 1 is going to be the second one
and unlike before you don't have to list
them individually ages 0 equals 19 ages
1 equals 22 or whatever so now of course
just to prove you guys that this works
and I'm not actually aligned to let's
output the ages 1 which is actually the
second one 19 plus h is 0 which is 21 so
I'm going to just save this execute pile
and run and as you can see we have 40
again just like we wanted so this is a
lot faster and easier way of being able
to assign your values to your array and
it's a lot quicker and it's a lot easier
like I said so study this and it'll give
you another option the only down point
is sometimes when you have real long
ones it's hard to keep track of so I
hope you guys learn a little more about
arrays study this and I you can become
familiar with this and then once you do
I hope you move on and watch my next
tutorial and remember to subscribe to my
channel thank you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
