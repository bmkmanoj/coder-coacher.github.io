to work with templates it was pretty
easy what we did is we took a template
we loaded it in and then we rendered it
in other words we pretty much just took
it we ran it through django and
converted it all into regular plain old
HTML and then once we had all that
rendered into plain HTML we can return
it to the user however I'm going to show
you guys a really quick shortcut and
that's pretty much how you can bypass or
combined the load and render functions
it just helps clean up your code a
little bit so delete this loader right
there
and instead what you want to do is from
django shortcuts you want to import
render so we can actually delete this as
well delete this and by the way whenever
I have a dictionary and it has just one
pair in it then I actually like to do
something like this and it just helps
I'll no condense my code a little bit
but delete this HTTP response now
instead of just returning a plain old
HTTP response we are going to return the
function render now I don't know if you
guys saw that but render as the first
argument it takes your request so we
need to pass that in now another thing
that it takes is the file path to that
template so just like before you write
musics index the HTML that's the
template we're using and the last one is
what is the information that the
template needs in order to work well
that's just context right there and if
you guys are like wait a minute
I thought that you needed to return an
actual HTTP response well that's
actually built in to this render
function so behind the scenes it takes
this converts it to an actual valid HTTP
response and it's good to go
so now we can go ahead and refresh this
and just so we can change one thing to
make sure it work I'll say um h3 here
my albums alright so there you go so we
click this click this everything works
beautifully and I mean I know that we
only saved like one line of code but
this is a whole lot cleaner</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
