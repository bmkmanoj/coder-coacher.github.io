proofs and I know we've been doing a lot
of these but every time we do a new
lesson on proofs we're learning more
rules that help us improve things so
example number one given that tal is
isosceles and te is equal to e L prove
that te a is congruent to le a so very
still write down our given information
tal is isosceles te equals E okay so the
first thing we can do is since we're
told that tal is isosceles that means
this has to be equal to this so ta is
congruent to al and triangle is
isosceles then sides are congruent
because a is the vertex angle of the
isosceles triangle so that means te a
and al have to be congruent so now we're
gonna learn something new we are told
that te is equal to e L but to prove
triangles are congruent we need two
congruent sides but the definition of
congruent is segments who have equal
measures so we're gonna use this little
theorem to get te congruent te l and the
theorem is if equal measures
then congruent because congruent means
to have equal measures so now we have
one side and another side all we need is
a third side but if you look these two
triangles share a E and since a E is
always going to be congruent to AE we
have a third pair of congruent sides so
this is our reflexive property and we
have one last step which is to say
therefore triangle te a is congruent to
triangle le a by side-side-side so our
next problem is gonna deal with this
shape trying to prove it's a
parallelogram so given that AP is
parallel to DC and angle one is
congruent to angle 4 prove ABCD is a
parallelogram okay so let's write our
given information so a be parallel the
DC angle one going to angle 4 ok so if
you notice since these two lines are
parallel that means that angle 2 is
congruent to angle 3 because they're
alternate interior angles so angle 2 is
congruent to angle 3 if lines are
parallel alternate interior angles are
congruent
ok so we just got this angle congruent
to this angle we have another pair of
congruent angles and if you look
they share this side because if we can
get these two triangles congruent we can
get this pair of opposite sides also
congruent and that proves it's a
parallelogram so we can say DB is
congruent to DB and that's the reflexive
property and then we can say that the
triangles are congruent by angle side
angle so triangle DB a it's congruent to
triangle B oh yeah BD c by angle side
angle and then we can get DC congruent
to a b DC is congruent to a b because if
triangles congruent corresponding parts
are also congruent and then finally we
can say that a b c d is a parallelogram
because if one pair of opposite sides
are parallel and congruent then it is a
parallelogram so those are the only
proofs we're going to work with today
but make sure you come back and watch
the next lesson where we do some review
of area and regular polygons</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
