welcome to your second iPhone
development tutorial and in the story
we're gonna be picking up right where he
left off and adding stuff to the screen
of our app so before we even get started
I want to tell you guys that in the les
story I remember that I couldn't find
where the Xcode was whoa if you go ahead
and you're Macintosh hard drive in your
developer folder in your applications
directory I guess is called inside that
Xcode is right there so if you can't
find it or you don't know how to open it
that's where it is so another obvious
thing you can see is what I did is I
rearranged all of my windows just so I
can make it easier to work with I put
all of my interface builder windows on
the left hand side nice and neat and I
also put all of my Xcode windows which
all of them I mean one on the right hand
side so now we are good ready to go so
you might take note that I have four
windows open and more specifically I
have the library and attributes windows
open as well if you don't have any of
these windows open then go ahead and
click tools in library to get your
library windows and inspector to get
your attributes anytime you're missing a
window and you don't know how to get it
back up it's gonna be under your tools
toolbar right at the top so let's go
ahead and exit that and what we want to
do is by the way this view window I'm
pretty much gonna call the screen so if
you get confused that's what I'm doing
since that's basically what it is just
the screen of your iPod so let's go
ahead and our boss comes in he's like
wow this is a nice app a grey background
but you know what
I want some text on the screen you were
like alright I'll see what I can do so
what we need to do in order to put some
text on the screen is go in your library
in your library is pretty much all the
objects that you can put on the screen
and let's go ahead and scroll down to
label and go ahead and drag it over to
your screen
release and bam look at that we have
text called label right on our screen
but we don't want to say label we want
to say something cool so double click
this and go ahead and type bacon
in there and now click away and bang we
now switch it from label to baking just
by editing it with a couple clicks and
go ahead and move it to the top the
screen or wherever you want it and you
know this is good to go
we already submit this baby to the App
Store making millions off it but before
we do we go ahead and a file saver file
so you know we don't want to ruin that
that's a--that's a lot of time to do and
once you're done saving it go over to
Xcode and click build and run now as
soon as you click this this is gonna
launch your iPhone simulator so this is
pretty much a graphical representation
of what it will look like on the iPhone
so I mean look at that pretty beautiful
and look oh we got 5 bars - oh it's
strong Wi-Fi not bad so go ahead and
exit iPhone simulator be quit iPhone
simulator and by the way your iPhone
simulator your Xcode in your interface
builder are three separate applications
so if you close out of one and the
others are still there that's why there
are actually three separate applications
so anyways your boss comes in we show
them this awesome app and he's like wow
that is awesome
indeed but my friend what I want you to
do is actually change a couple
properties I want bacon to appear a
different color maybe he wants a
different font and we're Ike dude I can
do this so this is how we do this go
ahead and select that bacon by clicking
on it that label I mean and in order to
change the color in your attributes
these are all the attributes of that
label go ahead and click the color and
set it equal to you know orange or
something like that the necks out of it
and now look our bacon is now orange
actually let's set it to like red you
know I just looks a little cooler looks
a little bit more bacon like so after
this you know what we want to do is I
know maybe change the font so go ahead
and click the font and it changes
something like courier new and look at
our bacon font change as we do that
let's make it courier it's a little more
thick and you know maybe we can increase
the size of it a bit by just stretching
this
and go ahead and double-click and bacon
and increase the size so BAM
I mean all this is pretty much
self-explanatory
you know just the basic text attributes
so now I mean this is good to code can
this app get any better you know I don't
think it can so go ahead and save it and
build and run this and now look oh look
at when this launch is bacon pretty
sweet huh
so after this launches go ahead and
click this little home button and now I
see well what's all this stuff well this
is what I was practicing before but you
know this is our application right here
our bacon app and I mean like the icon
on it I mean check it out
white I mean it pretty much sucks what
we want is this sweet icon just like the
New Boston so we're gonna go from
creating a basic white icon to creating
this how do we do that first close out
of your iPhone simulator and what you
need to do is you can't just create any
picture icon it needs to be 57 by 57
pixels and it needs to be a ping you
know what you know what I decided that
I'm actually gonna save this for the
next tutorial because I mean there's a
couple other things we need to talk
about as well so in the next story I'm
going to show you guys how to create
sweet icons like the one you just saw so
