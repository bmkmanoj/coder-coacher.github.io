how to prove a parallelogram really is a
parallelogram so there's five ways we
can do that we can show that both pairs
of opposite sides are parallel we can
show that both pairs of opposite sides
are congruent we can show that one pair
of opposite sides are parallel and
congruent we can show both pairs of
opposite angles are congruent or we can
show that diagonals bisect each other
because each one of those things is a
property of a parallelogram so if we can
prove any one of those things we can say
therefore this shape is a parallelogram
so unlike what triangle proofs we don't
have a we don't have like an a si or a
side angle side instead we're just going
to have to write out this that since
both pairs of opposite sides are
parallel this is a triangle or if both
pairs of opposite sides are parallel the
shape is a parallelogram so now let's do
some examples okay so given that D a D
which is this line right here is
parallel to C B and that D C a is
congruent to B AC prove that ABCD is a
parallelogram
okay so first we're going to write down
the given information so ad is parallel
to C B and angle D C a is congruent to
angle B a/c and our reason is that
that's given to us
so one thing I want you to notice is
that since these two lines are parallel
some of their angles are going to have a
special relationship to one another so
if you look this parallel line cut by
this transversal and this parallel line
form opposite or alternate interior
angles and if you remember the alternate
interior angles of a pair of a pair of
parallel lines are congruent so for our
next step we can say angle D AC is
congruent to angle B C a and then say if
alternate interior angles of parallel
lines then angles congruent okay so now
let's take note of what we already have
proven we know we just proved that this
is congruent to this we know that this
is congruent to this now I want you to
notice that these two triangles share
this side right here AC and if you
remember there's a property that says a
side is congruent to itself so since
they both share that we can say AC is
congruent to a/c and that's the
reflexive property
and now if you look we have an angle a
side and an angle and if you remember
that's one of our that's one of our ways
to prove triangles are congruent and you
might be asking why we need to prove
that these triangles are congruent well
to show that this is a parallelogram if
we can get this line congruent to this
line then we would have to a pair of
opposite lines that are parallel and
congruent and then we can say that we
have a parallelogram so next we can say
triangle D a/c is congruent to triangle
B C a and then we get and that's by
angle side angle next we can say that
ABCD is oh well no sorry my mistake
next we can say that a D is congruent to
CB because remember if triangles are
congruent corresponding parts are
congruent and I ran out of space but our
last step all right all right up here so
for our very last step we can say that a
b c g is a parallelogram and our reason
for that is if one pair opposite sides
I are congruent in parallel then it is a
parallelogram so that's going to be the
only one we're going to do today I'll
make another lesson on proving a
parallelogram is a parallelogram because
they involve a lot of work so make sure
you come back and watch that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
