video and in this is whirl
I'm going to show you guys some cool
tips and tricks with working with rows
and columns some cool things that didn't
show you yet
the first being how to insert a new row
in a new column so you may be thinking
okay
lucky I already know anytime I want to
insert a new row I'm just going to
scroll to the end and do something like
this typing all my data this hockey
player is named Bucky Roberts the
greatest hockey player of all time
however there are some cases where you
don't want to do this and the reason is
this even though this may look kind of
random at first glance it's actually
sorted by salary the highest to the
lowest so if we have a player that cost
somewhere around $5,000 we don't want to
insert it into the end right here we
actually need to insert a row right in
between these two players so how do we
do that well it's actually really easy
all you do is you select the row that
you want to insert a new one above right
click it and hit insert and since you
have a row selected it automatically
knows okay you're going to insert a new
row for a column what it's pretty much
the same thing but it automatically
detects that you have a column selected
so when you hit insert it inserts a new
column controls need to get rid of that
so that is how you insert a new row and
a new column now remember just like
before I think I already told you guys
had to delete stuff inside a row anytime
you want to delete the data inside a row
just go ahead and select it and hit
delete now again that doesn't actually
delete the row itself it just clears out
all of the data that was in that row if
you ever have an accidental blank row or
maybe you just need to get rid of the
row altogether then you need to
right-click it and actually select
delete so again the delete button on
your keyboard clears out all the data
inside the cells right-clicking and
delete actually wipes out or deletes the
entire row so
that's the difference between the two
now before I move on to kind of the next
concept I want to show you guys a cool
trick of resizing columns so we already
know a couple different ways that we can
resize columns we can of course double
click to fit to the data we can also
drag that manually but there are going
to be times where you have a couple
different columns and you want to make
them all the same exact size so what you
can do is this you can select multiple
columns by either clicking one and
dragging it to select and another cool
way that you can select multiple columns
that don't touch each other is if you
select one column and hold down control
on your keyboard you can actually click
and select the columns that don't touch
each other but anyways let's just say
that we want to have these three columns
be all the same size so we can either go
stretch this one to that or not like 150
and then we can do with this obviously
taking a long time so what's the
shortcut if we select all of these and
then we just go ahead and resize it to
something like I don't know 150 pixels
check that out
we just resized three columns and one
fell sweep at once saved us a bunch of
time so that my friends is not only how
you insert rows and columns but also how
you can resize multiple columns at once
pretty sweet so now eleven since I have
a few more minutes I'll show you guys
some other cool ways that you can select
particular types of data now of course
we know that we can select one type of
data just by clicking it and also a
range of data by dragging but they're
going to come times where we want to
select um I don't even know how to say
it like special types of data for
instance we're going to want to select
all the numbers in our spreadsheet so
what we can do is we can go through and
look into okay this is the number so I'm
going to select this and this however
even though this may look kind of like a
big
spreadsheet at first since we're just
new to a Microsoft Excel this is
actually a really small one some
spreadsheets have hundreds of columns
hundreds of rows so on and so forth so
if we ever wanted to format all the
numbers it could take like an hour to
select everything unless we had a
shortcut and that's this if we're in our
home and we go over to the editing panel
look at this thing that says find and
select in from the drop-down list if you
click this little arrow hit go to
special what this allows you to do is
select a special set of data so if we
ever want to just say select all the
numbers then click on constants and
uncheck everything except numbers and
what this is going to do is is pretty
much kind of select as you can see right
here all of the numbers hit OK and look
what happens all of the numbers in our
spreadsheet are selected save this a
bunch of time we don't have to do
anything manually and it did it
perfectly how awesome is that so that is
how we select all numbers now we can do
something like I know I didn't show you
guys had to a like make a fill color but
if we ever want like bold all the
numbers pretty sweet</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
