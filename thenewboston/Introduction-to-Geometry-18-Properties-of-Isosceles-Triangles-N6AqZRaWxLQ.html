and they're their properties so if two
sides of an isosceles triangle are
congruent then the angles opposite the
sides are also congruent so this side is
congruent to this side of this triangle
so that means that the angle across from
this side and the angle across from this
side are equal so if this angle equals
24 that must mean that X also equals 24
if I know that this side is congruent to
this side that means this angle is
congruent with this angle so if this
angle equals 68 degrees that means that
Y has T will 68 degrees and just if we
wanted to we could use our interior
angles of a triangle property to find
out what this equals so 24 plus 24 plus
C equals 180 48 plus C equals 180 so Z
has to equal 132 so we can do the same
thing for this one
we'll call this w this is 176 136 plus W
equals 180 W equals 44 so the next
property of two angles of an isosceles
triangle are congruent then the sides
opposite the angles are congruent so
since these two angle angles have the
same measure they're congruent so that
means the sides opposite them I have to
be congruent so if this side is equal to
8 X has to equal 8 and these two have
the same measure therefore they're
congruent so the sides opposite that
those angles have to be congruent so
this side equals 13 so y must equal 13
and we don't have any way of finding
what this other side is quite yet so
that's all we have to do for that one so
next video we're gonna talk about ratio
and proportions in order to compare
triangles so make sure you come back and
watch that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
