this video definitely the coolest video
yet I'm going to show you how to set
this up on an actual server so this
server that I'm SSH into right now
I just bought on digitalocean it was
five bucks a month and all it has is a
boon to 14.04 and I think it came with a
lamp but you don't even need that all
you just need a regular old abouttwo and
I chose a bun to 14.04 it becomes a
because it comes with Python three and
that's what I coded this in and it
really doesn't even matter that much
where you stick your file but what I'm
gonna do is here I'll show you guys what
we're doing alright so basically what
we're going to do is we're going to take
this server dot py right there and we're
gonna plop it on our server and then
we're just going to run it and then
we're just going to be that's it we're
just gonna listen for clients to connect
so then you move into somewhere I'm not
gonna mess anything up and I'm getting
kind of confused because I keep having
the switch between Unix commands and
then windows commands and they're all
different I don't know why they just
don't standardize on but whatever
alright so right now in my main website
I have two files and these are just the
files that came with and that's just the
default home page and there's HTML and
PHP version so what I want to do now is
I want to create this server py file so
I'm gonna copy all this and you can use
whatever editor you want I don't
I'm as sudo right now so I'll just write
nano server to I and this is if you
don't know just a text editor that you
can use from the command line so if you
hit enter it's going to open up this and
forgot it's different for every freaking
thing how you paste in art so once you
do that just paste in all of your source
code and there are alternative ways that
you can do this as well but since we
only have one file
we can just paste it in and once it's
pasted in just hold ctrl X Y and enter
so now what that did is it basically
saved all that data to serve it up py
and now we can verify that by writing
ket's server dot P Y and this prints out
all the data inside server dot B Y so we
can validate that it did indeed work so
now as you can see we have that file on
our server now to actually run this you
actually write Python 3 if you just
write Python it's going to be two point
seven and then server dot py now before
I do this if you guys don't even know
the IP address of your server then just
like I have config and then your IP
address is going to be right here and
you're going to need this for the client
so let me just copy this now and make
sure you have that copy or your just
write it down if you want and now what
you can do is this soap lake on three
server dot py hit enter so now the
script is on our server and it is
running it is listening and we don't
even need this anymore
and let me make sure I got the right IP
address all right so now check this out
type in the IP address right here
without the protocol and now this is the
program and again that's the only thing
you have to change that's going to be
running on your client so right now the
clients going to be running again
they're probably not gonna have pycharm
they're just gonna do this from wherever
and check out what happens in here
connection has been established and I
want to show you guys something real
cool all right so again this is SSH
right into my server so now if I just
write dir in even though I'm on my
server I could be anywhere in the world
you see what happened right there it
took it and it ran it right in here now
I can basically control this computer
anyway right echo hey and you see it
runs echo hey I can even do something
like echo sucker bacon dot text and
watch what happens this actually creates
a new file called bacon text on their
computer right from there
and again remember since we fixed change
directories we can change directory and
then I don't know maybe we want to look
at the contents of there whoa check it
out so we basically have full access to
the targets machine using a reverse
shell pretty stinking awesome and there
you go ladies and gentlemen so what I'm
gonna do is I'm gonna actually take this
and put it on github and if you guys
want to improve it or help me work on it
on anyway you know any way possible
maybe you want to make it multi-threaded
who knows then it just send me a commit
and then I'll review it and you know
hopefully it'll get a good community
reverse shell work and so same guys for
watching make sure to check out my other
videos hopefully you guys learned
something stay protected from hackers
and yeah I will see you guys in the next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
