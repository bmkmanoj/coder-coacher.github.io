tutorial where we are finally going to
be testing our final product and see how
it works and if it works so what I did
while you were gone is I actually
uploaded the analysis folder which has
the analysis a script in it uploaded to
my server and also I'm just one little
thing in the last tutorial I think it
was average decreased percentage I
accidentally had that as integer so I
went ahead and I changed that back to a
float so if you guys were copying me for
my last order remember that that should
be a float not an integer so now if we
go ahead and click on analysis a we can
see that it has zero rows so far which
basically means that it didn't analyze
any data so in order to analyze the data
just go ahead and click on analysis and
click on your script and whenever it
does it hopefully we don't get any error
messages and as long as nothing's
popping up that's a good sign so far so
what we need to do here is go ahead back
to our table and refresh and see what we
get oh yeah looking pretty good we have
some information in there so go ahead
and click analysis a it says it has five
rows and yeah it's looking pretty good
all of our tickets it ran through
successfully and it has data so what I
would do right now is I would actually
have to go through each of these tables
since we know that this data is valid
already and I would actually need to you
know either through Microsoft Excel or
maybe just with a graphing calculator or
something figure out if these numbers
are correct but right now at first
glance that are looking pretty correct
looking like we did a pretty good job
here so let me talk you through what
each row means one last time so each of
these stands for one company Netflix
Ford Yahoo Adobe and GE now the number
of days is different because for Netflix
when did we analyze that for um let's
see it was December 19th to Sept 2011
until today so basically from that date
until today it went up four days and I
actually think I ran on the script like
a week over
thing and by that I mean stock
downloader so that's why I may not have
the full two weeks and maybe only one
week or something
but anyways days increase means how many
days did it increase after it went down
now the percentage of days it increases
basically if you take the total number
of days of data it has and you put four
over that number so basically if we look
at this the GE is really easy to see the
days increased is three the total days
is 3 plus 1 which is 4 so the percentage
of 3 over 4 is 75% 1 over 4 is 25% it
just is another way of taking this over
the total basically a percentage of how
likely or how many days does that
increase out of 100 so the average
increase percent is a little bit
different what this is is every day that
increases it increases by a different
amount some days it increases by one
percent some days two and a half percent
some days one and a half percent it
takes all those averages and kind of
figures them all together and gives it
to you in this number right here and
these next three are just for the
decreasing so basically in that time
span it decrease to one day which was 25
percent of the data and it decreased by
an average of 9 or excuse me almost 1
percent so now this buckey's by value in
Bucky's cell value is it basically takes
the average decrease percent and it
multiplies it by the percentage of days
decrease and we get that value right
there so if we see 25 times negative one
or something close to negative one gives
you this and if we have 75 times one
point one seven that's what we end up
with so it's pretty much like an
indicator that factors in not only how
many days but also the strength of
change so there you go there you have it
I know this is kind of confusing but hey
if you guys ever work with a you know
get a job in programming or PHP they're
going to have you write a bunch a lot
harder more confusing scripts than this
and also it's going to have you you know
work with a whole lot more data than you
know just five rows
this is where you guys get used to and
yeah it's one of the bad things about
being a programmer but hey it was fun
thank you guys for sticking with me for
my first project hopefully I learned a
little something
and again don't forget I am going to be
taking all of this code and you guys can
have it for free on my website if you go
to tnb forum comm it's all there for you
guys you don't have to pay for it just
go and grab it and play with it so again
one - on thank you guys so much for
watching and it's been fun and I'll guys
we'll see you uh well I'll see you
around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
