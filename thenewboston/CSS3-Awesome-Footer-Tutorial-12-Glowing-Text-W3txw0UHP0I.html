video and in this tutorial gonna learn
some more cool effects first of all what
I want to do is show you guys have them
how to make the buttons change color
dynamically as you can see whenever you
hover over them and also you see how
whenever you hover over a link that it
appears to glow I'm gonna show you guys
how to do that I think it's pretty cool
you know definitely a lot cooler than
normal links it kind of looks like it
lights up and you can use this not only
for this footer but also on other web
pages well it works really good whenever
you have a dark web page by anyways
let's go ahead and get started so the
first thing we want to do is change the
color of our buttons whenever we hover
over them so our buttons were these list
items so let me just go ahead and copy
that and we already know from the
notification icons that in order to add
a property on hover you just add
semicolon or excuse me : hover that
means whenever you hover over this item
what do you want to happen well the only
thing we want to do is change the
background color to make a appear a
little bit darker so right now the
opacity is 0.1 which is basically 10%
opacity we want to change this to 30%
opacity so then whenever we hover over
it you see the button not the text but
the button is getting darker that's the
effect that we just created now the next
thing I want to do is I want a style
this text right here pretty much the
text on the button so of course in order
to do this
okay might as well take this out footer
menu oh let's see the best way to do
this this li is the button and the link
is just your no link is the a I really
don't know why they named link tags a if
anyone knows that let me know
interesting so what we want to do with
the links or the text on the buttons the
first thing we want to do is we want to
display it is a block and this will
allow us to position an easier you know
whenever we're moving there
- margins and padding's and stuff now
the color by default we want to set this
as this color si si si si si si now si
si si si si si is it's a very light gray
it almost looks white whenever it's on a
black background but this is actually a
very light gray and this other text in
the menu is as well it's one of my
favorite colors actually because it's so
light where it you can see it clearly
but it's very subtle and uh well anyways
I'll stop talking about the gray but it
is a freaking sweet color and the text
decoration for this is none because
sometimes browsers like to put
underlines under links and for this you
don't want to underline under that so
text decoration equals none so that's
our default text block light gray no
text decoration as you can see now
whenever you notice if I hover over this
link right here then it turns white and
also this text right here it appears to
be glowing so it goes from gray that
light gray I was talking about to a
bright white that gives the effect that
whenever you touch it it glows now this
is actually really simple you guys can
probably figure out how to do this a
hover hover and the only thing we want
to do on hover is change the color from
gray to white so right now what we did
is not only did we make the entire
button darken whenever we hover over it
but also when we hover over the text
itself it appears to be glowing now a
lot of people say you know what why
don't you just tie this all together and
this is why the button is for the drop
menu this text right here it can be a
separate link for example on my account
this takes you to the main account or
you can choose to go to any of these sub
links as well so you don't want to have
the button be one single thing I like
the button and the text separate
to these and that's why in it it makes
more sense whenever you're using the
website as well but anyways that is how
you darken the button and also make text
that glows whenever you hover over it
and in the next tutorial I'm going to
show you guys how to style this home
button and it's a little bit different
than the rest of them so make sure to
watch that but for now thank guys for
watching don't forget subscribe and I'll
see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
