and in this video we're going to be
talking about random access files and
let me tell you why we would ever want
to use a random access file or access it
in that way
now this isn't like a new type of file
it's pretty much just a different way of
working with the same file so we can use
um random access tools on this file you
don't have like half of your files on
your computer are sequential half are
random just how you work with it and
open it so the reason that you may want
to use it in this way is because of this
say that we have a long poem right here
and we only want to change one little
word in the middle maybe we had a typo
well before we only had the tools to
read an entire file or write an entire
file but what we want to do is we just
want to go in the middle of it jump
around to the middle right there and
just edit a little bit of it well the
other tools are kind of powerful so this
is kind of like um like a surgeon you go
in and just rip out a specific part well
a surgeon probably wouldn't rip
something out he'd probably do it
delicately so that's what I'm going to
teach you guys how to do just my headset
I got like the most comfortable headset
I don't know it's called I post it on my
forum I don't know I was the below but
freaking loved it don't even know I said
that don't worry about it so before our
tools were W for write R for read in a
for a pen and the truth is those are the
only letters you can use but there are
different modes as well or ways to
enhance it should I say so we can you is
use W plus and what this means is
whenever we add a plus the end this it
means open the file open it for writing
first and then after that this plus
means that we can read it afterwards so
this means open a file for writing first
then reading and also what I want to do
is this let's use a new example so
delete everything out of there and save
your file
don't delete the file just leave all the
crap out of it so now we have the tool
to
pretty much use this as a sequential
access file or excuse me a random access
file so now that we just have a blank
file let's go ahead and just print
something on the screen so f puts and by
the screen I mean the file of course
and what's the dumbest thing I can think
of I ate three pumpkins today and that
actually is true ladies and gentlemen
and f pointer so again just like before
this print something in your file don't
believe me check it out our file now
says I ate three pumpkins they okay well
Bucky you said that you're going to be
teaching me about random access files
and this is pretty much just a frickin
sequential file I'm not learning
anything new here well let's go ahead
and start learning that sequential crap
that I promised yet now the first thing
I want to do is show you guys about a
new function called F see what this
function does is it takes your file
pointer which resembles the cursor right
here and instead of just starting at the
beginning or the end for reading and
writing and appending you can actually
hop to a specific part anywhere in your
file so you can hop the like right there
if you want to so say that we wanted to
keep this first part of the sentence I
ate three but I forgot it wasn't
pumpkins that a is actually three
munchkins that at a so I want to change
it so we'll go one two three four five
six seven so remember that we want to
start at the seventh location in our
file so just keep that in mind even
though you don't know how to do it so
the first parameter it takes is okay
what file pointer do you want me to move
around well we only have one file
pointer the second parameter is what
position actually let me type this out
and then you guys are going to
understand what's going on
seek underscore set
so again what this function does is it
takes a file pointer and it moves it to
somewhere in your your file
now this seek set parameter seek set
means start at the beginning of the file
why they named it seek set I don't know
it they should be seeked to the
beginning would be a lot easier but now
you know what it does so it says start
at the beginning and the second
parameter seven is pretty much saying
how many characters or how many spaces
do you want me to move it so again start
at the beginning
now hit right on your keyboard sometimes
one two three four five six seven so now
our file pointer is right after that
three and now whenever you write to it
it doesn't overwrite this beginning
stuff it just over writes right there so
now if we just do something like f puts
we can fix this and remember since we
are butted up against the three right
now we need to add a space in our string
first or else it'll uh nope here bunch
together Munchkins on Friday so it
wasn't pumpkins I ate today actually
munchkins on Friday my apologies so f
puts of course we knew that in file
pointer so it knows to move it and
whenever you run this check out our file
so kept the i-83
and then what it did is it pretty much
took that string the F puts and put it
in place beginning at wherever we told
the fire pointer to move now just so I
show you guys one other thing we change
this all right and get rid of the string
so remember seek set means start from
the beginning of your file but there are
some instances where we want to start
from the end and in this case this is a
little easier to remember seek end
so again set means beginning and means
and I don't know kind of weird but now
another thing is whenever we start from
the end this just puts your file pointer
in a starting location if we put seven
now then it would start at the end and
try to move it seven forward however if
you ever want to move backwards then
that metal parameter has to be a
negative number so let's uh I don't know
to something like this
so right now one two three four five six
all right so we'll put i3 munchkins on
seek at the end move back six spaces and
write something else whatever I think of
whatever pops into my stupid brain all
right
so seek at the end and negative six
which means move back six spaces in um
okay so it says I three munchkins on I
don't know on top of a mountain
this story is getting incredibly dumb
but at least we learn how to work with a
random access file so run this bad boy
and check it out the first thing it
printed was I three pumpkins today and
then replace that I three munchkins on
Friday and then it took Friday move back
six and replaced it with on top of
mountain so again this actually makes
sense I three munchkins on top of a
mountain so all the crap that we did we
now got the world's dumbest sentence so
guys not only do you know how to work
with random access files but you also
learned what the world's dumbest
sentence was and that is I three
munchkins on top of mountain so now that
your brain is filled with this useless
information and also some useful
information we can move away from files
and on to functions so that's what we're
going to be covering in the next soro
and it's actually a really cool part of
C so uh I don't know I'm going to stop
talking now go eat some lunch again see
you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
