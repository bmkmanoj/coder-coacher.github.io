stack that we have to set up is PHP so
in order to install PHP sudo apt-get
install PHP 5 that's the version that
we're trying to use and I'm also going
to recommend two additional packages
that make PHP compatible with the server
that is already set up and that's a Lib
Apache 2 - mod - PHP 5 and also PHP 5 -
M crypt so alright looks good hit enter
and let it do its thing do you want to
use this much memory yes I do and we now
have PHP installed on our server easy as
that so clear now one other thing that
I'm gonna recommend is this right now by
default the way our server is set up if
a user ever requests a directory not any
specific file but just the main
directory it's gonna look through that
folder for a file called index.html now
since we're running a PHP based website
we actually want to change this to index
dot PHP since we're usually going to be
serving PHP files not just static HTML
files so show you guys how to change
that right now it's actually an Apache
setting not a PHP setting so sudo nano
get that sweet text editor et Cie Apache
to mods - enabled dirt dot-com all right
looks good alright so this is one of the
configuration files for Apache and as
you can see whenever you open it it's
gonna say ok you requested the directory
index so we're gonna look through it in
this order we're gonna look through for
a file called index.html then index cgi
yada yada yada and eventually index dot
PHP
well actually we want to search for
index dot PHP first so if I scroll over
here and just delete index that PHP then
I could bump it to
the front so index dot PHP so now we
gave it the proper order to search
through and now if we just hold ctrl X
yes to confirm or excuse me yes to save
our changes in enter to confirm and the
last thing that we need to do in order
for those changes to take into effect is
restart apache so sudo service Apache to
restart we're starting pachi that did it
it done looking good now if you ever
need to install any additional modules
then it's actually a really easy apt -
cache search PHP 5 - so check this out
you can search through all the modules
and I don't know maybe you want to
install like oh it's fun a good one
maybe like Jason like people use Jason
all the time whenever they're making
page P sites so let me clear this now if
you ever just want to look at a package
and not install it just for some more
information about it you can use apt -
cache show and then type the package
name now I happen to know since I
installed it on almost all my project
that there is a package called PHP 5 -
Jason
so if I want to check this out just
throw in this command hit enter and it's
gonna give you a bunch of information
about it what it is you know the size of
it a bunch of other stuff who made it
now to actually install the package sudo
not odo
sudo apt-get install and then just the
package name which is PHP 5 - Jason so
hit enter downloads it installs it boom
good to go and yes once texted me again
I should probably just put my phone on
vibrate but uh yeah whatever
and if we actually go to this website
we're gonna see hmm just got this
default apache homepage so real quick
i'm gonna show you guys how to just make
a real quick home page for testing so
it's
the cell alright so let's open up our
awesome text editor Nano and I know that
our files go in VAR w W HTML index dot
PHP so we're gonna open up this index
dot PHP file and we'll just put some
like a real quick echo statement on
there so PHP let go hey baby don't say
maybe
alright this website is definitely gonna
be awesome control X Y Enter
all right so now we have that file and
actually let me show you something else
I want to add one other page info dot
PHP this is a little bit more
interesting so I'm going to run this and
on info dot PHP I'm just gonna print out
PHP info and this just gives you a bunch
of information about your PHP
installation in case you want to tweak
any of it control X Y Enter alright so
our home page says hey baby they don't
say maybe and then we also have another
page that we made and I'll show you guys
that right now so this is our home page
hey baby don't say maybe and we can also
go to info dot PHP and this is what I
was talking about all of the information
about you know PHP if you want to change
any settings or anything feel free to
read through that it's incredibly
exciting trust me
and if you ever want to remove any files
so let's say for example re our home
page is looking sweet but this info page
you know we really don't want the users
seeing this for security purposes so all
we have to do is use sudo RM and then
you write whatever file you want to
remove so VAR w w HTML info dot PHP and
now we removed or deleted that file
so now if we try to refresh it it's not
found but of course our homepage still
is since we didn't delete that so there
you go that's how you set up PHP and get
it working on your server and yeah
you're ready to now start developing
your website</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
