and in this tutorial i will be teaching
you how to use includes in PHP and what
this does is make things like header and
footers so you can include a bunch of
times and you can only change your lunch
and then we'll change on every single
page of your website so as you can see I
have two files tester page and a welcome
PHP on welcome PHP I'm just going to go
ahead and make a simple PHP script right
now and all I'm going to do is a make
you can make it say anything you want
I'm just going to make mine say easy
Hoss and that's it all we have is a PHP
that makes it says it just has easy ha
so right now ode output easy Hoss on the
screen so let's save that and that's all
we have now on tester page PHP which is
a totally different page that doesn't
say easy a house at all let's go ahead
and create a basic website
just saw user HTML and body tags
and you can just end it oops that
switched up
now in the body of your website you're
going to want to go ahead and create
another PHP tag and what this tag is
going to do is it's going to call your
welcome
PHP so we're going to want to do easy
Hoss we're going to want that on this
page so here's what we do on your tester
page PHP in your PHP code that's
embedded in the body we're going to want
to write include and in your parameters
you're going to want to write whatever
other PHP script you want to include so
I'm going to write welcome PHP and of
course you got to put it in double
quotation marks and end that so the only
thing that goes in your parameters is
whatever script you want to include and
end that with a semicolon and then this
is the only PHP script that we're going
to have on our tester page
now on the next line just to show you
guys um let's create a heading one that
says welcome people
and let's just create a paragraph real
quick it says any now all star
so as you can see right now we have a
heading that says welcome people and a
paragraph that says hey now all-star and
this PHP that includes welcome PHP now
here's what's going to happen as a
website slogan it's going to go all
right here's your body
PHP wants to include this file so it's
going to go look for this file output
the word easy Hoss and then finish
writing the rest of your website so
let's save this refresh it and as you
can see it goes easy Hoss welcome people
hey now I'll start now why is this
useful instead just writing it right
here let's say you wanted to put this on
a hundred different web pages all you
don't have to do is change this let's
right take it easy Bessie and save it on
this one page and then whenever you save
this
you can see it would change on every
single webpage and that saves you a
bunch of time from going to web page
your web page and updating each one one
by one with this include you could
change it one time and it could change
on every single web page on your website
so that's a very simple way of using and
include to make headers and footers so I
hope you enjoyed I hope you learned
something and if you like my tutorials
