slash on live gamer from the new Boston
and in this tutorial we're gonna learn a
little bit more about graphics so you
can see here that I have the graphics
demo open if you don't know what this is
you may want to move back to the
previous tutorial and we just created
this app that whenever you click draw a
rectangle it'll draw a rectangle onto
the form now you can see that we don't I
deleted the code that drew drew the
rectangle onto the form and we're gonna
be doing something a little bit
different now so come over here to form
one click your lightning bolt and we
need to find the click event so here's
our click well double-click on it
so whenever the person clicks on form 1
what we want to do is let's just say
draw new rectangle now we will get an
error when we do this because there's no
such thing as draw a new rectangle so we
need to create it
so private sub draw new rectangle and
we're going to need the exposition so by
the exposition as integer and then the Y
position so Y position as integer okay
so whenever they draw the rectangle and
whenever they click draw a new rectangle
let's just go ahead and type G dot draw
rectangle will do or let's do a fill
rectangle so G dot fill rectangle and
we'll do brushes dot let's make it cadet
blue and then we will do the exposition
so x-position y-position and we'll just
make it 60 by 60
okay so now all we need to do is we need
to pass the expose position and the Y
position to our draw a new rectangle
method so you can see here that we have
four for more click we have five
Alcindor as system object the sender is
the object of the form and then we have
E as system event args now he has a
whole bunch of stuff that we can use so
for our event args we're just going to
use e dot X and e dot Y but you can see
that there is no such thing as e dot X
and e dot Y so what we need to do is
change to something else so right now is
it is system event args we need to
change it to Mouse event args
so Mouse event arguments so what this is
going to do is when we access a dot X
it's going to give us the x position of
the mouse so a dot X it says gets the
x-coordinate of the mouse during the
generating Mouse event so we're going to
draw a new rectangle at position x and y
now you could do all of this right here
up in form one click but it's always
good to put it in a different method
so that's easier to change in the future
so we'll go ahead and run this and you
can see that when I click the top-left
corner of our square is going to be
where I clicked again you can see it's
going to keep adding new squares so what
we can do is so that we create a new
square each time we just need to refresh
the form so me dot refresh says forces
the control to invalidate it's client
area and immediately redraw itself so it
redraws itself and gets rid of any
graphics that are already on there so
it draws a square and then when we click
it again it's gonna draw a square
somewhere else and the squares disappear
each time and it draws a new square now
we can even draw it behind our button so
go ahead put this code in if you have it
it's very simple just make sure that you
change eetu mouse event args so that you
can access the x position and the Y
position of the mouse you have any
questions leave them in the comments and
then once you've done that go ahead and
move on to the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
