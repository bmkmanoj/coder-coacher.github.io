we did is we learned this really awesome
shortcut of how to make a non hard-coded
URLs and this is the proper way that you
should do it in all of our templates but
let's go ahead and take a step back and
think about things for just a second I
mean right now this project is pretty
small it only has one app music but what
happens when we start creating more apps
maybe we're going to make another one
for videos maybe we're going to make
another one for profile form whatever so
basically what I'm trying to say is
usually sites have like 10 or 20 or even
more apps so that's fine however what
happens when another app aside for music
has the same detail view maybe it has
video detail view profile detail view
well then whenever Django tries to look
at this template it says alright you're
telling me to get the URL pattern for
detail but I have one in music one in
videos what the heck URL pattern am I
supposed to know what you're talking
about
well we solved that problem by
namespacing our URLs that means that we
need to say or specify oh whenever we
wrote this detail right here we're
actually talking about music app detail
view and it's really easy to do above
your URL patterns in music slash URLs
just go ahead and write app underscore
name and just set this to whatever your
app name is in this case music so now we
can go ahead and copy this and we can
actually use this in our template so
instead of just specifying alright URL
pattern detail we can write music detail
and now what we're saying is alright
instead of just looking for a generic
detail pattern actually go in the music
app and look for that specific detail
one so another cool thing is now we can
have this keyword in however many apps
we want so that works out pretty awesome
and the last thing I want to talk to you
guys about in this tutorial is kind of
unrelated from all of that but this is
kind of important because later on in
the future tutorials I'm going to use
this logic
you know I didn't kind of want to skip
over it you see in your views right here
and in your detailed view whenever we
look at the details of album we're
basically saying okay
try to get that album with some specific
ID and right now we have a album with ID
of one and two
now if we ever try to you know query
album whose ID doesn't exist like 78
then it's going to raise this exception
so this is pretty much what people
always do all the time they pretty much
try to get something from the database
and if it doesn't exist
raisa 404 so since people were doing
this over and over and over again what
the developers of Django did is they
give you guys a real nice shortcut to
pretty much write all of this in one
line of code so how do you do that
well right after render go ahead and
it's from jingle shortcuts right get
object or 404 so we can actually
actually let me cut this right here all
right so you can actually delete your
entire track except statement and here I
won't even paste it in all right so
instead of this what we can do is write
album equals get object or 404 album
primary key equals album ID so right
here replaces that entire try except
statement so it does exactly what you
think it's going to try to get an object
which object well something from the
album class and this is where you
specify what album it tries to get now
if it can't get it is just going to go
ahead and throw your 404 so this is a
lot more condensed then your try except
so I can go ahead and delete that and
now check this out it says are you
aren't even using this import anymore so
we can actually delete that too
so look how condensed this viewed up py
file is I mean that is awesome and
there's a lot of logic in here that we
pretty much clean up real nice and neat
so yeah there you go a couple cool
tricks then guys for watching
I'll see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
