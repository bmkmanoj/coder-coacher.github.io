tutorial that I'm making for the new
Boston and in this tutorial I'm going to
be showing you how to use bitwise
operators a little bit more so all you
need for this tutorial is a button a
short and a message box that will
display that short in a message box so
in the previous tutorial we looked at
the and and the or bitwise operators and
the exceptional or which we're going to
look at today it's similar to the and
and the or and that they all compare by
it they're the bits so in order to do
exceptional or you're going to have to
have two numbers one before the operator
and one after it so in order to do the
exceptional or bitwise operator you're
going to do a carat so you're just going
to do shift and hit the six key and then
we're going to the number after the
operators we're going to do five so then
three exceptional or five and three in
binary is one one and I'm just gonna put
a zero in front of it because five in
binary is three digits and this way
you'll be able to compare the bits now
we're going to do exceptional or five
which is 1 0 1 environment and the only
way to get a 1 in using exceptional
award is if both the bits are different
so since both of these bits are the same
right here they're both 1 then we will
get a 0 since these are both different
then we get a 1 since these are
different we'll get a 1 so in a message
box we should get 1 1 2 0 yep if we were
to do on 3 exceptional or 4 then it'd be
different because 1 and 0 are different
so it's get a 1 1 and 0 different again
so we get a 1 and 0 and 1 are different
so we get another one so we should get
all 1 2 this time yep
the next fit was operator them going to
be showing you is these shift operators
and the shift will basically just shift
the bits in a direction we're going to
shift three one to the left so in order
to shift you just don't want to do to
less than or two greater than signs and
this will shift it to the right so if we
do three shift to the right one it'll
physically shift those bits one to the
latter to the right
so since on three in binary is one one
it'll shift those bits one to the right
and it will just cut off this bit
because it won't be there anymore I'll
just shift all the bits this way so we
should only get one in a message box so
we should just get one because it shifts
these bits that way yep and a better
example would be five shifting because 5
is 1 0 1 so it will just shift these all
this way though this shift this bit yeah
this bit one to the right so we'll only
have one zero
we should get one zero now in a message
box hey ok the next or thil and the last
bitwise operator that I'm going to be
showing you is shift left and now let's
do the exact opposite it will shift the
bits to the left so it will shift all
these bits one place to the left so we
well now get 1 0 1 since there already
isn't a number there it will just fill
it with a 0 so just shift all the bits 1
this way so we should get one zero one
zero and a message box yeah if we were
to do that with three three would just
be one one right here and then if we
were to shift all these one to the left
we would get 1 1 2 0
we get shifted to the left oh no just
added your arm yet yep so that's pretty
much it for this tutorial so see you
guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
