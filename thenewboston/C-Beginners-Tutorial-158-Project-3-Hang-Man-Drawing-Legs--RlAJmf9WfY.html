fifty eight c-sharp tutorial than I'm
making for the new Boston and in this
tutorial we're going to continue working
on our hangman project and we're just
going to finish up drawing our guy we're
actually going to drawing you likes in
this tutorial so just like before I have
all the code copied already so I already
have to do is type else/if and we're
going to check to see if the body part
that use it passes through the draw body
part method is left legs are going to
say if B P equals body parts dot a lot
like and then we're just going to
basically draw a diagonal line from here
to about here and I already have the
code for that so copy that right here
and paste all right so on the starting
position is sixty one seven and sixty on
the x-axis is right on the character's
body so 60 is right there and sixty one
seventy is right there to be exact and
then we're gonna want to go 3190 so the
difference between 60 and 30 is 30 so
we're going to want to go over
approximately 30 pixels so it's not on
home about there and then we're gonna
want to go down 20 so that's the
difference between 170 and ninety one
ninety is 20 so we're gonna go over to
about there and then down 20 so about
there and connect those we should get a
line like that alright so now let's draw
the body part to draw body cards and
just draw that left leg right there and
there you go
perfect a lucky leg and now we just got
to finish up and draw the right leg so
I'm gonna say else if the body part
equals right leg then we're just going
to draw on my diagonal line right there
just a mirror image of this
right here so I already have the code
for that just like before and there you
go and just like the left leg it starts
at 61 70s so it starts right there and
then it goes to 91 90 and just like
before everything's gonna want to be on
the same y-axis so it's gonna be on as
if he's standing on a flat surface on
the ground so you know where he's gonna
be on the y-axis we just don't know
where it's going to be on me we just
don't know where it's going to be on the
x-axis and on the x-axis he's going to
be 90 so since the center is 60 right
here and the difference between 30 and
60 is 30 so we went over 30 on this side
well we're just gonna want to go over 30
on this side as well so it go over 30 so
approximately right there so 60 plus 30
is 90 and now we know exactly where he's
going to be since it's gone this says
it's going to be on this line right here
so there we go now let's draw his right
leg draw body parts and write like
alright so now there you go perfect and
these are on the same line at the bottom
right there so that's pretty much it for
this tutorial we finally finished
drawing our hangman in the next tutorial
we're going to be handling things like
getting a random word or someone to
guess all right so see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
