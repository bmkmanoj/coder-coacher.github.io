go over the sprite confirm this is seen
often in input forms whenever you are
creating a password or you're creating
an account where you have to put in your
email it's see the scene on either email
or password I don't think I've seen it
on very many other forms but what this
is is when you have two different input
boxes you want to check one against the
other for instance you type in your
password and you're asked to reenter
your password just to make sure that you
have it correct so in this tutorial I'm
going to show you how to do that using
the sprite validation confirm in
Dreamweaver cs4 so let's get started
click spry validation inside of your
insert tab and it's going to say the
dream we were did not detect an element
to validate against so what that means
is that we do not have any fields that
it it can look at to check against so
first we have to create some text input
boxes so we can match up the confirm
with a text box so what we're going to
do is we're going to create two
different text boxes and we don't need
to give it a name we need we do need to
give it an ID so i'm going to say ID is
confirm and we'll copy that up here and
here i'm going to say ID is password i'm
going to change this type too
oh whoops to pass work will go I'm also
going to add a break tag in there so we
could break them up a little bit we go
all right there we go we have two
different text fields and so now that we
have our original text password field
and our confirm password field now we
can go in and we can click on sir I
validation confirm and it's going to
give it an ID of confirm I'm going to
leave a label blank alright we go up
here and it's still do the same thing I
was doing the last tutorial it's for
some reason dreamweaver what does not
like to show the properties as soon as I
click inside of that spans I'm going to
click on page properties right here and
say okay and now we can see that we have
a few options here of course we're going
to leave the required check because we
want to check our passwords against each
other you can see that we can either
validate against the password or we can
validate against the confirm and what
that's saying is since we created an ID
of confirm an ID you password it's going
to check one or the other and in this
instance we would like to check against
password because that is the first one
so
let's check this out inside of the
browser
oops
there we go so I'm going to go back here
and I'm going to get rid of this because
we do not need the sky since they
created it for us we only needed to
create one text field originally so I'm
going to run this again and talk you
through exactly what's going on so i'm
going to type in a password in the first
one and then i'm going to type in the
exact same thing in the second one and
as you can see since i typed in the
exact same thing it validated it and it
allowed it to be submitted and so i'm
going to now i'm going to do the same
thing except the next in the in the
confirm box i'm going to type something
that is not what i type before you can
see that it's telling us the values
don't match so just to recap what we do
here is we create an input box of type
password and then we create clicks
privation and that's going to create
another input box forests of type
password and it's going to give it a
name of confirm an ID of confirm two
since that's what we described inside of
our up inside of our box once we click
on spy validation and it created all
this for us and basically all we had to
do was just click on as probably
validation confirm and it created a all
the logic forest to confirm that two
password boxes or text boxes are the
same thing so in the next tutorial we're
going to be going over the last sprite
validation and that is the validation of
radio groups so make sure that you guys
check that tutorial out and don't forget
to subscribe and I will see you in the
next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
