biology video and in this video we're
gonna be going over the krebs cycle and
it's also called the citric acid cycle
so what do you want to call it just go
ahead and take your pick
I'm gonna call it the Krebs cycle
because I think that's what more people
commonly do but if you want to call it
the citric acid cycle go ahead but the
important thing is in the last tutorial
we've left or we ended with pyruvic acid
which is C 3 H 4 o 3 and this is pyruvic
acid now in order to enter the krebs
cycle which is a series of chemical
reactions what we need to do is we
actually need to prepare this molecule
by putting it through a few chemical
reactions and changing it up a bit so
basically whenever we perform glycolysis
or we don't well I guess we do do you
know our bodies do it what happens is
the entire process is performed in the
cytoplasm but the Krebs cycle is
actually performed in the mitochondria
so after glycolysis these pyruvic acid
molecules remember we have two of them
they head over to the interior of the
mitochondria so remember we said that
here's the mitochondria and this is the
outer membrane and it also has an inner
membrane which is right here it means
you're a cool-looking mitochondria and
this stuff in here is called the matrix
and this is a bunch of fluid inside here
so this is very matrix and the matrix is
actually where the krebs cycle is going
to be performed but we'll get to that in
a second so basically after glycolysis
what happens is these perova Casson
molecules they head over to the matrix
because they want to begin the Krebs
cycle however on the way something
happens what happens is a couple enzymes
or actually one enzyme is going to rip
off some of these electrons and it's
going to stick them on to a molecule
called n a d-plus
now this molecule is going to combine
with a hydrogen from the environment but
the important thing we have to take away
here is this NAD+ is eventually gonna
become an a D H now I'm gonna be talking
about this molecule in a D H a lot and
just remember the places that they're
formed because right now they aren't
very important you guys don't even know
what they are probably but later on
whenever we talk about the next step
after the crip cycle you guys are gonna
see just how important these are by the
way here's a little hint they help to
make a frickin ton load of is a ton load
even ward a ton load of ATP's
so yes these are very important even
though you know you may not care about
them now so basically on the way to the
matrix this pyruvic acid helps to
convert this nad plus to in a D H and
now after that the Puru Vic acid is
going to enter the inside of the
mitochondria or enter the matrix so let
me go ahead and get a new slide so right
now picture in your brain we are in the
matrix and we have a prove acasio
because pyruvic acid is a three carbon
molecule now inside the mitochondria the
first thing that's going to happen is a
co2 is going to get removed so whenever
that happens we end up with a two carbon
molecule in the two carbon molecule I'll
just write to see we'll just go ahead
and let me pick a color this is called
acetic acid
so that's pretty much the first thing
that happens to this pyruvic acid as
soon as it enters the mitochondria so I
guess you can look at this little black
background I'm working on and pretend
that this is the matrix of the
mitochondria the first thing that
happens is a co2 is ripped away from
this Peru Fick acid and it goes from a
three carbon molecule to a two carbon
molecule called acetic acid so that's
where right now acetic acid so after
this what happens is the acetic acid is
going to combine with a molecule called
coenzyme a co enzyme a so right now we
have your acetic acid right here it's
going to combine with coenzyme a
whenever you have acetic acid combining
with coenzyme a you end up with a
molecule called acetyl co a and this is
how they write it co a and of course
this pretty much means acetic acid
acetyl group plus co a stands for
coenzyme a there you go
now CO or excuse me acetyl co a this
molecule right here is the molecule that
enters the all-mighty Krebs cycle so I
know we didn't even talk about the krebs
cycle yet but this is all preparation
for the Krebs cycle because in your body
you know if the kreb cycle was like the
popular hangout it would be kind of a
big deal it wouldn't let everything in
the Krebs cycle it it is very exclusive
it only allows certain molecules in it
only allows acetyl co ways in because
you know they're pretty cool so in order
for a Peruvian which we ended up with in
glycolysis to turn into acetyl co a this
is the process that undergoes and
remember that in the meantime we
actually made an N a d H so now what
happens is our acetyl co a is ready to
enter the Krebs cycle and in the next
video I'm gonna be taking well I don't
know if I'm gonna get through it
completely but I'm gonna start talking
you guys through the steps of the Krebs
cycle and by the way it is incredibly
awesome so I'll see you guys in the next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
