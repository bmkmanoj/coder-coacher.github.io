awesome amazing objective-c tutorial now
in this tutorial you see first off about
what I did is I cleared out all my old
classes and I started for with something
new so here's my main right here and see
what I did is I created a new class
rectangle and I separated the files for
my interface and implementation um if
you forgot how to separate files then go
ahead and watch tutorial number 23 and I
teach you how to separate files but
we're gonna be building a rectangle
class aside from our main method because
like I said I want to teach you more
about inheritance and this is gonna be a
little bigger program so I'm gonna get
everything set up or if you don't want
to type it then you can just watch what
I do but any of these what we're gonna
be doing basically is taking this
rectangle class and inheriting from it
and building on it so something new but
like I said I didn't want to have it all
jumbled up in one class so the first
thing that we need to do is go to our
interface right here which is dot H and
we need to add some properties or
variables same thing so what variables
or properties the rectangle has well it
has an int width and int height so those
are pretty much the only properties that
a rectangle has every consistent
rectangle so in order to define our
properties member property remember it's
always useful to define your properties
because then we don't have to build a
setter and getter methods when we
synthesize the methods and this is from
us or a long time ago if you remember
when you synthesize a method well you're
pretty much you're doing is saying I
don't want though the setters and
getters I want you to do for me
synthesize it for me so the first thing
you need to do is put your property in
with
and if you don't understand what I just
said I'll just put this if you don't
understand what I just said then you'll
see in a little bit when we actually
need to call the methods you'll see
what's going on but anyways we're gonna
eventually build to synthesize methods
setters and getters for each width and
height but we need build a couple more
methods well so what are some common
things that you want to take and figure
out with a rectangle well I know one
thing it's the area of it so let's go
ahead and build declaration for int area
and what else we can figure out the
parameter or perimeter
what's a parameter oh yeah that probably
just confused the int perimeter beim
game time and let's go ahead and even
though we have a setter and get it
I mean setters and getters let's go
ahead and build a method to set the
width and height all in one method so
let's go it's not going to do anything
just gonna be void let's name it set WH
and oh let's just go ahead is going to
take to an INT width and it's also gonna
take int high like that so this is how
you build a method header to pass two
variables in separated by colons and
ending with a semicolon so let me see
this is pretty much all we need for the
interface class it's gonna have two
variables width and height we're gonna
define them and then we're going to
build a method to get the area the
perimeter and set the width and height
all in one shebang so now if we go over
to our implementation again our
implementation says pretty much how do
we want to use this stuff so again don't
forget to import rectangle H that's a
necessity and now instead of writing our
setters and getters all four of them
manually all we have to do is put at
I should pop up synthesize just like
that with height and check that out with
one shebang Oh Eddie with one shebang it
automatically builds four methods for us
so that's why we had to define the
properties right here pretty much just
say this is what we're gonna be building
synthesized methods are and if you still
don't understand what I'm talking about
we're gonna use it one last time and
I'll clear things up for you so let's go
ahead and build the rest of these see
you well said we have a set width and
height copy that baby and now we got to
build the method but method bodies for
these so how do we want to do this
probably the easiest way with equals W
because remember we pass it in a number
that's going to treat it as W and height
we're gonna set this equal to H so ever
we pass it in is W is gonna be set the
width and whenever we pass it in for H
is gonna be set the height so now we can
use height and width in the rest of our
methods so now let me just go grab the
both those methods and grab the headers
and V so how do we figure out the area
of a rectangle easy Weezie return width
times height and since we already have
width and height set we don't have to
worry about passing in any values and
how do we find the perimeter of
rectangle easy enough all you have to do
is a return take the sum of width plus
height that's two sides and times by two
to find the perimeter around your whole
rectangle so let me see I think that is
everything we needed right there looks
pretty good so in this tutorial what we
did is we pretty much separate the two
classes I didn't show you guys how to do
that because there just be a waste of
time what we did is we built the
interface for a rectangle which our
class of rectangle R objects is pretty
much contained a width and height and
that's all we need to figure out
everything
we can figure out the area and perimeter
and set them both with the just those
two variables so what we did is we
define the variables we said alright
we're gonna be building these three
methods and then in our implementation
we actually went ahead and built those
three methods and we actually had
objective-c build four methods for us
setters and getters for width and height
so in our next tutorial we're gonna be
working in our main method right here
again you see make sure not to delete
any of this common housekeeping stuff or
else you're gonna have to type it all in
again but that's what we're gonna be
doing in the next tutorial so thank you
guys for watching I'll post all the

will see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
