image is it's a it's a black and white
image
that's attached to your image already
and anything that's black is going to
stay in the image and anything that's
white is going to be transparent and if
I I think I still have the PNG here of
the squish I can import it I still have
it yep is this it
this is I think that's the TIFF here is
the PNG so bring bring that in real
quick now a PNG doesn't have an alpha
but a tiff does so in the PNG all this
white that's in his mouth and in his
eyes or in a tiff all that white that's
in his eyes and his mouth and all around
the background is going to be gone
because the Alpha of it the white is
going to be gone and the black is going
to stay that's how I was able to get
this guy with transparency behind him
alphas were a little hard for me to
understand at first because you use them
differently to with these blending modes
and I'll show you real quick how they
how they work so first one is stencil
alpha and it's and it's stenciled out
everything that wasn't in the Alpha so
as you can see there since it was black
so now we go to stencil luma and it's
just like a little little less the
gradient down here at the bottom I had
on was black or gray nyan to black so it
was a little it's gonna be a little
faded and there's the silhouette alpha
and the silhouette looma so with the
with the stencil or silhouette Alfa's
the transparency is going to be cut out
based on the other channel and with
stencil luma and silhouette luma the
alpha are the transparency is going to
be cut based on the luminance values of
the of the image hopefully that makes
some sense if you if you can't figure
out the words like some of the wards
that I'm using like luminosity and
things like that go into Google and look
them up so you know what is going on and
you can figure out how these work a
little better now the next ones down
here are also transparencies but they
they work differently so the Alpha ad
which you're not gonna be able to see in
this one when you have two things that
share scene and you want them to I mean
let's see they you want them to like
fill in that seam there you would change
it to an Elfa ad and it'll it'll fill it
in for you the last one here is
luminescence Premo and you can't also
tell what's going on here but sometimes
when you import images with alphas they
or video the edges are too bright so I
mean you would you would use this
luminescence Premo to fix that I'll go
over that in like a later tutorial same
with the Alpha ad and then that way I
can show you how those work better so
that's it for the blending modes I mean
they are little daunting at first but
once you use them and and you remember
that the different sections are here
that these are darkening these are
lighting
these are the sorry
these are lightning these are lighting
and confuse myself there for a second I
was gonna say lighting twice
these ones are subtracting and these
ones here are based on color and these
ones here are based on alphas so just
remember like the basics and experiment
I mean I don't know what each one is
gonna do so I experiment and see which
one looks cool</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
