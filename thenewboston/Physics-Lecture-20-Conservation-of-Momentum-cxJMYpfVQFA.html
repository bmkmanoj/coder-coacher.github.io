video and in this video I want to talk
to you guys and show you an example of
the conservation of momentum so let me
go ahead and show you guys the famous
car example so say that you have two
carts car a and cart B now it would
probably make more sense if I actually
added wheels to these things so just
imagine that these are big blocks of
wood on wheels so car a and B are
identical to each other both in size
mass all that good stuff
however they are connected by a spring
now this is a pretty powerful spring and
what the spring wants to do is push a
away from B it just wants to expand and
separate the tube however well let me go
ahead and label this so you guys can
actually tell what I'm drunk however the
reason that the spring isn't pushing
these apart is because these two carts
are held together with a rope and I
guess I better label this two rope just
like that this drawing is actually one
of my better drunks so let's go ahead
and take a few calculations here first
of all we know the total force of the
system is zero
that's because force equals mass times
acceleration and if you take the mass of
all of this well it wouldn't really
matter because nothing is accelerating
therefore the force is zero okay we
already know that but the new thing that
we learned is the momentum is also zero
because momentum we know is equal to
mass times velocity so if we go ahead
and say that this is actually one big
object and it took the mass of it well
the mass doesn't even matter because
this system nothing is going anywhere it
has a velocity of zero and of course you
know no matter what the mass is whenever
you multiply something by zero the
answer is always zero so no matter how
massive these carts are since the
velocity is zero that means the momentum
must also be zero so what we're going to
do is we are now going to take a pair of
scissors let me
get out right here and we are going to
cut the rope now as soon as we cut the
rope cart B is going to go flying in
this direction and car a let me drop my
arrow a little better is going to move
in this direction why because the spring
is going to push both of those things
apart now of course this is you know
cool and we could build this and watch
them fling apart but what's the point
well the point is to demonstrate the
conservation of momentum now the
conservation of momentum in this example
pretty much says since the momentum of
the total system before we cut the rope
was zero this means after the cards
pretty much before we cut the rope it
was zero after we cut the rope it's zero
so if you're saying okay wait a minute
you're telling me that now that these
carts are moving they both have a mass
and they have a velocity and momentum is
still zero how the heck does that work
well let me go ahead and explain it
maybe a little bit easier to understand
if we gave these carts values so let's
go ahead and give them both a mass of 10
kilograms and 10 kilograms and we'll say
that once that rope was cut they started
moving at I don't know 5 meters per
second so 5 meters per second to the
left and this one started moving 5
meters per second to the right now check
this out the momentum the momentum
excuse me of cart a is equal to the
momentum of cart be the only thing is
that it's in an opposite direction so of
course if we figure it out the momentum
of this it would be 50 and if we figured
out the momentum of cart B it would also
be 50 but even though they had the same
momentum they are moving in opposite
directions so the total momentum of the
entire system as a whole is still zero
so that is how we know that the
conservation of momentum is indeed a
valid law because it pretty much says
this
and I think this is the formal law that
the total momentum in any system is
equal before and after any event and
whenever they write this they always
write the event in quotation marks for
some reason so again that's law I'm
going to say one more time because
that's what I have to pound in your
brain the total momentum in any system
is equal before and after the event so
basically in this example when the carts
weren't moving at all in the rope was
intact we figured out that the momentum
was zero and after the rope was cut in
each of these carts had a momentum of 50
but they were in opposite directions
that's what also called caused the
momentum of the entire system to be zero
after the event and of course the event
in this case was the cutting of the rope
so that is basically the conservation of
momentum in in the next tutorial I'm
going to give you guys an even better
example which is probably more useful
than cutting ropes and stuff so nice
thank you guys for watching don't forget
