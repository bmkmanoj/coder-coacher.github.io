basta and YouTube channel today we're
gonna be learning about using the free
transform tool in Illustrator cs6 now
the free transform tool allows you to
rotate scale reflect or shear an object
additionally you can apply perspective
and distortion to an object as well so
that's basically it that you can do with
it you can't there's some other things
and tricks you can do but we'll go over
just the basics I guess and first thing
you need to do is go ahead and select an
object that you want to use the free
transform tool on and then you're going
to go over to the free transform tool
icon and you can see that the hotkey is
e and select it and I'll just go over
what you can do with it you can
transform you can move if you try to
hold down all and drag it's not going to
copy like it would do with the regular
selection tool you can resize or scale
you can mirror
and you can rotate and those things you
can also do with the regular selection
tool but here's where the cool stuff
starts coming in the first thing we're
going to go over is shearing and if you
start dragging on one of these sides
then hold down control you're able to
move it along like this and slant the
object and that's called shearing the
next thing is called perspective and if
you grab one on the side handles again
and then hold control all and shift and
start dragging
you're gonna get some perspective into
this now it doesn't work as well with a
square but it'll work a lot better with
the with the star here so if I go ahead
and select a star and go ahead and start
making some perspective here
now it kind of looks like the left side
of the star is closer to us and the
right so the star is a little further
away
that's perspective the last thing I want
to show you is called distort and all
you got to do is click and drag on one
of the corners and then hold ctrl and
now you can just distort that corner
now with the store it only works on the
bounding box it doesn't work on like
certain points look I can't just distort
this corner over here of the star I
could as a store it from the bounding
box and as it's going to I don't have
the free for selection or a free
transform tool selected and I do it's
going to just go from the bounding box
and not from the corner points and then
using that I mean you can get a little
bit more perspective in there so that's
called distort something I wanted to
show you guys was using smart guides
when you have are transforming an object
so to set that up you need to go into
edit because in preferences and then go
to smart guides and it's not gonna be
selected which is transform tools right
here and if you click this since we're
in smart guides it's going to add smart
guides who are transfer free
transforming if I click on that and then
start using my free transforms you can
see that some smart guides are appearing
as you can see know they're lining me up
with whatever it's lining up with there
and then at the bottom of the of the
square there or rectangle whatever it's
called so that's how you use your smart
guides now if you don't see any when
you're doing that and you have that
checked go into view then come down here
to smart guides and make sure you have
it checked off or else you're not gonna
be able to see them controlling you is
how to turn on and turn off smart guides
as a hotkey so the last thing I want to
show you is how to transform if you need
specific values so go to window and we
got to go and open up our transform
panel so click on transform and it'll
show up here now x and y are for
transforming and we can just move things
left and right or up and down using that
so if i put in something like 500 it's
going to transform to the left on the
x-axis now width and height here are
skip for scaling and to the right here
we've got a broken chain link and then
if i click on it it's a chain link
that's together if it's broken then
these are gonna scale separately if they
are linked then when i scale one of
these the other one's going to scale
with it proportionally so if i put this
on at 200 you can watch the height is
going to watch the numbers in the height
they're going to scale as well
and that's how we get that so left here
we've got rotate and you can put it in a
predefined rotation value or you can put
in your own so if I wanted to tell you
something in like 28
I can get that as well and then for
shearing I can do the same thing and
start shearing
now there's other things I want to show
you within the options if I click on
this and I go to show options we've got
a line to pixel grid and scales and
strokes are scale strokes and effects so
if you have a line to pixel grid checked
off its gonna make things less blurry or
prevent blurry lines now normally it
won't be checked and you don't need to
have it checked
unless you're starting to get blurry
lines in your object if you go to check
scale strokes and effects what its gonna
do is it's gonna take the stroke line on
here and scale it along with your object
when you start scaling it up if you
don't have it checked when you start
scaling things the stroke is gonna say
the same size and it might not look as
cool or it might not look as correct so
you're gonna have to go up and then
increase the size so that it's relative
to the actual object go back but if you
have it checked and you start scaling
the actual stroke as you can see is
going to scale with it so it looks more
like it's supposed to so usually you
want to have that checked off and then
there's a few other things in here like
flip horizontal flip vertical and
they've got some like transform object
only pattern or both so that's all I
wanted to show you about using the free
transform tool remember that the hotkey
is e you're gonna be using it a lot so
remember that hotkey and so you can
switch out quickly and efficiently and
get your projects done faster so thanks
