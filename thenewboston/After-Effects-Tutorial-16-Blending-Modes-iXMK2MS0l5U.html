aftereffect tutorial in this tutorial
I'm going to be teaching guys about
something called blending modes now what
a blending mode does is pretty much take
whatever scene that you're working on
and it blends it with any of the layers
under it so it might be kind of hard to
understand so I'm just going to show you
guys what I'm talking about right here
we have the I believe this is the let me
see alright this is the robot scene
since he's doing the robot and what am I
going to want to do is blend this with
another layer under it so the first
thing that I'm going to need to do is
drag out another scene called panorama
and let me just move this so you can see
both layers at the same time now I want
to get my robot scene on top so I'm
going to want to grab it and just drag
it right on top like that now whenever
you apply a blending mode it's going to
blend it with any layer under it so if
you apply to any blending mode to this
scene since it's the first layer it's
not going to do anything you need to
have layers under it for it to work so
go ahead and select your scene that's on
top and to see all the blending modes
you can do this a couple ways the first
thing you can do is press f4 on your
keyboard and as you see as you press f4
this little mode on bar toggles on and
off you can also right click and press
columns and modes this will also bring
it up without getting rid of anything
else so now that we have our modes and
remember you want to work with the
topmost layer anything you apply the
button most won't show up at all you can
apply a bunch of different modes if you
click that little arrow you can see all
the modes on here um instead of just
going through these um all of these
effects I'm just going to show you guys
what a couple of them do um actually the
best way just to test them all out for
yourself and
as you can see I chose the multiply mode
for this one and what this does is kind
of blends these two layers together and
I each of these different modes brings
out different effects like darken brings
out the darkened pixels lighting brings
out the lighter pixels overlay these are
the ones who blends that together these
are ones they really give you some nice
contrast as hard mix and vivid light and
um classic difference and stuff like
that so as you can see whenever we apply
a blending mode the portion of the layer
that's over the top layer blends with
the bottom layers and it gives you a
really cool effect let me show you guys
this is classic I'll show you guys on
color this gives it a new color and
another neat thing that you can do is
you can let me go ahead and get rid of
the panorama you can also apply solids
under these and how you get a solid I
already have one right here but if you
want a solid color all you have to do is
go layer let me deselect that layer new
solid and this is going to allow you to
get a solid color of video and if you're
saying alright why is that useful I'll
show you I got a red solid I already
made it right here and let me just put
this behind by dragging this robot seen
on the top and now you can see that our
layer is on top with red underneath in a
cool effect that we can apply to this is
hard mix so let me go ahead and apply
where a hard mix and if you see if you
watch the video it now gives you a cool
effect just by using a solid color so
again that's one way that you can use a
solid color to create some cool video
effects it doesn't always have to be two
different scenes you get you can also
use this with a scene solid colors text
anything like that so again what you're
going to want mostly do is just
with all these I could go through each
of them I'll tell you what they do but
that will take forever and it will get
boring so just experiment have fun anam
once you experiment with those and you
feel comfortable with using blend modes
you're ready to move on to my next
tutorial so thank you for watching now
see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
