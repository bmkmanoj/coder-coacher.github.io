slash on live gamer for the new Boston
and in this tutorial we're going to be
taking a look at passing or rape
parameters so if you remember from the
previous tutorials we were making an
application that dealt with a race so
let's go ahead and open that back up so
you should see it in your recent
projects if not you can come up to file
open project or you can open the file so
let's go ahead and zoom in some here now
if you can see here that we have button
reverse button sort array and button add
array so what we want to do is fix a
couple things here and make our code a
little bit better now if you noticed
that if you run the program and click
sort array it'll freeze up and crash
because the argument cannot be no
basically what this means is not all of
the values in your array have been or
not all the indexes have been set to a
value so what we can do is we will come
in here and we'll double click on form
one and now we'll come up here and find
these lines of code that assign values
to each item in string classes and we're
just going to go ahead and cut those out
and then we'll go ahead and add them to
the form one load so basically what this
does is once the form opens the every
single index of the array has been set
to a value and we will have to worry
about that ok so now you can see we have
a for each loop in each one of these
button handlers now there's an easier
way to do this we can make a sub that
will do this for us
and to do this we're going to need to
pass an array as a parameter so we'll go
ahead and come down to right under clear
list and we will start off by creating a
private sub so private sub and then
we'll just call this add items to
list and now for our arguments we're
going to go ahead and type by Val arg
array as string so you can see it
automatically in the sub for us so
whenever we call add items to list we're
going to is going to be required then we
pass an array to it because we have
these parentheses right here which tells
the compiler compiler that this is an
array so now what we need to do is
enumerate the array so we'll go ahead
and use a for each loop so for each item
as string in our array we're going to go
ahead and add that to the list so we'll
just go ahead and comment this so add
array item to list and we'll just type
list arrays dot atoms dot add now for
the arguments will just add item okay so
now we can just go ahead and minimize
this here and we can also minimize clear
lists because we're not going to be
changing that now we'll come up here to
our button an array and we're going to
take out this for each loop so now we're
only going to need two things two things
in button add array so we'll just go
ahead and type add items to list and for
our arguments we're going to type string
classes and we're going to need
parentheses because it is an array
or nevermind we aren't going to need
those we just need to put in string
classes and the compiler I already know
is that it's an array so we can go ahead
and do this for each of the other subs
and for these we're only going to need
three lines so we can just go ahead and
type add items to list string classes
and we can do that one more time
for button reverse so add items to list
and string classes now if we go ahead
and run this you can see that we get a
DeRay elements order rate and reverse
array and when we click on this it will
add them to it we can also sort the
array and reverse the array and you can
see that everything works fine now I
taught you how to pass arrays as
arguments but there's also something
that you really need to get from this
tutorial is that you can create subs or
functions that will do stuff for you and
it will keep you from having to type a
lot of excess code so by creating add
items to list we'll needed to make one
for each loop and we had the argument
right here if we didn't we would have to
have a for each loop for each one of
these subs and this makes it easier so
that you don't have to write so much
code and copying and pasting is always
bad because you're probably going to
forget something and you'll find that
happening to you a lot if you copy and
paste so I'm go ahead and create a
couple functions or subs and pass a race
to them you can do whatever you want
with them once they're in that sub and
then once you know how to do that and
you're not going to forget it go ahead
and move onto the next tutorial and
