tutorial and in this tutorial I'm we
teaching you guys something called
functions and how to use them now
functions are actually one of the most
useful and one of the easiest things to
learn in PHP so this is a kind of
important tutorial to watch now what a
function is is simply a set of code that
anytime later when you're writing when
you want to write that code that you
just type in the function name and it
saves you from typing the whole bunch of
code again so hold on gotta a a.m.
lunchbox 10 so make sure whenever you're
watching this story oh and you have a I
M instant message lunchbox 10 and tell
them to shut up and quit disrupting me
during my tutorials alright back to my
tutorial a function saves you a bunch of
time when you want to code your site so
let me just tell you how to do this
the syntax to begin a function first you
type in function and what this does is
introduce it PHP and let you know and
tells it are a PHP we're going to be
typing a function after this and then
after function you type in any name that
you want anything you want to call your
function and I'll call mine test fun so
now my function has the name test fun
and then you have to add something
called the parameters like we worked
with before and we'll be going over
these next time but now we're just going
to leave them empty for now so now
inside our function any code that we
want to execute we execute within the
curly braces so any code that we want to
tell this function the X cube goes in
between the curly braces right
underneath it so this function can do
anything that you want it to do well I'm
going to have a do is echo easy Hoss I'm
just going to have it basic echo output
the text easy Hoss so now whenever you
write the function test fun it's going
to echo the word words easy Hoss
so now if we go down here and let's just
say we're type in on the screen where
we're right take it and now if we don't
want to go ahead and type all of this
again we can just type in the functions
name so we'll just write test fun make
sure you include your empty parameters
as you can see when we save this it
should execute
take it easy Hoss because that's the
text for a function as you can see it
says take it easy Hoss now again you
don't only have to use it just once this
saves you from anytime you want to write
this again you can just use the test
font so let's say we're working typing
it's more code and said first of all
let's add a line break so it's easier
and remember you have to include it
within quotes and you add it with a
period so now we can say I said take it
and then again you can say include my
function right here so again not only do
you have a use it once but you can use
it multiple times and it saves you from
typing this code each time so now if we
save it says take it easy Hoss and
here's our function right here
I said take it easy Hoss on the next
line and this is also useful say instead
of changing all this code and all this
code if you didn't use it say easy James
anytime you want to change a bunch of
this for all the instances on your
screen you just have to change this one
time and now if we saved it you can see
take it easy James I said take it easy
James and this is how you can include a
block of code many times on your screen
with only one set of actual coding it'll
save you a bunch of time so next time
we're going to be going over how to
actually use these parameters but for
now study this get the basic functions
down as you can see it's really simple
and it'll save you a bunch of time
