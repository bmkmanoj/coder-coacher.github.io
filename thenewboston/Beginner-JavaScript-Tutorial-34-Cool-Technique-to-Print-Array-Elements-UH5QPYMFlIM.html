your thirty fourth of JavaScript sorrow
and this story is probably going to be
pretty quick because I only have one
small thing to talk about but it's a
really cool technique and the easiest
technique for printing out an array so
you definitely want to pay attention so
let's go ahead and first create an array
um I'm just going to name it stuff why
the heck not and new array let's just go
ahead and create it right in here and go
ahead and type like five random words
like apples um pears let's see
bacon tuna and ham simple enough and
actually that looks like my grocery list
so anyways we have an array called stuff
and it consists of five elements the
first thing that people like to do
before they just go ahead and print it
out is you probably want to sort this in
some kind of order and might as well
just use the sort method and it'll sort
in alphabetical order so go ahead and
take stuff and use the sort method and
now what this does is it sorts the array
stuff so now whenever you print it out
it's going to be in a nice neat
alphabetical order so ever saying
alright let's just go ahead and print
out this array using you know the
technique we learn before we go ahead
and make a for loop and then we go ahead
and say I equal to zero and then we go
ahead and set I is less than and then we
go ahead and count the elements one two
three four five so we can go ahead and
set I is less than five and this is
going to loop through five times simple
enough but a better technique is this
say later on you might add an element to
your array or take an element out of the
array so the array size might change
from five to four or may go from like
five to seven or something well then we
would have to change our for loop and
things would might get confusing so a
better technique is this whenever you
start at zero your second parameter can
just be I is less than the length
of that array so now later on if you
were to change the size of this array
you wouldn't have to change this
variable this variable would
automatically know to count however many
items are in your right so I'll show you
guys that later on but now again go
ahead and increment it by one and we'll
be good to go so now all we have to do
is tab and documents dots rights write
anything you want on the screen so using
that technique we learn less toriel if
we just go ahead and put our array and
use I is the index it's going to work
perfectly since it's going to start at 0
and go all the way to 4 and since our
five elements in our array 0 1 2 3 4
that's going to give us our 5 um indexes
as I and it's going to work perfectly so
we can print out like this but it might
appear a little jumbled so I want to go
ahead and add a line break using that
right there so now each item in our
array were put on a new line whenever we
print it out on our webpage so let's go
ahead and save this launch in Chrome and
check it out our array which was jumbled
before is now sorted in alphabetical
order and we also printed out nice and
neat on each line so go ahead and let me
show you guys the benefit of this so now
let's go ahead and delete bacon or
something and now we only have 4
elements in our array so before where we
would have to change this variable it's
going to recount it and it's
automatically going to know that your
length of the array has changed so no
need to change variable here now
whenever we save it and refresh it our
program is going to continue to work
fine so the technique I want to teach
you guys in this tutorial was basically
instead of a number here which would be
the size of your array you can just use
this length property and what this does
is it automatically counts however many
elements are in your array so you don't
have to worry about what number appears
there it's going to do all the dirty
work for you and this is really useful
when you have an array like of 800
elements or something so I don't have to
count them every time and aside from
that I just want to show you guys how
you can use that
index in the for loop to plug that in as
the array index and loop through an
array really easily and simply so this
is definitely combining this technique I
tell you in this tutorial and the last
technique we learn basically how to use
for loops and arrays to just build
programs that work so easily together so
don't forget these techniques because
they're definitely going to come in
handy later on so for now that's all I
have for you guys but uh yeah I don't
know why I'm going to be teaching in the
next tutorial but it's going to be
pretty cool so thank you guys for
watching don't forget to sub and I will
see you next door Oh</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
