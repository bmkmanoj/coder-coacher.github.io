I'm going to call it results so we know
exactly what we're talking about so
we've got the search form we've got this
keyword filled with finding the match
every time we press a key down and we're
displaying that results who've named the
elements of our of our page correctly so
we can sort of remember them a bit later
on so like I said we've got this find
match function that we need to create up
here so let's go ahead and open up a
script tag and then go and close our
script tag and the type is obviously
text forward slash JavaScript because
Ajax is JavaScript and XML okay so now
what we're going to go and do is create
our function name which we've cooled
down here find maps so we can just start
a new function up in the wrong place
there so we can start a new function
called find match it's not going to take
any parameters because this function is
unique to this field so we don't need to
take any parameters to say you know
puppet somewhere or like we did in the
example where we where we created our
Ajax code last time we we put two
arguments in to here to say what file to
grab and also where to put the data so
we don't need to do that because we can
we can do that just for the purpose of
this of this this search but you're
welcome to modify obviously the Phi
match to suit your website's
needs I think it's the first thing we
need to do is check for a request so we
do we say if window dot XML HTTP request
so remember the case sensitivity of this
we've got capitulate XML and H and a
capital R here the the code inside of
here is going to be case sensitive so be
very very very careful or your program
may not run correctly so we've got an if
and then we're going to have it else
there so this is just for different
browser support but in this case we say
XML HTTP is equal to a new XML HTTP
request and then we power print
parentheses on here otherwise XML HTTP
is equal to a new activexobject so
active X object and we feed in one
argument which is Microsoft dot XML HTTP
in capitals okay so we've done that
that's set our XML HTTP variable now
what we want to do is we want to check
for the state the ready state of our XML
HTTP we're going to be a submitting data
through to this so we need to check for
that so what we do is we say XML HTTP
and we say dot on ready state and then
what's happening is we're going to equal
this to a function I'm going to have no
parameters in this but the function is
going to be inside of here so when when
we are ready to do this sorry this is
all ready state change by the way just
notice that there so on on the state
change of there our XML HTTP which is
our H xml httprequest object we need to
complete the function inside of these
parentheses so the function is first of
all we need to make a check so we need
to check the ready state and the status
of this so we need to say if xml HTTP
dot ready status is equal to 4 and xml
HTTP dot status so this is state i'm
confusing things so we've got ready
state equals 4 and we've got the XML
HTTP status is equal to 200 this is just
to ensure that data is being returned
if data isn't returned we don't need to
carry out the following block inside
here which is grabbing the element by ID
which is the element that we're going to
be putting the data into is our result
div so what we're doing is we're saying
document because we're speaking about
the overall document and then we're
saying get LM element by ID and we need
to get the element by ID which let's go
down
here in check we have called this
results so I should have known that
because I didn't name them so I could
remember them okay so we need to type in
results in here and then what we need to
do is we need to say dot in our HTML and
dot innerhtml is basically HTML inside
of this div so we're changing this so
we're making that equal to XML HTTP dot
and it's response value of response text
so the value of the text in response so
xxxx a XML HTTP dot response text okay
so we're done with that for now now we
need to come down and actually send this
data so we need to test it first because
we don't know if our our code just
around here works at the moment so the
first thing we're going to do is XML
HTTP and then we're going to say dot
open and you will remember this from the
last tutorial hopefully we've got three
parameters the first one is the method
so we're using get and we can go to be
using this into this tutorial as well
now as the file so we've got up here
we've got search tink dot PHP there's
nothing in it at the moment so search
Inc dot PHP and the next is if you want
to try to send this data a synchronously
so we do so we're going to just type
through by default it's true so you can
leave it out but I always like to put it
just in there now we say XML HTTP does
send and we're done
so now what we can do is test this out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
