video that was one of the most requested
videos of all time people asking how do
you record my xbox game footage and this
is a little different than everyone else
because this is the best way to record
Xbox game footage or PlayStation 3 so if
you have the idea that you want to make
videos like machinima or machinima
respond or if you saw any of my videos
you saw the quality of them in the
quality cannot be beat on youtube or
anywhere else so if you want to learn
how to do it here's how there are two
main well three main ways really where
you can record your video gameplay from
the TV screen the first one is pointing
a camcorder at the TV screen this is the
worst way to do it but if you have no
other way this you can do it the video
would be poor the audio would be even
worse and it's just not that great so in
the last Lucian you can do it that way
the second way in the two most debated
ways this is half of them is to get a
capture card and this is called a black
magic intensity Pro and so many people
have said that this is the way you got
to do it this way if you want high def
video from your xbox and put it on
YouTube this is how you should do it
however I got this and this is what I
did first this was my first option how I
first started a record and it is I'm I
mean the next thing I'm going to
recommend is the hop egde HD PVR and I
usually give you guys options and say
alright this is my input make your
recommendation but I'm not going to make
any recommendations I am begging you
guys please do not use a capture card is
a pain in the butt it won't work you
don't have a good enough computer for it
I don't have a good enough computer for
it and not $4000 computer you need to
setup a weird stuff like raid on your
computer and it causes a whole bunch of
problems so black magic in
tensity Pro if you have anyone
recommending this to you punch them in
the head because it is not good at all
so throw this away now what you want to
get in the way to record xbox or ps3 HD
footage and put it on YouTube or
anywhere else is this this isn't
actually this is just piece of paper but
it's actually down there because I'm
using it right now so I can't you know
hold it up it's called it HD PVR
it's made by a company called like
hauppage or something but anyways if you
type that in Google you can find it I
think it's like a couple hundred bucks
and this is the best way to do it what
it is I'll show you in a second how to
set everything up it's a box that goes
next to your Xbox and what happens is
your Xbox instead of connecting directly
to your TV it passes through this box
which records the footage in HD and then
sends it to your TV with no lag time at
all it was something specifically made
to do just this record Xbox footage and
HD so this is why you need it and even
if your TV isn't HD you can still record
it in HD so that is the most cool thing
ever so in the next part I'm going to
show you how to set everything up but
like I said do not get the Blackmagic
intensity Pro no matter how many reviews
you read because I'm talking from
personal first-hand experience this PVR
is what you want to get google it and
trust me you'll thank me so stay tuned
I'll show you how to set it up so here
is the basic setup Hey for how the
snores and guys don't look on my shorts
please you pervert so what happens is
you got your Xbox right here now instead
of the cables going directly to your TV
which is up here they pass through the
ha pitch or I'm just going to cut the HD
PVR because I don't know how to say the
companies names they pass through here
and then the cables another set of
cables HD cables go to your TV that's
these white cables right here so this
records everything so ever saying all
right
then how the eff doesn't get to my
computer well there's also a USB cable
right here and this goes from here to
your computer which is over here you
guys can't see it but trust me there is
computer over there now you're saying
alright and how does it get power well
there's also a power supply that goes
from here until the wall you guys can't
see that either but that's how it works
so pretty much your four cables
connecting to this the cable to the Xbox
the cable to the TV and this lets you
play xbox of course
the cable to the computer which lets you
transfer video from here to your
computer and the power cable which if
you don't know what that is then you
shouldn't even be watching this so in
the next section I'm going to show you
what cables go where alright guys so
here is the back of my HD PVR and here
is the setup that you want first of all
on the brochure says that there's three
different ways to connect your Xbox to
your HD PVR you want to get these cables
right here these are video composite HD
cables I think that's what they're
called and you can get them from Best
Buy for like 30 bucks what it is is one
of the ends looks like that um so the
rocket fish and the other end looks like
this you can see it says a rocket fish
and there are five cables that you need
connects there's actually the sixth one
which is useless but you don't need that
what you do is plug this into your Xbox
right there and plug this into let's see
it's the end section it's a set of
cables on the bottom right there so
that's a very first thing that you want
to do second you need this cable which
is these five cables for HD and these
come with their HD PVR so you don't need
to buy these and what you need to do is
connect these for your out and then go
ahead and send that to your TV which
mine is right there and just plug it in
like a well if you have a HD TV then
you'll know where to plug them in now
after that what you want to do is take
the USB cord and this also comes with HD
PVR and it's right here plug this into
the in this is the cord that allows you
to transfer
the data from this box to your computer
so take that cable and plug it into here
right here and then plug it into any USB
port on your computer nice computer
wonder who built that myself and the
last thing that you want to do it is of
course give it power right here and
after that well I'll show you what to do
so thanks for watching and I'll see in a
second</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
