Android tutorial for the new Boston
where we're hopefully gonna finish up
this little activity here maybe one more
tutorial I said but but what we're gonna
do now is within our on click method
we're gonna set up the text that we want
to display so we're just gonna call this
string and we're gonna call this body
because it's gonna be the body of the
text and we're gonna set this equal to
whatever so this is a message from
Travis thanks for your support
something like that maybe and then we're
also gonna set up a title so we're gonna
say string and title set this equal to
set this equal to Travis C and there we
go we have our title and now what we
need to do is we need to create a
notification and we need to tell it like
what's drawable object you know what the
time is that we sent the notification
all that good stuff so we're gonna say
notification I call this N and we're
gonna set this equal to new notification
and then we're gonna refer to our
drawable object or that little icon that
we set up I'm gonna say our drawable dot
lightning is my reference your reference
is probably different then we're gonna
say what the message of the notification
is so we're gonna call that body that
text that we set up and lastly we're
gonna refer to what time this
notification was sent so we're gonna
refer to the system time we're just
gonna say system current time in
milliseconds and there we go we have our
notification setup and then we're gonna
just add you know what details we want
to our notification we're gonna set up
the title and you know what intent we
wanted to open or a pending intent I
should say so we're just gonna say in
dot set latest event info recruit into
context we're going to say this the the
title we're gonna refer to our title
text for the content text we're again
referring to our body so we're gonna say
body and lastly our pending intent which
we called P I or pending intent so
that's just going to set up our
notification you know again the body the
I'm sorry the title the body and the
intent that we want to open and then
we're also going to set up basically how
we want to notify the user so we're
going to say in defaults we're going to
set this equal to a notification class
and then we have some options like the
lights the sound vibration all that good
stuff so we're going to choose the
default all which is basically the
default sound in the default or it will
vibrate as well we'll do both so set
that up and and then also since we're
using the vibrate we're gonna have to go
into the the new boston manifest and add
a vibrate permission again you can just
type this out or just go to the
permissions and say add use permission
and then you know vibration or vibrate I
should say and just add that permission
to our to our manifest so our
application won't crash and that's
probably it for this tutorial I don't
know exactly how much time we've spent
but I will finish it up in the laughs in
the next tutorial because again we have
to refer to our notification manager to
handle some of the events that's going
on and all that good stuff so we'll
finish up this little activity in the
next tutorial and I'll see you guys then
hope you have a good one and catch you
later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
