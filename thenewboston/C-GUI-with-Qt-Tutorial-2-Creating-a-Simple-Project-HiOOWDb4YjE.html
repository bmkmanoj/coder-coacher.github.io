want to create a project so go ahead and
click this button or you can also go
file new file or project either one
whatever you feel like now what we want
to do is a cute widget project and once
we click that we have two different sub
options cute gooey and mobile queue
application we just want cute GUI
application which pretty much this means
we want to create a C++ GUI program that
we can run on our desktop so go ahead
and select this hit choose and now it's
going to say okay give it a name I'm
just going to name it um
let's name it YouTube I guess YouTube
and you know what folder do you want to
put it in pretty much word you want to
save it to
doesn't really matter hit next now all
this stuff don't press anything that's
different it should all be set up
correctly by default next next finish
again I know I'm going going over
everything real quick but this is just
to make sure that we have everything set
up and working properly I'm not really
going to be going into detail in this
tutorial just showing you guys a quick
example but anyways now that we created
a new project in gave it a name what we
want to do now is I want to show you
guys how to look at the design or the
GUI interface because this is a really
awesome program so of course here's the
code right here but we're creating a GUI
so we want to see what it looks like
well actually if you expand all of these
folders right here you can see all of
the files that belong to your project of
course we got our C++ files dot CPP but
we're we're interesting interested in is
this main window dot UI so go ahead and
double click that and we can see that we
have a GUI right here or at least the
beginning of one so just so we can you
know learn how to add some simple stuff
on the Skua right now let's go ahead and
scroll down and look for I don't know
I'll just make something like a push
button that changes some text on screen
so this push button right here go ahead
and drag it out and plop it into your
GUI so now we have a push button that
says push button pretty cool that's how
simple it is we didn't even have to
program anything yet this is all taken
care of behind the scenes by cue
now let's go ahead and grab a label and
let's see this label right here looks
pretty good so go ahead and grab this
label drag it out and put it right next
to the button looks pretty good so now
what I want to do is again I know that
I'm moving really fast but I just want
to you know show you guys a real simple
program to show you guys that this doesn
t to work and I'm not just you know BS
in you so go ahead and select your
button and right click it and press go
to slot now again I know you guys don't
know what go to slot means but I'll
explain all this in depth later
highlight click and select okay now
obviously you can see whenever you do
that it takes you to the code that is
responsible for what happens whenever
you click that button and you guys can
probably tell that because the function
is named on push button clicked so what
do we want to happen well let's just go
to UI which stands for of course user
interface label which was that text that
we put on the GUI not the button but the
label and what do we want to do to this
label well we just want to call a
function called set text which of course
changes the text on the button and we
will just change this to ouch so again
one last time I want to repeat I know
you guys don't know probably what all of
these you know functions mean with all
of you know this different objects and
you know all this stuff but I'll explain
it all later what we're interested in
now in doing is just running this
project so go ahead to the slow triangle
right here and press run and once we do
that it's going to go ahead and build
the project which pretty much set
everything up and here is our awesome
project so go ahead and press this
button and make sure you look at this
label whenever I do I'm going to press
it right now and it says ouch
how awesome is that our very first GUI
application with Q so there you go there
is a very simple cute application in the
next tutorials what I'm going to be
doing is kind of rewinding starting back
from scratch and taking guys through the
entire interface what everything is what
everything does and I'm going to give
you guys a really basic knowledge
of the developer program before we start
getting to the more in-depth stuff so
thank you guys for watching don't forget
to subscribe don't forget to follow me
on Twitter Google+ and we have that good
stuff so thanks for watching I'll see
you next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
