slash on live gamer for the new Boston
and in this tutorial we're going to be
taking a look at the input box now the
input box is very similar to the message
box but instead of just displaying a
message to the user it will get
something other that they type into the
text box that is within the input box
let's go ahead and create a new project
and we'll make a little demo application
for this go ahead and shrink this down a
bit make sure you select windows forms
application and we will just call this
input box okay now we're just going to
go ahead and click OK we will wait wait
for that to load and now once it's done
loading let's go ahead and resize our
form so let's go over here and open the
tool box now we'll come down here and we
will add a label now let's go ahead and
change the text to nothing because we
don't want anything yet and we'll change
the name to label hello user okay so now
what we're going to do is we're going to
double click on form 1 and this will
bring up our code for the form 1 and you
can see here that created it created our
form one load sub so that whenever the
form loads is going to do whatever is in
that sub and since we don't have
anything yet it's not going to do
anything now let's go ahead and add an
input box so we'll just go ahead and
type input box and we'll add our
parameters and you can see here that the
first one is the prompt now the prompt
is basically what tells the user what to
type in the input box so we'll just type
what is your name and we've got our
second parameter which is the title of
the input box we'll just set that to
hello we got the default response which
will automatically fill the text box in
for them and they can change that with
it to what they want so we'll just go
ahead and leave that as nothing so we'll
just go ahead and add a comma to move on
to the next argument we've got the
exposition on
screen and the Y position on the screen
we'll just go ahead and skip those two
and we go ahead and close our parameters
and now what we need to do is create a
string so we'll just come up here and
declare string so dim use your name as
string and since the user may or may not
type anything we're just going to go
ahead and set this to nothing now we'll
go ahead and type user name equals and
then input box what is your name and
hello so basically what this does is it
gets whatever they typed in and sets it
as the value user name so what we're
going to do is we're going to set the
text for the label that we put on the
form so we'll just type label hello user
and you can see that it pops up there in
our intellisense
let's just go ahead and hit tab to
autofill that in for us we'll add the
dot and then we'll just go ahead and
type in text so what this does is it
changes the text inside that our label
shows so label hello user text and we're
going to set it equal to hello and then
we'll just add user name okay so if we
go ahead and run this you can see that a
little prompt pops up here with the
title hello and it says what is your
name
so if I go ahead and enter Sam and click
OK you can see that our form 1 says
hello Sam
so the input box is very useful it makes
it so that you don't have to create your
own forms to get input from the user if
you don't want to go ahead and put those
controls on your program on your main
form so I'll go ahead and play around
with the input box look at some of the
arguments in it change those around and
then once you're familiar with that go
ahead and move on to the next tutorial
