tutorial and in this tutorial as
promised I'm going to be teaching you
guys the beginning of making our very
first computer game now the computer
game I'm going to be teaching you guys
how to make I'm going to be making it
along with you I already started and
it's called tecora calm so if you guys
want to see that's where it's all going
to be at and I already started I just
made the basically out of it all as you
can see the title of the history the
login box right here but before we even
start doing this the first thing we need
to make is a replace for the users to
register since before you can log in you
of course need a place to register your
name so this is the very first thing you
do on any game that you're going to make
so that's what we're going to be going
over today how to make a basic
registration form to let people register
on our game so let's close this out and
uh here is my code right here now as you
can see if I launch this a raw code in
Firefox you guys are going to see my
registration file that I'm going to be
building right here you guys can have
the template however you want it I just
made a basic picture and our form is
going to be right here but as I said you
can have it anywhere you want it you
don't even have to have any of this if
you don't want so this is all pretty
much code you don't need to know all
this sentence this is just to make it
look good the thing I'm going to be
teaching you today is a login box right
here so like I said that's what we're
going to be working with today so the
first thing you're going to want to do
is create a file called register dot PHP
and if you want to add all this jazz to
make it look good you can but if not
then let's just get right down to it now
I made a div just so I could easily see
where my login box was but
matter where it is the first thing
you're going to want to do is make a
form so I like to start out just making
the form and closing it so I don't
forget where it is and the basic
attributes I want to add on this form is
first of all a name I'm going to set
equal to form 1 the next thing we want
to add is a method that says post and
this is very important you need to add a
method post for later on whenever we set
everything to a variable you're going to
have that method s post and the last
thing that you're going to have in your
opening form tag is an action in this
whenever you press submit and submit
this form it's going to have to run and
check to make sure everything is working
and the action says where we want it to
check and it's going to have the check
via a PHP PHP script that we're going to
build and we're going to do that is
somebody called
registered next dot PHP since this is
going to be our next step once we fill
out this form so make sure your form
looks exactly like this and then follow
along the next thing we want to do is
add the form tags username password
confirm password email and confirm email
and I like to put mine and paragraph
tags just because I found it works a lot
better now let's just type a username
since this is just basic text on the
screen so the user knows what form it's
filling in I'll show you guys what this
is later and we're going to make this an
input box so in an input box in case you
guys didn't watch my XHTML tutorials
it's just a box where users can input
stuff so the first thing we want input
for the username is text this is where
they're going to put their username
they're going to be able to type in text
the next thing is we're going to have
the name this box and the name whatever
you put in the name is going to be
stored in a very
so I'm going to make this variable
called username since it's easy to
remember
and the next thing size 15 that's how
big the box is going to be next
length equals 20 that's how long the box
or actually max length is how many
characters you can enter so they can't
have a username that's over 20
characters and the last thing I'm going
to add value is empty sense um whenever
we want it blank to show up so let me
actually show you guys save this run on
to the Firefox
once I show you guys what this mean what
this is you'll see what everything is
the username right here is the username
right here the input text is this you
can input text right there the name you
can't see it's variable the size is 15
see how long this boxes is actually 15
wide the max length is 20 and you see
I'm type in but nothing more is typing
in you can only enter in 20 characters
and the value is empty since if we put
something in the value then there would
already be text in there you can play
around on this but I'm just showing you
guys one time what it means so now that
we have a user name that they can input
their username the next thing we want to
do is have a place for them to input
their password so let's go password
and on and that we're going to have
another input box but this one is going
to be a little bit different the type of
this is going to be password and what
this means this one was texting you are
able to input text whenever you enter
your password on a like a on your email
or something you don't have those little
asterisks pop-up so no one can see what
you're typing that's what this does type
password it makes it kind of
confidential
the name for this variable is going to
be past
um and of course let's the rest of it we
can just copy from up here copy and
paste it can be 15 long max value value
now the next thing we want to make is
confirm pass now we want to confirm pass
to be exactly the same is password but
we want a different variable name and a
different text right here so let's copy
all of this copy and paste
let's put confirm pass type it password
again we want the name to be pass
let's name that pass too and we will
have all the other same things and the
last thing we want is email sentence
we're going to have to send them an
email so they can confirm their account
so let's do that right now let's go
ahead and type email and of course input
you guys are going to get good input and
stuff I have a feeling type text since
you don't want to pet you don't wanna
you want to be able to see their
password oh let's see
name we'll set the email on size equals
let's make the size of this one let stay
the same 15 max length let's have 65
cents emails are a lot longer than um
anything else and value is equal to
nothing now of course just like before
we want to have the confirm email just
like the email with a slight the only
thing we want to change is this right
here in the name of your variable so
let's just go ahead and copy this copy
pase confirm email email - and there you
go we just created our first forum in
PHP and the last thing that you're going
to need to do is add a submit button so
their users can submit their data in
let's just some let me show you guys how
to do that real quick do that to do the
excuse me put input type equals submit
this is a special button where you could
submit name equals submit and this is
going to be the name of our variable
oops
and lastly value equals register and if
you can see if we save this and take a
look at it run 100 Firefox we now have
made a basic form there you go
and in the next tutorial I'm going to be
showing guys how to make a script that
we run this form and register the user
and all this information is going to be
on my website the new Boston com so if
you want to take the text go out there
subscribe I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
