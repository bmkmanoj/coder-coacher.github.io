talk to you about our tables now you can
actually have a bunch of different
tables and I'm going to be showing you
guys a couple different ones but for now
this thing autocorrects on me like
different every single time it's kind of
ticking me off by the drop picking my
computer alright so I first want to show
you guys a simple table and then I'm
going to show you a condensed table in a
striped table and there are a couple
other ones but if you just want to look
at documentation once you learn the
basics of how they work then it's
probably a little bit easier so anytime
you make a table
you got to set its class the generic
class is just table and inside the table
you're going to have a bunch of rows and
in those rows you can make your columns
now what I'm going to do is I'm actually
going to separate this into a table head
and the table body now the table head is
good whenever you just want to label the
columns so you actually know what you
know the information in your table is
about so inside here this is where we're
going to make the rows if I can type are
you serious oh my god alright now inside
your rows see that pops up at the
stupidest frickin time really getting
kind of ticked off not that tipped off
though
I think I'm overreacting a little bit
alright so we'll have a column for name
and we'll say that this is a I don't
know a game and we're storing the users
points sounds like a pretty random idea
but hey that's what I'm going with now
after the head you can make the body so
T body and you just have regular table
rows in here and inside your table rows
you have a bunch of data so the first
one will be what's the name of the first
person Bucky Roberts that sounds like a
pretty cool dude and then what's the
next column age and points so how old am
i I am actually 74 years old and how
many points do I have in
whatever the heck game we're playing
8760 I'm pretty good at this game and
let's see let's have one other actually
let's have two other people on this guy
could be turd my GERD that sounds like a
realistic person and he or she is 13 and
they only have five points they suck and
let's have one more so we actually have
some cool data to look at um this is cha
cha cha cha I don't know it's a four
name but that's all I could think of
right now and they are 18 and they also
actually let's give them 32 points all
right so that's your basics of a table
now if I run this check it out so this
is your generic table
here's your header and there is all your
data and now let me show you guys the
difference between this let's tighten
this up a little bit and we'll keep this
one too so with the other one what can I
show you next I'll say condensed now I
actually like condensed tables a lot
they're my favorite because if you look
at this one everything is kind of big
and spaced out and whenever you have a
table you're usually looking at some
kind of data and you want to see it you
know kind of tight together at least I
do
so condensed and might as well create
the other one right now and this is
striped
I'll show you guys what that does
alright so as you can see I messed
something up and that is because yup I
need to put the name table and then copy
that's because we're actually using two
classes so this first class just says
okay this is a bootstrap table and the
second one says how do you want to style
it overriding the default styling now
hopefully this works and there we go
so this first one is just your generic
one that's your starting point I don't
know if you guys can really tell the
difference but the condense table right
here it has half the padding of this so
I just like it because it's a little bit
easier to read when all these elements
are kind of grouped together bunch
together a little bit tighter and this
last one I don't know if you guys could
tell but these rows have a little tint
to them so this one's kind of great this
is white gray and they'll alternate if I
had some more so when you have a huge
list of items in your table it's a
little bit easier to differentiate
between each individual row so there you
go that is what tables are and if we can
see what happens whenever we condense
this well it looks good on any size
device so there you go ladies and
gentlemen you now know how to make
tables and there are also a couple other
classes aside from condensed and striped
so I recommend that you go check those
out on the bootstrap website but for now
thanks for watching don't forget to
subscribe and I will see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
