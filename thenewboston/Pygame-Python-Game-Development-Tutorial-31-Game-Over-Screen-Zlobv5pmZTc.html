31st high game tutorial video in this
video we talked about now is menu
screens and also a little bit about our
message to screen functions so this
function here so right now we run our
game I swear I hit it but it's not
coming up there we go and we see our
first menu like this menu here we get
game over press you play again our cue
to quit but eventually I'd like to make
game over you know bigger and then press
C to play again or Q to quit
I'd like that taking up not be as large
as the game over but it needs to be like
game over and then the you know
proceeded play again our cue to quit and
to do that if we try to make game over
big and then procedure to play gimmicky
to quit it would that would be over each
other right because our function right
now just centers and stuff on the screen
so now what I want to talk about is just
a real basic way to give our message to
screen function and update and to allow
for us to add in a little more
functionality like like what I've just
described so ideally when we message the
screen we always probably want it
centered and the only thing I can think
of that I would never want to be like
centered right out of the gate is you
know maybe if you've got like buttons
and maybe if you've got um you know like
score won't be but that's not a message
to the screen really so everything that
I can think of that would encompass what
I would use the defined message to
screen function for will be centered on
the screen but at least Center on the
x-axis but not necessarily on the y-axis
so what I'd like to add to this function
is we've got message color and then I'm
going to just add another variable and
I'm going to call it Y underscore
displace and we're even we're also going
to assign a default value to this that
way someone doesn't have to enter a Y
displace if they don't it'll just be
centered totally but they can enter a
wide displace should they choose and
this is going to be displacement from
the center ok so what we'll do now is
we go to Center this like here we've got
text rec center equals display width
divided by two perfect and then display
height divided by two and then what we
can do here is just simply add plus y
underscore displace and now when we do
that we're basically adding whatever the
amount of pixels is that we enter into
displace so say we want to you know have
two things we might have you know game
over displaced by a hundred pixels up so
minus 100 and then another thing you
know the other message will be white
maybe right in the center or maybe 10
pixels under to the center something
like that so we can do stuff like that
so now what I want to do is we're going
to come over to where we have game over
so while game over equals throughs what
we're looking for
while game over equals true and we have
this message to screen right here
ideally what we'd like to do is game
over and this one is red so I'm just
going to do this so game over comma red
and then we can displace this by let's
do negative fifty pixels and then we'll
do another message underscore to
underscore screen and this one will be a
press C to play again or Q to quit and
this this will be in black and then it
will be displaced by 50 pixels okay so
now when we go to save and run this will
just let it run off the screen here we
see we've got game over and then press T
to play again our cue to quit and
they're content they're you know spaced
away from each other obviously we can
play with the spacing all friggin day
but I'm going to change the font and the
size of all this stuff so I'm not too
worried about making the spacing just
just so right now um so we'll leave it
at that
also just in case you guys are maybe new
ish to Python and you don't know when
you have function defaults like we've
made a default right so this is a
parameter default where we say Y
displace equals zero
this allows the person to not enter
something so we could say read and then
nothing run that and when we run off the
screen it will Center the game over and
then it moves the other one because we
gave it a value and if you ever have
like a lot of these function parameter
defaults it's a good idea to to define
it in the actual function itself when
you call it so we've got game over read
and then you could you would say just to
be really clear instead of a negative 50
you would say Y displays equals negative
50 and that will work in the same in the
same manner that it's been working but
it's a little more clear so if you have
a lot of function defaults maybe you
don't want to use all of the defaults so
like say you have a y displace and I
don't know Z displays and y displace
comes first
and then Z displace in the function
definition you would want to
specifically say hey I'm referencing Y
displace otherwise it has no idea what
you're referencing also if you just
happen to have a lot of parameters in
your function it can be useful to write
them out just purely if you're reading
through you don't have to be like wait
what was the third function and message
to screen you get scroll of be like okay
was that function above all or that that
parameter and so on so anyway that's
that we're going to continue building on
these these kind of like menus and
messages to the screen make them look a
little more appealing right now they're
really ugly so we're going to work on
that so stay tuned for that as always
