seventh cocos2d authorial and in this
tutorial as promised we're going to be
going over scenes so let me start out
and tell you guys what the heck a scene
is and I'll tell you guys by giving the
example whenever you first open your
game you might see a little movie that
plays an introduction if you will this
would be a scene so you know you watch
your introduction and it takes you to a
menu after that in the menu is how to
play on play now and you know maybe
another thing so this would be a
separate scene so you click play now and
it takes you to the actual game the
actual game would be a separate scene so
that's three scenes right there so you
can see quickly on how a different
project or app would be composed of many
different scenes so since you use many
different scenes when creating a game it
would be pretty useful to learn how to
actually make these different scenes now
by default in your project you have one
scene right there and that's the hello
world seen it pops up hello world on
screen but you can change it anything
you want but as I was saying we need a
way to learn how to create different
scenes and this is one of the problems
with the cocos2d documentation there
isn't really any good documentation
anywhere on the internet that pretty
much just tells you how to create a
basic scene there's only like tutorials
on transitions and you know weird stuff
like this so what I did for you guys is
just I'm making the story or just cover
how to create a basic scene so you know
this is one thing that's missing from
cocos2d documentation you probably can't
find it anywhere else on internet so
guys you're welcome so with that being
said let's get down tutorial we already
have one scene it's pretty much just a
menu on the screen so let's go ahead and
create another blank seem to do that
here's what you need to do highlight
classes right here right click it and
press add new file now we're going to
want to add a cocos2d template a cc note
class and
sure that this class is a subclass of CC
layer very important don't miss that now
go ahead and hit next and you can name
this file anything you want I'm going to
name my own ham and this up and create
it so now I have ham H and ham m and it
pretty much looks like a basic objective
c file except that you're importing from
cocos2d h so if you accidentally you
know create a Coco's i mean objective c
class make sure your import from cocos2d
and make sure you subclass from CC layer
you'll be fine now there we go in that
header file we only need to write one
thing and that's this plus ID seen
semicolon of course now in your
implementation we need to implement this
method now we could go ahead and code it
but there's a lot easier way to do this
go ahead and let's steal it from the
hello world implementation right here go
ahead and copy this copy and yeah we're
stealing this so in your implementation
right between the petition and paste
that and let's get some space so this
looks fine and dandy but there's one
thing we have to change on it move this
around in this hello world layer we need
to change this to ham or whatever your
name your class ham just like that and
that's all we need to do for this method
so go ahead and steal your
implementation from another scene and
just change those two little words words
and bam you're good to go how sweet is
that so in order to finish off this
class that sounded kind of deadly like
finish you off but in order to finish
this scene what we need to do is we need
to steal one more method this init
method right here so go ahead and copy
this pretty much it's just basically
stealing stuff from other classes
doesn't sound too nice but you know
that's life so command paste and you
have your init method stolen so let me
show you guys what set the meat of this
go ahead and delete everything in your
if block too so pretty much you end up
with this once you delete all the
comments in all the crap to make that
menu it's in it and then you have an if
statement that says itself is equal to
super in it and then you return self so
that's the only method you need and for
now I'm just going to leave the scene
blank but again if you want to create
anything in it just type in here so with
that being said what we want to do now
is we want to go back to this hello
world scene implementation and what we
want to do is instead of having this
button do nothing let's go ahead and
build and run this so you can see make
sure we don't got any errors all right
instead of having this button just click
it and do nothing what we want to do is
be able to click it and have it take us
to that other blank scene we just
created so go ahead and exit out your
iPhone stimulator and in this code let's
do this code here's what you need to do
CC director by the way the director is
the thing that changes scenes for you
how appropriately named shared director
and we want this director to replace
scene and we want him to do this using a
cool transition CC zoom flip X
transition and move this over and
transition with duration this means how
long do you want your transition the
last just go ahead and type in whoa whoa
transition with duration one and the
parameter I just accidentally they'll
leave it is seen and this is let me just
go ahead and type this in it isn't
really cooperating ham space node
dang it there we go re so of course
these parameters are this we want our
director because that's a singleton or
that's the object that takes care of our
scenes for us we want him to replace a
scene and how do we want them do it we
want him to use a cool transition we
wanted to take one second long and what
do we want for our new scene that ham
node that we just created and of course
end with a semi-colon and now let's go
ahead and last thing we need to do is
import this ham class so import ham H so
when it comes across mother fudger there
we go so when it comes across this right
here it knows what we're talking about
so go ahead build and run this save and
it succeeded so now check this out
whenever we press our bun does this cool
little flip and it takes us to a blank
screen so you know this blank screen is
actually our new ham scene so what I'm
going to do actually change this
tutorial up a bit I'm actually going to
go this ham implementation and add you
know what I can do just go ahead and
steal this menu right here so you know
instead of just flipping the black
because that's kind of boring go ahead
and paste this and let's go ahead and
change a few things first of all let's
add the image of the pizza so get rid of
target Kurt of all this stuff target and
selector well we can leave that there
this is really being really difficult
for me right now so anyways and your
Hamed IM just go ahead and put what's my
other file name ham dot ping and ham
dumping all I'm doing right now is
basically just adding a picture in the
next scene so instead of just blank
black screen actually has something in
it so now let's go ahead hopefully I
didn't mess anything up also I'm going
to be p 0
alright so here's our program here's
scene number one when we click it it
flips to see number two and of course
see number two we didn't add any
functionality to this we just have a
blank pizza on the screen so that is the
basics of how you transition from one
scene to another scene using a menu with
a button in it and you typically instead
of a guy getting hit in the face with
soccer ball you want to create an actual
button and typically instead of a piece
of pizza you actually want to create a
game but you know for now I think we
learned quite a bit so in the next
tutorial or be going over that creating
a game stuff but for now I'm just going
to look at this pizza and I enjoy it so
thank you guys for watching hopefully
you'll understood this if you didn't i'm
going to be posting step by step in my
forum i'll post the link below so um
yeah thank you guys for watching and
don't forget subscribe and don't forget
to check out my forum yeah see you next
