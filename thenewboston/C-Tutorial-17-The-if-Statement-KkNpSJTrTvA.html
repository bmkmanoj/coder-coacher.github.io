tutorial and in this tutorial I'm going
to be teaching you guys how to use an if
statement
now what if statement does is pretty
much you give the computer an option you
said all right I'm going to tell you
something if it's true I want you to run
this bit of code but if it's not true
then forget it don't run the code at all
so the first thing we need to do before
even get started is declare a variable
I'm going to name mine variable so is
not confusing and I'm going to set it
equal to 16 you can set your variable
equal to anything next we have to make
the syntax for our if statement and
that's simple enough if now what this if
statement is going to do is run the test
condition that's going to be in your
parentheses right here and if that's
true then it's going to run the code in
the body of your if statement if this is
false then it's not going to run this
code at all so let's give it a test
condition we are we say our if variable
is less than 30
so if 16 is less than 30 which is true
so it should run this we want you to
output on the screen the word chello
then we want you to end the line and in
case this is false what happens is the
if statement skips this completely and
just moves on the next line but since
the statement is true right now then
it's going to run this and then move on
then the next line so just to make a
next line real quick to show you guys
what's actually going on you can tell
it's going on easier not part of the
loop I'll make another line of code that
you guys would use in your program that
isn't part of the loop so again what's
going to go on right here is this c++ is
going to evaluate this variable it's
going to say alright if this variable is
less than 30 which is true it's going to
run this line of code in your if
statement and then it's going to run
this line of code just because this is a
regular part of your program
if it was false it's going to skip this
and go right to this so let's go ahead
and compile and run and if everything
works out we should see cello and not
part of the loop and there we go
again as you can see the if statement
evaluated that our variable was true so
it ran the statement and if code in the
if body and then it moved on to the next
regular part of your program and now if
you're asking alright what if this is
false I guess you guys can probably tell
what's going to happen we've got
something like 32 and you have a if
statement that evaluates it is false
since the variable is now not less or
greater than 30 this is false
so what c++ is going to do it is say
alright your test is false so I ain't
running this code omaha's I'm just going
to skip this and move on to this plus so
let's go ahead compile and run now for
everything worked out fine we shouldn't
see cello at all and this is just
successfully move on to our next part of
our program so again the if statement
evaluated this said all right I'm
skipping this since it's false I'm just
moving on and there's what you get so
those that bit of code is your basics
for your if loop again play around with
a test condition and in the next song
and teaching guys how to do it if else
statement most likely so stick around
and I hope you learned something thanks
