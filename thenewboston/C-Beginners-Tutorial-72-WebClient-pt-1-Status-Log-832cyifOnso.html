tutorial that I'm making for the New
Boston and in this tutorial I'm going to
be showing you how to have a status log
on your program so basically like a
status log is something that you can
tell your clients or the users of your
application what's going on with your
program like news about or you could
really have it say anything right here
and instead of having you just set the
text boxes text equal to something we're
going to make it something or make there
be a way so you change something on a
server and every person who opened this
program will see the same message no
matter what wording their application is
so in order to do that you're just going
to go open up your web browser go to web
comm and then you're going to want to
create an account I already have an
account so I'm not going to do that but
it's pretty easy just type in your email
and password that you want and your site
type it really doesn't matter and then
just click get started
once you've all got your account set up
just sign in just gonna sign them on and
once you're signed in go over to file
manager right here and then select
single file uploader and make sure you
have a some sort of text document ready
I just have a text document called
status it doesn't really matter what the
name is or what the contents of are and
you can edit that later but once you
have a text file already just open that
and click upload file and then it will
upload the file to right here and then
you can edit their file just by clicking
this little pen right here and click
Edit and now you can make it anything
you would like I'm just going to say
welcome to my app location and I spell
local alright and then just click Save
and now it will save that we've written
there now we can go back into c-sharp
and we're going to have it load what we
just wrote right here in the status text
into this text box we're going to have
to do that on the form lo so just move
over to events or here and click load
and in order to download data from the
internet we're going to be using the
system net class or namespace and then
we're going to want to create a new web
client class we call this cloth WC or
web client and then set it equal to a
new web client and then we're going to
set text box once tech equal Q what this
web client downloads from this status
text right here so we're going to do WC
dot download string and then we're just
going to put the address to the string
that you want to download the address to
that is um wall you just click on the
file you've uploaded and it'll take you
right to the page of that and then just
copy that URL
press ctrl C or right click and click
copy and then just paste that right in
here as a string so now on it will
download whatever we put as our text
document and we put welcome to my
application so as soon as we load up
this programmer here you should see
welcome to my application in this text
box over here yep welcome to my
application and we could change it to
something else right here if we were
changing - welcome to my application and
then I could say I have added many shoes
a broom but click Save and now we should
see I have added many new features in
the text box as well that we put us to
load here yep we also see I have added
many new features so this is just a
really quick and easy way to make it so
you can download on a string or have a
status of your program and if you have
web hosting or something like that you
can obviously host your text file on
your hosting but this is just
a free and easy way to do it so that's
it for this tutorial
so see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
