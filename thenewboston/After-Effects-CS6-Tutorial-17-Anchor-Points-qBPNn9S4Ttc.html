buddy Blackford here with another After
Effects cs6 tutorial for the new boston
today we're going to be learning about
anchor points I just wanted to let you
know that I counted a stack or two
energy shot that I found at the dollar
store for one dollar and it has me
pretty wired it says it has a as much
caffeine as a cup of coffee in it and
I'm feeling pretty good I don't usually
drink coffee
I don't usually pound Red Bulls or rock
stars or anything like that so it's got
me feeling good hopefully I don't crash
in like an hour although I feel like it
probably will since it's from the dollar
store but oh well
feel good now so the anchor point is
this little reticle sniperscope looking
icon right here in the middle and let's
see it you it's there for rotating
around and scaling from and moving your
position based on that point and let's
see how right now it's in the center of
this object so it's going to scale and
rotate around that point so watch this
as you can see it's rotating around that
around the point it's not rotating
you're on the center of the chain saw
it's rotating around the point and also
if I try to scale from it scale it's
going to scale from the center of it
there which pretty pretty easy easily
understood so you don't want say you
don't want your anchor point there you
want it to be over by the handle so you
can move the chain saw up and down so
you can cut a piece of wood in half or
something like that well that's what I'm
going to show you how to do is move the
anchor point around today so there's a
few ways to do it and let's go into our
timeline panel here and you press a for
anchor point
and you can move it with with these
sliders here and you can see it keeps
the Anchor Point in the center let's go
get to get on there there we go and and
if you move it there to the side and you
can move your move your chainsaw back
there you can see that the Anchor Point
is now over here by the handle I'll
click rotate and now you can see that
the ink now it's going to rotate around
the handle now I can like chop some wood
in half or something like that this is
told you I'm a little wired so that's
one way to move to Anchor Point let's go
back to the Anchor Point down here in
the timeline panel and to reset it to
the middle you right-click on it hit
reset and your anchor point stays in the
middle while the image or in this case
I'm using a vector rotates or moves
around the Anchor Point another way to
move the Anchor Point is using the Pan
behind tool which is up here it's this I
don't even know what kind of shape it's
like a dotted line box so the bunch of
arrows are on the outside
that's the Pan behind tool and either
click on that or the hotkey for it is y
like that now you go over to the anchor
point here and you can drag it and this
way the anchor point moves but you keep
your image or or vector whatever you
using it could be video footage it moves
it to the around the image so it will
have the same effect see
that's how you do that
I'm hitting ctrl Z just to get it back
to the center now there is another way
that doesn't seem to be working on
vectors so what I'll show you on a solid
so I'm going to click layer new solid
I'm going to make this into a circle I'm
just naming it here I'll do this real
quick for you guys I'm just going to
create a circle like that I'll click off
it so the mask isn't showing more but
now let's see if I try to rotate this
circle it's going to rotate around the
anchor point which was in the center of
the solid but since I make made a circle
over here and in the corner the anchor
point is now in the middle so you can
use the other techniques that I showed
you to move the anchor point or you can
double click and it brings you to the
layer panel you can go down to this view
where it says masks click on anchor
point path and you're still on your
selection tool here you see how that
change the cursor changed get over that
and then you can put it right in the
middle here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
