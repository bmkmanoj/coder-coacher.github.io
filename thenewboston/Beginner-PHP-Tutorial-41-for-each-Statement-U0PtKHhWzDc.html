org and this is a video for the new
Boston in this video we're going to be
talking about the for each construct now
it's commonly referred to as a for each
loop because it does actually loop
through elements of an array and allows
us to sort of iterate over an array and
take out different elements now I'm left
with the example here of when I did the
or the code from the multi-dimensional
arrays tutorial and but what we're going
to be doing is we're going to be
displaying to the user a list of healthy
and unhealthy food so we can sort of see
the practical uses of multi-dimensional
arrays and then using this for each
construct to to basically display all
these values rather than accessing the
values like so we could do food healthy
and then access element 0 which would be
salad so if we refresh that we have
salad up here so we start by just
writing for each and we have some
rounded brackets and then we have a
block so it's as simple as that
that's the syntax for it now inside here
we need to address the array so that
would be food and then we need to say as
so food as an element okay so food as
element is taking it's taking our
element which in actual fact is healthy
and unhealthy now because I also need to
take into account these here I'm saying
food as element equals greater than food
oh sorry I'll just do an item for
example okay so food is the array
overall element is healthy and unhealthy
and item is this array here so food
element is this sorry is this here
and this here and then the item is each
one of these so in fact I'll call it in
a element just so it's easier to
recognize now I'm going to echo element
and then get append a line break on the
end of that so using the dot and then
I'm echoing out some HTML so now we need
to refresh to see what's going to happen
now and you can see that we're presented
with healthy and unhealthy so already
we've categorized the two different
elements of this array inside here now
what we want to do is we want to further
access our inner elements so at the
moment if I was to come down here and
echo inner element spell it right you
can see that we're not going to have
much luck because what we're trying to
do is echo out an array so let's just
refresh that you can see under each one
we've already we're already starting to
pull together some kind of structure
where we're going to list our healthy
and unhealthy food
however we just been displayed with this
array keyword so you'll probably
remember that the we need to loop again
to find information about these and so
we've already looped to find information
about these however what we can now do
is we'll scrap this line here and we can
say for each and create a new for each
so now what we can do is we can say for
each inner element which should really
be called inner array so let me just
change this because it it makes a lot
more sense as harder than you think
naming variables so so we've echoed out
each element of this so these health
this healthy and this unhealthy now we
need to go in and echo out each one of
these so salad vegetables and pasta so
now what we can do is say inner array as
item item is equal to salad vegetables
and pasta for this element here
and and for unhealthy its equal to pizza
and ice cream so now all we really need
to do is say echo item a Pender line
break on and we're done okay so now when
we refresh you can see that it's taken
each element of that and it's put it
into a list if you like so what I'm
going to do is make a simple change here
I'm going to append strong tag on the
start of there and a strong tag ending
there that just sort of separates our
tables by making them more bold so now
what I can do is I can update this as
much as I want so I could say popcorn
and refresh and it just adds an element
adds a value just straight into there so
now you can see using this for each
we've been able to take the inner inner
array of this associative array overall
it would be called a multi-dimensional
array and we've just echoed out the data
that we need to</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
