your let's see 12th objective-c tutorial
and I don't know why my voice is so
raspy right now I'm not like sick or
anything I just got back from the beach
and all of a sudden my voice is raspy
now so um I probably sounded different
from the last tutorials but you'll get
used to it
so anyways in this tutorial we're gonna
be talking about we're gonna be talking
about looping and what looping is is
it's a way to execute code over and over
again
without having to type it over and over
again so it's the first pretty neat
thing that I'm gonna be teaching you and
there are let's see probably three main
huge types of loops and in this is Toria
I'm going to be talking to you guys
about something called the for loop and
uh let's just go ahead and get started
now let's go ahead and make a variable
called X and we won't set it say equal
to anything for now so we're gonna be
doing the very first loop which is our
very first program is we're gonna be
outputting the numbers which means
printing them on the screen one to ten
now with the tools we have so far what
we can do is we can make ten lines of
code on NSLog and we can put NSLog one
and this ought to and it can get kind of
repetitive but we want to build a
program that can repeat this process for
us so that's why objective-c
incorporated something called the for
loop and what it does is it takes a bit
of code and it runs it over and over
again for as many times as we tell it to
so here's the syntax to create a for
loop go ahead and press for and go ahead
and put it put empty parentheses after
it now you're gonna have three kind of
sets of variables or arguments for your
for loop the first actually technically
they're called three different
expressions the first expression is
where you want your expression variable
to start so what's going to happen is
this go ahead and set X equal to one
now the for loop is gonna look at this X
and as long as it's with within the
range well I'm gonna give you guys the
whole thing first and then you
understand set X equal to one and put a
semicolon this expression is off for now
it needs his second expression say X is
less than or equal to 10 and then that's
another expression now for your third
expression put X is equal to X plus 1
and now I'll tell you guys what this
means in it'll make sense now you have a
variable X and don't forget this entire
program is gonna run a piece of code ten
times so anyways you have a variable X
and it's equal to one now this program
is gonna run as long as X is within its
boundaries and then the second one you
give it its boundaries so you say all
right it's equal to one right now to
begin with and as long is it's less than
or equal to ten
I want this program to keep running you
say alright well then I think it's going
to stay one the whole time it's always
gonna be less than or equal to ten and
the third one is to solve that problem
is to change X you say hold on each time
we run this loop we're gonna take that X
and add one to it so the first time it's
gonna be one alright the next time it's
gonna be two all right next time three
four five six seven eight nine and ten
and once it gets to 11 this expression
is not going to be true anymore so this
expression is gonna say alright I'm only
supposed to run this program when it's
the less than or equal to ten
once I get to 11 I'm done so let me go
ahead and print all this out of the for
you guys so what can we do with a for
loop the line we type after this is
gonna run ten times so let me do
something real simple like m/s log and
then go ahead and put at percent I
and then just go ahead and print out X
and now let's go ahead and build and run
this and you'll see visually what's
going on see the very first time it
prints out X it says X is equal to 1 so
I'm going to go ahead and print that out
right here so it does this whole loop
and says is this statement still good
yep still less than 10 so I can keep
going well I'm gonna take X and add 1 to
it and now the next time I run it it's
equal to 2 the next time equal 2 3 4 5 6
7 8 9 10 and then after 10 it sets X to
11 and it says all right I'm only
supposed to be running this program when
X is less than or equal to 10 so since I
got to 11 that way I knew that my
program wasn't good anymore and I was
supposed to stop and this one I mean you
don't even have to do X plus 1 you can
do X plus 2 and look what happens here
save all it starts out at 1 then it goes
3 5 7 9 and once it gets past 10 I mean
it knows a shutdown and you can also
start at different values let me change
this back to 1 1 you can start at
something like 4 and it'll give it a
different starting point 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
or you can even go to 4 to UM 21 and now
when you build and run this and safe it
will go from 4 to 21 so again all a for
loop does is it takes a little bit of
code and it runs it over and over again
for you so without this for loop just
imagine if we had a program that we had
a bit of code we wanted to run a
thousand times what you do in some cases
well we would have to type everything a
thousand times over and over again it'll
get really annoying so that's why they
made this nice little thing called a
loop to do code over and over again for
you so those are the basics of looping
and that's all you really need to know
for for loops for this tutorial
again there are two different types of
loops as well that we're gonna be going
over in the end tutorials to come in the
next tutorial I'm gonna show you aside
from outputting numbers one to ten why
you would use a for loop and make this
idea and concept stick in your head a
little more so thank you guys for
watching don't forget to subscribe and
check out my blog and by the way I'll
see you next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
