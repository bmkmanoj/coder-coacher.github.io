beats Toro and in this lesson it's gonna
be a real quick video probably because I
just want to tell you guys about one
thing and that's how to extract the
value of your looping counter so you
know how I said in this last case
scenario where we started at zero and
I'm gonna could easily restart this
tutorial without the sneeze but you know
what I think I'm gonna leave that in
there so anyways in the last case
scenario what we did is we have a
command like this now we started at zero
we went to 15 and we counted by five so
pretty much our values that the computer
saw were a zero 5 10 and 15 and once we
got to 15 and knew to stop but what if
we wanted to see the value each time
instead of just just little command
right here whoa let's go ahead and learn
how to do that the cool thing about Ruby
is unlike a lot of other programming
languages Ruby lets you store the
current value in a variable using this
little pipe symbol now again this is the
little thing above the enter key on your
keyboard it's a straight line that goes
up and down so let's go ahead and make a
simple counting loop so we will go 1 up
to 10 or something like that the values
really don't matter now what I want is
to see what number the loop is on every
time one two three four five six seven
eight nine ten however if we just give
it a basic man then it's going to do the
same command every time so what we want
to do first is we want to extract the
variable and I'm just gonna put it in a
variable called X now the X is just a
variable I made up but you can name your
guys variable anything you want so now
what we did is we are going to extract
the value every time this loop is going
to happen so now that we have the value
well let's just go ahead and print it
out on the screen so puts X so now when
I go ahead and hit enter check it out it
says one two three four five six seven
eight nine ten so what it did is it
looped from one to ten every time it
looped we stored that value in a
variable called X
now again like I said I just named that
variable X but you can name anything you
want the key here is whenever you want
to extract variable make sure you put it
in between those pipe signs whenever you
do that you're telling Ruby hey we want
to get the value and store in this
variable right here and then with that
variable you can do anything you want
you can add it to other variables you
can just print it out on the screen like
you did the world is your oyster go
ahead and do anything you want with it
so now let me go ahead and show you guys
another example that may clear things up
say we have zero and we want to go to 15
by fives like in the last time actually
we can just go ahead and change this one
up right here so instead of just
stepping from zero to 15 and it prints
out something four different times let's
go ahead and extract the value from this
one so again inside curly braces the
first thing we want to do is extract
that value so we use two pipe signs and
we give a variable name like bacon
sounds like a good name so now that we
extracted the value and we stored it in
a variable called bacon let's just go
ahead and print it on the screen so puts
bacon so now whenever we run this we can
clearly see that the values that the
computer sees is 0 5 10 and 15 and then
we can go up to our method and verify
that mmm excuse me verify that yes
indeed we're starting at 0 and we want
to go to 15 by 5's so yes our computers
working Ruby's working properly and we
are good to go
so again that's how you extract the
value of a variable whenever you are
looping so hopefully you guys understand
now if you don't just go ahead and ask
me I'm gonna forum T and be forum calm
but for now thank you guys for watching
don't forget to subscribe and I'll see
you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
