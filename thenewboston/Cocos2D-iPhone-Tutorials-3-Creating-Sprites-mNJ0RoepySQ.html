third cocos2d tutorial the tutorial they
who have all been waiting for finally we
get to actually create a program
ourselves and we don't have to you know
just look at test their programs because
you know what we're done setting
everything up it's time to jump in and
actually start cone some crap so the
first thing I want to teach you guys is
about sprites this is pretty much one of
the most basic components of every
cocos2d application now if you never
created a computer game before what a
sprite is is pretty much all the cool
things that you add to your program you
have your background image of course
because you need one of those you have
all your menus and buttons and then you
have your sprites your sprites are the
images that move around on your screen
get animated crash into each other and
pretty much make your game fun for
example if you ever play Super Mario
Brothers the original one for nintendo
super mario would be a spray the enemies
would be sprites and the fireballs that
came out of them their sprites these are
all the things that we spend most of our
coding on so you know pretty much the
cool images pretty much all the cool
stuff is sprite um not a drink actually
it's not a soda pop so if you're
thinking all right I know a spray is I
saw a commercial about it no this is a
different kind of sprite so you know
enough of me talking about spray I'm
getting thirsty so go ahead and create a
new Xcode project right Daria and go
ahead and choose cocos2d application and
go ahead and choose this and you can
name it anything you want name it you
know bacon ham tuna I don't care name it
anything you want save and now let's see
what pops up like this bacon ham tune
that sounds like a wonderful place so
let me arrange this and let me move this
around so you know
before you guys start complaining all
right now check this out first thing we
want to do well you know even before the
first thing zero thing we want to do
expand resources and you see you have a
couple images here your background image
in your little icon image but go ahead
and download two and they can either be
like 40 by 40 or 70 x 70 but anyways
download two small ping images from
google or anywhere it doesn't really
matter you just need any examples i
download this chick right here and make
sure you press copy right like that it
probably won't matter but anyways um go
ahead and press add so i have this chick
right here and i also have this pig and
copy as well and add but anyways you
don't need the chicken the big you just
need any two images on that you can work
with it can even be this icon actually
if you want if you're too lazy to
download anything you can just use that
but anyway so make sure you have two
images because that's what we need Fritz
tutorial to be adding to the screen so
before we actually do anything just go
ahead and build and run your default
program to make sure that you know you
don't have any errors you got everything
installed right and by default the
templates include a basic program that
says hello world on your iPhone
simulator so if you drag your iPhone
simulator you see a basic hello world
text I'm saying all right how to heck to
that pop-up we didn't even code anything
yet this is just all you know built into
the template to make sure your program
is running fine so anyways now that you
have that you know that we have our
template our cocos2d application
template is good to go so where are the
files for this well if you expand
classes right here you can see that you
have a couple files your hello world
delegates or excuse me these are your
delegates your bacon ham tuna apt
elegance and these are kind of the
behind-the-scenes functions that
a happen you know whenever your program
first opens so let's check it take a
look at some of these application did
finish launching we don't code any of
that this is you know these are kind of
system level methods what we are
focusing on in this tutorial is these
hello world files specifically this is
your header file which we won't touch in
this tutorial and this is your
implementation file so make sure you're
in hello world layer dot M and you can
see that over here hello world seen em
so this is the file we're going to be
working in so let's go ahead and open
that and let's do some cool stuff to it
let me go ahead and rearrange it skin
there we go that'll be good enough
alright so as you can see you already
got a bunch of code in here and most of
this code is actually just to make sure
that hello world pop up on screen but
you know we really don't need a lot of
this so all the comments if you want you
can delete but the first thing that we
want to do is add those two sprites to
the screen so what we're going to be
doing in this program I should have said
this before is we're going to be taking
out the hello world because you
know we want to coat our own program and
what we're going to be doing is adding
our two images which is this chick right
here in this pig on the screen just
adding two basic images on a screen so
go back to your file and the first thing
you need to do to do this is this go
ahead and type under import type see sea
sprite make sure you don't type it in
any method because if you type it
outside of every method then every month
it is going to have access to it these
are called file level objects or file
level pointers because everything in
your file is going to have access to it
so anyways CC spray is how you tell your
program that you're going to be creating
a spray on the screen and in this
program at we're creating our spray is
simply an image so you can go ahead and
add a pointer to it and name it anything
you want I'm just going
name one mind chick and CC sprite star
and I'm just going to name my other one
Pig just so we know everything's clear
now check this out right now we just
have two pointers and we don't really
have you know any way to reference that
this is supposed to the point to the
chick image and this is supposed to
point to the pig image we just have two
pointers pretty much dumb pointers right
now so now what you want to do is you
want to look for a method called in it
and go ahead and you can minimize that
right there and by the way if you don't
know how to mend my stuff just highlight
the arrows that are in this little bar
but anyways you didn't need to know that
either anyways go down to the method
called in it right here and this is a
built-in method that not only comes with
a cocos2d application templates but most
your templates have an init method built
right into them and what init method is
is whenever your view or in this case in
cocos2d they pretty much call a view a
scene technically they're not exactly
same thing but whenever I save you or
seen for now just think of them is the
same thing so I notice whenever you're
seeing gets loaded this is the method
that runs automatically without having
to call anything so go ahead and delete
everything in this if block so again
we're working in the in it inside the if
block this is all the code to create the
hello world stuff if you can see see see
label hello world change the size
position and add it to the screen well
again like I said we are trying to take
out the hello world stuff and add our
own images so go ahead and delete
everything in the if block and inside
our if block here's where we're going to
be creating our sprites so let's go
ahead and make some room there we go and
the first thing we want to do is
reference our sprite Intel alright that
object we pointed to we actually want to
reference it and tell you what image
goes along with the object so here's
what how you tell
what sprite is supposed to use what
image go ahead and type the name reach
spray and remember one who mine was
named chick and go ahead type equals to
see sea sprite sprite with file just
like that look at it and now for your it
takes a string of what your file name is
so your file names are going to be
different depending on what file you
download from the internet but mine was
named chick ping so now you're saying
all right for that spray object use the
chick image simple enough so now what
you want to do on the screen is after
you say what image you want to use you
got to say we're on a screen do you want
to put it so check that position
definitely spell that wrong position and
set this equal to and this is very
important CCP and then you need to pass
it to coordinate say 150 150 now a
couple things we want to take note of
here what the heck is this CPP stuff we
know position is a property obviously
CCP is actually how you make points in
cocos2d they of course into their own
you know special coordinate system so
this is how you do it now 150 150 is a
little different than what you might
think instead of the top left and go 150
over 150 down in cocos2d you actually
start at the bottom left so you're going
to go 150 right 150 up and it's going to
appear somewhere right here so now the
last thing we need to do is we need to
add the sprite to the lair so in order
to do this go ahead and press self add
child and the child you want to add is
of course the chicks pray now I know I
didn't talk about scenes or views or
layers or anything like that but um
that's for another story for now you
need to know layers in cocos2d work a
lot like layers in Photoshop they're
pretty much just layers of
drugs that you can put on the screen but
you'll be more familiar with this as we
move on so anyways after this what we
need to do is just go ahead and do the
same thing with our pig so go ahead and
I'm telling this up that's what she said
and change this old pig so for my Pig
spray I'm going to inicia swith
initialize this with the file pig ping
that's Ted bit better right there and
for the pigs position let's go ahead and
put this it 250 250 so you know they're
not overlapping each other and add child
pig to the layer right there now if we
go ahead and run this we can see on our
iPhone stimulator and by the way I know
it's not called stimulator it's just
what I say my own load joke to myself
check this out the first thing we did is
referenced this spray object to se RA
for the image we want you to use is this
chick ping now where do you want you to
position it 150 over 150 up right there
and add it to the layer because if we do
if we didn't do that it wouldn't display
so that's why it's displayed and why is
this pig image I mean the only thing
different than this one is it it's a
different image of course and the
position is 250 250 so now you can
clearly see the coordinate system this
one is 150 over 150 up this pig is 250
over 250 up so that's how the coordinate
system works in cocos2d it's a little
bit different than the iphone typical
coordinate system being in the top left
but anyways that is pretty much all I
wanted to cover in this tutorial of
course all we did is created basic
sprites using CC spray that's how you
create a spray object reference it using
spray with file than writing whatever
your image files is called and then
position on the screen and then just add
it to the layer will be talking about
layers and scenes later on anyways
that's all I want to cover in the story
thank you guys for watching and don't
forget subscribe and I will see you guys
in the next door by the way check out my
forum
ipod apps yeah I'll see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
