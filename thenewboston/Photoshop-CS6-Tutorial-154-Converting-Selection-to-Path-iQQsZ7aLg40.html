another Photoshop cs6 tutorial here for
you
today we're going to learn how to
convert a selection into a path and it's
really easy so this tutorial shouldn't
really take too long so what I want you
to do is go ahead and import an image
that you would want to make into a path
and the easiest would be something that
doesn't have a background that you can
easily just select and get the outside
of the selection or something like that
enough this is something easy enough
like that so go ahead and take a tool
whatever tool you need and make your
selection so I'm going to click on the
white here and then I'm going to go to
select inverse so I have this tomato
selected now what I'm going to do it's
super easy I'm going to go over here to
my paths panel and you can see that
there's nothing here right now I can go
ahead down here and click on this button
down here to convert my selection into a
path if I do that it automatically makes
a path but if I do it that way I don't
really get any options to mess with so I
like doing it a different way if you
hold down alt when you're going to click
on the path here or click on the button
here we get a make-work work path button
here now we've got a tolerance setting
now if we set the tolerance down low
this Tyler's goes from 0 to 10 if you
set the tolerance down low it's going to
make a few more intersecting points and
it's going to follow the edges a little
bit better than if you put it up higher
if you put it up high then it's going to
make a or make smoother paths but might
not follow as well so let's go ahead and
set this to 1 and I'm going to hit OK
and you can see that a work path has
been made and you can see that it is
independent from my layers if you look
closely you can see that there is a an
outline there that is the path now if
you need to select the path go ahead on
this little section right here with the
text
and the shape tools and the path
selection tool is what we're looking for
these are your vector editing tools you
can go ahead and select the path and you
can see the different points that are on
it all right now let's go ahead and make
let's go back in our history to where we
had our selection and let's now make the
selection with a higher tolerance and
I'll put this at 10 and I'll hit OK now
you can see that it's smoother you can
see that the path here goes off the line
let's go ahead and turn off we'll keep
the white background on so we can see a
little better and I click and you can
see that there are definitely a lot less
points so it's not going to conform as
well to your image but it makes it a
smoother image so use the tolerance
depending are differently depending on
what type of image you have if you don't
have a lot of points that need to be
fixed then you want to use a high
tolerance so if you just have a plain
old circle go ahead and use a 10 but if
you have a more complex image use a
lower tolerance so you can get more of
the selection around it so that's how
you convert a selection into a path now
the reason you would want to do this
that when you make a selection and
Photoshop the selections are created
using pixels so the accuracy of your
selection is based on the resolution of
what you're selecting now if you're
selecting something that's low
resolution then it can be a problem when
you're working with web images or like
if you need some presentation graphics
or something like that but if you
convert the selection into a path you
can reshape the path and use Photoshop
vector tools these ones over here and it
gives you more control over your final
results so that's a that's it about
converting a selection into a path so if
we guys learned a little bit up
a little bit more about paths and vector
images and you can for example I'll show
you that you can edit this path so if I
hold ctrl T to make my free transform I
can scale this up and down and that's
not something you're able to do with the
selection so just wanted to let you know
that and that's the end of the tutorial
so thanks for watching this one and
hopefully you guys can put this new
information to good use in your next
project
look forward to seeing you guys in the
next tutorial see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
