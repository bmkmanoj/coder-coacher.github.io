slash on live gamer for the new Boston
and in this tutorial we're going to be
taking a look at step operators now the
last tutorial we did a simple for loop
and in that for loop it automatically
stepped it up by one each time the for
loop brand now sometimes you won't want
to do that maybe you want to step it by
five or step it by even 100 there's an
easy way to do this by using what's
called the step operator and you can
also step negative numbers too so let's
go ahead and create a little demo
application for this we'll go ahead and
go up to new project we go to console
application and we will just call it
step operator and we'll just go ahead
and click okay let's zoom in a bit here
okay so let's just add console dot
readline so it waits for us to press
ENTER or close out of the program for it
to close the window before we're done
reading so let's go ahead and create a
for loop so we're going to do for num1
equals 1 to 20 and then we'll just do
console dot write line now 1 now when
you're making a for loop you don't have
to declare the variable num 1 I know I
did that in my last tutorial but it
isn't necessary you can if you want to
okay so now that we've got this for loop
done let's just go ahead and do console
dot write line up here normal for loop
and let's create another for loop so for
number 1 equals 1 to 20 and then let's
just do console dot write line num1 now
these are exactly the same but we can do
something very simple to make them
completely different so for number 1
equals 1 to 20 and we just call the step
operator and set specifies how much to
increment between each loop iteration so
that basically says whenever it gets
down to the next your whatever is after
step is going to be how much it adds to
num one so let's just go ahead and let's
step 5 in this for loop so let's just
come up here and type console dot write
line and then we'll do another one just
so it adds a space in between our for
loops
and we'll just say step by five now
let's create one more for loop to
console dot write line and we'll do that
one more time but in this one we'll say
step by negative four so let's create
one more for loop so for number one
equals twenty to one and we'll just step
that by negative four so what this is
going to do is it's going to start our
for loop at 20 and go down for each time
until it gets to one and we'll just do
console dot write line num1 so let's go
ahead and run our program and see what
happens okay so up here we have our
normal for loop which starts at 1 and
goes all the way to 20 and calcify 1
each time and if we scroll down a bit we
have our step by 5 starts out at 1 adds
5 to it which gives you 6 then gives you
11 and then it gives you 16 now you can
see it didn't print anything else after
16 and the reason it does this is
because if you add 5 to 16 it's going to
be 21 and that's going to be out of the
bounds of the loop that we set and
here's our step by negative 4 it starts
out of 20 subtracts 4 from it which is
which makes 16 then it goes out of 12
then 8 then 4 and it doesn't go down to
0 because once again that would be out
of the balance that we set for the loop
now step is a very simple thing to learn
and it's very useful though I find
myself using it a lot when I make
programs and so go ahead and give it a
try make some programs with it and then
once you've got that down go ahead and
move on to the next tutorial so thanks
