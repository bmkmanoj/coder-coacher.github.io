believe PI game tutorial and in this
tutorial I'm gonna be going over how to
calculate the distance between two
points now I got my little drunk thing
open show you guys visually because I
found out that is a lot easier if you
guys could see so in my last tutorial we
had two points one in 2020 I mean at
2025 and one at forty 55 so if we went
over 20 and down 25 let me put 20 25 I
got a pretty good hinder and on-screen
and then we went over 40 and down 55 so
over 40 down 55 so I'll put this at 40
55 and we already built a function to
calculate our vector which was 20 which
is the difference between the X and 30
so let me go ahead and here would be our
vector right here
and you can calculate that because the
difference is um let's see it's 20 down
and 30 across so our vector would be 20
30 so now that we have our vector we
need to calculate the value or distance
of this line right here so if you're
wondering all right I know what a vector
is I know how to calculate the
coordinates of the vector but I need to
figure out the distance from point A
which is here to point B so let's go
ahead and do that right now and by the
way since this is a right triangle the
formula for this is a squared and this
side equals B squared in this slope this
would be C squared so a squared I'm not
even going to type it plus B squared
equals C squared so that's what we're
gonna do this is called Pythagorean
theorem
and he gave this to us because he wanted
us to make computer games so that's what
we're about to do and that's what I'm
about to show you how to do so let me
minimize out of that and we already got
one function actually I'm gonna go ahead
and change this to X&amp;amp;Y X Y X Y let me
run it make sure it still runs make sure
I didn't break anything and 2030 there
you go it still runs so now that we
figured out this formula to go ahead and
build the vector we need a formula to
figure out the distance so let's do that
right now
let's make another function in our class
in our vector class and this time let's
name it this thing so def distance and
make it self and what we need to do is
first set the variable of the side a and
the side B so we already have these we
already have a list up here and the
first item in the list is the difference
in the first side and the second item in
the list is the difference in the second
side so the first item in the list is
this right here
and the second item in the list is this
right here so we can utilize those
variables that we already got in our
formula down here man would you look at
this I really messed up
that's like graffiti right now anyways
so we can use that list to extract the
values from it too well it's a lot
easier to see so let's go ahead and set
two variables for the side so it's
easier to see self a a I know I said a
twice but this is equal to cell diff
zero since this is equal to this
coordinate minus this coordinate so
right now self a is going to equal 20
because remember here's what here's the
list I was talking about this list is
self diff so self a
is going to be equal to the first item
minute which is 20 and self B I'm gonna
make is equal to this item which is 30
and then we can use those two items
these are the two sides and we can use
these two sides to figure out the length
of that third side so let's go ahead and
write self B and set it equal to self
diff and this would be one since
remember zero was the first item in
enlist and one is the second item it's
weird but that's the way it is and now
we need a something called a math
function square root so what we need to
do is import math and this will give us
the use of the square root function
which will give us the ability to solve
for a third side so what we want to do
is return math dot square root and again
what we need to put in here is a squared
plus B squared
so go ahead and put self dot a asterisk
Astrix that - and that means square root
and python you Perisher know that self
be a stretch Astrix - and what this
pretty much means it's a really
complicated way of writing up but a
squared plus b squared and equal C
squared in order to get C squared we
need to take the square root of it so
that's what this does right now so let's
go ahead and the last thing we have to
do is print out our answer so print
thing dot distance and it doesn't take
any parameters as you can see it only
takes a self parameter so let's go ahead
and run this and then after it works
I'll show you guys it one more time so
here the two sides the side this side is
20 going up and down the side going left
and right is 30 in the distance between
those is 36 so let me show you in my
awesome here we are right here this side
would be 20 this side would be 30 in
this side would be 36
this slope side and again if you take
this side squared plus this side squared
it equals this side squared and that's
how you get it and it's a lot easier if
you know that theorem but anyways that's
how you do it
so let me talk you guys through this one
more time what we did is we took this
list that we already built we already
knew the first item in the list was the
length of the first side the second item
in the list was the length of the second
side so all we needed to do is square
those square a and square B and then you
got the square root of the slope side or
excuse me the distance of the slope side
and then we just printed it out so
that's your quick tutorial on how to
find the distance between two points
using a vector it makes it really easy
think to Pythagoras or whatever his name
was so practice this tutorial follow
along with me don't forget to change
your variables and also don't forget to
import math or else you won't be able to
use a square root function so again
thank you guys for watching don't forget
subscribe and I'll see you next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
