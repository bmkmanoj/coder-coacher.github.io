slash on live gamer for the new boston
and in this tutorial we're going to
continue working on our favorites viewer
program now this program all the credit
goes to the authors of beginning
Microsoft Visual Basic 2008 and they are
thearon Willis and Brian Newsome this is
a great book i would recommend it for
anybody who wants to learn visual basic
and is they have an updated 2210 version
then you may want to get that instead so
i just want to say that to make sure
they get full credit and i'm not taking
any for this so if you remember from the
previous tutorial we use this for each
loop to add each of the favorites to our
list view so let's go ahead and run this
and see if everything works so here is
our form you can see it says my
favorites and it's got our icon and
we've got the name which is gmail and
the URL it's going to have this really
long URL which is basically to log me in
to my gmail and then we have the New
Boston and the URL is HTTP colon slash
slash WWE New Boston calm and then we
have YouTube and it has our YouTube URL
now based on what your favorites are
this may look different and it will look
different so let's say when you created
your YouTube favorite you named it eggs
it would show eggs right here and then
have the URL and you can see that when
we select this it's going to select the
sub item of that too and so let's go
ahead and close out of this and now we
need to do is we need to set the set up
the link label to open the website when
they click on it so we can do this by
accessing the click event of our list so
let's click the lightning bolt right
here and we'll go ahead and find click
so whenever they click on list favorites
or one of the indexes on there what
we're going to do is we're going to set
the
text of our URL so we'll do link URL dot
text is going to be equal to visit so
we're just going to let it let them know
that they can visit this website and
then we're going to add list favorites
dot selected items
dot item and zero
and we're just going to do dot txt
now unlike a normal list box you would
think that if we access the item at
index of 0 it's always going to show us
the first item in the in debt in the
list because you think that it goes 0 1
2 as it goes down but in reality it's 0
and then 1 and then 0 and then 1 and 0
and then 1 I believe that's the way it
is correct me if I'm wrong so we're
going to visit and the list favorites
are selected item items items at index
of 0 and text so let's go ahead and run
this and you can see that if I select
Gmail it says visit gmail and then the
New Boston click the new boston and
youtube it shows youtube so let's go
ahead set this to one and let's see what
happens let's see if I was right
and it looks like we are getting an
error we cannot access the index of one
so let's just go ahead and change that
back to zero so now what we need to do
is we need to get rid of the link so
link URL links dot clear so what this is
going to do is going to get rid of the
length the link so it just looks like a
normal label now you may be wondering
why we're going to do this well what we
need to do is separate visit from our
link now we can do this by creating a
label and a link label but we can also
this just by using the link the link
labeled so we can type link URL dot
links dot and so we're adding a link to
this link URL and at index of six
because we have 0 1 2 3 4 and 5 empty
spaces count as a an index so we're
starting at the index of 6 how much
comes right out to visit so that's when
the link is going to start so business
going to look like a normal label and
then the link is going to start after
that and so what we want to do is access
list favorites dot selected items dot
item
at index of zero dot sub-items
at index of one and no wait we want to
access item at index of 0 and then dot
txt dot length so what is this going to
do is going to start it index 6 and then
the ending index is going to be the
length of our selected item so it's
going to go from this all the way to the
end of that item and now for the next
argument it's going to be the link data
as object so it adds a link to the
collection with information to associate
with the length link so what we can do
to actually add the length it the link
itself is will type list favorites
selected item or items dot item at index
of 0 and then we want to access the sub
item of that so sub items 1 dot txt so
what this is going to do is it's going
to get the item that is the text of the
sub items the first sub item so here we
have the the main item right here and
then we've got sub item URL which is the
first one now if we had another sub item
it would be too so it's going to take
the text from that and it's going to use
that as the length i mean the link and
so you see that the text right here is
the link itself so when you use the text
from this you're going to get a valid
link and you can see it says visit the
new boston
but when we click on it nothing happens
and you can see here that this looks
like a normal label and then we've got
our link so what we want to do to make
it open up our link once we click on it
we're going to have to click on this the
link URL or link label one and we need
to access the click event or the link
clicked so whenever they click on the
link what do we want to do well we want
to type process it says provides access
to local and remote processes and
enables you to start and stop local
system processes so we want to start a
process and we want to start the web
browser now this is going to vary
depending on what your default web
browser is so it's going to start your
default browsers so we're going to use e
which is the arguments and it's a link
link labeled clicked event args so we're
going to access the link in that so II
dot link dot link data and it gets or
sets the data associated with the link
so it's going to open the data that is
in that link so if we go ahead and run
this running out of time here we can
click on the New Boston and when we
visit the New Boston it opens up my
chrome browser right here and it brings
us to the New Boston website</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
