your fourth my SQL tutorial and now that
we have some data to play with let's go
ahead and play with it so open up
phpMyAdmin by of course clicking the
link and once you do your PHP my admin
tool should open up now let's go ahead
and serve some really simple commands
now in order to type in these commands
you always go up to this SQL tab now
whenever you click it you have this text
box that opens up and this is where
you're going to be writing your commands
so let's start with something very
simple type in show databases and once
your command is complete just go ahead
and click go and check it out whenever
you hit go it says your SQL query has
been executed successfully if you have
any errors in your queries then this is
going to be read and it's going to say
you know there's air on line two or
something
but anyways what this query does
whenever we see show databases it
basically lists all of the databases in
your servers so right now we have
information Shaima or schema
however the heck you say that was
already built into MySQL we didn't make
that one and we also have Danielle
underscore YouTube so if you're just
running this for the first time and you
want to see what databases your work or
school has go ahead and run that command
so basically like I said that is how you
run a simple command and another thing I
want to take note of is that sq oh the
language is typed standard in all
capital letters now the only thing
that's not going to be in capital
letters is table names and column names
those are going to be in lowercase but
all of the language itself for example
like the keywords those are going to be
typed in all capital letters by standard
now if you already are in a database for
example R if you already enter in the
database Danielle YouTube and when I say
in the database in order to get in a
database then I mean like if you have
the database selected already then let's
go ahead and run some simple commands
from here so let's go ahead and select
our Danielle
SCOR youtube and hop over to this SQL
tab now now that we have this database
selected let's see what tables we have
in this database so I'm going to go
ahead and run the command show tables
and I'm going to go ahead and hit go and
see what tables we have in here well
right now we only have the customers
tables so that is basically what the
command does whenever you hit show
tables it basically returns a list of
tables for the currently selected
database which was in this case danielle
underscore youtube so what if we want to
I don't know see all the column names
for a specific table
well of course go up to this SQL and
again make sure we're going to be
working in danielle underscore youtube
for the rest of these tutorials so
basically I want to say I want to see
all of the column names from the table
customers because remember customers if
we click on it we can see that it has ID
name address city state and zip but we
want to do it through SQL because that's
what we're learning so go ahead in your
SQL tab and in order to do that hit show
columns I always spell columns wrong
from and remember like I said the
language SQ o is all in caps but your
table names are in lowercase so
customers so show comes from customers
whenever you run this command what it's
going to do is it's going to return the
names of the columns for example ID name
address city state zip basically those
categories as well as some other
information and we'll cover this other
other information later on this is the
type of data and like I said I'm going
to be covering this later on but one key
thing I want to point out is this PRI
that stands for primary key now remember
in the first tutorial I told you guys
about primary key was pretty much the
one thing in your table that you can't
have repeated so if you look it says the
ID was the primary key and that's why
all of these numbers are unique by
anyways let's go ahead and learn a few
more commands so as you can see already
probably that
Eskew oh it isn't you know a weird
computer program language that you're
going to need an interpreter for it's
made up of these keywords that are
pretty much written in plain English
very easy to understand now one of the
most common commands that we're going to
be working with is the Select command
SEL ect now with this command does is
pretty much select the information or
data that you want so let me go ahead
and hop over to this customers table
real quick you see that this customers
table has a bunch of information on it
ID numbers names addresses city states
zip so let's go ahead and select one of
these columns so of course SQL and I'm
going to go ahead and select what can I
select City from customers now I'm going
to go ahead and run this and then I'm
going to talk about it so go ahead and
hit go and as you can see from our
customers table it returns all of the
cities so anytime you ran a query you
can either look at that query right here
or if you want to see it exactly like
you typed it hit show query box and
that's going to go ahead and show your
query but for the purposes of this
tutorial or excuse me for the purposes
of this query I'm just going to go ahead
and read right from here so what the
Select statement does is it pretty much
selects what information do you want and
you type this right after select so we
want to select the city from and from is
a keyword
what table so basically we wanted to
select what information the city from
what table
customers it's our only table we have to
work with right now and there you go
there you have it the results of our
query and by the way I probably should
have mentioned this a while ago whenever
I say query
I just mean a command or instruction
that we're telling MySQL to do so that's
what query means I know I said it for
like the last five minutes I didn't
explain but it's pretty much an
instruction what we've been typing in
are all queries</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
