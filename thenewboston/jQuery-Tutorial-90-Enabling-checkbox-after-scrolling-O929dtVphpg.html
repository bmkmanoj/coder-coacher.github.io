with a video tutorial for the new Boston
in this video we are taking the example
of scroll top and we're using this to
allow us to disable a check box in this
case I have a text area here with just
some fake Latin terms and conditions in
the I've sort of seen this effect listed
on a few websites where you have to
scroll to the bottom of a text area in
order for a particular check box to be
enabled to actually agree to these terms
and conditions at the moment this check
box is disabled and I'm clicking on it
at the moment and I can't actually check
it so essentially what I have to do is
scroll all the way to the bottom for
this check box to become enabled then I
can say you know continue with
registration or however this works in
this case this is obviously just an
example so what I'm going to do is go
ahead and scroll all the way to the
bottom and you'll see that when I do
reach the bottom this check box now
becomes available and I can go ahead and
click on it now we're going to be using
the scroll top function in jQuery to do
this but we're going to need to you know
make some additional calculations
because it's not as easy as it appears
because we've styled this particular a
text area a certain height we can't just
return the height a new scroll top to
actually calculate this we're going to
need to do some additional calculation
so we'll go back to our text editor or
go over to our text editor and start
writing this out okay so we're over 12
text editor we are in index dot PHP
which just literally has this text area
here
with the text inside and then underneath
we've got a check box with the ID of
agree the textarea ID is terms so we can
use these two both reference each one
and yeah that's it really we've just got
a check box we've also got an ext J's
file it's just it is essentially an
external javascript file we've also
included style dot CSS to style this
text
area let's just take a look at Starks
CSS all I've done is giving it height
here and a width here so that just makes
it look like you you saw when I showed
you the example and obviously yeah like
I said we have expects TDOT J s which is
our external javascript file so inside
our external javascript file
we want to go ahead and initially
disable the check the text the checkbox
sorry first of all if we go over to our
browser you can see that at the moment
it's enabled by default and nothing's
really happening here in terms of
functionality so the first thing we want
to go ahead and do is actually disable
this I'm gonna do this after the
document is ready so I'm going to use
document dot ready and inside create the
function of the code that I'm going to
run once the dom is available so the
first thing we want to do is set an
attribute to this agree agree checkbox
to disable it so what we do is we say
reference this with hash and agree so
we're using a ID selector and we just
want to set an attribute of this and
that attribute is disabled and the value
of that is disabled so when we go return
to our browser and refresh this check
box has been automatically disabled and
we can't do anything and obviously still
we don't have any functionality here
okay so now what we want to go ahead and
do is create an event handler for when
this text area has a scroll event ie
when we pull the scrollbar down or back
up again so when we do scroll we want to
then you know make some calculations get
some heights and everything and then
obviously perform an if statement to
remove the attribute disabled if it's at
the correct height so let's go ahead and
select terms which is our text area
obviously over here our idea of terms
and we want to go ahead and append the
scroll event handler to this now inside
here we create a another function
and all the code inside of here will be
that that is run when we actually
perform a scroll so when we scroll up or
down so let's go ahead and create some
variables and set some values to this
then then like I'll explain about a bit
about how it works so the first one is
the text area height and this is equal
to the obviously our terms or we could
just say this because we've already
selected the terms here so this will be
this and then afterwards array key 0 and
then dot scroll
height now let's go ahead and alert this
to the user in fact no that's probably
not a good idea let's go ahead and
create a temporary div just down here
just so we can get some information fed
back to us so I'm just going to call
this I did feedback so we want to say
selecting feedback apply the text to
this as text area underscore height so
we'll be constantly feeding back this
value so when we scroll down you can see
that it is just literally given us a
height which is 7 to 4 now this
obviously doesn't match the value that
we have in style dot CSS but this is the
height of the entire inside so the
scrollable area essentially but this it
still is inaccurate because we need to
go ahead and remove or minus the inner
height and that essentially means that
it will match up to the correct value</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
