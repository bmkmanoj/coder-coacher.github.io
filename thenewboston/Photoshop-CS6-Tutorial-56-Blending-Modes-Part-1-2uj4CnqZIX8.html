Blackford here with another Photoshop
cs6 tutorial and in this tutorial we're
gonna start talking about blending modes
and there's a bunch of blending modes
that might take a little while to get
through but pretty much what blending
modes do is blend in two different
layers together using the set methods
that they already have allotted here in
Photoshop so what I have right now is
just a picture of my friend Alex and
then I created a gradient layer here
over top which has black then white then
green and then pink and I wanted to show
you how these different kind of colors
interacted with the picture through
blending modes so you can find your
blending modes right above the layers
panel right in the layers panel I mean
right above your locks so if you click
on this right here it'll bring down the
different blending modes now the
blending modes have groups that they're
split into and I'll just go over the
groups so at the top here is just the
normal blending modes they don't really
do too much then the group we have below
is the darkening blending modes which
darken the colors that we have then
below that is the Layton blending modes
and those obviously do the opposite and
lighten the image we've got our contrast
blend mode group right here and that's
pretty much had they have like a bunch
of different ways that they interact the
these ones different they interact
differently with the layer below it and
you'll pretty much just have to see it
to see what's going on it's kind of
harder to explain
below down here we've got the inversion
and cancellation blending modes and
we'll have to go over those and then
down here is the component blending
modes and these kind of do a lot with
black and white in
Tinh and stuff like that so let's get
going on and show you what's going on so
normal is the default blending mode and
pretty much nothing goes on when you
have normal it's just one thing on top
of another
the next blending mode that we've got
going on is dissolve and I'm applying
the blending loads to the above layer
because that's how blending modes work
they affect the layer below so I'm gonna
change this to dissolve and I pretty
much never use dissolve I don't think
I've ever used dissolve once in my life
in Photoshop or in any other Adobe
program so dissolve this blending mode
acts on transparency and partially
transparent pixels and it treats them as
like a pattern so when I lower the
opacity here you're gonna see how it
kind of like does like some dissolving
and that's what dissolve does in this
there might be a use for it but I
haven't found it yet and that's at some
point I'll figure it out and let you
know what that uses but you don't have
to worry about that one too much because
you won't really use it so let's go to
the next group here which is the
darkening group so I click on here and
go to darken or I can roll my middle
mouse button to switch between these so
what I wanted to show you is that darken
multiplies the layers together in a way
that combines both of the images pixel
colors and it just basically like
multiplies them together
whichever pixels are darker in in both
of the layers are the ones that are
going to show up so if you look in this
area here remember that our image here
if I make it just that image if I solo
it we've got our black here on the left
and our white here right here so white
is the lightest so that should not show
up at all and the black should pretty
much show up all of it so let's go back
and see if that happens
does and the green seems to be darker
than some of the colors in this image so
that shows up as well as the pink but as
you can see the white part that was on
our gradient is gone now so that's how
darken works the next one is multiply
and multiply you'll be using a lot
within Photoshop and it's the best
darkening mode that there is so what's
multiplied is the luminance levels of
the layers pixels and it multiplies the
layer with the the layer that's above
with the layer that's below so it's
great for creating shadows and removing
whites and things like that from your
top layer so just remember that the
multiply is the best darkening so if you
don't think that your multiply is dark
enough we can come to the next one color
burn and you can see that that is a
little more darker and this always
reminds me of a little bit of a vintage
look when I use color burn so that's the
kind of stuff that I like to use it for
and this is just basically darker than
multiply so pretty much the same thing
but darker and it highly saturates
mid-tones and reduces highlights so
let's go to the linear burn here so the
linear burn is a darker than multiply
but it is less saturated than the
regular color burn as you can see here
the colors are more pronounced and lot
not as saturated let's go down to the
next one of the darkened group which is
called darker color and it's not my bed
it's not one of the best ones to use
but darker color is a similar to darken
it might not look like it like it right
now but it is it darkens the
the composite channel instead of the
separate RGB color channels so the one
that's all together it darkens that and
if you can find a good use for it and
you're going through your blending modes
and this one looks good
feel free to use it but obviously it
doesn't look good in this image with
these two layers so I wouldn't be using
it so I'm gonna stop here for now we
went over the different groups and we
got through the darker the darkening
blending modes and then the next
tutorial will go over the different
lighting technique modes and if we have
time we'll go through some of the other
ones too so thanks for watching this one
and if you want to keep on watching
tutorials about the blending modes in
Photoshop I suggest you watch the next
upcoming tutorial which is blending
modes part two so see you guys in that
one have a good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
