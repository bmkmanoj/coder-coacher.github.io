mitosis now what happens here is we
already know that the spindles are
attached to the chromosomes so what's
going to happen is that those spindles
are actually going to head to opposite
ends or poles of the cell so as this
happens go ahead and draw a spindle on
this side of the cell and one goes on
the completely opposite side and we
already know like I said that these arms
are attached to the chromosomes so let
me go ahead and draw some arms draw the
chromosomes later and these arms are
going to be attached to these ones down
here pretty cool looking spindles if you
ask me
and as these spindles head to opposite
ends or poles of the cell what happens
is it causes the chromosomes to line up
in the middle or the equator of the cell
so let me go ahead and draw my
chromosomes and I think I'm going to
draw these in you know separate colors
I'll draw blue and you're a blue one
over here and I'll draw a red one in the
middle so as you can see sense and
actually let me pick one more color
since this spindle right here is pulling
on them this way and this spindle down
below is pulling on them this way what
happens is that since the spindles are
on opposite ends or poles of the cell it
causes the chromosomes to line up in the
exact middle or equator of the cell so
that's basically what metaphase is the
spindles has the opposite ends or poles
of the cell and they tug on the
chromosomes and whenever they're tugging
on them it causes them to line up in the
middle or equator of the cell that's all
metaphase is so now we can go ahead and
move on to the next phase which is
anaphase and a phase so during anaphase
let me go ahead and draw my cell again
here's my cell right here and we already
know that the spindles are on opposite
ends so here's a spindle here's a
spindle and we already know that they
were pulling on the chromosomes
but now that they pulled on them they
actually pulled them so hard that it
caused them to separate
so whenever and I think I had a blue one
on the left and a blue one on the right
and I think I had a red one in the
middle if I'm not mistaken so what
happened is those spindles pulled on
those chromosomes so hard that they
separated into two sister chromatid now
I remember that I said that these
chromatid right here and right here are
100% identical to each other and what
happens is they split apart and they go
to opposite sides of the cell now what's
going to happen eventually is that this
cell is going to split in half and
whenever the splits in half each new
cell well have one copy of each DNA
molecule and you know I don't want to
jump ahead of that but that's basically
when what's going to happen after the
cell divides so basically we're going to
have two new cells one on this side and
one on this side and each new cell is
going to have DNA identical to the other
cell or the original cell so you know
we're getting ahead of ourselves but
that's what anaphase is basically when
the chromosomes separate so that two
sister chromatid identical to each other
this one and this one are identical to
each other are on each side opposite
sides of the cell so the next phase is
called telophase te LFA's so telophase
is kind of cool because actually let me
go ahead and draw this is actually the
funnest diagram to draw kind of looks
like a wavy figure eight kind of looking
thing basically what happens is the cell
gets ready to divide by forming two new
nuclear membranes around the chromosomes
so we'll draw the chromosomes you know
we have a blue one right here and we
have cold blue ones right here and I
think we have a red one right like that
and I forgot what a color I drew my
nuclear membrane let's go ahead and draw
it blue so basically what happens in
telophase is the cell is going to form
two new nuclear membranes around the
chromosomes so one here
and one here another thing that happens
is these chromosomes are going to uncoil
or d condense basically what happens in
the DNA during interphase it's going to
happen in telophase so these are going
to look like this they're going to
Deacon dense D condensed and I guess we
have some red ones in there too and then
it's going to start to spread out into
the you know original DNA form and the
last thing that happens is the mitotic
spindles they're done doing your job the
job of a mitotic spindle is to pull
apart the chromosomes so now that they
did that we no longer need them anymore
so those are going to break down or
dissolve so here we have it and I guess
I'll draw with little arms I guess you
know that's the symbol of breaking down
and dissolving so eventually these
mitotic spindles are going to disappear
so let me just go ahead and draw this
little separator line right here and
that's what telophase is again one last
time telophase is a last stage of
mitosis now you're saying okay wait a
minute but I'm looking at your diagram
right now in this cell isn't broken
apart yet well the section of cell
division whenever it breaks apart is
called cytokinesis technically mitosis
is just the splitting of the nucleus in
the DNA and that's what people get
confused about because remember
interphase is when the cells going about
its daily business in cytokinesis is
when it actually splits apart into two
cells but these are not stages of
mitosis itself mitosis only has remember
four stages prophase metaphase anaphase
and telophase
so to recap one last time telophase is
when the cell gets ready to divide it
has divided yet but it's getting ready
to divide and it does this by forming
two new nuclear membranes around the
chromosomes another thing it does is the
chromosomes inside the nucleus are going
to deccan dense or spread out around the
nucleus and the last thing that happens
is these mitotic spindles we have no use
for them anymore they're going to
dissolve disappear and they're going to
form again whenever you know the cell
cycle repeats itself and we need them
again so that's what telophase is and in
the next story we're going to be talking
about cytokinesis which is the last part
of cell division where the cell right
here is actually going to split apart so
think guys for watching I'm going to
subscribe and I'll see you guys then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
