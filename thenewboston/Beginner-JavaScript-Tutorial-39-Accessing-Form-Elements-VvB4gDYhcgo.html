to your 39th JavaScript sorrow and in
the last tutorial I tell you guys how to
access and differentiate between
different forms on your web page but now
in this tutorial since we already have
access to each form I'm going to show
you how to access each element in those
forms so let's go ahead and create a
form but I didn't want to keep the old
one from last time because I want to
make it a little bit different so as we
know from our XHTML tutorials hopefully
you watch shows each form can have a
property called name and I'm just going
to set this form equal to Bucky's form
simple enough so now if we go ahead and
end it we can begin adding our elements
so let's just like before add a username
a password and submit bun so the
username all we need to do is just like
last time we'll just make an input box
so input type equals text and let's go
ahead and add a name to this too so name
equals user's name simple enough so now
if you just go ahead and and we won't
copy it so for the password box it would
be input type equals might as well make
a password I think I made it text in the
last tutorial but that's definitely not
secure so the name equals on password so
well know so let me just go ahead and
test this right now
hello didn't want to look I got Yahoo
son of a beach launching Chrome there we
go so now we've got a password box in
the text box working perfectly so I
might as well add a submit button I mean
why not um input type equals submit
value equals submit now let's go ahead
and save it and refresh again and check
it out we got a perfectly working form a
username secret password and the submit
button that does nothing at all pretty
cool huh so like I said in order to
access our form itself let's say we want
to set equal to variable good first rate
document since the forms array is an
object of the document so then we will
write forms and since this is our first
form on our web page we would go ahead
and identify it by zero since everything
in arrays start at zero so after that I
told you guys that there is a way to
access each element so for example if we
want to access the first element right
here the forms array has a property
already built in and that's the elements
array so elements 0 would give you
access to the first element in your form
elements 1 will give you access to this
and elements 2 would give you access to
this you're saying all right why do I
even want access to it and what's the
use of it what am I going to do with it
well typically people want access to
let's say they wanted to verify that the
user name only consisted of letters and
numbers so when a user logs in your web
page you don't want them to enter lucky
dollar sign percentage sign at sign
semicolon semicolon you want like Bucky
65 Bucky 1492 so this is why you would
want access to each element so for now
since we're not validating any data all
we're going to do with this element is
is get a property of it and that's the
name and again your form has a name
called Bucky's form and each element has
a name this one is username this one is
password this one we didn't give a name
so now the name of username since this
is the first element in form zero is
going to be equal to the value username
x equals username so now we just go
ahead and document write this and if we
print out X on the screen and save it
and launch in Chrome check it out it
says username right there
so one more quick example if we go ahead
and access the second one by typing form
zero since it's the first form second
element and go ahead and save this and
then we go ahead and launch this in
Chrome it says password right there
pretty cool huh
so I'm saying all right simple enough
whenever I want to access a form I just
write form whatever number it is and
then whenever I want to access an
element I write element whatever number
it is in the right
but all these arrays are getting pretty
confusing Bucky is there something
easier that I can do yes there is
instead of worrying about arrays you
have a different option of accessing
your forms and also your elements
instead of using the forms array you can
just go ahead and use the name of the
form itself and this I think I can I'll
cough so anyways let's just go ahead and
copy the name of the form which is
Bucky's form instead of form zero we're
just going to go ahead and put Bucky's
form and it just like that
so just to verify that it's working so
far let's go ahead and run launching
Chrome and check it out we still get
password pretty cool so now we know that
we can use the form name instead of
using that dumb forms write a whole lot
more simple or a whole lot simpler what
is it I don't know I'll let you decide
so now what we can do is we can treat
elements the same rate the same array oh
I crack myself up
the same way if element has a name we no
longer have to use that dumb old
elements array we can just
go ahead and use the name of it which is
users name in this case so let's go
ahead and paste this in and of course if
we're writing code where we wanted to
print out the name of an element I mean
the names right here so it's going to
print out user name kind of redundant
but anyways this is just an example so
let's go ahead and launch this in chrome
and we see in fact we can access that
element using the name instead of the
array so anyways probably printing out
the name wasn't the best example but hey
I did it anyway so what I want to stress
you guys in this story is in order to
access each individual element in the
forms array we can either use the
element array simple enough element and
then the name of whatever element you
want to use or excuse me the number of
whatever element you want to use or if
it has a name we can use that as well
for example we use bucky's form right
there and username right there and it
worked fine so with those two things we
now have knowledge of how to access any
item in our forms any item in any form
on our web page
pretty cool huh so now that we have
access to them we can be then begin
doing things like validating the data
make sure they're filling checking
whether or not a checkbox is checked
checking whether a radio box is checked
you know simple stuff like that so
that's what I'm probably going to be
covering in the next tutorial but for
now that's all I have for you guys so
thank you guys for watching don't forget
to subscribe and I'll see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
