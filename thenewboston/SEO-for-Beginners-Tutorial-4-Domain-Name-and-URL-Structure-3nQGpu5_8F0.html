this video we're finally going to get
started using keywords remember a
keyword whenever I use that term it's
basically whatever a user searches for
so programming videos it could be
multiple words it could just be one word
it's basically their search query now I
say this because what Google does is
whenever someone types in a search query
what's going to happen is it's going to
go through its database and it's
eventually going to get to your website
and it's going to look at all the data
it has for your website and it's going
to say okay was this term programming
videos used a lot on their website if
the word programming videos is right
here and right here and I'm just using
it all over the place and it's going to
say you know what the New Boston com is
probably related to programming videos
so that is what is going to appear in
the search results right here so we know
that in order to get one of your
webpages to appear in the search results
then you need to use these keywords on
your website now the next question is
where do you stick them do you stick
them in your navigation menu the headers
the text or maybe the title right here
where do they go well let's start out
pretending that you created a website
for like you don't even have it created
yet now I know a lot of you guys are
probably watching these videos wanting
to improve your rankings within existing
website but for right now let's just say
that you have to buy a domain name stone
so let's say you're making a website in
whenever someone types in monkey videos
you want this website that you're making
to appear is the number one search
result so this is what I would recommend
let me go to this so whenever you buy
your domain name it's always a good idea
to include these keywords right in the
domain name so for example o let's say
monkey videos com whenever someone typed
in monkey videos this would have an
incredible advantage over you know funny
and more videos comm so if you had two
websites which were identical one named
monkey videos calm in one name funny
animal videos calm
whenever someone typed in monkey videos
monkey videos calm would appear first so
again like I said I know a lot of you
guys already have a domain name so you
can't really change it and it really
isn't that important if you have an
existing domain name but there you go
another thing I want to point out is URL
structure so if you do have an existing
website or domain name then one thing
that you can do is include those
keywords in your URL now I'll show you
guys an example of my website right here
so this is pretty much a bad example so
in order to view my profile you have to
go to this link profile dot PHP user
equals two now Google is going to look
at this and say user equals two probably
like ten million people on the internet
have user equals two so whenever someone
types in Bucky Roberts it's going to
have a difficult time knowing that this
link right here is related to my profile
so a better URL that you could actually
use is instead of profile whatever with
the ID number if you are Bucky Roberts
or something like this then this is
going to help out Google a lot because
it's going to look at this and if
someone types in Bucky Roberts profile
it's going to say oh you know what his
name is right in the stinkin URL this
definitely is related to this page so
again whenever I was developing my
website a long time ago I didn't really
think about this stuff I just want to
make sure it worked but if you are ever
making a social network or any website
really make sure to include the keywords
keywords will in the URL and you can
actually probably see let's say like a
by uh what other by panther chameleon
alright so whenever you look at search
results you see that we typed in by
panther chameleon on even though that is
a type of chameleon here some of them
you can see that it actually highlights
the keywords whenever they appear in the
URL so this is pretty much google
telling you hey the reason that we're
showing you this result is first of all
we found the search term on their web
page right here and also those keywords
were in the URL so we know that this is
a ranking factor because you know even
though we don't know Google's formula
it's pretty much a slapping in our face
saying dude we're like bolding the words
that are important right here so hey
this is how it works so there you go and
another thing I want to point out is
this let me refresh this page all right
so it's not only the keywords that
appear but also the closer they are to
your home directory
so this is my home directory right here
without anything after it now let's say
that I wanted to make a profile page for
all my users well a good idea would be
to make a URL like this right after
Bucky Roberts a little worse idea would
to be something like this user profile
page
Bucky Roberts and the reason that this
isn't a great idea is because this is
for directories deep now the further
away you get from your home directory it
pretty much means that this is less
important of course we know this because
the home page is the most important page
on your website anything you can click
from this is the second most important
anything you go deeper and deeper into
is less and less important and actually
it works the same for your computer I
mean on your desktop which is pretty
much the homepage for your computer you
have all these files now if someone were
just to go delete all the files and your
desktop alt suck those are your most
important ones however once you start
going into here in being ok so these are
kind of important I guess what about
something like Ava al production I don't
even know what's in here guys all of
these files that are like 5 directories
deep these obviously aren't important
people can probably delete this and I
wouldn't even know for like 10 years
so there you go
the importance of using keywords in your
URL that's kind of hard to say keywords
in your URL in your URL dunt dunt
alright anyways what did we learn well
we learned that if you can buy a domain
name if you're just setting up a website
for the very first time then it's a
really good idea to include these
keywords in your domain name now another
thing is if you can't then try to
include them in your URL structure such
as Bucky Roberts instead of someone's ID
number and another thing is make sure
that those keywords appear in your your
URL closer to the parent directory the
closer the better
so there you go thing guys for watching
still got a lot of stuff to cover but
for now that's all so see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
