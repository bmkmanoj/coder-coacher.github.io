android tutorial for the new boss in
again with me travis and we're gonna do
in this tutorial we're gonna set up a
new class called GFX surface and I'll
explain what that is in a second here
just get that set up and also do extends
activity and then import and add your
oncreate method now as I'm doing this
hopefully you guys know how to do this
as of now just going to be kind of
talking and not really following the
mouse cursor but basically before we
extended the view class and you aren't
going to want to do that we're actually
going to want to extend the surface view
class even though it's a little bit more
complicated it's kind of harder to
follow along with the surface view but
that's what we're gonna want to do
because when we extend the view class
like we did with our GFX right here it's
using so much processing speed and
slowing down our application because
it's that thread is handling both the
graphics and the user interface that's
just a really tedious thing for it to do
so what we actually want to do is extend
the surface class or the surface view
I'm sorry instead of just the view I'll
show you how to do that we're gonna kind
of set up the sit pretty much the same
way as before except this time we're
going to say surface right here so you
guys can kind of look back and be like
okay I kind of what we did there and
then I can't forgot what what do we call
this variable our view okay so we'll
just say our surface view here and again
we have to create this class if you just
hover over you can say create my bring
that class right here and or what we can
do all nevermind we're just gonna stick
with kind of same familiar familiar way
there and again what we're gonna do here
is say our surface view equals new
surface view I'm sorry oops our surface
for u equals new my bring back I need to
come up with shorter variables what am I
doing here
surface
and past and again context of this
pretty much same concept that with what
we've done earlier and again what we can
do is say create constructor it might
bring back that passes in you know this
context or this class so we can just hit
create constructor right here and that's
going to affect this other class which
is my bring back surface and there we go
now what we want to do in this my bring
back surface class is oh yeah the other
thing we need to do is set the content
view of this but you guys probably knew
that yeah we're gonna say our surface
view and again I'm sorry I'm in the GFX
surface class so just get that set up
and we're good to go
for now and now for what this uh might
bring back surface class what we want to
do is again instead of extending this
the view class we're gonna say extends
surface view now basically this is just
gonna handle the surface of a view
instead of the view class in its
entirety because you know it's a little
bit more basic and all that good stuff
we're gonna import that and then we're
also going to implement runnable and
I'll kind of explain the framework of
how this works and what we're doing here
but basically we're gonna need a thread
of some sort and again threads take
runnable x' and again anytime we
implement something we have to add it
that's why we're getting this problem
here so we're gonna we're gonna add
unimplemented methods kind of get
everything set up and also I just
noticed that it's passing in very very
classroom from that our GFX surface
class so we're going to delete that and
set and say context and then context
like this because again we want to pass
in a context import that and we should
be pretty much good to go with with our
little activity here now basically when
we use a surface view
like I said it's gonna be a little bit
different then when we used when we use
our actual view class it's gonna be a
little bit more complex but that's fine
I trust that you guys will be able to
catch on</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
