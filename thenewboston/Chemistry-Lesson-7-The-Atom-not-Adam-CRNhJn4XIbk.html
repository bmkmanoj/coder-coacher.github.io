welcome to your seventh chemistry
tutorial and in this tutorial I'm going
to be talking about the atom and I'm not
talking about your dumb for an atom I'm
talking about this little thing you're
right here
you know those balls I was talking about
earlier not those balls come on guys
focus those balls that I said everything
in the universe all of the matter is
made out of these tiny little things
called atoms well that's what this thing
is right over here
now if you're taking a chemistry class
in high school or college you have to
define atom exist the smallest part of
matter that represents a particular
element that's a scientific term but I'm
just going to call them tiny balls that
everything in the universe is made up of
so for awhile for a long time in history
people used to think that these were the
smallest possible things that could ever
exist and if you're wondering how small
a atom is think of this picture a hair
like a hair from your head or your arm
or you know wherever you want to get it
and think how thin a piece of hair is
the width of a hair is like almost
invisible really in how big is atom
compared to that width of a hair you can
fit 1 million atoms roughly depending on
how thick your hair is through the width
of the hair so if you took a hair and
sliced it up a million times that would
be about how wide anatomist pretty crazy
if you think about it huh so anyways
that's why people thought for a while
the atoms were the smallest possible
thing that could ever exist but then
scientists got all these fancy
instruments and did all these fancy
tests and they figured hey there's
actually stuff that makes up an atom you
can split this atom into three smaller
things and technically an atom is made
up of more than three things but for the
scope of beginner chemistry we're going
to be talking about the three main
ingredients and I just needed to say
that or else people would yell at me but
oh what about quarks and positrons and
all that stuff but we'll worry about
that later
so anyways what's in an atom 3 things
protons neutrons and electrons sounds
fancy enough let's go ahead and learn
about those so protons are the first
ingredient there's something that's very
dense and by dense I mean they're pretty
much very heavy and they have a positive
charge and just remember opposites
attract in chemistry that's one rule you
have to remember opposites attract
positive is attracted to negative so
positive czar pop my G I can't talk
protons are very heavy and dense and
they have a positive charge neutrons are
another ingredient they are heavy
just like protons however they don't
have any charge at all so if you could
look at a proton and neutron they'll
probably look the same the only
differences a proton has a positive
charge
now electrons have a negative charge and
they're also a lot smaller and lighter
than protons or neutrons how small exact
it takes 2000 electrons to equal the
mass of a proton so pretty much protons
and neutrons are huge in both dense
protons have a positive charge electrons
are very small and light and they have a
negative charge so electrons are
attracted to protons and neutrons are
just kind of chillin they're hanging out
so saying okay so is this like all
jumbled up like in a big stew or how
this put together well first let's go
ahead and talk about the nucleus the
nucleus is the center of an atom and
this is really a bad diagram because the
new he'll this really isn't this big but
for the sake of this tutorial just
imagine that this red thing right here
is the nucleus it's the center so in the
center or the nucleus the protons and
the neutrons are chillin together and
again the center of the atom is what we
call the nucleus don't get neutrons in
nucleus mixed up neutrons and protons
are in the nucleus don't forget it or
else I'll punch you in the head dropkick
you so the nucleus is actually very very
small and very dense compared to the
entire atom so that's why I said that
this diagram is really way off and it
were saying okay so is it like half the
size of this diagram or what
let me go ahead and give you an image if
an atom this entire atom right here was
the size of a football stadium the
nucleus would be the size of it would be
like a raisin or grape on the 50-yard
line in the middle of it so that is how
small the nucleus is compared to the
entire atom so just imagine that and
that is why again that this diagram is
way off so even though it's really
really incredibly small
it contains 99 even more than 99% of the
mass so it's really small but it's super
dense and super heavy and I know I
didn't talk to you guys about density
and if you don't know what that means by
dense it means how much stuff is in
something so for example you can have a
marshmallow well nevermind we'll talk
about density later and I'm hungry for
marshmallows now but anyways we'll talk
about all that good stuff later
so just remember for now in the nucleus
the protons and neutrons are in the
middle and very dense and electrons are
whizzing around outside but we'll talk
about the electrons in the next tutorial
so the last thing I want to cover is
this whenever you look at a list of
different kinds of atoms stuck together
and this list is going to be called the
periodic table which we're going to
learn about later but you're going to
see something like this the first thing
you're going to notice is the atomic
number
now the atomic number is the number of
protons in an atom like for example
hydrogen has 1 proton helium has two
protons it's pretty much how you define
different elements determing on the
number of protons so determining on how
many protons element has that's what
gives it its name so you're going to see
its name in this one is plutonium that's
what pu is the atomic number is the
number of protons and the mass number is
the number of protons plus neutrons so
we're saying okay where is just the
number of neutrons well they aren't
going to do all the math for you so if
you ever want to figure out how many new
Trane's are in plutonium you just take
244 which is the number of protons and
neutrons pretty much everything in the
nucleus minus the number of protons or
atomic number and you get 150 neutrons
in plutonium in this instance so again
they aren't going to do all the math for
you but you know if you want to figure
it out you can so again one last time
this thing right here is plutonium and
in plutonium there are 94 protons and
that's the atomic number it changes with
each element and the mass number is the
number of protons and number of neutrons
pretty much how much stuff is in the
nucleus of the atom
so hopefully you now understand the atom
and you have a better understanding of
the universe and what we're made up of
so now that we solve that mystery we can
begin to go on and learn other things so
anyways thank you guys for watching and
I will see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
