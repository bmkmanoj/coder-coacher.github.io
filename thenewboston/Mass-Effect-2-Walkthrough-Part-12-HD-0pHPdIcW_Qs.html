looks like they can actually fight they
tell you what we're up against just tell
us where to go archangels holed up in a
building at the end of the boulevard
over there he's got superior position
and the only way in is over a fairy
exposed bridge it's a killing ground but
he's getting tired making mistakes will
have him soon enough I'll get to him
just point me at that bridge I like your
attitude but we've got a plan in place
you'll be on a distraction team head
straight over the bridge and keep
Archangel busy so the infiltration team
can sneak in behind him that's like a
suicide mission to me pretty much but
you look like you can handle it head up
to the boulevard and get to the third
barricade talk to sergeant katka he'll
tell you when to go in a medical and
Sachin cathian good idea watch yourself
from a Boulevard archangels killed
dozens out there already well we might
have a way in but getting out could be
interesting let's worry about finding
him first
Shepherd I've scanned the area but i'm
unable to plot any other paths to
Archangel guess we're going with the
Mercs heavy mex and gunship possessed
considerable firepower we getting them
before leaving will improve our chances
and what's this
Kafka
sergeant katka you must be the group
salty mentioned you're just in time
where are you waiting for us the
infiltration team is about to give us a
signal Archangel who know what hit him
got any questions may be the last chance
are you leading the assault huh tarik
doesn't pay me to fight I just plan the
attacks and fix the damn gunship you
freelancers get the privileges Chuck
travel team
archangels got quite a surprise waiting
for him but that means no more late for
me got to get her back to a hundred
percent before tarik decides he needs
her against
you're working too hard does look like
archangels got much time well let's not
wait around too long come on we'll give
these guys a surprise of our own let's
go
Oh
they should come in handy
archangel</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
