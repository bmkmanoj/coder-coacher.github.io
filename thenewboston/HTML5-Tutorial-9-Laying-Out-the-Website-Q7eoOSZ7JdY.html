ninth html5 tutorial in this tutorial
what I'm going to be doing is we're
going to be laying out this template
that we pretty much made in the
tutorials 1 through 4 I think it is so
we're pretty much going to lay it out
style it and I'm going to show you guys
how to lay it out perfectly using an old
traditional box model in CSS because I
get so many messages and emails asking
me how to layout a website and it's even
kind of difficult to Center a website
properly so I'm going to be showing you
the old style and then I'm going to show
you how it differs from the new style
and you guys can probably use bits and
pieces from both to layout your websites
like a pro so both of these techniques
are awesome I don't want to say that one
is better than the other you can
definitely use things from both but once
you watch probably these next five or
six tutorials you guys are going to be
able to layout websites like a champ so
the last thing I want to mention is yes
we are going to be going over you know
the canvas and geolocation and all that
good stuff but I want to cover the core
basic fundamentals first before he's
jumping in that really advanced stuff
and also I'm going to be moving to New
York this weekend so if you're watching
these tutorials as I upload them I just
want to let you guys know that I'm
shutting off my internet tomorrow and it
won't be on for like a week or so while
I you know transition make the move so
anyways enough talking let's go ahead
and start laying this stuff out so the
very first thing we need to do is we
need to surround well I'm going to go
ahead and minimize this head we really
don't need it we need to surround
everything in a huge div tag so I'm
going to be putting my div tag right
under the body and I'm just going to
give it an ID of let me see something I
can remember id equals big not bug big
underscore rapper
in okay since this is right under the
very first opening body tag I'm going to
close it right under this last one right
here and a cool thing if you go ahead
and highlight your div tag and if it
turns purple that means that it has a
matching div tag somewhere so if you're
working in a small window like this or
if you just want to go through and make
sure all your tags match you can do that
nice little tip so anyways now that that
turned purple again
basically we're surrounding our entire
main content with this big diff tag and
that's so we can Center the website
later on so don't forget that and also
don't forget the name of it now all I'm
going to do is I'm going to go through
each one of these tags these html5 tags
and give it an ID and an ID basically
lets us reference it whenever we're
working in the main CSS file later on so
I'm going to name this header top header
and I probably need that ID and actually
I think I'm going to do this just go
ahead and copy this bad boy so I don't
have to type all that over and over
all right so header is top header and
then for my nav we need ID for this now
the navigation I'm going to just call
top menu I guess since that's where all
my links are and for this section I'm
just going to call it main section
pretty creative with that one and let's
see we need to find the sides now these
side ones right here if you remember
they're pretty much the news I'm just
going to put news in them Bucky has a
dog you know not the important
information but definitely information
that we do not want to forget so I'm
just going to call this side news and
for the footer we actually need ID for
this too and this is going to be called
the footer so let me just go ahead and
make sure didn't type anything wrong
real quick and if we go ahead and save
this in refresh we can see that nothing
changes and I guess I might as well show
you guys this is our starting point
right here Blaine old plain stupid
boring website so we definitely need
this
this up a bit so now that we have an ID
on everything whenever we're making our
CSS file we can reference this stuff and
we can actually move it around how we
want to so for this tutorial I just want
to mention all that stuff at the
beginning and also make sure that you
surround all your contents with a big
div tag and give all your stuff an ID
and that's going to allow us to
reference it and also move it around in
the next tutorial so we have a lot of
CSS and styling to cover in the next
tutorial so I'm going to be saving it
for then so for now thank you guys for
watching and also if you need any of
this code again I'm going to be posting
it all on my forum so anyways thank you
guys for watching don't forget to
subscribe and I'll see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
