tutorial and in this tutorial I'll be
teaching you guys how to write a for
loop now what this kind of loop does it
allows you to run a specific code or
script however many times you specify it
too so you can either run it one time or
a hundred ich and it can do it all
automatically depending on what you told
you have a script to do so the first
thing we need before we even type what
code it is is a variable and we need
this because first we need to tell it
how many times to run so most of the
time when people use for loops they use
an integer with the value of I and they
set it equal to either 1 or 0 I'm going
to set mine equal to 0 this is just
because I and 0 is some of the most
simple and plain integers to work with
and the syntax for a for loop is just
the word for then you add your
parameters and this tells JavaScript
that we're going to be typing our for
loop in here now inside your parameters
you have to type 3 separate things
the first thing you type is what
variable you're using and what you want
to set its initial value to so we
already have this variable I equals 0 so
in the loop we're going to be using I
equals 0 that's our first value and
we're going to be setting it equal to 0
so I can start a 0 you separate elements
in your parameter with a semicolon
make sure you don't put a colon
now once you type your semicolon the
second element you add is called the
range and this is how many times or how
far you want your variables to reach so
it starts at zero and I say all right
well what do I want to end to that well
I want to end it when I our variable is
less than or equal to 10 so 10 times
pretty much now that we have that we
have two elements in our third element
is to tell JavaScript how much we want
to increment it by so since we just want
to increment it by 1
I can type I plus plus and remember plus
plus means just add 1 every time so we
have variable start a 0 and at 10 add 1
to it every time now inside your for add
the curly braces just like a function
and inside is what you type your code
that you want it to execute over and
over again well I want to tell it to do
over it and over again 10 times just go
to document write and remember all this
means is output basic on the screen it's
going to show a write on our web page
and that's why I use these body tags
because we're not going to be using an
alert box
and in the parameters I'm gonna type I
for the variable and then after that
we're gonna want to add a line break and
remember you can use HTML in your script
by enclosing it in double parenthesis so
now what this is gonna do is go through
this ten times each of those times it's
gonna output the integer now this isn't
gonna display the same every time
because we're adding 1 to it and after
that I just added a line break so it
will show up easier and you can see it
on a different line instead of just on
the same line but you guys can just see
that so let me save that and refresh it
and as you see at first started with 0 1
2 all the way to the number 10 now just
to recap why this did this first declare
a variable say what you want it to start
at we started at 0 and end it at 10 as
you can see 0 and at at 10 increment it
by 1 each time that's why only went up
by 1 each time but you can have it
increment by whatever you want to 3 or
100 and then we were eight all right now
we have our values and we know how many
times we want to do the code but what
exactly is the code that's where we type
in here the code is that we want you to
write on the screen the number and then
move on the next time
so that's how simple it is to make a for
loop there are a bunch of different
kinds of loops that I'm going to be
teaching you next time
but please support my videos and make
sure to rate this and enjoy watching and
learning this and then move on to my
next video thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
