video and in this tutorial I'm going to
be getting into some cool things that
you can do with worksheets but before I
hop right into that I want to just
briefly cover how exactly we can copy
and move ranges around or selections of
data because it's not very intuitive at
least some aspects of it so let me go
ahead and touch on that first so we
already know that you can just select Oh
pressure mention this I'm working with a
new example in the story the new
visitors to Bucky's room you can
actually work with anyone because um I
don't know the data isn't really
important we're just going to be like
copying stuff but if you want to follow
along go ahead and download the new
visitors to Bucky's room project file
for my website alright so back to the
video let's go ahead and select any
range of data for example this right
here just make sure that you have
multiple cell selected and just like any
other program we can copy it in a couple
different ways we can just right-click
it hit copy or cut we can use the
symbols right up here or we could use
the shortcuts on our keyboard of course
control X is cut ctrl C is copy and ctrl
V is paste now of course look at this we
have one two three four five six seven
eight nine rows selected in one column
now whenever we paste this in Excel we
don't need the select the exact same
size that were pasting into I mean we
can and it will work fine
well we actually just need to select one
cell just like this now whenever we
paste it what's going to happen is it's
going to reference the active cell right
here it's going to say okay this is the
active cell of the copying area or if
you cut it then the cut area and
wherever you click that's where I'm
going to reference this active cell goes
to that so again that's just a nice
little tip another thing that in 1.0 is
this if you ever have a selection made
say okay I think I'm going to copy this
and you know what I actually didn't want
to copy it but now I'm stuck with this
marching ants around the selection if
you ever select something in
copy and you decide that you actually
don't want to paste anywhere then what
you can do is you can just hit control D
on your keyboard and that will deselect
your current selection so pretty cool
that's another uh you know kind of
keyboard shortcut control D to get rid
of those marching ants now another
really cool thing that I want to show
you guys is this if you ever want to
drag and drop then you actually do it by
taking your mouse in whenever you make a
selection you move it to the top left
corner and look at my crosshairs right
here or my cursor you see how it's the
typical fat plus sign well when you move
it to the top left you get these four
directional arrows so if we just click
and drag what it's going to do is you're
going to see the outline of your
selection and you can just drop it
wherever you want so that takes whatever
data you have selected and it drags it
and drops it to another area it's the
equivalent of cutting and pasting it
somewhere else but of course it's a very
cool way very I don't know like kind of
modern way of doing it so one last thing
I want to talk to you guys about in this
tutorial I know I was saying that I was
going to cover worksheets but I guess
you know I don't have time I was
rambling on about stuff earlier they're
gonna come across times that you're
going to want to copy an entire column
into another column now for this example
right here we just do real quick by
dragging down copying and pasting it
right here however a lot of the times
you're going to work with data that is a
lot longer than this I'm talking about
thousands and thousands and thousands of
rows so a quick little way that you can
take one column and copy it to another
one is this select the last empty column
in your worksheet and if you just go up
to this editing panel right here and you
select this option right here fill click
fill right now you can see what it did
right there and it actually is probably
better to explain it if you just look at
this icon what it does is it takes the
column to the left
and pretty much puts it on one column
right so this is actually a really good
icon whoever designed this good job
you know they clap i applaud to you so
why would you ever want to do this well
you actually do this a lot whenever
you're working with formulas and I'll
talk to you guys about formulas later on
but um well I guess it's kind of hard to
explain her and how if I didn't even
talk to you about formulas yet but
you're going to come across that the
need to do that so whenever you need to
that's how you do it for now thank you
guys for watching don't forget subscribe
and in the next video we're going to be
covering some cool tips and tricks about
worksheets</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
