64th you decade story and in this
tutorial I'm going to be talking to you
guys about something called volumes now
if you're kind of getting annoyed by
this menu and these buttons right here
because they're sitting there in our
interface but I never really talked
about what they were that's what I'm
going to be covering in this story let
me explain you guys verbally what
volumes are first volumes are pretty
much just areas of space that you can
set up to do different things now it's
kind of hard to explain it verbally but
once I go ahead and show you guys an
example it's going to be crystal clear
so let me go ahead and show you guys
when and why you would use a volume so
say you're making this level and you put
this trigger right here well we can
change a couple properties on the
trigger we can make it taller or we can
make the cylinder wider give it a bigger
radius but it's always going to be a
cylinder so what if you want to make
custom shape so the years you didn't go
around it or you know you just want it a
shape different than a cylinder because
of a better fit your level well this
trigger just isn't going to work so go
ahead and delete your trigger and what
this is saying is all right Bucky you're
deleting it in the view but it's still
going to be in your kismet so let me go
ahead and continue and open up kismet
and delete it in there just to make it
happy so what we're going to be doing is
basically adding a customized trigger
shape called a volume so go ahead and
select your builder brush and if you go
ahead and right-click it give it 5 12 x
32 x 256 tall's good enough and then i'm
going to go ahead and hit build and now
this gives you the general shape and we
can go ahead and make a volume of this
shape i'm going to be doing a couple of
things more to it so in my side view
what I'm going to be doing is centering
this right in front of the door looks
pretty good and I'm also going to be in
my front view just bringing it right
about there so if we actually go ahead
and look in my perspective view you can
see that this area which is going to be
eventually the area of a trigger is
sitting right in front of my door but we
want to fix the problem that you know I
told you guys about we want to make sure
that the user or the player rather
doesn't sneak in between the side of the
wall and the door here and kind of sneak
pestis volume so what we're going to
want to be doing is we want to get more
of a customized shape so go ahead and
hop over in geometry mode and if I go
ahead and select this face right here I
can go ahead and let me move this maybe
move this so you guys can see a little
bit better go ahead and hop over to
extrude mode and I I talk to you guys
about true mode before so it basically
lets you customize the shape of your
volume and that looks pretty good over
there so now I'm just going to be doing
that with the other side so make sure
that they're both relatively even
usually whenever you're making a game
then you wanna you know take your time
and make sure that this and this are
both even but for the sake of this
tutorial it's good enough so also with
extrude mode still on i'm going to go
ahead and select this face and probably
my front view would be the best just
pull it so it hits that castle wall
looks pretty good and also select this
face right here and pull that so it
matches up right with that so now we can
go ahead and X out of this geometry mode
and what I have now is the custom I
shape that wraps around the door
completely so now my user of course
can't jump over this can't go underneath
it we don't have the problem of a
trigger where it's only a specific shape
which is a cylinder we can pretty much
make customized shapes so right now this
is just a weird-looking builder brush so
how do we turn this into a volume if we
go ahead and hit this button add volume
we can go ahead and select let me see if
I can find a trigger volume right there
and what this does is it makes this
trigger volume this same exact shape and
the reason we can't see any changes is
because our builder brushes in the way
so let's go ahead and slide that out and
actually hit be to hide your builder
brush and now you can see we have this
green volume that is like a customized
shape perfectly to fit our map server
saying all right so this is a trigger so
can we just treat it exactly like a
trigger well yes you can any
you can do with the trigger you can do
this this is basically a customized
trigger so go ahead and select it an
open kismet and if you go ahead and
right-click you can now see new event
using trigger volume 2 and just make it
a touch event which means whenever you
touch any of this area then this matinee
is going to play and that is of course
if we drag over this touch and plug it
into play so now what's going to happen
is this we set up a customized volume
which is pretty much a customized shaped
trigger and now what happens is whenever
our character runs into this trigger
volume hits this volume or this space in
any kind of way the matinee is going to
play and if you guys forgot the matinee
just turned this door from red until
green so if you guys don't believe me
let me go ahead and hit play from here
and now let me go ahead and see I'm not
hitting my volume yet but now when I do
you see is slowly changed from red to
green I couldn't made that a little more
exciting my I should make it move or
something but hey i'm too lazy to do
that so that is basically what a volume
is in again i only went over a trigger
volume which is one type of volume but
we have a massive amounts of volume
again we didn't cover a lot of this
stuff yet so you know like post process
and physics volumes but we'll get into
that later so anyways now they
understand the basics of what volumes
are and how to use them you're ready to
move on to the I don't know whatever the
heck I'm going to touch teach next so
thank you guys for watching don't forget
subscribe and I'll see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
