video I am going to teach you how to
perform a DI fen ocation at AK now this
is in tact that you can use to boot
people off of a Wi-Fi network and there
are a bunch of different techniques to
do this if you want to boot someone off
of your network on theirs the D
authentication attack which I'm going to
be showing you in this video there is a
disassociation attack which is kind of
like the same thing in Reverse as you
guys are going to see and you can also
just das it in other words just send the
network a bunch of packets and slow it
down and overwhelm it until like
everyone's booted off but this is one of
the most useful and I'm going to explain
why in just a second so basically what
we're going to do is we are going to
pretend to be the router and we're going
to do this by changing our MAC address
to the same one as the router so once we
do that we can pretty much just start
saying bye to whoever you want to and
they are going to think that we're the
router and we're just like kicking them
off so it is hilarious so this was a
capture that I've been running for like
a minute and the workflow is kind of
like this you basically just find all
the networks and then find a specific
one so I am only worried about Bucky's
Wi-Fi so I'm going to copy the Mac for
this and then down here I'm gonna I can
pretty much just run that command again
so arrow dump ng and it's always a good
idea to only listen on the specific
channel that that ap is broadcasting on
not adrian peterson the access point so
you see my Wi-Fi is only broadcasting on
channel 11 right here so if i type - -
channel 11 and then i can also type - -
be SSID and then paste the mac right in
there so let me just run this real quick
and i'll clean up some of this clutter
so we pretty much are just listening
still and now let me grab my tablet so
i'm going to have one client on this
network which is my tablet i'm holding
in my hand
and all right so we pick them up let me
set that bad boy down and now we can
stop so now we got all the information
we need and basically the only two
pieces of the puzzle that you're going
to need is the MAC address of the access
point which we got last time and now we
have the MAC address of the client so
this is the MAC address of that tablet
that I just had and actually right now
before I even do this let me just take a
screenshot of this I can't record my
tablet and this at the same time so nope
that wasn't it
all right so I am now I just wanted to
take a screenshot because I'll show you
guys that I do have a Wi-Fi signal my
tablet is connected working perfectly
right now so what we're going to do to
kick them off is we're going to use a
tool called I call it airplay some
people call it Airy play but I think
Airy play sounds weird so AI r e play -
ng so this is a packet injection tool in
other words you can create packets and
send them out so the first piece of the
puzzle is this we're going to write
minus minus D off and just write like mm
or something like that so this means
that we're going to be sending out D
authentication packets and these are
essentially goodbye packets we're like I
said they're just messages that say
goodbye in two thousand means that's how
many were going to be sending so it's
going to send about I don't know maybe a
few a second so if we send out two
thousand then it's going to last for you
know a couple minutes so now if you
write minus a it needs two other
parameters the first is the MAC address
of the access point when you just get
them all down here so paste that in and
this is the MAC address that we are
going to pretend to be so we're going to
pretend to be the access point and now
write a space - see this is the MAC
address of the client you want to kick
off so these are the packets that we're
going to be sending goodbye packets this
is the access point that they're going
to be coming from quote-unquote or
pretend to be coming from and this is
client now after this you just write
WLAN one Mon because that's the device
that we're going to be sending it from
and let me hit enter
and let me pick up my tablet here and
you see right now it start it started
sending out all of those the
authentication packets so now let me
take another screenshot and I'll post
this in my video and you guys can see
that I have lost my Wi-Fi signal on my
tablet and I can't connect to the
internet actually let me just open up
Chrome and try to go to some web page it
says you are offline Wi-Fi and mobile
data are unavailable tomato tomahto
tomato tomahto now there you go let me
just go ahead and stop that in as soon
as I do I'll bring them back online but
that is how you can boot someone offline
again you can target one person multiple
people and this isn't just for you know
if a girl in your history class is
snobby and you want to kick her off the
internet I mean you can do that but um
what it's really useful for is capturing
handshakes because I'll explain more
about this later on but basically if
people are already connected to the
network then that means that they
already verify themselves now you can
disconnect them and then they have to
verify themselves again and during that
moment while they're verifying
themselves you could look at things like
passwords in a whole bunch of useful
information but we'll get into that
later on for now that's enough that is

people off of Wi-Fi</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
