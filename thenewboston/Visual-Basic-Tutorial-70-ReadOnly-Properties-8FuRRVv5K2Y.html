slash on live gamer for the new boston
and in this tutorial we're going to be
finishing our customer program that uses
structures and if you this doesn't look
familiar to you
go back to tutorial 68 and that's what
we start building this program so enough
rambling let's go ahead and get started
so we created a structure we created an
object of that structure and let's go
and take this out just to make it a
little bit more readable we set the
values of that structure and we call
displaycustomer and passed our object to
it and so basically what displaycustomer
does is it takes a I'm sorry about that
it takes a customer and it sets the text
of the text value text first name to
cuss the customer not first name so now
what we're going to do is we're going to
fill in the name field so the way we're
going to do this is we're going to use a
a read-only property now if you don't
know what properties are then go back
and to one of the earlier tutorials
because this will just confuse you know
one thing about structures is that you
you don't you aren't constrained to only
use variables and values inside of your
structure you can also use methods of
properties and other stuff so in our
case we're going to create a property so
we'll go ahead and type public now we
don't want the property to be able to
set a value because there's no need to
so what we're going to do is we're gonna
type read-only property so what this
says is make a property but don't let us
make a set function so it will let us
use a get but we cannot use set so now
we're going to do is we're just going to
give a name for this and we'll set it
equal to name for the name field right
here and now we need to specify a
datatype for it so we'll just do as
string and now you can see that when we
press ENTER it adds the get and end
property for us you can see it doesn't
add the set for us because it because it
is read
only so now what we need to do is we
need to add first name and last name to
each other so we will just type return
first name and then we'll just add a
space in between that and then last name
so what this is going to do is the
property name is going to be equal to
first name plus space plus last name so
now what we need to do is we need to set
the we need to put that inside of this
text box right here which is text name
so we'll scroll down here and we will
find our display customer sub so you can
see we set text first name dot text text
last name dot text and text email tag
okay so now we'll come up here to the
first line of display customer and we're
just going to type text name dot text
and we will set it equal to cust dot
name now name is read as a value you can
see that it gives us instead of the Blue
Square we are going to get this little
pointing finger right here to a list and
that just represents a property this can
also represent constants and other
things inside a Visual Basic once you
learn what these icons mean you'll be
able to see things really fast and know
what they are and it it may not seem
like it but it helps a lot when you're
programming anything so now let's go up
here and we will run this and if we type
list customer we get Jim Jones first
name is Jim last name is Jones and we've
got the email Jones gym at live.com so
now let's go ahead and I'll just show
you that we can create more than one
customer so we'll just type private
object new customer as customer now
these two are completely independent of
each other and they're independent of
the customer structure because we are
creating what's called an object of it
which creates a one of them so we'll go
ahead and come down here and we
we'll set the values for object new
customer so object new customer dot
first name let's equal that let's say
that equal to Sam and then object new
customer dot last name and I'm not going
to put my real last name on here let's
just do hello that would be my last name
it sounds like a good last name and then
we'll do object new customer dot email
equals let's just do my email at
programmer dot com
okay so now we can just go ahead and
instead of using object customer we will
send object new customer and we'll go
ahead and run this and you can see that
we have our normal form and if we click
list customer we get Sam hello first
name Sam last name hello and email my
email at programmer comm so that was
just a little demonstration to show you
that you can create as many structures
as you want and they are stored as
objects and they are completely
independent of each other and each can
have different values for the variables
and they won't affect each other so um
we also talked about read-only
properties which was the main focus of
this tutorial there's also such thing as
a write only properties which instead of
giving you only get you you only get the
set function which we'll be covering
later on a couple couple tutorials after
this because we don't need that in
anything else so thanks for watching
guys and stay tuned for the next
