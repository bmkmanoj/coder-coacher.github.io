forum tutorial before we move on to form
validation and this tutorial we are
going to go over the last few form
elements that we haven't touched yet i'm
going to show you how to use jump menus
file fields and hidden fields all and
also text areas unfilled sets i know
that sounds like a lot but i think i
think that you guys will be able to to
keep up so first off let's say let's
talk a little bit about some
organization field sets or are think of
it like a box that you wrap around
different different groups of input
objects so say you know you have a group
of text fields or a group of radio
buttons with a menu inside of it and
some more text fields and you want to
wrap that in a field set because it's
going to tell you okay this is where you
put your address this is where you put
your school information so let's just
let's build one and then you'll see what
I was talking about all right so we're
going to click on field set over here
just click on Phil's hitting the insert
group and i'm going to call this i'm
going to call this file because we're
getting ready to input a file in a
second so what you can see is it created
a fieldset tag and a legend tag so i'm
going to save that and i'm going to go
over here and i'm going to click on text
area and what a text area is actually I
take that back i'm going to click on
file field and what a file field is is
you know whenever you're like making a
photo gallery or like uploading a
what-do-you-call-it you know you're
uploading some of the facebook where you
an album you're going to make an album
at facebook and you got to upload your
files well you the way you do that is
to insert the file yeah using a file
field so let's call this one picture and
let's just leave the size alone and it
doesn't really matter that much for this
particular example and we're going to
say okay and with that little bit of all
we really typed there was picture we
clicked on file field and typed in
picture and now we have a form item that
allows us to upload files it doesn't
have to be a picture see we've created
our field set here and it wrapped it
around this box and inside there we have
a file field and you click browse and
it's just like yours like normal files
just upload it once you click Submit so
that is the first two things I wanted to
show you in this tutorial the next thing
is going to be the jump menu so let's
create another field set will call this
one jump menu because that's exactly
what it is going to be and I'm going to
give some space here i'm going to click
inside the field set and i'm going to
insert a jump menu what a jump in you is
is it's almost like a menu of links
basically it's a drop-down menu and
whenever you click on an item inside
that menu it takes you to the link that
you pre-define inside of the menu items
so for example this item right here and
the first time I had a couple so we can
make some
some menu items and some jump menus here
alright so we have item 1 and I'm going
to leave that one I'm going to say
select a site and i'm going to give a
number sign that way whenever you click
on it it's not going to go anywhere is
just going to stay out on the site that
you're on at the moment all right and
for the second one I'm going to give it
a pink a name or text of google and make
sure you put HTTP in front of it so it
doesn't think that you're actually
trying to locate the file and your
current file structure and then I'm
going to click on the light i'm just
going to get i'm gonna say facebook for
this text right here right and you get
the idea there we go says open URLs in
May window and I'm just going to leave
these two like right here will say okay
and so I'm going to launch this your ass
and check it out and tell you to select
a site ok I want to select Google lets
going to take me to google i'm going to
select facebook i'm just going to take
me to facebook so now we've checked out
file fields we checked out filled sets
and we have also checked out jump menus
and the last thing that we're going to
look at before we move on to form
validation in the next series of
tutorials is we are going to look at the
text area I know sort of goes back a
little bit we've already we already made
our application and if you talk a few
tutorials ago where we we dealt with
text input and we are about to do the
same thing on a little different level
so I'm going to you know since we're
dealing with Phil sets we're gonna fill
sets in this example so I'm going to
create a little one last field set i'm
going to call it text area say ok
and inside this field set I'm going to
insert from the insert group over here
to the left I'm going to click on text
area and what a text area is is
basically a large text field you can set
the rows and columns as you see here in
this window oh I'm going to call this
one large text field I'm going to give
it I'm going to give it 20 columns want
to give it 5 rows i'm going to say i'm
going to leave the rapid to default say
okay and now we have created a text area
so let's launch this and let's check it
out inside the browser so you see now we
have a text area we can just continue to
type text as long as you want keep on
typing and see we're going to wrap when
I keep typing so just keep typing all
day long inside that and so yeah that's
it for this tutorial and that is it for
the basic form elements up here still
following this the the fun part is about
to is about to be validating all this
stuff yeah we have all these all these
objects inside of our form but we have
no way to tell if they're legit you know
if the people are putting in the
information the users putting in the
data it could be it could be wrong say
if they're putting an email of it could
be it could be wrong it could not be the
right I guess the right form and we can
use a spry validation straight inside
dreamweaver June you can see these over
here and that's what we're going to go
through the next tutorials so make sure
and stay tuned make sure and keep
watching and I hope to see you in the
next tutorial don't forget to subscribe
and
see you in a minute</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
