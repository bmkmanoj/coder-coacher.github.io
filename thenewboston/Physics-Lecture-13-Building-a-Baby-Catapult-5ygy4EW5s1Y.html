physics lecture and in this lecture what
I want to do is I actually want to show
you guys a problem where we calculate
force using the formula force equals
mass times acceleration so in the last
order what we did is we calculated the
acceleration or velocity of a potato and
we figured out acceleration but you know
since we're talking about force I think
it's only proper if we have a problem
where we actually need to find the force
of something so let's go ahead and think
of a problem real quick say that we had
a baby now this baby was just sitting
here when when crying like a little wimp
and this baby had a mass of let's say 16
kilograms a pretty tubby baby now we
wanted to build a baby catapult where we
could actually launch this baby at an
acceleration of 50 meters per second
squared we want to take this baby and
send that little bugger flying I was
about to say something else but I don't
think I should so how can we do that
well what we need to do is we need to
figure out how powerful to build our
baby cannon so let's go ahead and think
about this force equals mass times
acceleration at least that's what Newton
told us and the mass of the baby equals
what was I think I said 16 kilograms and
we already know how fast we want to
launch this baby we want to get this
baby going at 50 meters per second
squared so now we need to figure out how
powerful do we need to build this cannon
what is the force of this
well since force whenever we're looking
in the Newton's we need kilograms in
meters per second squared we already
have that the only thing that we need to
do is we need to take the mass which is
16 and we actually don't even need the
units because we know we're going to
come up with Newtons so it just takes 16
kilograms and multiply it by 50 meters
per second squared and whenever we do we
end up with a force of 800
Newton's so guys if you ever want to
build a baby cannon where you launch 16
kilogram babies and if you launch him
with a force of 800 Newtons then that
means that they are going to go
accelerate 50 meters per second squared
so there you go there is a problem of
how to figure out force according to
Newton and in the next tutorial what I'm
going to do is I'm going to discuss the
difference between mass and weight
because I often mix them up and I want
to explain to you guys
therefore if I ever slip whenever I'm
teaching you guys can correct me and
I'll leave you a bunch of hate mail so
thank you guys for watching don't forget
to subscribe and I'll see you guys in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
