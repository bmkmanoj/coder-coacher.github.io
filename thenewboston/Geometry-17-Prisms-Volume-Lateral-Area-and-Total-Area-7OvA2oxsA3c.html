prisms and we're gonna learn three
formulas well one is actually a review
formula the volume of a prism but we're
also going to learn lateral area of a
prism and total area of a prism so first
volume is equal to area of the base
times your height so for this this is a
rectangular prism so the base for us is
this square right here but since we
multiply everything together it doesn't
really matter what order you multiply in
because if you remember multiplication
is commutative which means you can do it
in any order you want so we're going to
do the area of the base which is 5 oops
times 4 times your perpendicular height
now if you look this is us taking this
prism and standing it up like this so
that this is 4 this is 5 and this
perpendicular height is this 8 because
this height makes a right angle here so
we can use that as our height so times 8
so volume is equal to 5 times 4 which is
20 times 8 so volume is equal to 160 and
if we had units it would be units cubed
because remember volume is a cubic
measurement we're going to do one more
practice with volume so for this one our
base is our base is this right triangle
right here so we're going to do V equals
the area of the base which for right
triangle it's 1/2 base which is 3 times
our perpendicular height which is 4
times the height of this prism which
would be
okay and we're going to multiply that by
our height which if you were thinking
about this as this triangle being the
base and this triangle sitting on the
ground like that its height would be
this four that's right here so V is
equal 1/2 times 4 is 2 2 times 3 is 6
times 4 is 24
so 24 units cubed okay for lateral area
you take the perimeter of the base and
you multiply it by the height when we
find lateral area we're just finding let
me get my shader so I can show you we're
just finding the area of these blocks
that go up and down we're not going to
find the area of this top block or this
bottom block okay just the lateral area
that's stand straight up and down so
when we find this we're going to take
our perimeter of the base which is 6
plus 3 plus 6 plus 3 6 plus 3 is 9 plus
6 plus 3 is 9 so 9 plus 9 is 18 so the
perimeter of the base times our
perpendicular height which is right here
7 and if you multiply that you get 126
and pretend they said this is inches
it'd be inches squared
because remember area is always a
squared unit of measure right so if we
find total area we're gonna we're gonna
be finding the lateral area which is the
area of each one of these um rectangles
that wraps around the shape these sides
but and we're going to add it to this
part these two hexagonal base is right
there I hope that helps you see a little
bit I know it's kind of hard to tell
because this isn't a 3d piece of paper
but for this we take our lateral area
which if you remember it's the parameter
of the base so the perimeter of the base
times your height so our perimeter of
our base our base let me just say is a
regular hexagon so to find our perimeter
all we have to do is take three
multiplied by six and you get 18 so our
perimeter of the base is 18 times our
height of the shape which is this five
right here times two area of the or plus
two area of a base in an area of a base
of a hex on is hexagon is the length
length right here times height so this
is three times four so 18 times five
which is 90 plus three times 4 which is
12 two times 12 so 90 plus two times 12
is 24 so our total area for this prism
is a hundred and fourteen a unit squared
because remember area is always unit
squared well that's all we're going to
do with prisms today but make sure you
come back because in the next lesson
we're going to talk about right circular
cylinders</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
