tutorial and in this video we're finally
gonna start styling the drop up menus
and I just want to say that I got a lot
of messages because on YouTube my name
is the New Boston and everyone thinks I
live in Boston in their messaging me
about all the bombings and stuff I don't
really live in Boston so uh I am safe
for everyone who is asking I don't live
in Boston I live in New York so uh yeah
so anyone who is worried about me you
know I'm okay anyways in this tutorial
what we're gonna do like I said is style
these drop up menus so the first thing
we're gonna do is style this programs
menu because I'm gonna be building
something special for the account
profile in two columns drop up menu this
programs menu is very simple basic one
and actually what it is is a list kind
of within a list so let me go ahead and
show you guys how to style this first
now actually let's go ahead and put um
like comments programs menu drop up
something like that
now remember like I said before
basically what we have here is this
entire footer is an unordered list in
each of these little tabs account
profile two columns programs each of
those buttons is a list item so actually
what we're going to be doing is within
this list item we're gonna be building
another list because remember this
programs button is a list item and this
calculator group chat image editor meme
generator all of those are actually
another list so once I code it you guys
are gonna see what's going on so in the
footer menu which is basically the
entire footer the list item the first
one is this programs button right here
what we want to do is we want to add an
even deeper unordered list and we'll
just give this the the class drop up so
basically what we're saying is whenever
we're styling this we're styling this
drop up menu right here this
but that appears on top of the programs
now the reason that we're not styling
this one or this one or this one is
because we're gonna use a different
layout for that but this is what we're
gonna be working on right now this drop
up menu that pops up whenever you hover
over the program's tab so the first
thing and the only thing we'll put in
here is display:none why is this because
you do not want this to appear by
default whenever they first visit the
website you only want it to appear
whenever they hover over this tab so by
default display:none now how do we
achieve the effect that we wanted to
display on hover well that's easy
actually if we just copy this key a
little bit and list item hover then we
can change that a display to block so
now what we did is whenever they hover
over this list item which is essentially
this button then what we want to do is
we want to display it on the screen
however it doesn't really have a size
right now or a position so let's go
ahead and fix all that and by the way a
lot of people make this mistake whenever
they're making either drop-down menus
just basic drop-down menus or drop up
footers like this they make the link to
hover over but you don't want the user
to have to hover over the link to make
the menu appear if you want it to act
like a button make sure that the entire
list item appears on drop up because
then this item wouldn't appear now only
when you hover it over a link so anyways
make sure you always hover over list
item not over the a tag which would be
the URL so now we basically said don't
display undie fault but whenever the
user hovers over the button display it
so now we got to give it all the
settings so position:absolute and this
is of course in reference to the outer
element that which basically means the
list item now the margin is going to be
zero zero zero negative 15 pixels now
why is this well if you go ahead and do
the math
with all the padding and the margin and
all the borders and everything when you
move it to the left 15 pixels it lines
it up perfectly with this left-hand side
and let me just zoom in here if I can
there we go see if I can zoom in as you
can see it's lined up perfectly with
this border right here so that's what we
want</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
