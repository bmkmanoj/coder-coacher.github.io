welcome to your seventh Photoshop
tutorial and in this lesson I have to
talk about the Navigator panel and I got
to teach you guys about screen modes and
I'm going to be going over the zoom tool
whole bunch of crap that I'm going to be
teaching you guys so let's go ahead and
start with the Navigator panel now by
default the Navigator panel is not
visible so go ahead to your window and
make sure that the Navigator panel has a
check next to it if it doesn't then go
ahead and click it and now you see that
your Navigator panel opens up on the
left hand side so just go ahead and make
this a little bit bigger not too big
that's what she said and that looks
pretty good right there
so what the Navigator panel is is it's
basically an easy way to navigate around
your image or document now the pretty
much most simple thing that you can do
with it is just zoom in and out of your
image so here's my main image right now
this is actually a picture of my sister
I don't know what she's doing just
probably you know being a model in
training so to zoom in what you need to
do is hold this slider right here on
your navigator panel and zoom in just
like this now as you can see a red box
appears whenever you zoom in far enough
now the red box basically represents the
visible area of your image so as you can
see it's you know close to a hand inner
bottom lip so that is the visible area
in your main document now of course if
you want to zoom out you can either use
the slider or you can use these two
little Mountain icons next to it small
mountain of course zooms out large
Mountain zooms in in increments now the
last thing that you could do or the less
technique that you can use is you can
actually enter a value so you know how
we're zoomed in to 81 percent well if we
want to go ahead and zoom out to I don't
know 25 percent just go ahead and type
in 25 hit enter and then your image is
going to be zoomed out 25 percent by the
way the default is 100 right there so
aside from that as you can see earlier I
talked about this little
Redbox now red is a pretty cool color
and you know this little red box is
contrast to a lot of typical pictures
but what if you're working with I don't
know a photo that's in the morning where
there are lot of reds or maybe you're
just working with a graphic and there's
a lot of red colors in that well then
this red box can get kind of confusing
and you may want to change it to a
different color so to change this red
box to a different color what you need
to do is you need to use the option menu
right here and choose panel options this
gives you your navigators options and
the only option is what color do you
want to change the box to so let's go
ahead and change this to I don't know
like a orange or something looks pretty
good and there you go now your box is
orange so if you want to change the
color that's how you do that now the
next thing I want to talk about is
screen modes now a lot of people just
like to stick with this default screen
mode but there are often times where
other screen modes are definitely super
beneficial so the default screen mode in
of course the excessive screen mode it's
this button right here the default
screen mode is standard screen mode and
that's a screen mode with all your
panels on the bar at the bottom pretty
much all this gray space around it now
if you want to go to a different one
then choose full screen mode with menu
bar now as you can see whenever I did
that everything kind of changed and the
first thing you can notice is the little
windows bar that was on the bottom that
had the little windows icon and the time
in the tool bar it disappeared
also there are no tabs on the top giving
you the name of the document now the
last screen mode is full screen mode and
whenever you select this it gives you a
little prompt that says okay you're
about to go into full freakin screen
mode it's kind of a big deal and the
reason that they give you is prompt is
because whenever you click full screen
there are no buttons so if you're
clicking around like oh how do I get out
how do I get out you get out by pressing
escape or F and then it puts you back in
the standard but those are the different
screen modes
one thing I want to point out is that of
course in standard mode you can do
things like paint the picture in
full-screen mode you also have full
access to all of your tools so even
though you can't see your tools on the
left hand side you can go ahead and I
don't know maybe draw her a pair of
glasses or you know just give her some
nail polish you also have full access to
your tools even though you can't see
them a lot of people don't know that now
the last thing I want to talk about now
that we covered screen mode and the
Navigator panel is the zoom tool now
this zoom tool is the magnifying glass
right here and it's the first tool that
I want to go over because it's extremely
important now even though it's only one
tool there are multiple ways that you
can zoom in and around your image the
first thing you can do is you can click
a certain spot so say I want to zoom
into her eye I'm just going to go ahead
and hold the tool over I click click
click it zooms into her eye so then you
know maybe I could make some better
glasses or change the color of her eye
her eye whatever I want to do now
another thing that's kind of useful is
you can also hold this in now instead of
clicking just click once and hold it in
and as you can see it zooms slowly into
wherever you're holding now the last
thing that you can do aside from
clicking and holding it in is you can
drag so whenever you click this in drag
right it seems in and whenever you drag
left it zooms out so remember click hold
it in or drag right and left those are
the three different ways you can zoom
and another thing I want to show you
guys real quick is say you're zooming
around and you know you got all confused
if you just double click this little
magnifying glass then it puts you back
to 100% default value so there you go
there is how to use the navigation panel
how to change screen modes and also how
to use the zoom tool again even though
it's one little tool it's pretty
powerful once you get to know it and
you're definitely going to be using this
a lot it's probably your
a most common tool so there you go thank
you guys for watching don't forget
subscribe and I'll see you guys in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
