another app review and this one is for
illuminate tycoon this is the free
version but the only difference between
the free version and the paid version is
pretty much ads that pop up and they
only pop up like once every three
minutes or something so it's not that
bad so go ahead and our main screen just
put play against our new career or load
a game that you already have
I have Bucky ofcourse and now you see
this huge interface which can be kind of
confusing to begin with results are your
results
obviously the rent right here this
pretty much takes it to a different
location in the high your pay for rent
the more people that are gonna stop by
the upgrades are for better equipment
the staff is of course when you get real
busy you need to hire staff to help you
Marketing is for things like cost per
glass and also your advertisement cost
which can help make you popular and the
recipe and the supplies are
self-explanatory you can change your
recipe if you click on it that's a
pretty bit of recipe right there if you
guys are getting stuck egg lemons 4 cups
sugar and three Ice Cube's montane your
ice cubes depending on the day and of
course to buy supplies make sure you are
stocked up is your supplies at the top
right here so go ahead and once you're
ready go ahead and click start day and
it says you don't have enough money and
pay your hired staff so let's go ahead
and we can fire her click back and now
we can start our day so we can either
walk through real time or click this the
fast-forward it and what this does is
pretty much give you your end of these
stats sir customer satisfaction was 64
and they complained about long serving
time so that's why we actually need a
staff so I'll click OK and that's pretty
much it um pretty much give feedback
every day and this will give you what
you need to do to make your thing more
successful they might complain about the
recipe you need to change that
complaining about long wait times change
but that's pretty much it so I'm gonna
go ahead and I'm gonna rate this game a
six out of ten just because you know
it's a game that can keep you busy for a
while but it's it takes a while to get
to hang up and that adds on this one
aren't very fun but on the version that
I think the paid one is a dollar
ninety-nine and that's all without ads
so again like I said a six out of ten
what I recommend buying it sure why not
it's uh it's free so I mean you have no
excuse not to and that's it for that so
thank you guys for watching don't forget
to subscribe and remember if you have
any more
Absalon interviewed just let me know and
I'll do it for you so long last time
thank you don't forget subscribe and
I'll see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
