another app review and this one is for
illuminate tycoon this is the free
version but the only difference between
the free version and the paid version is
pretty much ads that pop up and the only
pop up like once every three minutes or
something so it's not that bad so go
ahead and our main screen just put play
you can start a new career or load a
game that you already have I have Bucky
of course and now you see this huge
interface which can be kind of confusing
to begin with um results or results
obviously the rent right here this
pretty much takes it to a different
location in the higher pay for rent the
more people that are going to stop by
the upgrades are for better equipment
the staff is of course when you get real
busy you need to hire staff to help you
marketing is for things like cost per
glass and also your advertising costs
which can help make you popular and the
recipe and the supplies are
self-explanatory you can change your
recipe if you click on it that's a
pretty good recipe right there if you
guys are getting stuck eight lemons for
cup sugar and three ice cubes on change
your ice cubes depending on the day and
of course to buy supplies make sure you
are stocked up is your supplies in the
top right here so go ahead and once
you're ready go ahead and click start
day and it says you don't have enough
money and pay your hired step so let's
go ahead
and we can fire her click back and now
we can start ur day so we can either
walk through real-time or click this to
fast-forward it and what this does is
pretty much give you your end of these
debts sir customer satisfaction was 64
and they complained about long serving
time so that's why we actually need a
staff so i'll click ok and that's pretty
much it um pretty much give feedback
every day and this will give you what
you need to do to make your thing more
successful they might complain about the
recipe you need to change that complain
about long wait times change your staff
but that's pretty much it so i'm going
to go ahead and I'm going to rape this
game a six out of ten just because you
know it's a game that can keep you busy
for a while but it's it takes a while
get to hang up and the ads on this one
aren't very fun but on the birthing that
I think the paid one is a dollar
ninety-nine and that's all without ads
so again like I said a six seven ten
what I recommend buying it sure why not
so it's free so I mean you have no
excuse not to and that's it for that so
thank you guys for watching don't forget
subscribe and remember if you have any
more Absalom interviewed just let me
know
for you so long last time thinking don't
you can subscribe and I'll see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
