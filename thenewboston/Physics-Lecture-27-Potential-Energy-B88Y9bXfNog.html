physics lesson and in this lesson I want
to talk to you guys about potential
energy so now that we understand the
difference between power and work let's
go ahead and talk about energy
scientists say that energy is the
ability to do work which kind of makes
sense because you know whenever I have
energy I can do some work I could you
know go get a job or do something
productive even though I usually just
watch movies or go to McDonald's I have
the ability to do work
which is the important thing so we
already know whenever we're talking
about work in physics we're talking
about force times displacement so now
that we understand that let's go ahead
and talk about potential energy or the
ability to make this crap happen so
probably the easiest example I can think
of is when you have an apple that's
growing from a tree now of course
whenever apples grow up mature grow ripe
they fall to the ground but right now
this Apple is still growing it isn't
doing crap it isn't producing any energy
it isn't working at all however like I
said whenever this Apple is just hanging
from the branch it will give off two
things when it falls first of all
whenever this Apple Falls it's going to
move therefore causing a displacement
and it's also going to hit the ground
with a certain amount of force so sent
since it's going to move and hit the
ground with a certain amount of force we
know that this Apple is going to one day
work it's going to produce energy and
since this Apple has the potential to
work one day we call this potential
energy potential energy so basically
when something isn't working yet or not
giving off any energy but it has the
potential to do so we call the energy
that is stored in this Apple potential
energy now in this example potential
energy of this Apple depends on two
things first of all the more work it's
going to do is depend on how high off
the ground the Apple is and also the
weight of the Apple
heavier this Apple is the more force
it's going to hit whenever it hits the
ground and also the higher this Apple is
the harder it's going to hit the ground
so again the potential energy if we want
to calculate the potential energy of
this Apple is dependent on the weight in
the height of the Apple so let's go
ahead and run some calculations on this
slide since I'm running out of room so
the formula for potential energy is
equal to weight and or excuse me I
didn't mean equals to weight times
height
the heavier and the higher off the
ground something is the more potential
energy it has the more it's going to
work eventually so we'll say that the
apple has I don't know let's give it a
weight of equal to 6 Newtons and we'll
give it a height how far do apples
usually grow off the ground Oh apple
trees are pretty big I don't know I got
I don't know I'm just going to say
something stupid like 20 meters even
though that would probably be a really
huge apple tree and by the way I
probably shouldn't mention this before I
get you know too far ahead you guys I
know that I usually say that new in is
the unit for force but weight and force
since gravity is consistent on earth
pretty much weight and force are the
same thing or equal so I often use these
two terms interchangeably and that is
actually valid because whenever you're
talking about earth weight and force are
indeed interchangeable fun fact for you
guys so now what we want to do let's get
back on track here is we want to
calculate how much potential energy or
how much energy is stored in that Apple
so what we do is we take the weight of
the Apple which is 6 Newtons and we
multiply it by how high off the ground
was the Apple which is 20 meters and of
course you guys can probably do this but
we end up with 120 Newton times meter
and if you remember from the last story
whenever you have Newton times a meter
you end up with the Joule
so this Apple has a potential energy of
1
120 joules one day it is well pretty
much there is 120 joules of energy
stored in this Apple that's how much
potential it has simple enough I just
explained to you guys what potential
energy is I don't need to explain that
so that is how you calculate potential
energy of things hanging from the ground
and there are also so many other
applications that we can use potential
energy and that it's also it's pretty
much mind-blowing and in the upcoming
tutorials I'm going to show you guys all
the different things that you can do
with potential energy probably one of
the most important concepts in physics
so anyways thank you guys for watching
and well I guess I'll see you guys in
upcoming video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
