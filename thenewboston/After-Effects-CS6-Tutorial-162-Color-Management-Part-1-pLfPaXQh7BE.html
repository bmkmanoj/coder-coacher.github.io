Blackford here with another After
Effects cs6 tutorial I was just over at
Bucky's house we kind of like built a
little man cave in his basement and we
set up like a futon and an Xbox and a
bunch of us came over and we're playing
hockey and 360 and we weren't doing too
well because you know when you play try
to play with four people at once you
always suck because everybody's trying
to like go for the puck and everything
like that and in hockey so everybody
started getting mad so I was like yeah
I'm out of here I didn't want to get
beat up because I wasn't doing very well
so I guess it sucks to suck for me but
usually I don't do it that bad but
anyways today I want to talk to you guys
about color management and color
management is within the project
settings and it's kind of hard to
understand and to be honest I don't know
every single thing about color
management because there's a whole bunch
of different aspects to it but you don't
need to know a whole every single thing
about it you just need to know the
basics and how to use it correctly and
then if you ever need to know anything
else just look on like Adobe's website
to figure out what's going on and I'll
bring up their their page that they have
here that will be helpful for you if you
ever need to but here it is and if you
ever just pause it and then like write
this down or just type in After Effects
color management so I'll bring that over
to the side and I'm not gonna be reading
from that or anything like that I'm just
I just brought that up so that you guys
had something to do or something to read
as like extra material to help you help
yourself out I read it a long time ago
and it is actually pretty decent at
helping you figure out what's going on
so color management is pretty much used
to make sure that the colors that are on
your computer screen though that you see
are going to be transferred over to the
like something like a TV or if you're
going to be put
something on a webpage you want to have
the right color space and like - if
you're bringing in your footage you want
to make sure it's the right type of it's
the right color and everything when you
bring it on to your own computer screen
this is pretty important especially when
you're trying to color correct things
you want to make sure that you have the
right kind of color on your monitor or
and you want to make sure that it's
going to be right on like a TV or
something like that
and you remember that there's certain
kinds of TVs and everything so you got
the tube TVs and then you got some TVs
that aren't full HD and then you got the
HD TVs so you just whatever you plan on
putting this on you need to think ahead
and then setup your project for that so
we go over this now because now we have
kind of an idea what's going on so let's
go into our project settings so go to
file then all the way down here at the
bottom is project settings and your
project is pretty much everything is
combined into all your video and all
your compositions that you have made and
everything that you save with this file
name so mine's a e 1.8 be that's your
project so we've got the project
settings going on here and we don't need
to worry about these timecode and frames
because we have learned about these
already I want to teach you about this
color setting section so we've got this
depth here and this is the bits per
channel and we've got 16 and 32 and
that's gonna talk about like the amount
of color that you've got into here so
I'm gonna cancel out of this real quick
because I can't go over onto anything
else like if I click it's gonna give me
the error noise
like that so I'm gonna come over here
and look at my video real quick and if
you look into the video look I can't
make this I can't make this any bigger I
guess up here but if you look at the the
video settings here we've got 44 or 0.1
0 0 k HZ and that is your audio and
we've got 32 bit right here and then
we've got stereo now you may have you
may look at this and see 16 bit here or
on on another one of these we got 32 bit
don't get confused by that this section
right here is audio what we want to pay
attention to here is the file type here
and we want to make sure and realize if
we have any HD footage going on so check
out the actual resolution and if it's HD
or not so I've got this here which is a
bunch of K which was a bunch of DP X and
images which is a large file type that
supports a lots of colors so if I've got
and then I've got something like this
I'll bring that in you can see this is
huge
and let me move it over here to where
I'm timing indicator is and you can see
how large this is and these support lots
and lots of colors and color values let
me delete that out and then I've got
something like this video here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
