video we're going to be binding the
socket to the port so what does this
mean basically what we did is we created
a socket and all that data says hey we
are going to be connecting to another
computer somewhere so now what we need
to do is we need to say ok whenever you
have that conversation where is that
data going to be coming in where is a
conversation going to be taking place
and we already declared all the
variables up here on our own machine
just listen on port 999 but now we
actually have to bind this data to the
socket so this socket knows that this is
the data to use very simple stuff but
you know that's what we got to do to
port and say and wait for connection
from a client now the client of course
is that target machine if you got hacked
and they probably don't know they're the
client but hopefully it's your friend or
something in Texas so whatever alright
so deaf sockets bind and now what we can
do is actually just copy this cuz use
the same stuff and I'm too lazy to type
it alright so I'm just going to put a
little indicator at first so then
whenever you run this program we can see
some something pop up in the command
line and we know that it didn't freeze
or anything so I'll say a binding saw
hit to port
and I'll say ports port because remember
this port 9999 this is an integer right
now so we have to convert it to a string
before we print it out and now if I
spell that correctly you can actually do
the binding and the way you Pont you
bind your information is actually really
easy so for your socket just call the
function bind and then inside here you
actually rate a tupple and it just takes
the host and the port
so this says bind the socket to the host
and this would usually be an IP address
but since we're just listening on our
own machine and this is just running on
the server itself it's just going to be
blank which is fine and poor 9 9 9 9
all right so now all of our information
is bound together we're ready to pretty
much listen so for your sockets what
you're going to do is you're just going
to call listen and just stick a number
in there like 5 and that will be good
enough so basically what this does right
here is what well I'll break it up so
listen does is it basically allows your
server to accept connections so we're
not actually connecting at but now our
server is sitting there waiting for
someone to connect now this five
argument right here this is the number
of bad connections that it will take
before refusing any new connections so
you can set it up however you want but
five is a good number I mean we're the
only ones that are going to be running
it in this example so whatevs now let me
just toss this in again as message and
I'll just say all right so whenever we
failed at binding I'll say sake
finding hair and then we can print out
the error message and then what can we
do after this let's pump a new line and
get some workers you going on all right
so if we fail to bind the socket then
what we can do is you can say hey that
didn't work but I'm going to retry it so
we got some recursion going on it's just
going to call this function again and
keep trying until it combined so let's a
can bind not combine just talking to
myself here don't mind me all right so
so far we created a socket we said hey
this server can connect to other
computers and then we said re we're
going to bind the socket to the poor in
other words this is what information or
this is where the conversation is going
to take place looking good so now the
last main function that we have to do
here is just to accept connections
because right now is just listening for
connections but what happens when
someone actually connects well we will
see with second must be listening for
them all right so now what we do is you
write def socket except now this is
another thing that you need to watch out
for a lot of people try to accept
connections when their socket is not
listening for them so if you leave this
line of code out then it's not going to
work your socket needs to be listening
before it can actually you know accept
obviously so whenever someone next
what we're going to do is this alright
so what this function does right here is
it accepts a new connection so whenever
some client connects to our server what
it does is it gives you some information
this is the actual connection and this
will want to write printout you guys are
going to see all right so first let me
just print out some information so we
can know or understand what these
variables actually do so this is going
to wait and it's not going to continue
for the rest of this code we're on with
the rest of this code until a connection
takes place so at this point in time
I'll say connection has been established
I guess and just throw my plate and how
am I going to format this alright
alright so this variable right here it's
actually broken up into a list in the
first element is actually the IP address
of whatever computer connected so it's
pretty cool that's how we can identify
it and after this is the port number and
I don't know if I think this is a string
already so I just have to alright so the
second element is the port number so all
right looking good so whenever we get a
connection from a client it's just going
to print out connection has been
established and it's going to tell you
the IP address and the port number right
there looking good so now
what we want to do is we want to pass in
well we'll make this function in just a
second and close all right so this right
here is basically information about
whoever connected and this is reference
to the connection itself so the
conversation so we're going to make a
function in just a second
called send commands and basically what
this is going to do is once a client is
connected and it's going to sit like
some dudes computer and Texas is going
to sit and say okay what do you want me
to do so it's going to look and wait for
commands and it's going to do whatever
we tell it to and then once it gets a
command it's going to run it on its own
computer wherever it is and then send us
the results so it's basically it's
basically an awesome way that we can
pretty much access a computer indirectly</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
