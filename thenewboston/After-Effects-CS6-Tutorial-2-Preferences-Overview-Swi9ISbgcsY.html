is buddy Blackford and welcome to the
second After Effects tutorial today in
this tutorial we're going to be learning
a little bit about the Preferences up
hope my preferences so you can see what
you should possibly have but it will
differ for everybody at event depends on
how your computer is and then I'll give
you a little bit of tips and then
possibly go over the tools panel we have
enough time up here and I'll let you
know like the hotkeys and stuff so the
first thing we're going to go to is edit
preferences then you can just go to
general that'll be the starting point
the first thing you want to do in like
any program is set up your preferences
or else everything's going to be all
screwed up and it's going to be a little
harder to work or things are going to be
slow or you can't see things whatever
you get the drift okay
so you can check out here and you can if
you want to you can pause the video and
make sure that you have these ones
checked here
most of these are default it saves your
preferences so I'm not sure which ones
really were default but I definitely
uncheck show tooltips because I got sick
of that popping up every time ok we'll
go to previews and I left everything how
it was here this is all default
here's display
here's the import and it might be a
little boring going through these so
maybe I'll tell a little story while I'm
doing it about this woodchuck encounter
I had today so just pause the video if
you want to do the checks like set up
your check boxes or your times or
whatever or I'll just go slow enough
that you can actually do it within the
time as I'm telling the story and
everything so you can hear it so we went
to the store to this farm and I was had
to smash fence posts and to build a
fence for cows so think it out and we're
just smashing away and all of a sudden
this woodchuck comes running out of
nowhere and I yell to the guy I'm
working with hey there's a woodchuck
coming after you and he just runs away
screaming like it was funny I don't know
he just ran away screaming and that
story wasn't as funny as I thought it
was going to be but I guess that I had
to suffice for now because that's all I
could think of so um here we got the
median dist cashier every once in a
while you might want to empty the disk
cache it basically speeds up after
effects every once in a while I think
it's all like these I think it's all
slow on you if that that's something you
can try to speed it up normally when you
choose a full to zero folder for your
cache to go to you want to usually go to
the SSD so I could make one on my SSD
and
new folder a temp and I can select I can
select that hit okay and now it'll go to
my SSD and I'll be a lot faster these I
just left the same video preview I left
this how it was appearance and I left
this how it was also most of the
preferences you can just leave how they
are I'm pretty sure autosave isn't
turned on so you may want to check
autosave projects and I put every 10
minutes I found that that works pretty
well because sometimes 10 minutes of
work is a lot of stuff and if you've
animated like a hundred points or
something like that or put a bunch of
effects on and you don't you're not
going to remember and your computer just
randomly crashes for no reason then you
will be happy that the autosave is there
also you want to always save like all
the time like any time there's a star up
here it means your project isn't saved
so you can see it up here by the name
hit ctrl s or you can go to file and
then save well you that's one of the
things that you always want to do and
you'll learn and what once you if once
your computer program crashes a few
times because it always happens here's a
multiprocessing and i like to turn mine
on i have a a course in my cpu and it's
one of the AMD eight core some things or
another so i reserved two for the other
applications and then had two gigabytes
so this usually helps me render faster
but just so you know not all the time
does it render faster so this helps most
of the time but not all the time
and here's audio I didn't mess with this
here's more audio I didn't mess with
that either so I said okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
