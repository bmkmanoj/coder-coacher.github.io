analysis was essentially whenever you
want to analyze this one-page once
you're done with that you can go ahead
and move on to curls so crawls as you
can expect it pretty much allows you to
enter your website's homepage and then
it crawls all of your pages now again
I'm not going to recommend crawling all
of the pages on your website and that's
because a lot of the time you don't need
to for example if you look at my profile
right here say that I analyzed this page
and found a bunch of problems with it
well the problems on my profile are
going to be the same on you know
Sally's profile and they're gonna be the
same on Harris's profile so again even
though I have a lot of pages and I want
to improve Moe I don't need to scan
everyone's profile because it's always
gonna give me the same results so just
type it in here and you can actually
limit the pages you want to scan using
this drop-down and then if you hit crawl
it's gonna go ahead and start I actually
already did one yesterday so you know I
didn't think you guys want to just wait
for it to scan while I talked about
nothing for two minutes so I'll save you
some time so I scan this and I believe
this was a hundred pages so check this
out so just like before
whenever you scan your website the
results are going to be broken up into a
bunch of different sections the first
one is just an overview so of all the
pages of scan I got this score 52 out of
100 not that great not really proud of
that but that's what that is
now again you really want to spend your
time into these individual sections
that's going to give you details on what
exactly you need to improve so the first
one is this indexation pretty cool word
so what this section essentially does is
it checks for broken links now a broken
link is let's say we have a link like
this link but it was either incorrect
maybe I whenever I was making the
website I typed in the URL wrong or
maybe it links to a page that doesn't
exist anymore or maybe it just doesn't
link to anything those are all broken
links links that don't work as they
should
now
is you want to have zero broken links on
your page and the reason for that is if
Google scans your page and it sees you
have a bunch of broken links it's gonna
look like your website isn't maintained
and it hasn't been updated in a while so
that's what broken links indicate so you
definitely don't want any of those and
it's also good not to have a lot of
redirects so a redirect is basically
something like this you see how whenever
I go to
www.carmensognonvi.com/newsletter echt
through the new boston com so that's
what that is but in general you don't
want any of those or as little as
possible now we can see that I have one
right here that whenever someone goes to
the New Boston comm slash forum it just
redirects them to the forum home page
which is essentially this page right
here so again this is in the file it's
actually a directory so that's why it
does that and again you want to make
sure that you have two hundred almost
everywhere that just means that it's a
link that works properly resource okay
so if you have a bunch of 4:01 that
means that it doesn't exist 300 are your
redirects tomato tomahto
so no broken links textual content so
what this is is essentially whenever it
scans your website go back to my home
page let's go this way
all right so whenever it scans your
website is going to gather information
about the keywords on every page at
scans so it's going to scan this page
and then it's go and go to you know the
video space scan this page and gather up
all of the keywords and that's what this
section is right here so in general like
I said before you want a lot of keywords
that are going to be good ranking
factors so if you see that your most
used keywords are
things like you know they don't even
relate to videos or tutorials or
computer programming then that's
probably not good you probably want to
work on that but yeah and another really
awesome thing aside from just seeing
what are the most used keywords on your
site is you can actually break it down
into all the pages so here are all of
the pages that site analyzer scan and it
looks a little bit funny and that's just
because I increase the zoom for just my
videos but you know it doesn't really
look like this if you were just to go to
the site so every single page what it
does is it tells you all right use your
text to code ratio you usually want this
a lot higher than mine are right here
again my sites kind of weird because I
have videos and you know the point of a
video is like so you don't have to like
read a book or so you can learn in a
different kind of way so that's my
excuse okay guys so so for a wide mine
is so awful so you usually want this a
lot higher than mine and also on every
single page it tells you what keywords
are used most so say that you were
trying to boost your homepage for maybe
programming lessons that's the keyword I
want to try to target because that's
where all the users are searching for on
Google I can see that my top keywords
right here they don't even include the
word lesson so that's something I want
to work on and it's cool so um I have a
section for like let's see food right
here I'll show you guys it real quick so
here are all the video tutorials and
courses about cooking and food and I can
see re so these are in keywords and
video tutorials toriel laura video well
that's not really good I should probably
try to target something like um cooking
lessons or cooking courses food
tutorials something like that so it's a
really helpful in again not only an
overall overview of your entire site but
the individual pages to make sure that
they are optimized as well so let's go
ahead and scroll back up and click on
