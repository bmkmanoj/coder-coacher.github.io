tutorial that I'm making for the new
Boston and in this tutorial I'll be
showing you how to read XML and in case
you don't know what XML is it's
basically just a way of storing data and
it's very similar to the tree view so
this people that's a node right there
and inside of its people node we have a
person node and can inside of this
person node we have a name node for
storing the person's name and age node
for sewing the person's age and an email
note for storing the person's email and
in order to create a new node you just
basically put a less than sign the name
of the node and then following that put
a greater than sign and then when you
want to finish that node off you just
want to put a forward slash inside of
the node and then just have the same
name so this this people node you can
just tell it ends right there because
there's a forward slash and the people
so this is the same name of this so then
inside is people node right here we have
a person node we have one for their name
inside the person node we have a versus
the person's age and also the person's
to do now store this is a very common
way of storing data alright so in the
program that I'm using right now is
called notepad plus plus it's great for
writing XML or pretty much any language
so in order to download that just go on
Google and just like a kind of pad plus
plus go to the first link here the
download tab and then just click this
saw installer right here you may see a
different version that's okay this is
just the most up-to-date version as at
the time of me making this tutorial but
this download the latest version really
doesn't matter they're pretty similar
and yeah just put this link to download
all right so once you have that just
write an XML file it looks similar to
this one so the first thing that we're
going to be doing is reading XML so our
goal is to just read the person's name
right here so we get started just go
ahead and double click on a button make
sure you have an open file dialog and if
statement checking to see if the user
actually selects a file
open file dialog we're just going to
create a filter here so they can only
open up XML files filter all right so
now they can only open up XML file so
just make it a lot easier on us we also
going to need to be using the system XML
namespace because all of the classes
handling XML are is inside of this XML
namespace so the first thing we're going
to want to do is create a new instance
of the XML document class or going to
say XML document I'll just call it X
talk and study equal to a new XML
document class in order to load our
document or load our XML file we're
going to need to be using XML or the
load method inside an XML document class
so we're just going to say X Docs which
is the name of our instance of the XML
document class use the dot operator to
get to that load method and inside of
here we're just going to pass as a
parameter the location of the file and
this need to be a path to it on your
computer or URL we're first going to be
having to be in half an hour computer so
we're just going to have it read
whatever file that we open and the open
file dialog file name alright and now in
order to read it we're just gonna say X
talk dot select single node so we will
just want it to select this name node
right here so we can't just put name
right through we have to tell it where
to how to get to his name though we have
to put people slash person slash name
and then we can get to this name so
right here is gonna pass or yeah pass
the path to that node so we're going to
say people slash and yeah you do use a
forward slash person slash name and then
we're just gonna want to use the enter
text property to get
this text right here inside of this name
node and we're just going to have that
be displayed in a message box alright so
now I'm going to bug here and click this
button we should get a message box or I
can help you get an open file dialog
just gotta open that full yep we get
atom perfect it read the name because
you gave it a correct path and if you
wanted to get persons like eight or
something we can change this age because
the age node is also inside of the
person node so just put age right there
and you should get 15 because it says 15
right there within that XML file yep 15
perfect so that's it for this tutorial
so see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
