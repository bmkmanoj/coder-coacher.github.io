your 26th uh I was going to say
objective-c but this is actually
intermediate Java tutorial I've been
doing Objective C for like the last
month so anyways welcome to your 26
intermediate Java tutorial and in this
story we're going to be learning about
threads now if you watch any of my game
tutorials you know that I already tell
you guys a little bit about threats but
now we're going to be really getting
in-depth and aside from that before I
even begin I want to show you guys
something you might be interested about
if you go to my new blog right here the
New Boston code blog spot.com it's a new
blog I made today you will see all of
the source code not only for this
tutorial but every tutorial I'm going to
make from here on out I'm going to put
the source coder right here in again the
New Boston code blog spot.com and if
you're too lazy to type that in just go
ahead to my other blog and then you can
see a link to that right here on my
tutorials source code or if you're are
at my youtube channel good thing I have
like the smallest browser in the window
well if you're in my youtube channel go
ahead and go to my blog and then there's
a length of this blog but anyways that's
enough of that let's get the tutorial so
actually I'm just going to put a link to
this right in my description box why
don't I do that and save you guys
confusion yeah that's what I'm going to
do so if you're saying alright let's get
to this thread stuff what is the thread
what thread is is it's a way your
computer allows you to do multiple
things at once so for example the video
you're watching right now remember the
old days where you had to download a
video and wait for the whole thing to
download and then once it was downloaded
then you can watch it like eff that no
way we want to start this video
buffering and as soon as we get a little
bit of data in it that's when we start
watching it and it actually loads as
we're watching it and we can watch it
before the whole thing is loaded so if
you see the little progress bar at the
bottom move in
um you know that you can watch a video
before it's completely a little bit so
loading and watching those are two
different things doing it at the same
time that's the power of threads so
again instead of doing one thing over
then waiting for it then going to the
next thing and next thing step-by-step
we're doing many things all at the same
time
pretty cool huh so I'll be going in this
a little bit later and if you need a
better explanation go to my Java game
development tutorial one and two and I
explain it more in detail but now we
really just want to get into the coding
so you know enough of me talking let's
go ahead and do this so in order to
create a thread the first thing that we
need to do is implement the interface
runnable now runnable right here
contains one method and one method only
we need to use in it and that's the run
method now whatever we put in this run
method is the code that's going to run
whenever we start our thread so in this
tutorial we're going to be building
three separate objects each of those
objects we're going to put on a separate
thread so we're going to have three
threads we're going to run them all at
once and see what happens pretty cool
huh so let's go ahead and each of our
objects which is also going to be on its
own thread is going to have a string
name and into time and random R equals
new random just because we want to give
it a random time never saying all right
not - that's what you're going to say
first gotcha
I imported random from Java util so you
know we don't have to make a separate
class right that's a built-in class
pretty cool way so now what do we want
to do for the constructor on public tuna
or whatever you name your class I first
want to give each object a name whenever
I create it so I'm going to pass in a
variable later on to give it a name so
that name is set to your parameter and I
also want to give it a time to sleep now
whenever you put a thread to sleep it
pretty much means do nothing just sit
there chill out hang on wait for
something else to happen so right we can
give it like a time manually like 50
milliseconds but we want to give it a
random time because you know we can so
are from our random object right here
dot next int and as a parameter for this
you write 999 and this is milliseconds
so now on your random time is anywhere
between 0 and 999 milliseconds which is
pretty much between 0 and 1 second I
mean close enough right all right so
outside of your constructor now we're
starting getting this one error and it
says dude you implement a runnable when
are you going to make this run method
all right we'll do it right now
so put public void run and it doesn't
need anything and it's a parameter and
go ahead it does need to try and catch
though so let's go ahead and get this
out of the way try catch exception E and
we don't need to put do anything for
exception but anyways whatever you put
in try remember
this run method gets called whenever you
start the thread so whenever you start
the thread this is the code that's
actually going to happen this is your
sweet spot right here so let's go ahead
and what do you want to actually do
system.out.print F and let's go ahead
and press for the format let's go ahead
and press % s is sleeping 4% D so we're
going to say the name is sleeping and
then we're going to say how long it's
sleeping for and after this we actually
need to put our thread to sleep so in
order to put threads to put thread dot
sleep and you don't need to name what
thread you're putting the sleep because
whenever you call run it automatically
knows that thread it's kind of like self
keyword so looks good right there
and we also need to put time in here as
a sleep parameter you put how long do
you want to sleep for I mean you could
put something like 40 or 12 seconds like
that actually it would be that but what
we're going to be doing is giving it
that random time to sleep for so that's
why that came in handy and after this we
just want to do system.out.print F one
more statement to make sure everything
went well maybe you should put out
instead of R that probably helped you
know just a little bit and let's just go
ahead and put all right house percent s
is done and for the parameter just put a
name so I know this might not make any
sense at all but in the next tutorial
when I put all this together you'll
actually see how to implement threads
and I'll be going over it one last time
to tie it all together and so it makes
sense to you
so stick around for the next tutorial
and I will see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
