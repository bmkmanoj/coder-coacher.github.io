place on tutorial and in this tutorial
I'm going to be teaching guys how to
make something called a list box and a
list box it's pretty much just a list
and it has the scroll arrow to the
up-and-down to the right of it it's kind
of like when you're filling out forms on
a website it says pick your state and
then it gives you that huge list that's
what this is so before we make a list
box we actually need a list and I'm
gonna name on my list so let's go ahead
and this doesn't have anything to do
with WX this is just a regular Python
list so let's populate a list of items
um let's say we're going the grocery
store and we need a grocery list so
we're gonna get beef tuna some coconuts
and stuff that run you should too more
beef and let's see a one other thing one
other thing or cereal and just put that
quotes that took me an awful long time
you think of cereal that's embarrassing
but anyways now let's get fun WX stuff
now in order to make a list box of this
box is pretty much a container to hold
your list so let's go ahead and name
that comment for a container and let's
go ahead and put WX doc list box and
let's go ahead and fill these parameters
in the first one is the parent which is
panel of course next one knot is the ID
which I'm gonna set the negative one you
can give any number you want next is a
position and put it somewhere like 20 20
10 10 30 30 not important after this is
the size of your list box and I'm gonna
make mine 80 by 60 tall and this should
be tall enough I don't want to make it
too taller you're not gonna be able to
see the arrows which I'm gonna show you
guys in a little bit after this you need
to write all right you got this
container
what list do you want to put in it well
we have this list right set up calling
my list so I'm gonna put that and that
is that let's see one two three four
fifth frame
and the six parameter is a style and
that's in this case I'm gonna use WX
period lb underscore single and this
means that you can only have a single
option selected at once so you can't
select tuna and more beef you can only
select the one so next we got our list
but there's one other thing I want to
teach you guys in order to set a default
selection you need to use the built-in
method set selection and then you can go
ahead and set your selection by default
and I'm gonna set mine to three and it's
gonna be zero one two three and it's
gonna be more beef is gonna be selected
by default and remember whenever you're
making lists sing with an array the
first value is zero and then it goes one
two three not one two three so that's
why more beef instead of coconuts is
going to have a default selection so
let's go ahead and run this hopefully we
don't get any airs and as you can see
more beef is selected and this is of
course a list box let me get this out of
the way and let me try one more time
there we go so again in order to make
this first we need a list and this is
you should know this if you know Python
next you need to make a list box object
I named mine for container no other
reason and a first panel position is
20/20 this is 80 by 60 tall Milas is
inside and look this wxl be single this
means that you can only select one of
these at once that's what you usually
want to have and of course the default
selection is just as soon as the program
starts up what value is selected by
default
so that's your quick tutorial on how to
make a list box play around with that
and hopefully when you learn this you're
ready to move on to my next tutorial so
thank you guys for watching and I'll see
you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
