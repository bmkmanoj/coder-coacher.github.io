art tutorial and in this video I want to
teach you guys how to create a matrix so
first of all what the heck is a matrix
beside you know the movie well what a
matrix is is it's similar to a data
frame but it has one exception you know
how a data frame or even an excel file
can have each column store a different
data type for example one column can be
names one column can be numbers another
column can be dates well with a matrix
the entire thing needs to be the same
type of data so it could be all
numerical it could be all text however
you're not going to see a lot of text
matrix matrices I think that's how you
say it because people typically just
store numbers in a matrix because you
can do a bunch of cool things to it
like we're going to see later on so I'm
going to shut up and I'm going to teach
you guys how to create one right now so
first like everything else just just
give it a name to store everything in
I'm just going to name it one and the
keyword it's created is who would have
guessed
matrix now this function is going to
take two pieces of information the first
piece of information is what numbers do
you want to use so typically what we're
going to do in the future is we're going
to be importing you know a list the
numbers from either a database or maybe
a HTML table or somewhere else but right
now let's just go ahead and use a simple
list of numbers one 200 just for an
example so that's the first piece of
information it needs the second piece is
how many rows do you want to break this
list into so in order to do that in row
stands for a number of rows and we'll
just go ahead and break this into ten
rows so again we're making a matrix with
the numbers 1 through 100 and it's going
to be broken into ten rows and of course
ten columns so in order to show that or
print out on the screen just go ahead
and type the name of it and run this bad
boy and as you can see in the console
ten rows ten columns
one two hundred all right so that was
you know kind of interesting but now I'm
scratching your head and you're thinking
all right
so what's the point of creating a matrix
when we could just create a data frame
well the cool thing that you could do
with matrix is actually when you have
more than one so let me go ahead and
create two similar matrices right now so
I'm going to create one matrix and let's
just set up ten numbers in each so 51 to
60 and we'll break them up into two rows
each and now I'm going to copy this
because I'm lazy and I'm going to name
the second one three now for this
example it doesn't really matter what
numbers you use but make sure that you
have the same number of items in each
matrix so let's just make this one like
61 to 70 or something so each of these
two and three actually I'll print memory
now so you guys can see two and three
each have ten items in them and also two
rows so why is this important well
whenever we have similar matrices check
this out
well typically what you're going to want
to do is you're going to want to test
that they're similar using di M now what
this does is it actually tell you tells
you the number of rows and columns in
each one so I should probably mention
that before we start doing anything cool
to them so if we do this right here it
says two rows five columns and as you
can see the matrices two and three are
similar so what do I keep talking about
this similar stuff for who cares if
they're similar or different well the
cool thing is when they are similar you
can perform equations on them what am I
talking about
so let me print these out again so you
guys can see the original ones and then
I want to show you guys something cool
say we want to take matrix two and
multiply it by matrix three well here's
our original 151 and here's our work
Suzumiya this is 2 and this is 3 and the
resulting matrix is essentially this 51
times 60 one equals three one one one
fifty five times sixty five equals three
five seven five and what it does is it
goes through every single element in the
matrix and it performs a certain
equation in a nice graphical order so
this is really useful whenever you're
working with a lot of data and you want
to perform an equation on a similar set
of data and this is just a really basic
example but remember this because we're
going to come back to this concept later
on so anyways thank you guys for
watching and in the next video what
we're going to be doing is I'm going to
be teaching you guys how to read CSV or
Excel data from your local computer and
from a file on the internet it's going
to be sweet so I'll see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
