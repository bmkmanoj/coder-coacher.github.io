another walk through this is my first
one for the left 4 dead 2 1 my favorite
games that I just got by the way and
this is for the streets if I didn't say
that before I can remember already and
what I'd like to do first is grabbed a
shotgun and go ahead and blast these uh
like I start on the zombies because
they're a lot infected outside and then
once I do go ahead and open the door and
you'll see a bunch of infected here
right I'm gonna come dombey's by the way
because I feel like it and go ahead and
glass those and your teammates will come
out and help you and once they're all
dead what I like to do is go run inside
and I like to reload again because after
you're done shooting on them you already
wasted like a tenth of your bullets so
go ahead the ammunition piles right
there and run to the right and once you
run to the right you gettin see what
these I really is a gun and yeah another
gun so I don't want to grab any of those
already got my primary shotgun that I'm
going to use it for the most of time so
go ahead and go up this little slope and
you'll find a bunch of more zombies up
here and go ahead and bless them and
there's usually a special infected at
the top so watch out for him probably a
tank which is I hate tanks are my least
favorite so go ahead and bless these
guys to write and once you're done
killing all these you're gonna want to
run down there and there's a door to the
right hand side that you're gonna have
to go down is actually building but for
now clear out this area right here blow
that guy's head up and right there and I
usually like that going that like to go
in that little tent
oh I don't like that sound that uh
that's tank so let's go ahead and shoot
that girl all right yeah see if I can
kill this guy real quick thanks for help
teammates I owe you one and yeah just
just pummel me it feels good and yeah
I'm going to be destroyed by this thing
and
see rip my head off so what's the zombie
curb stomping me so all right Ellis is
reviving me and I'm probably going to
need to use my health pack to heal
myself Oh Nick you're one of a kind guy
you're healing me so then I don't have
to use my health back sucka see if i'll
use it on you I'm all so let's go ahead
and run down this little soap and like I
said there's going to be a room to the
right hand side that you're going to
need to go in after this let me scratch
my ear real quick ah I felt good so let
me wait for my teammates open this door
and there sometime is a witch a witch is
in there and you shouldn't stalder
startled her so go ahead and bless this
because there's no witch in there any
time you come across a witch she's only
going to attack you if you like make
loud noises around or shoot her or
anything like that so try not to do that
and if you find another shotgun go ahead
and grab that um go ahead and bless
these guys and once you clear out this
area and don't forget to check behind
you um you're going to need to go
through this area to the left and then
you're going to need to take a quick
right and climb up a dumpster and I'm
probably not going to have time in this
Walker to show you guys so let me just a
clean house a little bit and that's the
one thing i don't like about the shotgun
it has power and it has good you don't
have to be too specific one game but
takes forever to reload and by the way
if you have a bio bomb you're gonna need
to use it in like one minute so hold on
to that i got the perfect area for you
to use it so let's go ahead and get this
jockey or whatever and that's probably
it for this tutorial

do so thank you don't forget subscribe
