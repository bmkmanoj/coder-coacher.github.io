slash on live gamer for the new Boston
and in this tutorial we're going to be
taking a more in-depth look at message
boxes now if you remember from two
tutorials ago we did the windows forms
hello world and in that we used a
message box now I'm going to show you
some more stuff that you can do with a
message box so let's go ahead and create
a new project here we will select a
windows forms application we will call
it message boxes and we will just go
ahead and click OK now we'll wait for
that to load and we'll go ahead and
shrink it down a bit and let's come up
here to our tool box and we will add a
button now we will just make the button
a bit bigger or here let's go ahead and
just do this let's go ahead and dock it
and make it fill the whole screen ok so
let's set the text value for this button
to show message box and it will change
the name to button show message okay so
now that we've designed a little window
here we'll go ahead and double click on
show message we'll get the toolbox out
of the way here and zoom in some
necklace here is that we have our sub
button show message underscore click so
now this is going to run whenever they
click the button so let's go ahead and
type message box dot show and we'll type
this is a bear message box so that is
the message box show that uses one
argument in the parameters now we can
use the message box dot show that uses
two arguments in the parameters now in
the first one the
the single argument in here is the
message that's going to show in the
message box and there is no title to it
so we'll make another one and we'll say
this message has a title we'll add a
comma and we'll go on to our second
argument which is the caption and we'll
just set the caption to title now we'll
create a third message box this message
box will say we'll do message box show
this has an icon we'll go on to our
second argument set it to title or here
comma we'll set our second argument to
title and then now we have a third
argument and you can see here that it
says buttons as system not windows form
stop message box buttons now we're going
to select we're going to go ahead and
type message box and you can see here
down in intellisense we've got message
box buttons okay message box buttons
that okay cancel we got retry cancel we
got yes no and yes no cancel we're just
going to go ahead and go with okay and
now we'll add another comma and what we
do here is we set the icon and its icon
as system windows forms dot message box
icon so we'll just type message box icon
dot information okay so now if we run
this you can see you see here is our
form 1 and if we go ahead and click on
this you can see we get one message box
that says this is a bear message box and
I can see that this is the only message
box that has opened up and when we call
more than one message box after each
other it's going to wait for the first
one to close and then it's going to open
the next one so this is a bear message
box and then when we click OK it's going
to open up the second one and it says
this message box has a title and you can
see right there that it says title
and now the third one it says this has
an icon and it's got our information
icon and you probably didn't hear it but
coming from my speakers there was the
windows default information sound now if
you set it to error you're going to get
the error sound you could say you set
the warning you're gonna get the warning
sound now just click OK there and we'll
go ahead and exit out of our program and
now here's one more thing I wanted to
cover with message boxes that the dotnet
the people who created a Visual Basic
added just to help developers out a
little bit so instead of having to type
message box show which may take a while
you can just type message box and then
your parameters and I can see if we go
ahead and run this let's go ahead and
add a message for this will just type
message okay so now if we go ahead and
run this we're going to click so show
message box we got there the one with
the title the one with the icon and if
we click OK we get another one that says
message and you can see that the default
title is message boxes so whenever you
type the shorthand version of showing a
message box the title is automatically
going to be set to message boxes unless
you override that by using the argument
okay so now that you guys have seen a
look at message boxes you can go ahead
and make programs that will show message
message boxes when the user clicks on
certain things and once you've got that
nailed down and you're not going to
forget it go ahead and move on to the
next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
