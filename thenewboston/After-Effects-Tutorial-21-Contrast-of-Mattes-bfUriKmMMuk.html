Effects tutorial and in this tutorial
I'm gonna show you guys how to use
something called the invert effect of a
mat and also how to play around with the
contrast of your mat to make it just how
you want it now in the last tutorial I
showed you guys how you can use just
simple like black and white images or
black and white text but I didn't tell
you guys that you can actually use any
picture you want to create a mat so for
example you can have this picture of a
flower right here and what this does is
the same thing as last time but it takes
all these uh black and whites or shades
of gray to create a map so let's go
ahead and in the last tutorial I showed
you guys how to make a basic mat like
this but now I want to show you guys
that you can also make an invert mat by
going down here and press luma inverted
mat and what this does is instead of
only showing what's inside the flower it
shows what's outside the flower so just
like masking you can also do inverts of
mat to instead of just only showing
what's inside show its outside now for
what I'm gonna do next I wanna show you
guys just regular the regular mat
without the invert so anytime you're
looking at this man and this is a flower
in this case you see that you see the
shades of grey right here and some are
black some are white some are
see-through but you're saying alright
I want this flower but I don't want to
have this black right here or I want the
little details to stand out more what do
I do to do that well anytime you want to
work with the the contrast of the mat
what you need to do is select your mat
right there and you can either have this
eyeball checked to show the full picture
or on track to show the mat and but more
importantly make sure your layer is
selected and go to effects and then you
need to go to color correction and then
after color correction you need to go to
levels and this will give you the gray
levels of your men
- arrows you want to be working with the
most are this arrow right here this
black one this is the gray one you don't
want to use that a whole lot in this
white one right here so again this black
one and this gray one what the black one
does when you move this is it takes all
of the dark gray pick I mean pixels and
moves them into black so this brings out
the detail more as you can see in my
picture all of the black lines are
getting darker and it's just showing
with detail more so anytime you want to
show more detail in your mat just slide
this and anytime you want to show less
detail what this white little triangle
does just take the light gray pixels and
change them all completely to white so
if you move it you see all those black
pixels slowly change the white so this
gives you a more basic outline so now
you can see if I move it almost all the
way none of the black pixels or no
detail is showing just a huge outline so
if I want to say add a little more
detail than I want to take this black
slider and change all my dark gray
pixels the black and this brings out the
black contrast of your man so that's
pretty much it for this tutorial I just
want to show you guys how to use the
invert effect and also how to use the
contrast of map to get your mat just how
you like it
so thank you for watching in my next
story I'm gonna be showing you more cool
stuff that you can do with mats but for
now that's that so thank you guys for
watching and don't forget to subscribe
and I'll see you next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
