Effects cs6 tutorial
I'm your host buddy Blackford and I
figured that since we're working on all
these different projects you might want
to make them look cool with a nice color
scheme but maybe you haven't gone to
school or read about how color theory or
any of that stuff works and how colors
kind of go well with each other
so I'm going to show you a website real
quick and it's going to have a bunch of
pre-made color palettes for us to use
that will be helpful when you're making
your project and trying to make it look
nice so I'm going to bring up the
website here and it's called Adobe
cooler now you can it'll start up on
this page where you can create your own
types of different what do they call
color themes but if you don't want to
waste time and try to figure out a color
theme you can come to this Explorer
right here and people have created all
these different ones for you you want to
come down to either most used or most
popular and these are the ones that work
really well so if we go and take like
click on this frenzy one for renze it
brings us to this page now you can't
save this it's going to bring it up as a
web page and that's something that's
kind of annoying within this cooler they
want you to try to use it with a Adobe
and integrate it but I honestly haven't
figured out how to integrate it into
After Effects yet when you download it
what you have to sign in and sign up and
everything like that that's always
annoying when you download it it gives
you this a ASAE file which I know that
in cs5 I used to be able to just enable
the cooler extension but I can't figure
it out in this one so what I'd like to
do is just a take a print screen so I'm
going to hit print screen on my keyboard
and then I'm going to open up Photoshop
and I'm going to go file new and when
you hit print screen in Photoshop it
just brings up a brand new brand new
document I guess with your dimensions of
your screen and I have double monitors
so it's going to be extra wide so I'm
going to hit OK and then this is going
to pop up I'm going to hit edit paste
and here we go
I'm going to use my crop tool here and
just click inside these and press Enter
the crop tool is over here on the Left
it's been selected already and then I'm
just going to save this and we can just
save it as a JPEG that's fine and a
color scheme is just all we want to say
right now and save it put it at maximum
hit OK and close out a Photoshop and
close out of this website now I'm going
to import that image file import color
scheme and let's just drop drop it onto
our table here and we can always refer
to this and I'll just make it small and
put it up here in the corner kind of
like how an artist uses a I got a little
thing in there somehow kind of like how
an artist uses like a paint palette and
he can dip his brush in we can always
pick from these color palettes here so
I've got this a solid here and I'll make
it smaller and I'll create another solid
solid - I don't know how to spell today
apparently so anytime you get to pick a
color there's this dropper here if you
click on it I can move over here to this
dropper and just click hit OK and
there's my new color so that's that's
easy enough it's a pretty basic quick
and you can just get it done and always
have this available for you up here now
you could also pick your color without
having to put this swatch up here but I
feel like having this little smaller one
up here is a little better but I can
bring over the website here it's going
to be on my double monitor here and it's
kind of annoying having this in the way
so it's going to be over here on my
other monitor if you have another
monitor I can go to layer solid settings
click on my dropper tool and bring it
over onto the other monitor and you can
see that it's changing so that's the
benefit of having two monitors if I try
to do it in within here it's going to go
away so I mean it's not something that
you can do with just one monitor unless
you like minimize after effects which is
basically annoying so don't do that
we'll just stick with the way that I
showed you for now and then if I ever
figure out how to get the extensions in
there which I can't really seem to find
anything on I'll let you know and make
another tutorial about it but stick with
this for now as a way to pick your
different colors so that's a quick tip
there to make things look even more cool
so I'll see you later on in another
tutorial have a good one everybody</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
