video it's going to be an awesome one
going to talk to you guys about filters
now a filter as I'm sure you could have
guessed is a way that you can filter out
your packets because whenever you start
capturing packets okay there's a ton of
crap here 99% of this you know you
usually don't care about you know you
don't care about all the UDP or you know
even most of the TCP traffic maybe
you're just looking at what websites
your kids go to so we need to figure out
how to filter out all the extra crap and
we just want to focus on the good stuff
now before I start showing you guys all
the cool commands and how you can filter
I need to talk to you about one thing
and that's the different types of
filters so there are two different types
of filters one is a display filter and
one is a capture filter so the display
filters are right here and if you go to
capture options then your capture
filters are right there now I'll explain
the difference right now so this data
that you're looking at is about 10
seconds before this tutorial started I
just went on Chrome and I went to like
paste thin and nhl.com and like a couple
different sites so this is all the
traffic but it also includes you know
other stuff like UDP other TCP traffic
and you know just a bunch of stuff in
the background so if all of my results
are here all the packet and I just want
to filter them out then I could throw
something in here like HTTP and hit
apply and now it's gonna take all of
those results and find only the HTTP
packets and display them to me all right
that's a display filter that was pretty
easy to understand so what the heck is a
capture filter so if I said okay I'm
gonna filter this by HTTP my capture
then that would mean during my capture
while I was listening for traffic it
wouldn't even log any of this other
stuff except HTTP so
caPSURE filter is what do you want to
log in your display filter is of all
your stuff what do you want to see and
that's kind of confuses a lot of people
sometimes because they're okay I uh you
know I have no filters in here but for
some reason I'm not seeing any UDP
traffic and that's because if you go to
your capture options back yeah um you
actually never even logged any you to be
traffic so I just want to point out that
this filter and this filter are
different what you log in what you see
in your results so with that being said
let's go ahead and figure out how to use
these filters so they're already a
couple built-in ones and if you just
click this filter button on the left
then you can see some of the most common
ones so let's say that we only want to
see um I don't know let's see HTTP we'll
keep it real simple so I'm going to hit
apply and hit OK so okay that's
interesting but I actually want to
change that maybe I only want to see you
know everything but DNS so I'm going to
hit apply and hit OK
so now I'm looking at every single
packet except if it's DNS related so
this is one way to do it to get some of
your common ones and you can also just
type it in manually so actually let me
pull up one of the other ones actually
Oh like this and show you guys at the
hard way I guess so if you're ever
looking through and you're like ok I
want to filter this out but it isn't in
the common filters I need to write my
own it's probably going to be a pain but
probably real complicated well it's
actually pretty simple
so say let's just do something really
easy let's uh all right let's get the
get request so I only want to look at
HTTP but not all HTTP traffic not posts
not delete not update I only want to
look at the get HTTP traffic so what I
can do is this if you go to http and by
the way whenever you're typing
is not a valid filter then it's going to
be displayed in a red so like if I try
to filter by H what the heck does that
mean it doesn't mean anything however
whenever your filter is valid and it's
actually going to work then it's going
to light up in green so that way it's
pretty cool indicator bike you don't
have to guess if your filter is legit or
valid or not it tells you right in a
lifetime so in order to filter out
traffic by git I'm going to go to HTTP
request and I'm too lazy to type it so
request hit enter and then of course we
want to filter out by method and the
method we want to equal get so now this
is going to do is it's going to look
through all my results in whenever I hit
apply it's only going to show me the get
traffic so look at that looking
beautiful so if you ever just want to
clear it then go ahead and hit clear and
if you click this little button
expression then you can see that these
are all of the different types of
filters that you can have so you can
filter your packets out by a lot of
different methods and if you just start
typing like HTTP then you'll pop down to
HTTP so you don't actually have to
scroll now in that example that I just
typed out we saw that we can use this
operator equals equals and that means is
the method exactly equal to get and
these operators they don't apply you
know to every filter so you can't be
like arm filter the protocol if it's
greater than you know HTTP location that
doesn't make sense so the ones that are
greater than and less than you might
want to say like the length for example
with some numerical data so if the
length of this is bigger than a thousand
then you might want to filter it that
way but you know I just want to point
out that these relations they're just
not like all encompassing you have to
actually use them in a smart kind of way
so another thing that people can do is
they can actually combined filters
so say that I wanted to search for um
get right here and by the way that I
even point this out that this is your
little history so it's kind of like um
you know kind of like a browser in a
sense where you click this and all the
previous filters will pop up right like
that so save that I wanted a filter my
packets out by git and I also wanted to
look at the post so what I can do is I
can surround this with parentheses and
if you guys are familiar with
programming then this is going to be
like second nature
so the or command is if you hold down
shift above the enter on your keyboard
use two of those little up and down
lines they're called pipe symbols I
think and now will write post right here
so this is saying is show me all of the
packets that use get or post so I'm
going to hit apply and now all I don't
even know if I have any post traffic
here but if I did then it would show the
post traffic as well now if you ever
want to use and then what it's going to
do is it's going to look at two
parameters so this isn't going to make
sense because you can't have a packet
that is both get and post
so just remember it this way whenever
you want to use multiple conditions you
can use pipe pipe which means or or
ampersand ampersand which means and if
you use or then if any of these
conditions are true then it will display
so if this one is true even if all the
other ones are false then it's going to
show that packet with two ampersands
what this means is every condition that
you have listed it needs to be true so
whenever I hit apply of course since a
packet can't possibly have get in post
and that's why that doesn't show up but
let's say that you only wanted to show
get packets that were like had a length
longer than 200 so that would be one
where you would need to apply both
conditions
anyways that's the basics of filters and
some of this other stuff is pretty easy
you can save your filters if you have
one that you use a lot but you usually
just use the built-in ones if I can get
this right there or you just type your
own in real time at least that's what I
do but whatever you guys wanted to do
you know follow your heart there you go
thank you for watching see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
