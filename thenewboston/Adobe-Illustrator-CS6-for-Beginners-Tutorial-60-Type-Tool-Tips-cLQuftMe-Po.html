awesome two Illustrator cs6 tutorials
and this tutorial we're gonna go a
little bit further into our typing tools
I'm gonna give you a couple pointers and
tips about using some of the different
tools so I'm just gonna go ahead and
just delete out some of the stuff that
we had and start new so the first one I
want to start with is the regular type
tool but the first thing I want to show
you is that if you click on this arrow
over here you can get a detachable menu
for your type tool and then if you click
back on this it'll go up and down or you
can click on the X just get rid of it
but you still have all your type tools
here it they don't detach per se but it
gives you a detachable menu so you'll
still have both of them there so let's
go ahead and click on your regular type
tool now with some of your type tools if
you click and drag you'll create a text
box and you can go ahead and experiment
with them and I can't remember off the
top of my head which ones have all the
have the text boxes and which was one of
them's don't Wow that was hard for me to
say for some reason but I do know that
this one does have a text box so let's
go ahead and start typing within text
box I'm gonna create a new one and here
we go and here's some type Wow my
keyboard is like off so if you press
ENTER it'll go down on some spaces so
you can create a new line alright and if
you want to be able to have your type
tool is selected and still create other
new typing things all you got to do is
hold down ctrl and
click outside the object and go ahead
and click again hope I clicked in a an
old text box that the head so control
click off the object and then go ahead
and click again and then you'll have
your new line now I have my old text box
back here that that I created the first
time as you can see if I move it it
doesn't move this text but here as you
can see there so that's what happened
when I selected that text box I'm just
gonna go ahead and delete it out if
there's any other text boxes in here no
it doesn't look like there is but when
you have the text box
it still is still there and when you go
ahead to click in the area or on the
text if there's text in it then it's
gonna show up all right let's get on to
the next so say you're in have a text
box going on go ahead and make one and
it's way too small for the text that you
wanted to put in there this little box
here with a plus sign shows up go ahead
take your direct selection tool and you
can click on one of your anchors and
drag it out like one at a time like this
if you want to I just hit control Z to
go backwards or you can just go ahead
and select your regular selection tool
and do something like maybe like drag it
out and as you can see the longer you go
the less amount of text you'll have on
the same line and that's pretty nice so
onto the next thing so the next trick
allows you to be able to use your
vertical and horizontal type tools
without having to switch the actual tool
so make sure you have your type tool
selected and when you go to click you
can see that the cursor is up and down
if I hold down shift you can see that
the cursor now goes sideways
and if I click now I'm gonna get a
flashing space I'm not actually sure
what that flashing a little bar is
called but it indicates that you're
typing text if I started typing you can
see it's a vertical text now so a way to
switch between these is holding down
shift when you're typing so let me go to
the vertical text to our vertical type
tool and if I hold down shift it's gonna
switch it to horizontal to easy and it
helps you get through things way faster
without having to switch between the
different tools so that's all I've got
for this tutorial teaching some of the
different techniques that you can use
that may not be apparent when you're
using the type tools is what we did and
I'll get into some of the other tools
these went a little over the time limit
that I thought we have about five
minutes per video so I look forward to
seeing you guys in the next video we're
going to talk about some of the other
type tools that we learned and I'll go
give you a couple of tips about those as
well I have a good one everyone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
