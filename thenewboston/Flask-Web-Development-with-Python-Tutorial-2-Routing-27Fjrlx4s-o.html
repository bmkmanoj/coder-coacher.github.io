video I want to explain all about
routing what it is in how we can use it
on our website so the way that we can
route is through the use of a decorator
and I added a little comment right here
and if you guys don't know a decorator
is whenever you have a function and you
see an @ symbol and then something after
it this is a decorator it's basically a
way that you can wrap up an existing
Python function and modify its behavior
in some kind of way
now with flask we use this to basically
route or map a URL to a return value so
mapping routing tomato tomahto what the
heck does all this mean basically all
we're doing with a complex terminology
out of the way is we're connecting a URL
to the return value of a function
so whenever a user requests this URL the
response from the server is going to be
whatever this return value is right
there
that's all we're doing and just to show
you guys one more example that's going
to make a lot more sense is let's say
that we want to make another page aside
from the home page and we'll just call
it like a tuna or something so where I
at App route and in here we just write
tuna so whenever the user goes to the
page and it's usually going to be our
URL like the New Boston comm slash tuna
what we want to do is we just want to
make a function under here and we can
just return anything we want now
remember what we write in here is the
return value does that mean that you can
actually write HTML in here well yes it
does so check this out let's just write
on like a heading to an alright tuna is
good heading to right there so now let's
just go ahead and run this and let me
pop this up in re so there's our home
page and now let me go ahead and write
the tuna so there you go
this is what we requested a server give
me the tuna page and it said ok
me check what happens whenever you do
that don't I don't oh look at this
you requested tuna and I'm going to run
this function right under me and you're
going to get this response so that's why
we saw a tuna is good in heading two and
there are better ways to actually
include HTML what we're going to be
doing eventually is making like an HTML
template and then passing in whatever
values we need but it's going to be I
don't know it's not going to make a lot
of sense if I just try to explain it
right now so one last thing that I
actually do want to explain in this
video is how we can use variables so
basically let's say that we're setting
up our web page right here and we had
like a profile section so we had I don't
know like user Bucky or we could have
user um Emily or we could have user Ava
basically we need part of this URL to be
a variable and depending on that
variable the content changes so it might
say hello Bucky hello Ava depending on
whatever we passed in right there so
what we're going to do now is we're
going to route and we'd say I'm a
profile slash user name all right so all
right def profile now inside here I'm
just going to write user name so
basically any time you want to make a
variable in your URL what you need to do
is you need to put it in between angle
brackets so user name and then we need
to pass it in just like we're passing in
any old you know just a regular Python
function just pass in variable as a
parameter and then we can return
whatever we want Wow cannot type so
return is of course whatever displays on
the screen aka the server's response and
I'll just write hey there
sent us
and then this will be user name right
like that so basically from the URL what
we're essentially doing is just calling
a function this function down here and
we're going to pass in user name for
whatever is in the URL so if they type
in Emily it's going to say hey there
Emily if they type in Bucky is going to
say hey there Bucky and let me make sure
that I restart this and check it out so
what I do profile and I'll write like
out Bucky and it says hey there Bucky
and let me bump this up so you guys can
see it got a heading to run this restart
but about a bing bada boom bada bing
check it out art so says hey there Bucky
and what if we're making um a buzz
profile it would say hey there Ava and
we aren't just limited to text in you
know writing out their name we can do
this with a bunch of different things
and we actually aren't even just limited
as strings we can use integers and I'll
show you guys how you can pass a list
into your template or HTML but uh let me
show you guys real quick how to use
integers because there's a kind of weird
thing that you need to look out for so
whenever you just want to use basic
strings letters like people's names and
stuff like that you can just do this
however let's say that you're making arm
like the stream like the news feed and
you just want to single out a single
post while you identify a post by its ID
number so that's not a string it's
actually an int so whenever you're just
using strings you don't need to write
the datatype but whenever you use an int
you do so we'll just name this post ID
or this could be like someone's age or
employee ID number whatever and post
right here and remember whatever the
variable name is that's the same one we
want to pass into the function so then
I'll just write something like a post ID
is whatever post ID looking good and
this doesn't
actually have to be the same name you
can actually write show post or whatever
so now let me restart this and go to
post and remember what our web server is
expecting is an INT an integer value so
I'll just write like 23 whatever so post
ID is 23 um you know 53 8 4 or 5 7 there
you go so in this tutorial what did we
learn we learned that you can make
multiple web pages for your app or your
website using routing pretty much tying
together a URL with a return value of a
function and we also learned that you
can use variables in your your URL so
anytime you just want to use a plain
string you don't need to do anything
special but anytime you want to use a
different data type then you actually
need to specify it because by default it
just expects the string if you give it
something else in my flip-out so there
you go still a lot of stuff to cover but
hey we're getting there this is turning
out to be you know a lot easier then I'm
sure a lot of you guys probably thought
so I'm gonna go eat my lasagna now and
I'll see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
