tutorial that I'm making for the new
Boston and in this tutorial I'm gonna be
showing you how to use the directory
class just a little bit more so all
you're gonna need for this tutorial is a
button and once you have that on your
form just double click on it so right
here we have a folder browser dialog and
we also have an if statement checking to
see if you just selects a folder in the
folder browser dialog also you're going
to be using the namespace system Daioh
because the directory class in there so
once you have this code just type out
the directory class inside of the if
statement and then use a dot operator to
access all of the methods inside the
class so the first method that we're
going to be looking at is the create
directory and the create directory will
just create a directory or a folder so
we're going to need to have a path to
the directory that they want to create
so we're going to use the path that user
selects in the folder browser dialog now
not only do we need the path to where to
create the folder we also need um what
we're going to name the folder and in
order to name the folder which can use
mom we're just have to add on to this
string on the location of the folder we
want to create so if we wanted to name
our folder like I don't know Adam then
we have to do on plus and then we want
to do um - I guess backslashes I don't
know and you have to put two of these
here because a single backslash will on
tell c-sharp to ignore this quote so you
could have quotes inside of strength so
we're going to have to have two
backslashes to cancel it out and then
we're going to want to give a name to
our folder I'm just going to call it
Adam so what this will do is it will add
on this string to the end of our
directory so if we had like on like C
slash users slash Adam slash desktop and
then slash test folder and then slash
Adam what that will do is that will tell
it to create a folder called Adam inside
of the test
so now one debug and click a button you
click this button right here we get a
folder browser dialog now we're just
going to create another folder inside of
this test folder right here click OK and
you should have another folder inside of
the test folder called atom checker here
yep me now the folder called atom and
like I said before this will just add it
on this atom to whatever folder that we
already selected so if we wanted to
create another folder called atom inside
of this folder one we can do that we'll
just do button 1 let's select this
folder one right here click OK and now
inside a folder 1 you should have a
folder called atom
yep right there test folder folder one
atom go back click folder 1 if a folder
called atom inside of it the next thing
I'm going to show you how to do is how
to move directories so all you're going
to want to do is do move and then first
you just going to put it says right here
on the source directory name or the path
of the file or directory to move so if
you wanted to move this folder called
atom that we just created we can do that
so we're going to give the path to the
folder they want to move and we're just
going to have it be the folder that we
selecting the folder browser dialog and
then the second parameter that we have
to pass through here is the path to the
file that wanted to move to so if we
wanted to move it to inside this Dover
folder to here we would have to tell it
to move it to there so what we're going
to do is we're just going to create on
we're going to have it written type out
the string so it's just going to be C
slash and then whatever you're using
here actually C slash users and then
slash whatever easier you're on like if
your user account is like I don't know
mine's Adam and then you're gonna want
to put another slash and then to
wherever your folder that you want to
move is and mine is inside of my desktop
and then called test folder and then
there's a folder inside of that called a
folder too so
so we're going to have to type out a lot
here but it's been Def Con men slash
test folder and it was spacing and then
slash older too so and then what it will
do is it will move whatever folder we
have selected in the folder browser
dialog to this folder to directory
however we're not done yet we also have
to give a name to this folder that we're
now moving and since the folder that
we're moving is called Adam we're just
going to call it Adam so what it will do
is it will move the folder this folder
right here into this folder so now let's
go into debug select the folder that we
want to move I'm just going to move this
Adam folder and it should move it into
folder to okay now when we go in here
click folder two we see that Adam folder
is not inside of this test folder
anymore yep it's now inside of this
folder too and the final thing that I'm
going to show you how to do is how to
delete a folder so we're just going to
do dot elite to access the delete method
and then we're just going to provide the
path to the folder the one of the levy
and that's just going to be whatever
folder you select enough older browser
dialog so now click this button and get
our folder browser dialog we browse to a
folder that we want to delete I'm just
going to delete this Adam folder right
here click OK the Adam folder should no
longer be there anymore
now if we go on to my desktop get to
that test folder key now yep we don't
have that Adam folder anymore so that's
it for this tutorial and that's it for
the directory class so see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
