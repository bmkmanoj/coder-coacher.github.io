is you want to sanitize everything so go
ahead and first of all get your siphon
and what I'd like to do with the siphon
is I like the hook the hose up to it and
pump it a couple times because then the
inside of everything gets sanitized and
of course we're going to be putting beer
through this so it's very important so
once you give it a couple pumps just go
ahead and Smurfs at all in the liquid
and you can also get your other hose and
this is the hose that goes from the
bucket to the bottles whenever we fill
it up so just go ahead and put that in
too and a lot of people like to sanitize
these bottles one by one not sure why
but what I like to do is I just like to
go ahead and throw them all in my
sanitizer and make sure you fill them up
so they sink the body now after that you
need to go ahead and sanitize your
bottle filler right there let's go ahead
and set that in now what I like to do
whenever I'm sanitizing is I actually
like to take bottle caps right here and
also some people actually sanitize this
whole capper won't really hurt anything
it shouldn't really affect it if you
don't sanitize it because it only
presses on the top of the bottle caps
but it can be safe to go ahead and same
time it anyways and with the bottle cap
I don't like to throw them in here
because then whenever you're grabbing
each one you have to fish them all out
so what I like to do with these is I
like to get a separate Bowl and just go
ahead and fill it up with some sanitizer
and that makes it easier whenever you're
searching for them all have to grab it
one by one and the last thing that you
need to do is you need to go ahead and
sanitize your spigot and bucket so go
ahead throw that right in there and also
your bucket and once that's done you
need to go ahead into some assemble the
stick it on the bucket and then you can
go ahead and fill it up with some
sanitizer and make
doesn't leak and once you have your
bucket and also the spigot sanitized you
can go ahead and so simple then and it's
better if you go ahead and test this
with sanitizer first first of all you
want to make sure it doesn't leak in
second of all if you don't know which
way is open and closed on the spigot
it's good to find that out of sanitizer
before you go ahead and spill beer all
over your floor
so after sanitizing everything what we
can do now is prepare the priming
solution it's kind of a tongue twister
prepare the priming solution anyways go
ahead and take your sugar and pour it in
a pot and also take your 16 ounces of
water go ahead and dump that into and
then go ahead and bring this to a boil
now once it's boiling we only want it to
boil for about two or three minutes just
so all the sugar is dissolved in the
water</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
