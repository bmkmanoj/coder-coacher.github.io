tutorial and in this video I want to
teach you guys how to install a package
now what a package is is it's actually
all this crap if you go to your packages
tab you can see that you have a huge
list of these things called packages so
what the eff is a package what it is is
it's basically a bunch of code that
someone wrote for you and what you can
do is you can download and install it on
your computer and then once you have it
installed you can use all those
functions so for example let me go ahead
and show you guys an example right now
so say that what we wanted to do was we
want to take all the information on a
table from a website and we wanted to
read it or convert it into a data frame
so we could use in our program well
actually there's a function for that so
if you make a object called items what
you could do is you could use a function
called
read HTML table and the using my
semicolons like I'm programming PHP or
something by anyways when you use this
function it takes two pieces of
information the first piece of
information is where is that URL well
it's right here so you give it the URL
of the website where the table is out of
course it needs that and the second
piece of information that you should
always use is which now
what this keyword means is whenever
there are multiple tables on a web page
then it could say for example I put
which equals one it means the first
table so if there are three other tables
it says don't get the second one don't
get the third one get the first one so
that's what that keyword means so now
what we can do is we can go ahead and I
don't know maybe we won't only wanted to
pronounce the head of it so print out
the head of it doot-doot going to run
this wait a minute okay it says it's not
working but I know that this is a
function in R so let's read this one
more time okay
cannot find the function or read HTML
table and the
reason that it can't find this is
because we don't have that package
installed this function the read HTML
table is indeed a function but it is in
this XML package so what we need to do
is we need to install this particular
package so if you click install what you
can do and I already have this installed
on my computer but this is how you would
install it you start typing the name of
the package and you can just use
autofill Oregon type the hole name if
you want but you pretty much type the
name of the package that you want and
then you click install and as you can
see it says installing lalala it does
its thing package XML successfully
unpacked and check again it might be a
little different for you since I already
installed it but that is all you have to
do it is now installed on your computer
so any functions that are inside that
package you can use now before you use
this package you need to do one thing
what you need to do is you say hey are
we're going to require you to load in a
package XML and what this line is
essentially going to do it says ok we
loaded this package now we can use the
functions so now whenever you run this
it loads it right here and now that we
have that function available check it
out all this data or this data that was
from the website we automatically stole
or well we didn't really steal it we got
it
and we read it into our pretty frickin
awesome
so anyways I wanted to make it swirl on
how to install and download packages
turns out it's incredibly easy but now
you guys also now know how to read HTML
tables from a website so a little bonus
for you guys thank you guys for watching
and now well I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
