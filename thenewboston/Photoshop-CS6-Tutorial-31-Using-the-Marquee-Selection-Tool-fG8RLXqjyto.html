name is buddy Blackford and this is
another Photoshop cs6 tutorial we're
going to be going over the marquee
selection tools which is in the top
right of your tools or at the very top
if you have the long the long set of
tools instead of the ones that are next
to each other so let's get started and
within the selection tools you got the
rectangular marquee elliptical marquee
and then the single row on single column
marquee tools so let's go ahead and use
the rectangular marquee tool now what
this does is it creates a rectangular or
square selection that you can use to
edit different parts of your of your
photo so what you need to do is click
and drag and you can create put my Monda
make sure make sure you're at this
button right here is pressed where it
says normal or new and then make sure
your style is normal they were a bit
messed up from a different project I was
working on but make sure it's like that
so normal and this first option right
here now click and drag and you can
create a free-form square or rectangle
going on here now if you hold shift down
it will create a perfect square for you
and when you release it creates your
selection now with this selection you
can do a bunch of different things to it
you can change the color by using the
Paint Bucket you could move it around
using your move tool so that section of
square that we got there and you can do
do a few things to it when you have the
move tool selected you're able to move
the resize and everything like that
resize that section so you can also
press delete and like delete that
section out so if I had to know
cancel cancel that don't apply if I have
the marquee selection and I press Delete
it'll delete it right out conversely you
can take the you can take the move tool
I'll just move it off the screen if you
want but that's up to you
so we've got a few options here we've
got the new which is this first one here
new selection we've got add test
selection if I click on that and then I
add our intersect these it's going to
add to the selection that I already have
or F you're just out here it's just
going to have another separate box for
you then you can hit delete and then
they all delete it hit control Z to go
back and then I can hit control D to
remove my selection so that I have
nothing selected so I'm going to create
a new box and then the next one we have
is subtract so I could come in here and
then sum this area would be subtracted
so if I want to move this you can see
that square is still in the middle which
is nice you can create some cool looking
designs doing that
so the next one over we have is
intersect anything that intersects here
is going to be kept so instead of
cutting out that section it's going to
keep whatever section intersected with
your selection so this little area right
here should be what is selected yep and
it is it ctrl D to deselect and we got
our feather over here and let's make
sure we're on a new selection we got our
feather here and if I increased that to
something say like a hundred pixels draw
out my mask or on my selection you can
see that because there's a feather that
the selection is now a little rounded if
I hit delete you can see that the
selection is definitely feathered off
and it goes off by a hundred pixels
because that's what I typed in now if I
make a selection and I want it to be a
lot more like five hundred pixels you'll
see how the shape looks a lot different
now it looks like a circle because it's
so feathered off and that's what you get
all right there
so let's put this back to zero and then
I'll make a new selection we've got our
different styles going on here and the
normal is just what we've been doing it
allows you to create freeform shapes
that stay within like the square or
rectangle so it lets you create freeform
square rectangles to weather whatever
height and width that you want now we've
got the fixed ratio here and the fixed
ratio allows you to input a width and a
height and then it will stay the
selection that you make will stay within
that ratio so I can
I can't freeform this I'm moving my
mouse around all over and it just only
allowing me to stay at a 16 by 9 ratio
so eventually if I drag this out I could
get to 16 by 9 inches so let me do it
from the top and there it is about there
so that's how the fixed ratio works and
we've got fixed size now you can make
this let's do like 500 by 500 maybe 500
by 200 was try that and then I click and
it creates a 500 by 200 pixels square
now I can't click and drag or anything
like that because it's just a fixed size
so go to normal and I wanted to show you
something else that's pretty cool so
there is another thing that I want to
show you guys that it's pretty sweet
you can create your selection from the
center of where your cursor was if you
click and then you hold down alt and
drag right click and start dragging and
you hold down alt it'll create the
selection from the center instead of
dragging it from the corner so that's
pretty pretty helpful if you want to
start in the middle of your document or
something like that
so let's see what else there is to talk
about let's go to the next tool which is
the elliptical marquee and pretty much
this is almost the same
what's a change from fixed size to
normal and we'll just drag out something
here we've got our same selections
options up here add subtract intersect
our feather is on there and then we've
got anti-alias which makes this smoother
so if I hit delete and take off my
selection we can see that we have a nice
smooth circle wait go back and I'll
uncheck anti-alias click here and delete
and deselect we still have a smooth
circle um let's check inside the
anti-aliasing it's supposed to make this
like really smooth but you can see it
that it's a little jagged instead so
that's what the anti-aliasing does
basically it creates a softer selection
so the elliptical mark marquee tool it
just it's good for making circles and
ellipses if you let me zoom out and get
back to where it was so everything's not
like deleted out and everything go back
to where we were 100% fine doesn't
matter and click on this we've got the
ability to make like ovals ellipses and
if you hold shift you can create the
perfect circle and of course if you drag
and then hold all you start making this
from the center
if you hold all and shift it makes a
perfect circle from the center if you
don't hold shift it makes like whatever
shape that you are going forward so
that's a that's all for the marquee and
Alip elliptical marquee tool so the
rectangular in elliptical and then in
the next tutorial since this one's
getting a little bit long I'll go over
the single row and single column so
thanks for watching this tutorial and
stay tuned for more tutorials about the
different tools because that's what
we're getting into right now so see you
guys later have a good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
