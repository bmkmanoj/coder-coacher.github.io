to your 28th CSS tutorial and this is
going to be an amazing story because in
this lesson I'm going to be teaching
guys how to apply styles to more than
one element at the time because before
we had to take each element and apply
one style at a time and it took a lot of
time and I'm just way too lazy for that
so I'm going to teach you guys how to
save some time and also we're going to
be learning something else if I don't
run out of time in this video so the
first thing we need is just go ahead and
add some normal text on your webpage not
up there down here in your body this is
normal text and under this just go ahead
and make a header one you can actually
make whatever header you want but I
chose header one why not and go ahead
and write right like this is header one
in it and under your header go ahead and
make a paragraph there's my opening P
and in your paragraph text just right
this is a paragraph or anything you want
so anyways like I said what I want to
teach you guys had to do is apply styles
to more than one element at a time so
before what we did is we had a tag for
example our header tag which we would
put h1 and then we would go ahead in
there curly braces apply whatever style
property value we wanted to and then
under that we would have another thing
like P for paragraph and then in here we
would apply whatever same style we want
but what if you had this crazy idea that
I want to apply the same style to two
different tags for example I want to
turn all the text in my paragraph red
and also all the text in my header red
so if we wanted to apply the same style
to more than one element at a time
here's a nice little shortcut for that
instead of writing on several different
lines we can go ahead and write h1 just
like before and we can write a comma and
then after that go ahead and add your
other element on the same exact line so
this saves you the trouble of not only
having to add many elements but on one
line right all the elements you want you
just have to remember to set
write them with a comma and then you
only apply that rule once and when you
apply it once it's going to affect all
the elements you told it to so like I
said it saves you some time so let's go
ahead and check out an example right now
if we go ahead and take the property
color set it equal to red or something
simple something that shows up good and
go ahead and save that now check it out
the normal text stayed the same right
there because it didn't get affected
with our CSS but the header and
paragraph both turn red even though
they're on the same line and we only set
that CSS rule color red one time it
applied it to both the paragraph and
header one element so again like you can
see this saves you a whole lot of time
whenever you're applying the same style
to many different elements and I did it
with two elements in this example but
you can do with three four or five
however many you want so anyways that's
what I wanted to show you for the first
half of the story now let's just go
ahead and do everything because that was
simple enough what I want to show you
guys now is something called span now
before I taught you guys how to apply
styles to entire elements for example
and it's in the lesson I just showed you
how would you apply the style to it
entire header or how would you apply a
style to entire paragraph but say for
example you have a paragraph let me go
ahead and make one real quick on your
screen like this and there's a bunch of
text in it let me let me just type some
stuff this is my first pair and I love
carrots and apple pie so you have this
wonderful paragraph on your screen and
this websites looking pretty good so far
but you get this crazy idea that maybe
you want to apply a CSS property to you
know maybe just a couple words well we
know that we can't apply it to the
paragraph or it's going to affect
everything so how do we solve that
problem well what XHTML did or the
wonderful people who made it they
invented a special XHTML tag and it's
called span sp
and whenever we want to affect just a
group or a block of text what we need to
do is we need to surround that text with
our span tags so let me go ahead and
surround like um I love carrots with a
special span tags now this is a double
tag so it has an opening and closing
span and let me go ahead and end it
right here
span in our scene all right Bucky so how
do I actually apply a CSS rule to this
well again just like any other element
just go ahead and type the element name
which is span up here and I'm not just
making this word up you can't like write
your name and put it in here and expect
it to work
span is actually a built-in thing so you
know don't go making up words on me
so anyways in your curly brackets just
write it like you write any other normal
CSS property so let's go ahead and
something different than color let's go
ahead and change the font weight this
time let's change this to bold and also
might as well change the color to color
change it to green that should look
pretty good so now let's go ahead and
save this and refresh and check it out
none of the paragraph is affected but
your span which is pretty much like
custom made tags that might be easier
way to understand it that is only part
that's affected so if you ever come
across this problem where you want to
apply a CSS rule but you don't want to
affect the whole tag you can insert
these custom span tags and then only the
text that's in between those tags is
going to be affected so that's pretty
sweet and again like I said span is a
keyword that you need to use you just
can't use any word you want like your
name or your favorite food you need to
work use the word span or else your
browser's not going to understand it so
anyways that's all I have for you guys
for this tutorial so um thank you for
watching and don't forget to check out
