Photoshop cs6 tutorial on your host
buddy Blackbird and today we're going to
go over using the swatches panel now it
should be right next to the color panel
if you didn't mess around and remove it
or anything like that and it says
swatches on it and if you don't have it
go to window and then come down here to
swatches so what swatches are is just a
group of a bunch of different pre picked
colors and you can have the ability to
create new swatches which is just a
single color and you can create like
certain groups of them and save them and
just have like a recurring color palette
for you to use when you're working on
some design projects and things like
that so like when you're working on like
creating somebody a logo or something
like that
you can just have up in your swatches
the three different colors that you're
working with and be able to quickly
choose between those so you don't have
to keep on looking and using your
eyedropper tool to keep on picking
colors and everything like that so what
happens with the swatches is that right
now you get start you get loaded with a
preset set of swatches and you can come
up here and change them in this and the
options panel and then you have all
these different types of swatches here
and you can change the way that you view
them so we got small thumbnail here's a
large thumbnail and then you got your
list here which tells you the names of
all the different color swatches and
then you can see now how they are listed
and what they are like or what they're
used for
so when you go to the small thumbnail
you're kind of wondering why there's
some of the same colors and things like
that but you can see that in the list
that some of them them are RGB blue and
one of them is the CMYK blue and pretty
much that you get a whole bunch of
different things you're some pastels and
lights and everything like that sorry if
I was going too fast through those but
you can come down here too
check out our get different colors so if
I come down to like solid coated Pantone
or something like that you can hit
appended to add new or to add them to
your current list of swatches so if I
hit a pen I've gotten a new set of
colors here and to be able to delete
though you can click on a swatch so if I
click on this one it turns into a hand
if I click and hold and then I can bring
it down to the to the trash can here and
then that will delete it or if I hold
alt you can see that the UM the icon
turned into like a pair of scissors and
I could just start clicking on things
and I'll delete them like that so
holding all is the faster way you can
add single swatches by going to your
color panel go ahead and pick a color
anything I'll just stick with like
bright red for right now and if I hit
this um like the new button is it's a
the create a new swatch from your
foreground color button and there I go
and you can name it and then it will
create it there for you so I'll just
name this super red or something like
that and hit OK and it puts our right
down at the bottom let's cut that out
because it doesn't need to be there and
um you can go ahead and if you start
adding way too many swatches and
everything you can go ahead and like
reset that by going up to the panel here
are the options
reset swatches replace the current
swatches with the default colors hit OK
and say changes to the current swatches
no and then you got your basic ones that
you had they're all at the beginning so
that's how you do that you're able to
create your own sets so if I I wanted to
just get rid of these let's get rid of
these swatches so many of them
as positive so I got rid of everything
on there I'll go ahead and just select a
color we'll just go blank there's one
black and then I'll select another color
should just stay down red the first time
red okay now I'm bit basically building
up my color swatches here then I could
go ahead and save these if I wanted to
and it goes automatically to your color
swatches folder and I could save that as
red and black save so I'll do something
like reset real quick and then we can
load up your swatches that you had their
load and they will come into into play
there so they append when you load just
so you know another quick way that you
can add swatches is a just move into a
gray area on your photos on your
swatches panel below all the colors and
turns into the Paint Bucket if you click
on it you're able to just add a swatch
quickly which is pretty cool let me look
into the options panel and see if
there's anything else to go over you can
go to close to close out the swatches
panel which I probably didn't need to
show it's probably self-explanatory and
you can't oh you can go ahead and
replace everything if you don't want
ever if you don't want the swatches to
append by loading you can replace
everything and hit load that way you
don't have all the default colors so I
didn't have any swatches pre-made so I
had to tell it delete them all by hand
and then and then add these in people
after I had the swatches made so thanks
for that's going to be the end of this
tutorial so thanks for watching this one
and give it a thumbs up if you liked it
and learned a little bit about the
swatches panel thanks everybody have a
good day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
