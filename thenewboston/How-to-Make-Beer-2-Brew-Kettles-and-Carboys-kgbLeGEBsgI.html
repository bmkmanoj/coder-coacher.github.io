boiling pot or a kettle now we're going
to be boiling between two and a half to
three gallons of liquid so make sure
that your pot is at least four gallons
five and six gallon pots work awesome
now the material it doesn't really
matter
I recommend stainless steel or aluminum
just don't get those ones with black
paint on it because they chip and they
rust really easy and of course you need
something to mix it with um some people
use wooden spoons I have a metal spoon
right here and if you go to any website
and look at beer brewing spoons just
type that in they're going to give you a
lot of options so anyways a spoon and at
least a four gallon boiling pot now the
next thing that you need is a 6 gallon
fermenter now this thing right here is
called a fermenter or a carboy people
have different names ring I have a glass
one right here but some people use
plastic some people actually use buckets
for this process but I recommend a
fermenter it's a lot easier and
basically the reason that we need it is
because whenever we have our beer and
it's not it doesn't have alcohol in it
yet we put the East in in the yeast is
going to eat the sugar and convert it
into alcohol however it doesn't happen
instantly it takes a long time sometimes
it takes two weeks sometimes it takes a
month and while that process happens we
need to put it in a container and set it
up to the side and let the yeast do its
thing so again like I said this is
called a fermenter or a carboy I
recommend getting a six gallon one and I
also recommend getting glass it's a lot
better than plastic
now one optional accessory that you may
want and this is actually really cheap
and really handy it's just a carboy
stand or a fermenter holder or whatever
you want to call it basically these
things whenever you wash them they're
paint to dry so they can go ahead and
sit
these really easy and it helps dry it a
lot because if you just sit on here
right-side up and they dry like that all
the water is going to go to bottom then
you're going to have water stains or
sediment on the bottom so again
invest in one of these it's really cheap
it's probably like under five dollars
and it's really handy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
