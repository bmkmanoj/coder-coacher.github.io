fourth blender tutorial and in this
tutorial I'm gonna be talking about
animating things and just animation in
general so it's gonna be pretty cool and
it's it's about 10 o'clock at night and
I just woke up you know took a shower so
I think I'm gonna be good to go on this
one's gonna be pretty good tutorial and
uh unlike last time where I thought
about sushi I had another realization
when I was in the shower how come when
you're taking a shower
doesn't matter where that there's about
one millimeter difference turning the
knob from freezing cold to scolding hot
any shower I ever stepped in if I like
turn it a little bit it'll be freezing
cold like haha I can't breathe and then
if I turn the knob just like one
millimeter more it's like scolding the
skin off of my body so you know there's
a fine line between there and only you
know your own shower if you could go to
anyone else's house then you know it's
over you might as well forget about it
but anyways let's give this tutorial the
first thing I want to remind you guys of
is up unlike last time where
transformations we're moving it around
you also have these little arrows right
here and you can move on your transfer
or your object around using these arrows
if you're too lazy to nina do it the
other way and you can also right-click
it and when you get it to the place just
left-click it to set it but for right
now with this selected go ahead and
press delete because we don't need that
dumb all what cube in our way anymore
what we need is a spear so go ahead and
crease spacebar and let's go ahead and
create mesh ecosphere you can create
anything you want doesn't matter for
this tutorial just uh I need to create
something now in order to a anime I want
to get two of these items and that
brings me to my next point of
duplication so go ahead and select this
with your right mouse button if it isn't
already sucked in and hold down shift
and press D and when you do you get a
duplication of this item now go ahead
and press left-click to select
so again that shift deep now since we're
animating is probably going to make
sense to switch our animation view so we
can either go down here and go to
animation or since we're being lazy what
we can do is um use a shortcut and that
is control left so again hold down
control press the left arrow and that's
gonna bring you up to your animation
interface so now we're in ER in now we
are in our animation interface so let's
anim something well the first thing
we're gonna want to notice is this
little bugger right here and this is
called the timeline right now it's in
seconds and went by the end of this
tutorial you're going to understand what
the timeline means it's pretty simple so
I'm not gonna explain it if I always put
your cursor over a timeline press space
and or excuse me press the T and make
sure you're in frames and again that's T
you're in seconds by default and go to
frames this way
we can see the frames instead of the
seconds or you can do seconds if you
want you know I really don't care just
want to tell you guys ads up there the
next thing we're gonna do is create an
empty on the screen so deselect
everything and go ahead and click
somewhere around right there put your
crosshairs over it and go ahead and
press space add empty now what an empty
is is is pretty much an object that does
nothing so why would we want an object
that does nothing on our screen
well the usefulness of this empty is
that we can animate this empty for
example we're gonna make it grow and
then what it does is we can link these
two objects to the empty so for example
if we had 10 different objects and we
all wanted them to grow what we could do
is animate them each individually and
make them all grow give them all frames
or we can animate this empty once and
link all these objects to this empty and
whatever this empty did these objects
would do so we want to have two n mate
each of these separately we just have to
animate something once and then link
everything to it what you're
see so since I said that it can do that
I better prove you guys that it can do
that so we got our empty selected what
we need to do is scroll down here until
we get our little green bar right here
and this is the time where we're at and
go ahead and move it to frame one or to
the left as far as you can go and what
you can see right here is frame one
empty and it also says it down here so
go ahead and slide that way to the left
here at frame one and what we're gonna
want to do is insert a scale key so go
ahead in with this selected the empty
press I scale I scale get it and that is
a Newman joke I just made that up please
don't repeat it so now what we want to
do is move this little time to frame you
know 100 or something or 99 just cuz it
couldn't there we go 100 now what we
want to do is actually change the scale
of this empty so go ahead and I guess
you know just change the scale press s
on your keyboard and go ahead and change
that a little bit and go ahead and hit
it just like that and now what we want
to do once we change a scale at frame
100 we want to set another scale key so
go ahead and press I with a still
selected and press scale and now you can
see to our little graph on the right
hand side this is the scale of our
object over x it goes from 1 to 4 in a
hundred frame so what this means is it
starts out its size 1 whatever that
means and it goes to 4 times its
original size and 100 frames so how can
we see this visually if we put our left
mouse button over here and scrub back
and forth we can see that our empty is
now changing as it goes from 0 size 1 to
frame 100 size 4 so now we have an empty
that is animated in scale so now how can
we get these objects to do the same well
I'll tell you the first thing you learn
1 do
is deselect everything in your main
animation window so go ahead and press a
until you get everything deselected so
again a means all in the lender so hit
it twice to get everything deselected
now what we're gonna want to do is
something called parenting so go ahead
and hold down shift on your keyboard and
select this one this one and select this
empty last to make it active and now
what you need to do is parent these to
this so how do you do that well once
you're empty is um what's called the
active one and you can tell what one is
active by this objects and links right
here
what you're gonna want to do is hit
control hold down control and press P
and this means make parent and once you
make that parent again that's control
and P you're gonna have two little lines
to your objects right here now what a
parent is it pretty much um allows these
objects to take the properties of its
parent so again the children that these
two objects are called do whatever the
parent does so now if you scroll back
and forth you see that as the parent
girls the children grow with it so this
is a pretty good parent right here
unlike my parents who made me wear a
skirt and sit on my uncle's lap when I
was seven years old but I don't want to
talk about that it brings back some bad
memories but anyways this is a pretty
good parent unlike mine so again as you
can see scrubbing back and forth another
thing that you can do is if you um hit
all a you can see this animation play oh
yeah just like that or if you're too
lazy to hit it you can just scroll all
the way back and hit this play button or
right here and watch it play like that
either way you've got many different
options of Washington play and another
cool thing that you can see anytime you
move this
parent around the children move with it
you know makes sense para moves the
child gonna move too so you know just
like in real life but uh that's that for
this tutorial actually accidentally got
rid of my time on my screen recorder
shot know how long we are about thank
you guys for watching this tutorial and
I will see you next time
