youtube.com slash on live gamer for the
new Boston and if you remember from the
previous tutorial we made this
calculator right here and now what we're
going to do is we are going to start
adding the code that will make our
calculator work so go ahead and open up
the code for it and I'll zoom in some
here here is all of our subs that handle
our buttons being clicked now what we're
going to do is we're just going to come
down below all of this and we're going
to start off by creating the functions
that will add subtract multiply and
other stuff so we'll create a private
function add and then we will buy Val
num1 as double and then we will buy Val
num2 as double
so now what we're going to do is we need
to return a value so we will just return
num1 plus num2 now go ahead and create
that for subtract so we'll start off
with private functions subtract and we
will buy Val num1 is double and num2 as
double now we're going to do is we'll
just return num1 - num2 now we will
create another function for dividing so
private function divided
and we will add the same arguments for
subtract and addition so we'll just copy
this and paste it right here
and now we're going to do is we're going
to return num1 divided by num2 now we'll
create this for multiply so private
function multiplied and then we're going
to have the same arguments as up here
and we will just return num1 times
num2 now we'll create that again for
modulus but instead of using a double
for modulus we're going to go ahead and
use an integer because if you use a
double for modulus you're always going
to get the value 0 so we'll type private
function modulus and then we'll buy val
num1 as integer and num2 as integer and
we will just return num1 modulus num2
and we'll do this one more time for pi
and so we'll go ahead and create private
function pi and then we'll go ahead and
add our arguments so by val num1 as
integer and we only need one argument
for this one let's do double instead and
now we will just return number one times
math dot pi now what we need to do is
set a return type for each of these so
for pi we'll just do as double because
we can possibly get a double and for
modulus we're going to have to return an
integer and for the rest we will just
return them as doubles
okay so now what we'll do is we'll go
ahead and come to our button ad click
sub and we're going to add the two
numbers that are in the text box so what
we're going to do is we're going to do
the addition so we'll type ad and then
for our arguments we're going to go
ahead and convert whatever text is in
there to a double so we'll go ahead and
type C type and then we'll just type
text number one dot text so what this is
going to do is it's going to convert
text num1 dot text to a string and to
come into an into a double and to do
this we're going to add a comma and type
double right there now you don't have to
when you're using C type you don't have
to use it in an assignment such as
create a variable and then this variable
equals C type you can do it on the fly
inside arguments or wherever you want so
we'll just do that one more time for
text num2 dot txt and then we'll go
ahead and close that now we need
something to store what add gives us
back so we'll go ahead and declare
answer as double and we will set it
equal to whatever add gives us back when
we call it and give it the first number
and the second number and let's see what
we got here
all right we need to convert this to a
double okay so go ahead and try this we
get all this code written down make sure
you understand it you can even play
around a bit with with it yourself to
see if you can get it to show up in the
third text box and to do other stuff and
once you understand everything go ahead
and move on to the next tutorial and
