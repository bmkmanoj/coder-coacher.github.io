very first Adobe Illustrator cs6
tutorial
I'm your host buddy Blackford and I'll
be going over about a hundred
illustrator tutorials with you on the
new boston channel and we're going to be
going over how to use the program basics
about it and give you a good grip on the
program so that you can go into the
field and start using it and it gives
you a good basis for you to continue to
learn on your own and then maybe in the
meantime or maybe later on we'll add a
whole bunch more tutorials more advanced
and stuff like that so in this tutorial
right now I'm just going to go over what
is a du Adobe Illustrator cs6 and what
do you use it for you might have been
wondering that so I'm going to answer
your question now so illustrator is a
program used by both artists and graphic
designers to create vector images and
I'll go over what vector images are and
a little bit more in depth but they're
basically images that are infinitely
scalable so you're going to be making
images that will then be used for
company logos or promotional use and you
can even use it as your own personal
work if you need to you'll be creating
things like illustrations charts graphs
and diagrams you can create like I said
before the logos cartoons and if you can
think of it if you can think of some
kind of graphic or illustration or
something like that you can create it in
Adobe Illustrator now Adobe Illustrator
does have a steep initial learning curve
but once you start getting past it and
getting to know how to use the program
then it became it can become really
worthwhile and catapult your graphic
design skills heavily and that's what
I'm going to try to teach you in these
tutorials and we're going to get over
that curve and we're going to get into
it so that we're all comfortable using
it now one of the things that I
mentioned before was a vector image and
you should you need to know what a
vector image is because it's
important and is basically what adobe
illustrator deals with the entire time
when you're making it so these are what
you're going to actually create so think
of this when you have a vector image you
can scale it up as much as you want and
the edges are all going to stay crisp
and clean same with if you scale it down
you can do the same thing you can make
it as tiny as you want or as large as
you want and the edges are going to stay
nice now have you ever tried to take an
image or like like a picture or a
clipart or something like that in
Photoshop and you increase it and it
starts getting all blurry and everything
like that well Photoshop mainly deals
with what's known as raster images and
those are gifs jpegs Tiff's PNG s and
those are made up by a grid of pixels so
you'll be dealing with pixels when
you're using Photoshop but when you deal
with illustrator you're going to be
using paths and if i zoom in on some of
these here we look at them and I click
using I'll use this white that it's
called a direct selection tool and if I
click on it you can see that there's a
path here and it's made up by points
anchor points here and that's what you
create your shape with you're using
paths not pixels and when you're using
these the program illustrator uses
mathematical formulas and that is
probably proprietary to Adobe they use
those to allow these images to be scaled
up and down indefinitely so one of the
things that people get intimidated with
illustrator about is the name kind of
makes it sound like you got to know how
to draw to be able to use illustrator
well you don't actually have to have any
prior knowledge of drawing or painting
or anything like that
you don't have to be like this great
artist to be able to use it you can take
like an image if you want or a
photograph and you can use it as a guide
to trace or
thing else like that just you don't have
to be able to draw to be able to use
illustrator properly I mean it does help
and it will help you to be a better
graphic artist if you know how to draw
but you don't need to have prior prior
artistic ability I mean myself I'm
pretty much terrible at drawing so I use
a illustrator because and I mean I use
it by tracing paths or use existing
vector images and things like that's I'm
not a that great at drawing but I'm
still able to use the program so what
happens if you're using illustrator and
you're using your vector images but the
person that you're working for your
client decides that they don't want
vector images well you're like what do
you want what do you want me use Adobe
Illustrator for then to do it but
sometimes clients they don't always make
the most sense a good thing with
illustrator is that it has a versatility
in it to be able to change these into
raster images so you can change the
image into a JPEG if you really need to
so one thing that you got to realize
though is after you change it to the
raster image you're not going to be able
to change it back to a vector which
sucks but you can always go back in and
trace it so it's not too bad but you
always want to like save a copy of what
you're doing that's why you always save
and everything like that and we all know
that illustrator is pretty expensive for
the average Joe I guess it's not the
most cheap program but if you go on to
Adobe's website you're able to get a
30-day free trial I think it's still 30
days that's the last time I checked I
haven't checked in a little bit but it's
a free trial that you can use and then
you can download that and follow along
with the tutorial and get an idea if you
want to actually buy the program and
that's just a to start out but that's
pretty much all I wanted to go over for
the intro and we can start getting you
some
or things that deal with using the
program a little bit better in the next
couple tutorials so I thank you for
watching this one and hope you guys all
have a great day
see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
