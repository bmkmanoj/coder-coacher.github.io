installing the plugins now the plugins
remember are the actual useful things
that grunt can do now the specific
plugins that you want are dependent on
what you're trying to do to your project
and they're probably going to be
different for every project I'm not
gonna talk you through every single
plug-in because there are thousands of
them I think they're like 5,000
different ones so just show you guys how
to set up one or two but the concept is
the same for every single plug-in once
you know how to set up one you're gonna
understand how to set up any of them so
anytime you want plug-in from your
command line type NPM install in every
plug-in follows the same naming
convention it's grunts - contribu one
you found online that you'll want to use
type the plug-in name right here now two
of the really easy ones that people will
use all the time they're not only easy
but they're really popular are uglify
now this is a plugin that takes your
JavaScript and it minifides it in other
words it rips out all the white space so
the file size is a lot smaller so type
the name of the plug-in you want to
install and then after this right - -
save - dev now hit enter and that's
gonna go online find the plug-in
download it install it and then also add
it is a dependency you know show you
guys what it did so again what it did is
it went online found that plug-in which
was right here download it install it
set it up for your project and also
added it is a dependency in your package
Jason I mean pretty handy for one a
little line of code in the command line
and again the dependency just says hey
we're gonna be using uglify in our
project now just so you know I stick
this in your guys's brain let's go ahead
and install one more plug in so npm
install and remember it's grunt -
contribute our white space and minify
zit
- - safe and - dev so now go do the same
thing do-do-do-do-do do-do-do-do-do
alright so actually let me clear out
that crap alright so we can verify that
it downloaded all the plugins that we
wanted to boom and set them up looking
good so we have all the plugins all the
tools ready to go the last thing that we
need to say is hey grunts we need to
pretty much give it a set of
instructions of what we're trying to do
so in order to do that we're gonna have
one last file and that's the grunt file
so just right-click your main directory
and hit new javascript file and you have
to name this grunt file dot J s so look
at this so in here the syntax is always
the same again I probably should mention
this so this is the file where we're
going to be giving grunt the specific
instructions in other words when we're
done developing our website everything
looks good we're gonna say what plugins
we want to use how we want to use them
any options that we need to give it and
in what order so for example if you want
to aqua Phi and then modify the CSS or
if we wanna you know convert all of our
less code to CSS and then minify the CSS
you pretty much give grunt a bunch of
tasks or jobs in here so the syntax that
we use is module dot exports and set
this equal to function and as a
parameter pass in grunt now make sure to
add your semicolon and we pass in grunt
because later on whenever we're ready to
actually run all these grunt commands
we're gonna be typing grunt in the
command line and that says ok you typed
in grunt so inside here whatever code we
write in here that's what grunt is gonna
do so again one last time we're gonna
make our website just like we would
normally we're gonna type grunt in the
command line and then it's gonna do a
whole bunch of crap now the jobs that
we're gonna be creating for grunt grunt
cause those
okay that's word is hard for me to say
for some reason tasks so I'm gonna try
to avoid saying that but in order to
make a new job or a task and what you do
is you type a grunt and I would just
show you guys one really easy this is
not one thing you would ever really do
I'm just gonna show you guys how to make
grunt print something out on the screen
but we're gonna say grunt register task
right here now inside here will just say
default which means that whenever we
type grunt use this as the default task
pretty simple because you know this is
only one we have so far and four if I
can type function correctly function and
my branders
my little curly braces right there and
my semicolon so we're basically just
giving a default job to do right now and
if you ever want to log something out on
the screen then type grunt log writes
and just like write whatever like this
grunt task is pointless so again
whenever we would run our grukk man now
I'll just do it right now grunt it's
gonna go to this file and say okay I'm
gonna follow our instructions what did
you tell me to do well you just told me
to print out this grunt task is
pointless and done without errors now I
say that this is actually a pointless
task but sometimes you do want to log
things out so for example you might want
to log out let's say that you're gonna
minify all your CSS so you're gonna
minify it and then you're gonna log out
CSS minified successfully or something
or I don't know like all your less files
converted in the CSS so if you just want
to log a little things so the user knows
what's going on and you can use this
right here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
