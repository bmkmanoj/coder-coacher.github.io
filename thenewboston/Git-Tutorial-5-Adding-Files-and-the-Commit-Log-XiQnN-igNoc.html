even know what freaking number it is
welcome to another get tutorial and the
first thing that I wanted teach you guys
in this tutorial is how to view all of
your commits pretty much how to view
your commit history so make sure that
you're in your main a project folder and
type git space log in hit enter now as
you can see what this command does is it
basically allows us to view our commit
history and we only have one commit
right now and it basically gives the
author of it which was Bucky Roberts the
date which was this is the point in time
where I actually made this commit and
this message right here now of course we
only did one commit so far which was
adding our very first text file to the
project which was first text right here
so that's what this committee is
displaying but if we had more commits
than they would all appear there now
another thing I want to point out is
that you can also view commits from a
certain person because if you're working
on a huge project with a bunch of people
like a team of programmers then it's
helpful to view commits from only a
specific let's say you have a programmer
a developer and you know a systems
administrator maybe you want only want a
view of changes from the developer which
would be Bucky so let's go ahead and get
logged which pretty much means show me
the commits but I only want to view them
from one person so - - author equals
Bucky in it's cool because you don't
need to type in the full name which is
Bucky Roberts you can only type part of
the name and when you hit enter it's
only going to show you those commits
from Bucky so what if you are you know
maybe you typed a person that doesn't
exist let's say get armed log - -
author let's just set this equal to
Wendy and hit enter now of course Wendy
does not exist the only person that made
a commit so far was me so this of course
is not going to display any commits
because when you didn't make any and
there are a couple other things that you
can use to UM view certain commits but
you know I'm not going to do a whole
tutorial because this is just a kind of
beginners tutorial and well it's kind of
boring viewing commits from you know
specific people so anyways let's move on
the next actually really helpful thing
and that is making changes to your
project now I know we already added a
file last time but I want to show you
guys a really cool way to better
understand how changes are made and
that's using git status now hit enter on
this and it says oh on branch master I
thought said Oh branch master I was
reading it in that voice - it says
nothing to commit working directory
clean so what does this mean the status
basically says that there are no files
that you are working on that git isn't
keeping track of in other words if you
created a file but you didn't commit it
yet then it would give you an entirely
different status so remember whenever
you type get status and that's another
thing in your bash if you hit the up
arrow then it's going to take you to the
previous command so if you keep hitting
up that's what I'm doing on my keyboard
then it's going to keeps like cycling
through your previous commands so I
don't have to type it out but get status
pretty much compares your repository
which is that main project against your
working directory which is just your
local copies that it's working on and it
tells you if there are any changes so
right now they match which is good so
let's go ahead and create a new file on
let's create a new file and just put
like this is another just put this is
the second text file that we are making
I just go ahead and save this as second
dot text and of course this is all in
the tuna directory and let's actually go
ahead and make a third one this is our
random dumb third file and save this as
third as well so now in our working copy
which is our local computer just think
of it like that we have this first file
which is already committed to our main
project the second and the third which
we just made so those are not committed
yet and if we type get actually let me
clear this get status then it says okay
what we can pretty much see or what this
is pretty much saying is you have
untracked files second and third text
now untracked means that we didn't
commit them and if we don't commit them
get isn't keeping track of them so now
if we make any changes get can keep
track of this one but since we didn't
commit these two then it can't keep
track of those so let's go ahead and
well pretty much just add this right now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
