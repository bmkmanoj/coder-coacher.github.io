buddy Blackford here with another After
Effects cs6 tutorial and today I want to
talk to you about using the brainstorm
feature which is this little button here
with the thought bubble with the light
in it and I want to show you what that
does and how to use it and why it's so
cool so let's get on with it
might as well so the brainstorm button
when you click on it it takes a group of
properties or effects that you have
selected and makes a bunch of different
random options for you to pick from and
you can see what it looks like in the in
the panel so might as well just show you
off the bat so let's just add some
effects here and let's maybe let's add
like where's the blurs let's go to the
blurs we'll add like CC radial blur that
might work and let's do transition
venetian blinds alright so we've got
these two selected right now I just
selected them now if I come down to this
brainstorm button and click on it it's
going to bring up a few ideas of things
that I can make with this with these
effects and it's got a randomness
variation here and we got a play/pause
button so you can see how it's gonna
show up and work
so you can see that this one's swirling
these ones are just kind of not doing
too much or whatever so and then I could
pause it here's my transparency show our
transparencies coming through and you
can also hit this let me stop it stop
there we go yeah geez how many times do
I gotta hit stop to make a stop anyways
you can hit this again to get to the
next brainstorm and we can just like try
to like look at those and to what we
want so let's pick this one here and you
click this button here to apply it and
we can save it as a new comp we can go
full frame here to see what it actually
looks like yeah this is a pretty cool
little feature that it's got going on
and then we've got include a next
brainstorm so you can like save tiles so
let's save this one and then brainstorm
and we'll keep that one and then it's
gonna be like brainstormed out for that
one so that's kind of cool so let's go
back to what we had and I'll include it
let's try increasing up the randomness
here let's go 75 brainstorm now what do
we got a bunch of different things cool
like this one looks kind of cool
you can see it's like a little bit of
venetian blinds on the edges here that
one's like trippy looking shouldn't have
picked up alert it's kind of hard to
look at a little bit but let's add it
apply it and then if I play this is what
we get some time maybe I'll turn my
background on and that's what we got
going on here the venetian blinds is
just a transition that uses like kind of
blinds to make the transition so that's
the brainstorm feature you can take like
position and things like that also so if
I go to position and I want to
brainstorm that it's going to just
change the randomness of where the
position is and you can see that here so
pretty much there's no keyframes on this
one so let's cancel that out it's gonna
stay where it is let's put some
keyframes in here
cookie from there select these keyframes
and the position now if we play it no it
doesn't doesn't look like it's a moving
it around too much but it's like not
moving at all so I guess that doesn't
doesn't work let's try moving it while
we're doing the keyframes like this
that's why position isn't moving
so we've got this here on this key frame
there we go now we've got some
let's move this over here now
there we go now let's try the brainstorm
and now you can see that the brainstorm
will work with your keyframes that
you've got going on there so now if I if
you look here if I stop it it kind of
like renders it out and I'll play the
going with your keyframes to see what's
going on so that helps out the
brainstorm doesn't work with masks but
it does work with the mass properties it
can create variations with the mask
feather the mask opacity and the
expansion but it's not gonna create a
random mask for you so just keep that in
mind we can add the we can add
brainstorms to like layer styles so let
me let's go to layer styles here and we
can add and the like a outer glow oops I
turn it off
I've got the outer glow here and now I
can brainstorm that it should give me
different outer glows let's increase the
randomness
brainstorm
now it's got different kinds of outer
clothes like this one's all like weird
different looking as you can see and
this one is not as not as intense so you
can use it with the layer styles not
those so there's the layer styles
there's the transformation properties
there's effect properties so if you're
like really having like a mental block
or you need some creativity boost or
whatever then just go ahead and use the
the brainstorm feature and that I'll
help you like pretty much come up with
some ideas so that's cool I like that
feature a lot it's really good on text
so I'll just throw some text in here and
throw a couple features on it
text brain waves so let's throw a couple
effects on there box blur
and let's go to stylize I'm just go to
this roughing edges and let's just do
some things here and it's got a couple
couple different looking things here
let's increase the randomness to 50%
brainstorming again and you can see the
different effects that we get if it does
any other parameters snow so pretty much
that's that's how this works so works on
text it works on video it works on shape
layers so if I create a shape layer
actually I just drop draw one out
so we got a shape layer there and let's
add a in effect
let's see if I can there's one that
worked pretty good little last time that
I used this slow motion it was in
distort that's what it was just put that
on there
and this could look at the different
kind of effects that I'll create for us
and that and we got that so I mean the
effect makes some pretty cool stuff and
comes up with different looking things
for you so that's a that's it for
brainstorming it's pretty
straightforward just click on it to get
yourself some more ideas pretty much
thanks for watching the tutorial and
also it's actually good for like if you
put the effect on and then you go to
brainstorm and then you can see how they
use the the effect to create different
effects so what I mean is let me click
on it again so we've got the effect
going on here and you want to know how
to how the hell do I even make this
effect right here now if I click on it
and apply it the parameters change and I
have now learned how to make this cool
looking effect so there you go that's
how some people figure out how to make
cool effects that no one else has ever
thought of so there and use that thanks
for watching this tutorial give us some
thumbs up if you liked it thumbs down if
you hated it and that's it don't see you
guys later goodbye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
