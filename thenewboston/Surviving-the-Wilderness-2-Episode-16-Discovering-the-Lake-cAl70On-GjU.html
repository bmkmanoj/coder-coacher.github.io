forms which were incredibly disgusting
by the way I kept walking along the edge
of the creek and I'll show you guys
where I ended up like it so I came from
over there that's the edge where it
dumps in and I found this huge pond or
lake is really weird
finding the huge lake and not seeing
what my camera's must have known and not
seeing any houses whatsoever and this is
what I have to walk on so that's why the
camera might be shaky but anyways I see
a point up there so I want to get to the
point where I can see the full light
because this is like a little bay that
I'm in right now and another good thing
is I heard some frogs so if things go
right then hopefully should be eating
some frog Lake soon definitely whatever
I catch whatever are you next I'm gonna
cook it because harrying those worms I
felt sick to my stomach
so I learned my lesson look my frickin
boots are soaking in the mud oh so
that's good but anyways I don't want to
film right now because I don't want to
drop my camera but uh I'll get to the
point up there and I'll give you guys a
update then well I am almost to the
point
I think is just above this little hill
right here so we will see what's on the
other side of the way looks like nothing
quit walking alongside deal Lake because
it was way too muddy I know if you guys
can just heard that but I just heard
another frog
so anyways I'm gonna go ahead and go
over there through these trees and well
once I get a better view I'll show you
guys what I find
all right so I soon erupt how it looks
like it's gonna be a decent lookout
right there so let's see ah look at that
that works right I don't fall down there
it's so weird to see a lake that's this
big and to see absolutely no one at all
if this was anywhere around where I was
living then it would be packed full of
cottages jet skis boats people fishing
but out here there's nothing at all and
there's even a little island right there
it's pretty cool but anyways I guess I'm
just gonna have to go to the other side
of the lake over there and uh I don't
know what to do so after walking on the
other side of the lake for probably five
more minutes after I got done filming
last
I realized that there is no way I can
make it all the way down on that side so
I started off in this direction and I
wanted to end up in this direction so I
was walking along this sword right here
I started down there and I started
walking along that Shore in this
direction and it was just so muddy and
as you can see there are a ton of
branches down and if you go in the woods
deeper and try to walk then it's even
thicker and there are a bunch of dead
trees and you would like in a minute you
would move like 20 feet so now I'm on
this side right here and I actually I
couldn't swim across because I have all
my camera gear and stuff with me so I
had to go back where I first found the
lake and come all the way along this
side and it is so much easier as you can
see there are hardwoods it's so cleared
out if you can see all the hardwoods so
much easier to walk here than I where it
was before let me go ahead and show you
guys where it was before so you remember
that island that I showed you guys I
really wish I could have just swam
across the because that would've been a
whole lot easier but here's the island I
was talking about so Louie see if I can
zoom in so there's the island that I
thought was pretty cool and I was over
this trees and in my way
I was over I'm that peak right there but
now I'm on the other side and I really
don't know if I'm gonna stay here or
keep trying to make it to the other side
of lake it's getting pretty late now so
I'm not really sure</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
