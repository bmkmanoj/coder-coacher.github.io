Effects cs6 tutorial where we're going
to go over quickly how adjustment layers
might create a problem for you in a 3d
scene so I've got these two objects here
they're just I made them 3d because
they've already been made in 3d from a
previous tutorial and I want to apply an
adjustment layer with an effect on it
desaturate everything except for my gear
here so what an adjustment layer does is
you it's up here in the layer panel or
in the layer drop-down here right here
and what it does is you can put it in
effect on it in it and pretty much
affects everything that's below it so if
I throw this on here at the top and put
in an effect on it let's put let's put a
blur on because that's pretty easy to
see it's gonna blur everything now I'm
gonna take this leave this blur on for
you I'm just gonna turn the effect off
real quick and like I said I don't want
it to affect the gear I just wanted it
to affect everything below so I'm gonna
move this adjustment layer underneath
the gear but now the gear pops on in
front you're like what the and you know
the four-letter word that comes out from
it and this is because effectively this
adjustment layer breaks the rendering
order of the comp and that's just
something that the adjustment layer does
now this adjustment layer doesn't allow
these 3d objects to interact with each
other anymore
such as if they cast shadows on each
other or if they
interact or intersect with each other or
anything like that so I'm gonna show you
in the top view real quick how I have my
3d scene set up here are those CS TV
colorful letters there and then this
right here is my gear that I had in the
back so let's go to our our camera here
and now you can see it's weird that the
gear is in front and that's because of
this adjustment and layer like I
explained earlier now if I turn on the
effect you can see it it's gonna affect
everything but now this gear is an entry
D space anymore pretty much the only way
to get around this is to delete your
adjustment layer and add that effect of
a blur onto every layer that you want to
have the effect on you can't use the
adjustment layer because it breaks up
the rendering order and this allows
things to interact with each other so in
case you guys were messing around with
that I just wanted to explain to you how
that was going on and why that was
happening so you weren't a PDF at your
computer or After Effects more I should
say so thanks for watching this quick
tip and hopefully you guys don't run
into this problem ever but now you know
how to fix it from happening and what to
do thanks for watching and have a good
day everybody</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
