c-sharp tutorial that I'm making for the
new Boston and in this tutorial I'm
going to be showing you how to use the
open file dialog so all you need for
this tutorial is a button and a text box
now we can add an open file dialog you
can do this one of two ways you can
either go over to the tool box and drag
an open file dialog over to your form or
we can create it using code which is
what I usually do so we double click on
this button right here and create a new
instance of an Open File dialog then
we're going to want to give a name to
our open file dialog I'm just going to
call it ofd or Open File dialog then
just set it equal to a new Open File
dialog now basically an open file dialog
is something that will allow the user to
browse through the files on their
computer and open a file and then you
can do something with that file but
we're not going to get into that in this
tutorial so in order to display the Open
File dialog to the user you're just
gonna want to call the show dialog
method so it's going to ofd dot show
dialog and this will then display the
dialog to the user so now I'm going to
click this button we should be displayed
with an open file dialog and yep now we
can browse some files on our computer
and open a file but we haven't coded for
it to do anything of that file yet so in
order to run a quick check in order to
make sure that the user actually open
the file they didn't just like exit out
an Open File dialog we're going to
create an if statement here and say if
the Open File dialog dot show dialog
equals dialog resolve dot okay then we
can do something with that and basically
right here this is just an enumeration
and it will check to see if the user
actually opened a file and if they
didn't then the dialog result would be
something other than okay but if they
actually open a file and the dialog
result will be okay and you can
and do something with us but right now
we're just going to make sure this code
works right here and we're just going to
have a message box we display it if the
user actually open the file so here we
display the dialog and if they click the
exit button we shouldn't get a message
box they click cancel we also shouldn't
get a message box but if we open a file
it should get a message box go in order
to get the path of the file which the
user open we're going to want to use the
file name properties so I just want to
go up the file name and this will get
the path to the file with the user open
so we're just going to go ahead and open
this file right here and it should now
give us a path to this file so we should
get the C Drive user slash Adam slash
desktop and the file name then the path
to the file if you wanted to get only
the name of the file we could use the
safe file name property and this will
just get the name of the file itself so
instead of getting the path to the file
we'll just give this like 45 3 whatever
right here yep now you can make it so
that users can only open files with
certain certain extensions so in order
to do that we're just going to want to
do the Open File dialog named instance
dot filter let's set that equal to a
string and basically first you're just
going to want to give a description of
the UM type of file that user can only
open so if we only wanted to make a user
view of it to open a PNG file then we're
just going to want to type I guess your
PNG image and then following that we're
just going to want to type a straight
up-and-down line then I'm going to want
to type a star and a dot and then the
file extension and since we only want
users to able to open PNG images we're
just going to type dot PNG so now if we
debug here
open up the file dialog as you can see
right here we can only open up images
that have a dot PNG extension and we
have the description of the file
extension right here you can add
multiple ones say you wanted to do also
like I don't know a bi K then we would
just do another line then dot VI K now
we open this up now we have a choice we
can either do PNG or VI K you can also
give a title to your name of your file
dialog box so if we wanted to do like
change the title of the dialog box to
equal like open image and you can do
that go up here click this button now it
says open image up here instead of just
open like it set before um so that's
pretty much it that's pretty much all
there is on open file dialogs there are
a few other properties you can browse
through here on your own like show help
I guess but yeah there are a whole bunch
of other properties but that's all I'm
going to show you for this tutorial so
see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
