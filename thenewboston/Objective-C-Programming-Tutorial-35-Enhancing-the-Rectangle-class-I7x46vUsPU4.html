amazing objective-c tutorial and in this
story we're gonna be working with let's
see the rectangle class and editing it
to add our new and improved origin and
guess what just happened me I just made
this tutorial like ten minutes ago
and I went to export it save it and it
says oh the program just unexpectedly
shut down and I was like oh thanks so
now this is actually my second time
doing this tutorial so I had to go back
and delete everything so I don't know if
I got everything I guess I'll find out
right here so uh yeah see I already seen
one thing import foundation right there
that's a new thing I typed and I think
that's it so anyways we made this class
called XY point and this was our pretty
much our origin so now we have to go
back to our rectangle class and this is
your interface file for rectangle and
add all the origin data so the first
thing that we want to do see I already
see another thing I added just just
pretend you didn't see what just
happened right there so the first thing
you want to do is after importing
foundation is go ahead above your
interface and you want to reference the
class X Y point and this is going to be
because we're going to be working with
origin objects so let me just type this
in right here so I can finish explain X
Y point not only does your rec thing
will have a width and a height now it
also has an origin object great like
that so what's gonna happen is this your
interface rectangle has a width that's
integer it's going to look through it's
gonna say oh you have another integer
called height that's all right I know
all those things our variables int and
then it's gonna say alright wTF is X Y
point I've never seen that that isn't
built into my system and what's just our
origin WTF and it's gonna be like oh I
see what's going on here this was never
built into my system like integers and
stuff you made your own class called XY
point so if we didn't have this little
reference right here
when it came across this it wouldn't
know what's going on so now when we come
across that you know we already told it
it's a class that we made so that's what
this and this means so aside from that
what we want to do is we want to build
methods to deal with this new origin
property we want to build one method to
pretty much just get it back whenever we
need our origin so it can tell us what
it is and we need another method to set
the origin to a point like 100 200 800
600 so let's go ahead and build the
headers for those right there I'm you
don't need to include them for a
property because we're going to be well
you won't don't worry about it the first
thing we're gonna do is return our
origin to us so let's go ahead an XY
point we want to be getting an origin
object back and we want to name this
method origin so whenever we call this
method all it's going to reduce return
the origin to us simple enough and these
methods are incredibly simple once you
see us build them the next method what
we're going to build is called set
origin and we are going to pass it an XY
point and we'll just name that point and
what it's going to do is pretty much set
the origin for us oh you probably
couldn't tell that by the name cuz yeah
so let's go ahead and copy these for the
headers I want to make sure I didn't do
anything else looks good enough now in
your implementation class let make sure
I didn't include anything from the other
tutorial all right import rec village
implement rectangle let's yeah I think
all we need to do is a make our methods
pretty cool so let's go ahead and make
our method bodies right now and all this
origin does right here is it returns
origin and maybe this will make sense
after I build this body right here then
I'll explain it what set origin does is
we're going to pass it a point
we're actually going to pass it an
origin object called PT so we want to
take that origin object and we want to
set it equal to origin okay set it equal
to PT so now check this out the point we
pass it which is going to be pretty much
the object that we pass it is going to
be equal to origin so now whenever we
return origin it returns this X Y object
so that is how you can set the origin by
passing it a point object and then PT
and that is also how you return the
origin so let me make sure I have
everything right here I think that's
everything I wanted to cover in this
tutorial I mean in the next tutorial
we're going to be getting into the real
fun stuff of pretty much well let me say
this first of all not I mean it doesn't
matter what we're gonna be in the next
tutorial the easy way to see this is in
the parentheses that's what you're
getting back we're getting nothing back
in this method we're just doing stuff
setting something equals something else
in this method we're getting back an
object that's going to be the origin see
on the right hand side of the colon
that's what you give it in this method
we're giving it an origin object name PT
in this method we're giving it nothing
we're just getting it back this is a
greedy one so that's a easier way to see
it so anyways now that I said that in
the next tutorial we're gonna be typing
in all the data in Washington this
program actually run so thank you guys
