tutorial and in this tutorial we're
gonna be talking about well actually not
we I'm gonna be talking about a race
you're gonna be listening hopefully so I
don't mean arrays like well you need a
new job I'm talking about an array arr a
Y that's how you say it now what an
array is essentially all it is is it's
one variable that can hold many values
so say before we had an X and we set it
equal to 54 this is one variable one
value but in this store I'm gonna be
showing you how one variable can be
equal to many different values in this
case I'm gonna be making an array called
food I'm gonna be setting it equal to a
bunch of different objects now I'm also
going to be showing you since you have
one pretty much a variable equal to a
bunch of different objects how you
access each object it's actually pretty
cool and pretty useful so you know just
like before when we talked about mutable
and unmovable shrinks there's also a
mutable and unmute Bowl arrays now a
mutable array of course means that can
be changed immutable arrays means that
it has to stay the same throughout your
program now immutable arrays are hangul
are handled by the NS array class that's
the one we're gonna be creating today
will probably create a mutable array
later on and this is handled by the NS
mutable array class but anyways let's
make an unchanging immutable array so NS
array I'm gonna store a bunch of food
objects which is pretty much a bunch of
strings and in order to create this
create NS array that's the class you
want to name your array or variable
mines called food and in order to create
your actual ray put NS array make a
method and this don't make it it's a
built-in method called array with
objects plural don't forget the S right
there now sorry got whooping cough now
what you're able to do is you're be able
to pass in a bunch of objects and
they're all going to be stored in this
one
variable so let's go ahead and you know
let me think of some food I'll make it
in order so apples bacon let's see see
corn his food um let's see the doughnuts
do you know there are two different ways
of spelled doughnuts pretty cool huh
and uh might as well keep going let's
see II I can't think elfs I can't think
of any food that starts to these are and
uh fudge I'll name a fig why not and you
always need to signal your array with
key word and nil and this isn't when you
like print out your array it doesn't get
printed or anything it just tells your
array that this is the end of it so let
me first show you how to print out one
item in array how to access it NS log
all right the first thing I want to
point out is this your array is
referenced by each index so for example
this food array has one two three four
five six objects in it and remember each
time you're referencing something on the
computer program it starts with 0 so
this apples is food zero bacon is food
one donuts would be food three and this
phage would be food 2 2 3 4 5 so that is
how you access be like alright I'm
hungry for food too so this is 0 1 2
that means I'm hungry for corn got it
that's a my straightforward example of
how to reference array objects so let's
say we wanted to print out well let's go
ahead and just print out corn so go
ahead and press % @ to print out any
object and what do we want to print out
an object from the food array well
object object at index and then you're
right what index it is and go ahead and
press 2 and remember since you're
referencing these they're called the
index each member in array is called the
index
since you start with zero apples is zero
bacon is one and corn should be two so
when we print out object in the food
array at index two it should be corn so
let's go ahead and save this and check
this out
corn beautiful program all it does is
output corn let's sell this baby to
Microsoft so that is how you print out
each individual index but check this out
we could go ahead if we wanted to print
out all the items in our array and make
that line six times and print out
opposite fit index zero objects index 1
objects index 2 but a more efficient way
to loop through an array and print out
every object would be to build a loop of
course so let's go ahead and build a for
loop and this is the most common loop
for looping through an array so let's
create a variable just counting variable
called I and go ahead for I is less than
6
since remember 6 elements aren't right
but you don't want to set it equal to 6
because it starts with 0 not 1 so it's
going to be 0 1 2 3 4 5 and those are
your six numbers and then go ahead and
plus I plus plus the loop through you
know sequentially it's going to go 0 1 2
yeah you don't want to loop them two at
a time or anything but NS log and for
our print statement just put item at
index percent I and this is going to
give you what index you're at starting
with 0 ending with 5 and just put is
percent a so first we're gonna output
the index which is I 0 through 5 and
then we're gonna output the object so
food object at index in this pot I so
instead of passing a number in here it's
automatically gonna pass the value 0
through 5 and print out the objects
accordingly so check this out save item
and index zeroes apples item index do is
corn I'm an index for his elfs couldn't
think of a food and five is phage which
I'm at fudge but you know it gets the
point across so that is pretty much how
to loop through an array and depending
it what index the object is that print
it out accordingly
so uh yeah you might want to study this
code for awhile and once you figure out
kind of what an array is pretty much one
variable called food holds a bunch of
different stuff but uh yeah I mean
that's essentially it so again this is
an immutable array it can't be changed
in the next tutorial I probably create
an immutable array we're super mutable
it's a it's a little different but yeah
I'm gonna be copying the source code
posting it in the link below if you want
it so yeah thank you guys for watching
don't forget subscribe and definitely
check out the next tutorial it's gonna
be real helpful</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
