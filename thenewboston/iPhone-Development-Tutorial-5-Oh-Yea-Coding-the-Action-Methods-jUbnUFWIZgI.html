fifth iPhone development tutorial
iPhone development sorry are really
chugging along here and in the last
story what we did is we built this
property called labels text that pretty
much represented the text of the label
pretty clever I named it that and we
made it an outlet so I could actually
link to the object on the screen and we
actually created this method right here
called clicked and this is the method
that's going to be called whenever you
click one of those buns so we pretty
much just gave everything a title now
let's go ahead and add the brains to it
so in your implementation file of view
controller first thing we want to do is
go ahead and delete all these comments
what uh my buddy Steve Jobs was so kind
to do is include all of these methods
that he commented out these are some
methods that you make commonly use but
you know what we aren't gonna use them
in the store so any thing that has a
comment get rid of that you can go ahead
and delete these too but I mean four of
them I don't have time to delete all
those I mean they give you a nice little
you know message about what these
methods do anyways so anyways back to my
tutorial again we declared a property
called labels text and we use the app
property because we wanted to have our
program automatically build the setter
and getter methods and again I can't
stress this enough if you don't know
what I'm talking about
I explain everything in my objective-c
tutorials so anyways
go ahead Pat synthesize labels text and
by doing this this pretty much means
alright when you compile this
automatically build setter and getters
for this labels text property awesome it
selves it saves you like twenty lines of
code it automatically does everything
for you probably one of the coolest
features an objective-c so now that we
automatically have two methods already
how easy is that we actually need to
build this one method right here and
this is called clicked so go ahead and
copy the header and paste that and now
let's go ahead and add the body so like
I said this is the method whenever you
click the button
this is the method that's going to be
called so if we remember from my first
tutorial not my first tour but from my
last tutorial what happens when you
click the button well what happened was
it pretty much took the title of that
button and printed it out in a label at
the top of the screen so let's go ahead
and do that right now so as soon as we
call this method what we want to do is
we want to get the title of the button
alright Bucky how do you do that well
check this out we know that this
whatever it returns this is action this
isn't the method name but what is this
what is this crap ID sender why'd you
like that and what is it whenever you
click an object on the screen its sender
is automatically the thing you clicked
so if you clicked a label its sender
would be label if you clicked a red
button its sender would be a red button
so now we can use the properties of this
sender to mess with it so if you say get
the title of sender it's going to get
the title of the button if you click
button and so on and so forth so here is
what we can do we're going to want to
create an empty string NS in this string
by the way is going to store the title
of the button NS string and therefore
I'm gonna name it title of button yeah I
am that creative so go ahead and set
this equal to sender which is whatever
button we clicked it's gonna be sender
is that button and here's what we need
you this where it gets kind of confusing
but not really title for state this
pretty much is a method that returns the
property of the button now want things
to get even more fuzzy check this out
you know how a button has a bunch of
different states I mean it has a regular
state just a control normal state that
one's just chilling I'm screwing it also
has a state when you press it down it
also has a state when you you know slide
it I mean it has a bus a different
buttons there's just not one method for
a click button it has a bunch of
different states it can be so what you
normally want
is click you I control
I know control state normal there you go
and what this pretty much means is the
normal state of the button I know they
made the longest most confusing word but
this pretty much means your normal
button so now check this out what this
method does is it's going to return the
title of that button of sender so it's
gonna take that title and it's gonna
store it in a string called title of
button I mean this is a lot easier to
work with than all this once you say I
would so now what can we do now that we
have the title of the button well
remember what we wanted to do is we
wanted to print it out at the top of the
screen so let's go ahead and make a
another string bareboat NS string and
let's name this the new label text
because we're gonna be wanting to
replace whatever old labels there
whether it's a blank or an old label and
we want to replace it with this new
label so the thing we wanted to do is
take this new label instead equal to the
title of the button so let's go ahead
and NS string allocate some space and
initialize with format this pretty much
means what format do you want the string
in I just want to print out the an
object and title of button so this is
all we're gonna do so make sure you
lowercase Alec and check this out what
all the set is re now this new label
text this is just an object that prints
out the title of the bun so this is
pretty much just a string that prints
out the title of the button so now check
this out remember we have this labels
text property right now and since we
synthesized it unlikely bill setter and
getter methods for us
so now we can go ahead and do stuff like
that labels text and this is the label
on your screen the label that appears
that top the text now the property of
the text for a label is text so anytime
you want to change the text of your
label just go ahead and press whatever
label you're working with whatever
object dot text and now you can change
the text of the label so what we want to
set this equal to is new label text so
pretty much the title of the button we
click is now that new labels text easy
enough and that's it we're done with
this method the only thing we need to do
after this is take that object we
created new label text and release it
because I mean since we allocated it
anything you allocate or retain you have
to release that's the general rule so
remember check this out
remember we retained this property
labels text right here
well since even though it automatically
built those methods for us we still need
to pretty much release those objects so
what you need to do in your I mean this
is just housekeeping stuff right here
view did unload in here and make sure
you put this self dot label I named it
label text or labels text set this equal
to nil and you know you don't really
need to know what this means right now
just remember any well you know it's
I'll explain it another Tesoro it's kind
of taking like five minutes explain and
the only other thing you need to do
after this is in d alec method you need
to go ahead and release your labels text
remember as a general rule any object
that you either allocate specific memory
to take out a piece of memory from your
computer you need to give it back and
since we went ahead in
retained this it we're pretty much
saying hey computer let me hold it on in
that memory for a little bit so now when
we're done with it we go ahead and give
it back so again don't forget labels
text to release that set it equal to
Nell and of course build your object and
wanna know something cool we are done
with all the code that we had to build I
mean we went ahead and built this action
whenever a button gets clicked it pretty
much does everything for us went ahead
and typed these two little housekeeping
things now we're ready to jump in
interface builder and begin linking the
code to the objects and running our
program so you know that's it for this
tutorial thank you guys for watching the
next tutorial we're gonna sum everything
up tie it all together run our program I
am so excited so I will see you then and
yeah don't forget to subscribe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
