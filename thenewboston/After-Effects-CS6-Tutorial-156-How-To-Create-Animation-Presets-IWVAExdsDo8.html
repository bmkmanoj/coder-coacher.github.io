Effects cs6 tutorial
I'm your host buddy Blackford and today
we're gonna start talking about
animation presets and how you can save
them and create your own presets for use
so what a preset is is just a collection
of effects or it could even be masks or
anything like that where you anything
that you can basically copy and paste
you can save it as an animation preset
so the presets are generally found over
here in your effects and presets menu
you can also find them up here in your
animation and you go to browse presets
and you can find presets there and there
is a way to there are there's many ways
to save animation presets so I'm gonna
go over a few of those ways so you can
save your own presets for quick use so
if there's some things that you need to
use repeatedly with like through your
whole like video that you're making then
save it save it as a preset and you
won't have to go copy and pasting all
the time so what's going to happen here
is I've just got some text here and I
applied two effects to it fast blur and
bulge now you can just apply the effects
and not even do anything to them if you
don't want to or you can just have that
a different minor or major
transformation property differences here
so what I'm talking about just moving
these properties around so I've got
these two here and I want to use these
every time I have a text in my new
composition that I'm making so what I'm
gonna do is I'm gonna select these two
like this
using shift holding shift or control and
then the first way that and the quickest
way that I like to do this is to come
down to this little page button here and
it says create new animation preset
click on that and it'll bring you right
to where you can save your user presets
now if I just name this blur bold or
something like that and you want to make
sure you name today you know that's what
they're wrong do you want to be sure to
name your presets something that you'll
remember so you can use them later on
and remember what they are so I'll hit
save now if I wait for this to save and
now I can go ahead and use this preset
again let me delete these off so we can
throw the preset back on there I type in
blur underscore bulge it'll be under the
user presets folder and I can just drag
that right down there again and it's the
same exact preset that I had so there
are a few other ways that you can save
presets I think there's four ways so
I'll go over each one of those so we've
got the page button right here that we
can click on to save then the next one
we can use is going up here to animation
save animation preset and then it'll
bring us to the same area and you can
save your presets anywhere but generally
you want to just save them in the user
presets section it's makes just makes
sense and I mean unless I don't know you
might have another reason not to do it
but this is the default one that
everybody else is going to use so just
realize that
so I'm not gonna save it again since I
already have it the next way to do this
is to drag your whatever you want to
make into the preset over to the effects
and preset page here so if I drag these
over you can see that there's the two
rectangles and I just drag it over here
and that way you can save it that way
also now same thing just save it as
something you remember to use and let's
see the last one oh yeah the last one is
up here in this drop down menu from the
effects effects and presets panel here
make sure you have your effects selected
or anything else that you want to have
selected and come click on that and
click on save animation preset and to
the same page as it was before so those
are the ways to save your animation
preset and in the next couple tutorials
I'm going to show you the different
things you can add into an animation
preset so thanks for watching this one
and continue to keep on watching to
check out how to use animation presets
even better so see you guys later have a
good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
