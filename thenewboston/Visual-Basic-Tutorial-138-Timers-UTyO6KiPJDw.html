slash on live gamer for the new Boston
and in this tutorial we're gonna be
talking about timers so let's go ahead
and create a new project we'll go ahead
and select windows forms application and
we will set the name to timers so let's
go ahead and we will make the form a
little bit smaller we will add a list
box and two buttons so here's our list
box
we've got button 1 and button 2 so we'll
just make this a little bit bigger and
now all we need to do is set the text of
button 1 to start and then the text of
button 2 to stop we'll go ahead and come
over here to start and we'll set the
name to button start and then for stop
we're gonna need button stop okay so
let's come over here to our tool box and
we will scroll down and let's find the
timer so if you drop down your
components submenu right here you're
gonna go ahead and see the timer right
here so just like any of the dialogues
you don't need to drag it out on your
form because you cannot actually see it
so we'll just double click on timer and
you can see it has been added to our
form so let's go ahead and click on time
come over here to the lightning bolt and
we'll just double click on tick so what
the tick does is every time the timer
ticks and you can set the properties of
this and set the interval so this is
milliseconds so 100 milliseconds is a
tenth of a second let's just set our
interval to 5000 milliseconds which is
five seconds so every time the timer
takes let's go ahead and add an
to the listbox so we go ahead and do
private number as integer and we'll set
it equal to zero so whatever it takes we
will add it to the list box so list box
1 dot items dot add and we will add
number let's go ahead and just add 1 to
number so it's gonna add it to the list
box and then increment it by 1 now 5
seconds is gonna take a pretty long time
so let's just go ahead and shrink this
down to 1 second so we've got 1 second
1000 milliseconds now we'll double click
on the button start click and whenever
they click start we want to go ahead and
start the timer
so we'll September 1 dot start so it's
gonna start ticking the timer and
whenever they click stop let's go ahead
and stop the timer
so timer 1 dot stop so let's go ahead
and run this and if we click start we
wait a second and 0 shows up 1 2 3 and
this is happening at intervals of 1
second now if we did all of this at once
and added them all at the same time it
would be almost instantaneous but since
we are pausing well not really pausing
we're using a timer and every time that
ticks were adding so let's go ahead and
change the interval and we can see the
change in time so let's change it to 5
thousand milliseconds we'll go ahead and
click start
you can see we wait five seconds and
zero shows up if we wait another five
seconds the one's gonna show up so go
ahead and practice with timers they are
very useful you put the code that you
want to run in during each tick and then
you can have certain actions start and
stop your timer so go ahead and practice
with those and once you got those down
go ahead and move on to the next
