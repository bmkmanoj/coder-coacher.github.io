going to show you how to use the insert
tab to manipulate the text inside of
your web page so over here we see we
have the insert tab and we're going to
drag it over here until there's a little
blue line above your files and in
between your application bar then you're
going to drop it in and you see that is
when you probably when you pull it over
it will probably have the common tab
highlighted but since I was working on
earlier it it had the text one
highlighted already so as you can see
here we have all these different letters
so I want to go inside the body of our
HTML page and i'm going to type some
text sample copy i'm going to highlight
that and i'm going to click this be
which stands for bold and it wraps it in
the strong tax and that will make a copy
bolt what do the same thing highlight it
and then click the eye it's going to
turn that bold copy into italic bold
copy and here we have the paragraph
button so we can highlight this and it
will wrap it in a paragraph tag if you
have lots of text for instant this a lot
of text i'm going to copy and paste that
save that right here and i'm going to
copy and paste this whole tag it makes
underneath there so we have two
paragraphs refresh it you can see that
you can type a lot of text and you can
wrap it a paragraph tag and it'll space
it out for you you can also achieve this
same thing by using the brake tag and in
dreamweaver all you have to do is press
shift and then press enter and it will
insert a break in between your lines so
I just pressed enter again to get
another right tag I'm going to put that
underneath there I get on here in the
document design mart and it's going to
look exactly the same as a day before
because I have to break tags in between
there so if I take a break to hang out
you back down it's going to make smaller
shift in ER a break tag ends gonna make
you look like that's a paragraph so also
we have things called our lists or list
and the list items so for instance if
you want an ordered list
order list I should have typed in the
code but check out this paragraph tag
right here and I'm going to say a B C
I'm going to take these a B and C which
are the items inside to order list wrap
it in order list tag separate these out
you wrap an order list tag by
highlighting everything and selecting oh
well and now for each list item inside
of your ordered list you highlight it
and you click on li which stands for
list item save that and now we have an
ordered list and we can replace this Oh
with a you and that stands for unordered
list you could also do the exact same
thing by deleting those ul and selecting
all of your list items and then clicking
you oh now do you have the exact same
thing also you can insert break tags
here now bring space you see all these
different things inside this drop-down
menu right here also we have other
characters you can see are a lot of
different characters you can insert and
one thing that you use a lot inside of
this menu these things like the
copyright it shows you this simple
that's all you have to type in the code
to do that but without using code you
can just drag it down from over here
trademark and that's all the time I have
for this tutorial but it's basically a
short way to edit and manipulate text</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
