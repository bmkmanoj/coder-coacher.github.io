After Effects cs6 tutorial my name is
buddy Blackford and I will be teaching
you how to smooth out your motion sketch
so when we did the motion sketch before
it gave us a lot of keyframes and a lot
of hassle if you're trying to edit those
keyframes and the smooth ER on the
motion sketch down here didn't really
work so hot so I mean we didn't we
didn't really like it too much well I
didn't like it too much I guess so I'm
gonna show you how to a different way
how to smooth it out and to reduce the
amount of keyframes that you get so
let's start a motion sketch real quick
and I'll just make whatever keep going
and that's good enough now we got we're
gonna have all these keyframes if I hit
you it's gonna bring up everything that
has a keyframe and we can see that
there's a zillion of them there now
nobody wants to edit any of that stuff
so what we want to do is go up to the
window our window tab up here and click
on it and let's go to smoother and then
that smoother shows up here now you need
to go to your selection tool and select
the keyframes here and you're allowed to
use the smoother you have to have at
least three keyframes selected to be
able to use smoother now a position you
want to use spatial path because that's
like something around in space and then
temporal is for things like opacity and
that's temporal equals like time so what
we're gonna do is first we're just going
to leave the settings like they are
spatial path and tolerance at one I'm
going to hit apply and you can see that
that smooths it out a little bit but
like not a whole lot and it deleted some
keyframes so I'm going to hit control Z
and it's it moved the keyframes deleted
some so now we're gonna move the
tolerance up a little let's try like 20
or something like that
now let's hit apply and now you can see
how it's smooth way out more and deleted
a lot of keyframes making it a lot
easier for you to figure out how to edit
this and everything now you can still
edit all the keyframes and everything
and yeah I guess that's that's pretty
much it you can use the smoother on any
types of keyframes like if you have a
whole bunch of rotation or a whole bunch
of opacity keyframes that you any want
to just smooth out what's going on a
little bit better you can use it on that
also the smoother is only has two
settings here so there's not a lot more
to talk about for it so I'll end that
tutorial this tutorial and we'll move on
to the next one and a little bit see you
guys soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
