okay so now what we want to do is we
want to place this result which now
equals the return data of validate email
into our email feedback spam so email
feedback text result and we can do the
same thing just down here email feedback
dot text result so as I mentioned
earlier slightly inefficient because
we're calling the ver the function twice
and then using this twice to put the
same thing in you could take this and
apply it to another function that would
be slightly more efficient because then
you'd only have to again call this
function again we might do that towards
the end of the tutorial but for now
we've taken this result variable which
has the contents of validate email which
has the content of data which come from
the contents of email dot PHP so it's a
slight slide of data here and then we're
applying it to email feedback so let's
go ahead and check this out we click in
we get this message we've seen that as I
start to type we should be getting hmm
okay so it appears that something might
be wrong here
okay so let's
yeah that's ho look here okay so I've
returned this data just inside of here
so let me just put that down there
because we were returning it inside of
this function here which in turn wasn't
giving us this result value we need it
from the function let's go ahead and
test that again them sorry I click in
here and I start typing and we should be
okay so let's go ahead and do this
another way let's pull this function
down here and that's in here create a
variable called data returned and that
equal to data and then we'll return data
returned and we'll just double check
everything here so yeah okay let's see
if this works no okay so what we're
gonna what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
stick to I mean this is version
JavaScript now you should be able to see
how lazy jQuery makes me what I'll go
ahead and do is I will just take the
result here and that we did before or
take this email feedback selector let's
get rid of that and let's get rid of the
var in front of this validate email
function okay so I'll just go and
explain what we are doing now what we're
actually doing is removing the returned
value of this function and I'm just
calling the function itself now once the
data has been returned I'm gonna go
ahead and use a selector to select the
email
feedback span and then apply text inside
here which is the return data so the
validate email function returns the data
to this email feedback span so let's go
ahead and try that you can see I've just
started typing and I've typed Alex and
we have the text that doesn't appear to
be a valid email address then I go ahead
and continue typing and we would
retrieve this valid email address
message then when we come away from it
you see that it disappears however when
we come back it revalidate s' it so if
for example it was just Alex ah but as
soon as we click on here it revalidate
s-- the the text inside of there okay so
we've looked at a basic concept of email
validation obviously if you were using
this for every form field it would be
inefficient so some kind of function
that you would create to validate forms
based on their type would be better in
this case however in this we've just
demonstrated posting data to our email
dot PHP far from Ajax using our post
HTTP request and essentially they're
returning the data and putting it into
an HTML element here so that's just some
basic email validation in jQuery</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
