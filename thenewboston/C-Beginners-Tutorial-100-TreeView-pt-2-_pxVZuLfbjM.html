c-sharp tutorial that I mentioned for
the new Boston and in this tutorial I'm
going to be showing you how to remove
nodes from your tree view so aragón
need for this tutorial is a tree view
and two buttons you're also going to
need to have the code that we created in
a previous tutorial and this just
created all the nodes for our tree view
so let me win so one we debug here you
should just have all the nodes that we
created in the previous tutorial when we
click on this button yeah there's people
animals and ever spot right under the
underdog alright so now to get to the
moving nodes so the first thing we're
going to take a look at is removing a
node we have selected so we're double
click on button two right here because
we're going to have it remove the
selected node and we click that button
in order to get the node we have
selected I'm just going to type tree v1
are going to named your tree view and
then you're going to want to use
selected node property to get the node
you have selected and now we're just
going to use the remove method to remove
that node so now we should just remove
the node we have selected when you put
funny too
now select dog it should remove that
yeah select something inside of people
if you remove that as well
you can remove this whole people on to
it all right
so say you want to just clear your let's
be all completely just to eat every
single node in inside of it so that you
just do whatever you made your tree view
you nodes property and then just remove
all those nodes so use the clear
property or clear method to clear all of
those nodes from your tree view so when
we debug here it should just remove
every single node inside of the tree
view all these you should just remove
them all at once
yep just clear them all out all right so
you can I'm also going to show you how
to remove on nosy of checked off in
order to have check boxes appear in
front of each node to select your tree
view and go over to the
please panel and choose the checkbox
property to true and now we debug and
add our nodes you see that yeah there
are checkboxes in front of each one of
our nodes so in order to remove all the
nodes we have selected the person we're
going to do is create a new method to
remove all those I'm just going to call
our remove selected nodes they'll remove
check those all out all right and we're
going to have it pass through a tree or
tree node collection forever so on a
tree node collection of you like tree
view on dot nodes so to get see and then
we're going to loop through each one of
the nodes in the collection and see if
it's checked so I'm going to say for
each tree node inside of this collection
multiple of TN then we want to remove it
but what we're going to do is have it
add it to or add the node we want to
remove to a list of nodes and then it's
going to remove all the nodes at once so
I'll list I'm pre a list of three nodes
right here our analyst send people to a
new tree know the list so we're going to
use this list to store all the nodes we
want to remove so we will do TN the list
add that tree node so if the tree note
is checked then we're going to have it
added to this list are groups or just a
if P n dot then we'll just add it to
that list of tree nodes right here now
this will only work for ones that are in
the root of our tree no if you want to
have it to work for every single node
inside of our on tree view we're going
to have to use something called
recursion so basically we're just going
to recall this method from inside of
here but we're only going to have it to
do that if
the tree note has children so if there's
child nodes inside of it then we're
going to have it check those well so
we're going to say if this has nodes so
if there's nodes inside of this node
then we're going to have it recall this
method and pass those nodes through
again so right here we're checking to
see if there's any nodes so if there
aren't any nodes then the count of nodes
inside of it will be 0 but if there are
nodes or if this node does have child
nodes then it will prove to be true so
we're going to say if it has child nodes
and we wanted to recall this method and
check those nodes as well so we're just
going to say check I know we're just
going to pass through those nodes so now
we have to do this we can now remove all
the nodes from the tree view or from
this list right here that we want to
delete so it's going to do for each tree
node plus BN inside of that list and we
just want to remove a commentry utility
tree v1 dot nodes not remove and then no
yeah so now we debug here it should
remove all the nodes we have checked
no matter if they're inside another node
or not oh he never called it Alderaan
method got a fall move check and it'll
pass through the nodes inside of the
tree all right now we've done now we
have this dog checked off I should
remove that yep we select some of the
set of people if you remove that as well
if we wanted to select even three at a
time it should remove all of them yep so
that's pretty much it for this tutorial
so see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
