welcome to your twelfth tutorial and
this my friends is the tutorial that I
have been waiting for we're finally
going to begin talking about math and
math operators and all that good stuff
so a couple tutorials go I give you guys
a quick little taste of variables and
math operators and you saw that not only
can you set variables equal two numbers
and text but you can also set them equal
to simple equations for example 4 plus 6
uses the addition operator to set apples
equal to 80 so what it does whenever you
do this it knows that you're working
with numbers and it knows to add them
together to give you the answer so then
when you have document.write and you try
to print out apples it doesn't print out
the text 4 plus 76 it actually prints
out the value of 80 so in that sense it
knows that you're working with an
equation so that's pretty cool another
thing that you can do is you can't
you've not only limited the two numbers
you can go ahead and add 3 or 4 however
many you want so let's go ahead and the
answer to that is seven seven eight six
six six pretty cool long so let's go
ahead and delete all this and aside from
the addition sign you can also use the
subtraction sign I don't really need to
show you example of that because
hopefully you guys know how to subtract
well I do want to show you guys example
of is multiplication so the
multiplication might be a little
different than you guys would expect
it's actually go ahead and type like 54
or something it's not X don't ever use
the lowercase that's exactly the
asterisk sign just like that so 54 times
3 let's go ahead and see what that
equals 162 pretty cool
so anyways whenever you want to multiply
go ahead and use the asterisk sign
whenever you want to divide you can go
ahead and you use the forward slash just
like that
so 54 divided by 3 is 18 it goes in
evenly pretty cool
but what if you have a number like 56
divided by 3 that doesn't go in evenly
well let's go ahead and refresh this and
see we get 18.66 66 and finally it cuts
you off this 6 actually goes on forever
but
depending on your browser it's going to
cut you off after a little bit just like
my friend did lesson light when I had
too much brewskis but anyways it's going
to cut you off so that leads me to
another point what if you actually need
that remainder as a number itself for
example you were making a program you
said eighteen remainder 2 which would
the answer to this problem be well
anytime you want the remainder you need
to add the percentage sign and this is
called the modulus operator it basically
divides one value by another and it
gives you the remainder back so 56
divided by 3 is 18 remainder 2 so when
you save this it's not going to say 18
remainder 2 is just going to say -
simple enough let's give another example
25 divided by 7 is 3 remainder 4 but
it's not going to say 3 remainder 4 is
just going to say 4 pretty cool huh so
that is how you use the modulus operator
and the last thing I actually want to go
over it's not really a math operator at
all but it kind of is it's called the
increment and decrement operator and
this is how you can quickly add one or
subtract one from a single number so
let's go ahead and make a variable
called chops short for pork chops and
set it equal to 7 by the way I'm hungry
and let's go ahead in order to add this
you can add 1 to this variable in one of
two ways you can do chops
well I won't even teach you guys that
but you can do this chops equals chops
plus 1 so then it's going to say alright
this variable now equals 7 plus 1 so we
can go ahead and write document dot
right
chops you can actually do this another
way but I'm not going to cover that in
this tutorial so let's go ahead and save
this and did I this is chopped actually
it was going Laurel and singulair mixing
up can't do that so let's go ahead and
save this printout and we see that we do
hit indeed have eight first it was seven
then we added one to it we got a pretty
cool huh but see whenever you have
chopped equal child plus one it can get
kind of confusing so let me show you
guys an easier way to quickly add one to
a variable anytime you want to add one
to variable just go ahead and write the
name of the variable then write plus
plus and that's it that'll take the
number whatever it is say it's like 67
and then would add one to it and that
will give you a completely new variable
so let's go ahead and save this and now
chops is equal to 68 instead of 67 so
that is a way to change your variable by
adding one to it you can also write chop
- - this is the Dickerman or what's
called decrement whatever not decrement
that's a that's something else so don't
want to talk about that and see it was
67 before and then we took that variable
subtracted one from it so now chop
equals 66 and we printed it out on the
screen so again plus plus and minus -
they aren't really useful right now in
these examples but trust me
whenever we learn about loops and we're
going to learn about other stuff and
they're going to come in handy and we're
going to be using on the ton so that's
why I want to cover them now so when we
go over them later on you won't get
confused so thank you guys for watching
that's all I have for you guys for this
tutorial a simple tutorial about math
and simple equations well I got like a
piece of phlegm in my throat so anyways
thank you guys for watching don't forget
subscribe and I'll see you in my other
