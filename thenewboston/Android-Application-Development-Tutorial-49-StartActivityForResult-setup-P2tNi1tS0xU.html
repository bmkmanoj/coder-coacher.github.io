android tutorial for the new boston
again with me Travis
we're going to do in this tutorials work
within our open class or open class and
also our our data classes well kind of
get the basic setup for our start intent
for result for the most part start
activity for result so we're going to do
basically first is set up a new variable
or set up these up radio buttons to do
something sorry is reading something my
other computer so sorry if I was kind of
sidetracked there but what we're going
to do is basically set up a string
variable so we'll call this string we're
going to set up a new variable above our
class and we're gonna say send send data
that's we're going to call this so we're
going to set send data up within our
switch case down here we're going to say
these are kind of the answers for the
most part to do we set up an answers not
positive no all right so we're gonna say
send data we're going to say if it's
crazy we're gonna say probably right in
quotations copy paste definitely right
and both
we'll say spot-on oh no I hear a lot of
British people say spot-on
I think that's what they're saying I
don't know but we're that's we're going
to roll with so there we go we basically
set up our new text variable all we're
going to do is set up our test text view
that we set up up here I believe yet
test and that's the text view below all
of our radio buttons in our radio group
we're going to do that outside of our
switching case so we're just going to
say test dot set text this is just to
make sure our radio button is working
we're going to set it to our send data
so there we go
basically as you can see here's our
switching case but we're still within
our on check change listener right here
so basically it's going to go through
the switching case set this data up
according to which radio buttons pressed
and then it's going to break the switch
statement and it's going to call this
method where it's going to change the
test text so there we go basically set
that up and now we're going to set up
our just kind of messing around as well
we're going to set up our start activity
for result so how we're going to do that
is basically we're going to set up an
intent and well first let's use the
method start activity for results we're
going to say I because that's what we're
going to label our intent and now all we
have to do is basically start our
activity for results and we also have to
set 0 as well this is just kind of a
default value that that the start
activity for result takes in as we use
in the previous tutorial I believe we
set up a variable and we set that
variable equal to zero basically just
you can also use 0 it's just kind of a
default no biggie
and then we're going to set up an intent
obviously so we're going to call this
intent I
we're going to set it equal to basically
again the same way we set up our last
activity for the most part so we're
going to sit or yeah our last tutorial
believe it was so we're going to say
intent I equals new intent I'm just
going to copy this line here and again
it gives it the context of this class
and what class it wants to open so it
kind of has a reference and then any
time we use this start activity for for
result we need to import that method
basically on activity results so I'm
just going to right click again go to
source override implement methods and
this comes from our activity class so
we're going to say on activity results
right here again it takes in two
integers and an intent I'll break this
down more as we use this method but
basically we've set this method up now
and that's pretty much the end of the
tutorial again I'm just going to make
sure those radio buttons work and there
we go again I'll explain that a little
bit more in the next tutorial when we
work with actual passing the data and
getting the result data but we're going
to go through the start activity for now
and as you can see this test changes
with each click of the radio button and
it's pretty amazing for the most part so
I'll catch you guys in the next tutorial
have a good one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
