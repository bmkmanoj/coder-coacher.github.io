welcome to I don't even know what apart
this is but you'll see whenever I make
the title um and Assassin's Creed in
this is another assassins tune and it's
called ill do Mo's secret i would say
out duermo secret but i know that's
wrong now but anyways the first thing
you need to do in order to get in is
hire some occasions where you just saw
me do and go ahead and distract these
guards right here like hey baby what's
your name sure only my drop post see you
and then just go ahead and open the door
very fancy door in fact I wish are all
of the door handles were like that so
just go ahead and sneak in and now you
see some people and they're going to go
through a short dialogue real quick and
i'll let you listen in but this the cool
thing about this tomb is that there is
any guards it's just like a huge puzzle
that you need to navigate through and
the tricky part is not falling and dying
so make sure you stock up on medicine
before you do because if you don't you
don't want to have to die and you know
obviously the only thing you have to do
is not die so listen to this degrazia
stay away from the artwork on the walls
and when your men paint the dome take
care not to disturb any of the sacred
relics in the lanterna on top they are
the most important artifacts in our
church yes yes Padre just make sure to
pay us to pull some for our work and
then it's going to go ahead and show you
the box that you need to climb up or
pretty much a starting point so you
pretty much don't interact with any
other people during this game all you
need to do is sneak around the church
until you find the tomb and tomb is
actually at the top of the church weird
place for a tomb I know but go ahead and
accept
and go ahead and climb over to here and
climb that and my videos leg and for
some reason but it should be good so go
ahead and climb this and that and go
ahead to the right and get on top of the
door right there and now once you get on
top the door you're going to want to
have to hop up here and i always miss
this so you might as well just miss it
again and now what you need to do is go
around and climbing again I'll get this
time guarantee though there's two spots
i always miss and that's my first one
it's actually kind of cool they make the
first jump of one of the hardest jump so
um go ahead and go over to the beam see
ya laying on that and let me line it up
and then that's good right there so now
just go ahead and go to the right hop on
that and now you need to go and navigate
these wood planks you can go directly to
the chandeliers on the right so you need
to start out going the chandeliers on
the left and hop on one the chandeliers
right there go ahead and hop on those
and you can either jump over to that one
or this one doesn't matter but the goal
is to get the chandeliers on the other
side but like I said you couldn't just
hop directly on them before because I
mean there's just no way so go ahead
through here hop on that and now we need
to do is get to the point of that ladder
and once you do it's going to knock down
and this is going to give you a place
where if you fall off you're going to be
able to start and now I have a way back
up in case I fall yeah he said to better
than I did I'll way back up in case you
fall so it points you in the right
direction of where you need to go pretty
much the second level and now just go
ahead and turn around and you're going
to see some more wood planks that are
higher than the other ones so go ahead
and jump on those and those just like
that and now go ahead on to the other
cement blocks and go ahead and jump on
that other one and now you're going to
have to navigate through these wood wood
planks to as I'm just going to say what
blinks so you're going to have to swing
on these chandeliers make sure your
I know first so trying to turn in midair
and now you pretty much always go where
the pigeons are I notice so if you see
pigeons go there kind of like a homeless
man in New York City so go ahead follow
those chandeliers and get this wooden
beam right over there and you see pretty
much the cement thing against the wall
that we're going to need to go to right
there and also those wood planks to the
right-hand side and this mission
actually gets easier on the further we
get especially when you get real far
into it the first part is I mean the
most likely default so go ahead and hop
on the other channel layer and yep right
over there and these one chandeliers
right here and now you see scare those
pigeons and now you see I might fall
right here to go ahead and jump on that
and scooch all the way over to the right
because I mean if you overshoot that one
beam you'll still land where you need
land and it's not letting me jump I just
look like a gymnast swing in here so I'm
going to go ahead like I guess because
the art joy was in the way so now go
ahead and scooch all the way over to the
right and now when you jump it's going
to automatically land on that ladder
knock it down and you're going to
continue with the second part of your
mission which is going to be a second
video for me but you see the letter
knocks down and you're going to give a
message here that says you'll get it
trust me oh it gives you the entire tour
of where you need to go beautiful yeah
we're getting there by the way next door
so thanks for watching don't forget
subscribe i'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
