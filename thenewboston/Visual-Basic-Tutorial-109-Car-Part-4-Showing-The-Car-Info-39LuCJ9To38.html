slash on live gamer for the new Boston
and in this tutorial we're gonna be
working more on the card program now if
you don't understand what you see
already on my screen then you might want
to go ahead and move back a couple of
tutorials and start from the beginning
of the card car program tutorials okay
so now that I got that out of the way
let's go ahead and add a constructor and
a another method that we can use inside
of our car class now these are all
essential because we're going to be
using those in other classes that we
make by using inheritance so let's go
ahead and just make a simple method that
will or a function that will tell if the
car is moving so what is common this so
is the car moving and we'll type public
function is moving it's not going to
accept any arguments because we don't
need any and we will make it a boolean
type because the car is either moving or
it's not moving it's that simple so now
I'm going to test if test the speed so
if speed and we are accessing the
property speed right here so and this
uses what's called indirection to where
we're not actually accessing this
variable directly we're using this
property so if speed equals zero and if
that confuses you the indirection
concept then I'll be talking about it
later on and you've already been using
it a lot throughout your programs so
it'll be easy on understand what you
grasp the concept because you've used it
a lot so it's speed equals zero then
what do we want to do we want to just
simply return false
now if speed is anything else other than
zero then we're gonna go ahead and
return true now they can also be moving
at a negative speed we're just gonna
allow that let's say they're going
backwards now this technically isn't
right because they're always it's
possible to move at a negative speed you
always have to be going a certain speed
in one direction or the other but for
this program let's just allow them to go
backwards by using a negative speed so
if it's anything other than zero we'll
just simply return true now let's go
ahead and create a constructor so that
whenever somebody creates a new car
object it's gonna go ahead and set some
of these values for them so that they
don't have to do that so we'll just go
ahead and use the constructor so sub new
go ahead and enter and it'll add in sub
for us so let's just go ahead and set
some of the default values for this so
we'll set the color the speed and the
number of doors so color equals let's
make it red speed is going to initially
be equal to zero for here in speed it's
gonna be equal to zero and then int
number of doors let's go ahead and set
that equal to five and that's including
the trunk so you got four and then the
trunk so now that we've created our
constructor we can go ahead and head
back into form 1bb and you can see under
the form unload we don't have to set the
color to start with because it's already
done that for us in the constructor now
if you want to you can go ahead and add
some arguments for the constructor so
that when they make a new car object it
will set it to the color of the speed
and the number of doors that they want
so let's come over here and we'll add a
button and we'll just call it accelerate
so we'll set the text to accelerate
we'll set the name to button accelerate
and now I'll go ahead and access the
click event for that so just like all of
the other click events we're going to be
using an input box so we'll just type
default car
we're not default back color it keeps
doing that for me because it's not
selected so default car dot accelerate
and for the arguments we're going to
need an integer so what we're gonna do
is we're just going to convert a string
to that and the string that we're going
to be used is the string that is that we
get from the input box so input box
please enter the speed in miles per hour
to accelerate so this doesn't what to do
the title we'll just set it to speed and
then we'll leave the rest as default so
the first argument of our conversion is
going to be the string that we get from
the input box and now the second
argument we're going to convert that to
type integer so now I just need to make
sure that all of our parentheses line up
so I've got one there and we've got
another one right here
so we're gonna have to put let's see I
think one right there
or not let's put one right there ok so
now that we called accelerate let's just
go ahead and show the car info so we'll
just type default car dot two string now
I know I'm gonna get a lot of comments
about this saying like why did you
override to string to do this when you
could have created your own method that
shows the attributes of the car well the
reason I did this is to get you some
practice with the overrides and because
we're not going to be using to string
anywhere else in our deep
Carr class so if you called the default
card to string if we didn't override
that it would give us back something
that isn't useful to us at all so I just
decided to override it to give us what
we want it's only going to do that to
the class car and anything that inherits
it so let's go ahead and come back here
and we will run the program and see what
happens so we'll go ahead and we'll set
the name of the car - let's say Honda
CRV so we've got our CRV the color is
already automatically set and let's go
ahead and accelerate it by let's say 60
miles per hour and we'll click OK now if
we show the info info if we show the
speed I mean not the info we get the car
name the car color the number of doors
and the car speed now we can keep
accelerating let's accelerate by another
5 miles per hour you can see that it
gives us 65 miles per hour ok so before
this tutorial is over I want to give you
guys a challenge now what I give you
guys challenge is I feel it'll really
help you learn visual basic look on your
own if you do the challenges instead of
just moving on to the next tutorial so
what I want you to do is whenever the
person clicks set color and it has it
shows an input box I want you to set the
default response as the color that's
already there so let's see see you got
the default response a string is set to
nothing well I want that to be set to
the color the car is already set to so
if you figure out how to do that feel
free to leave a short video reply that
would be the best but you could also
just leave a comment and tell me how you
figured it out so thanks for watching
guys and stay tuned for the next
