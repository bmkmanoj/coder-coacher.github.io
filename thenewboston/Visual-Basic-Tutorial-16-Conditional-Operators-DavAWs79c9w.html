slash on live gamer for the new Boston
and in this tutorial we're going to be
covering conditional operators now
basically what conditional operators are
is testing to see if a value is either
less than greater than less than or
equal to greater than or equal to or not
equal to another value so let's go ahead
and get started we're going to go ahead
and create a couple variables up here so
we'll create a variable called is in
kindergarten as bullying and we'll go
ahead and set that equal to nothing now
we're going to create a couple other
balloons and now the reason we're doing
this is because we're going to see we're
going to use the person's age to
determine different things that they can
and can't do or whether they're at a
certain point in their life so now we're
going to do dim can drink as booing and
we'll go ahead and set that one equal to
nothing to and we'll dim is a or is
senior citizen as bullied and we'll set
that one equal to nothing to okay so now
what we're going to do is we're going to
prompt the user to put in their name so
we'll type console dot write line or not
their name their age what is your age
and now we're going to create a new
variable that stores their age so dim
age as integer and we're going to set it
equal to console dot readline so
whatever they type in is stored in the
age variable so now we're going to
create some if statements here so if
if age does not equal five then do this
so basically the not equals operator in
Visual Basic is the less than sign and
the greater than sign put right next to
each other now if you're used to any
other languages sometimes they will use
the exclamation mark equals but in
Visual Basic it's just like that
so if age is not equal to five then
we're going to go ahead and set is in
kindergarten equal to false and now if
it's anything else or if it is equal to
five then is in kindergarten is equal to
true so now we are going to create
another if statement so if age is
greater than or equal to 65 then we're
going to say that they are a senior
citizen so is senior citizen equals true
and now if their age is anything else
that's not greater than or equal to 65
which is pretty much stuff that's lower
than 65 then is senior citizen is going
to be set equal to false okay so now
we're going to come down here below that
and we'll make another if statement so
if age is greater than or equal to 21
then can drink
is equal to true and then else can drink
is equal to false so now what we're
going to do is since we have all of
these if statements made to set the
values of the boolean's we're going to
go ahead and create a string so we'll do
dim outcome as string and we'll go ahead
and set that equal to nothing or let's
do outcome kindergarten and now let's go
ahead and make a couple more of these
and let's do outcome senior an outcome
drink so now what we're going to do is
if age is not equal to 5 then outcome
kindergarten equals you aren't in
kindergarten
and let's just go ahead and copy this
right here and if they are in
kindergarten we're just going to tell
them you are in kindergarten now outcome
senior equals you are a senior or
citizen you are a senior citizen and if
they are younger than 65 then we're
going to tell them that they aren't and
now out come drink equals you can drink
because if age is greater than or equal
to 21
they can drink is equal to true and
since can drink is equal to true then
we're going to say that they can drink
and now else we're going to say you
cannot drink so now what we're going to
do after all of this is done we're going
to do console dot write line outcome
drink and outcome kindergarten and
outcome senior now let's go ahead and
add a couple spaces in here so out of
space right there in between it now this
will just make our outcome looked a
little bit nicer so that there's spaces
in between each one of the messages that
we have here
okay so now if we run this hopefully
everything works fine if we type in what
is your age okay there we go we got a
problem right there I always seem to do
this in the programs we're going to have
to add a console dot read line okay so
now if we run this it'll say what is
your age
and if we type in five you don't say you
cannot drink you are in kindergarten and
you aren't a senior citizen and now if
we do something like 21 say you can
drink you aren't in kindergarten and you
aren't a senior citizen and now let's do
this one more time say what is your age
will do 67 it'll say you can drink you
aren't in kindergarten and you are a
senior citizen
so make a couple programs using these
conditional operators they're very
useful when using if statement and then
once you've got that nailed down go
ahead and move on to the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
