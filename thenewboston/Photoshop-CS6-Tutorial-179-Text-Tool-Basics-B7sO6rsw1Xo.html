we're gonna start going over type tools
and we're gonna start having fun with
some text in our next few tutorials and
today we're just gonna go over using the
standard type tools in cs6 and there's a
couple of new things that I'm gonna go
over that are new to cs6 such as like
language options and different like kind
of panels and stuff like that so just
pay attention to all that stuff and I'll
try to point those out when I can I'll
point out the new thing so you guys can
see what the difference is and today
marks a special day outside which some
people might think it's good some people
might think that it's bad but it started
snowing today and honestly I like a
little snow before Christmas and
everything but after that the snow can
go away and I'd rather it be warm I like
having a white Christmas well let's go
ahead and get on to our text tools so
obviously you guys know that making this
around Christmastime I guess so let's go
ahead so we've got our text tools over
here where this T is so we've got four
of them there's a horizontal type tool
and the vertical type tool and then
we've got our mask tools that are the
same as these but they're just meshed
and then it just makes selections so go
ahead and select your horizontal type
tool and you can see that the hotkey is
T and just click and a little cursor
will appear just like any other like
word processing document or anything
like that and you can just start typing
and pretty much that's how the text
that's the basic way to do it
typing out text this is the easiest way
and quickest and that's what you'd be
using most of the time but there's other
ways that you can do stuff so let's go
ahead let's go to our other type tool
let's go to our vertical type tool
and you can see that the vertical type
tool here oops I need to select my layer
goes up and down like this and that
happened to be the perfect size that
fits on the page which is pretty cool
now every time you create a start a new
type new type you create a new layer so
every time I click it's gonna create a
new layer for you which is pretty handy
so we'll just bring out some text here
and let's start going over what's going
on so when you want to create type
there's three ways to create different
types you can click like I was just
showing you and then you can enter a
line of text either horizontally or
vertically like I was just showing you
can click and drag to enter a paragraph
bla bla bla bla bla bla bla so that's
how you make a paragraph and then I can
switch to a different tool and it'll
change out of my paragraph and now I can
move this entire paragraph around and
you can also click on a path so if we
make a path let's just make a path
that's good enough
and if we check out our path we got our
work path there and then I'm bringing my
type up and if I click it and it changes
to this cursor here hello MA
well it'll type along the path and if I
can move this point here we can we're
able to type along the path and I'll
show you ways to fix it up so it'll type
out better than that and everything like
that so here's the path can make another
point there too so as you can see that
and then you can adjust your path and
everything and all your points to
actually write on the path but I'm just
showing you that you were able to do
that now so that which is pretty cool
and I'll just delete these out because I
don't want them there and we'll take
this out of there all right so let's go
over some of the options that we've got
here if I click on my type tool and make
sure my layer is selected and then click
within there you can edit in between if
you want we've got our cut our text
fonts up here and you can see different
samples on the right which is helpful if
you select your font here or your type
here and start going through different
texts if you click on font and then use
your up and down keys on the keyboard
when it's when everything is selected it
will switch through these really quick
and you can get like previews of your
different fonts alright and some fonts
you're able to change the type of font
let me get a different font that's more
basic there we go so we got like our
italics our pulls and then
other variations and we've got our font
size here you can use some of the
previous um of the fonts that are
already there set for you or you can
type in a font or you can use drag on
the t's here to move your phone up and
down which is nice we've got our
different font like features here sharp
crisp and they'll just let give your
phone a little bit fine-tuning and then
we've got our paragraph options up here
so this is a center paragraph so if I
start typing
let me start typing on something new
it's going to type from the center and
go out if I go from the left
everything's gonna start typing from the
left and if I come here from the right
it's gonna start typing up from the
right like that so keep that in mind
when you're typing and that'll help you
keep things centered on your page so
they don't go off like that we're doing
on mind we've got our color here which
is self-explanatory
then we've got different warp texts so
if I select this and I want to make warp
it a little we've got some different
things going on we can do an art and
they'll do that for us and then you can
mess with it if you want depending on
the way you want to do it and that's
good for it to go over for now so that's
a little introduction into text let me
check my notes to see if there's
anything else I want to go over alright
there's a couple other things so if I
click on my text here and then I move
away from the text and click and drag I
can move the text around easily without
having to go up to my tool the move tool
up here if I double click it'll select
the words so it'll select like a group
of words for you which is
handy if you wanted to go fast so if you
want to delete a key at a time you can
just hit the backspace key if you go in
the middle here you can hit the Delete
key on your keyboard to delete things in
the middle and if you want to delete
everything select everything and hit
delete or backspace as well and then
once you click off you can see that the
layer name will change and you just have
layer 1 or layer 2 or whatever the layer
number is and the last thing I wanted to
show you was you can change the language
on here so if we go to this button up
here click on it it'll bring up our text
options you can also click on the
character here and then alright you can
change your language here and then
you've got some other options here that
we'll go over at some another point but
that is the basics of text and that's
we're gonna start out with today so
thanks for watching the text basics
tutorial and the standard typing tools
so let's get into more advanced stuff in
our next few tutorials so see you guys
there have a good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
