thirty-eight c-sharp tutorial that I'm
making for the new Boston and in this
tutorial we're gonna finish working on
our button so the first thing that we're
gonna do is make it so that when the
user clicks on the button or holds their
mouth down on the button the button
turns at the yellowish-orange
so what we're going to want to do is go
over to our control designer scroll down
on the offense to Mouse down and then
just double click on that to create a
new event handler for it alright so what
we're gonna do is just basically redraw
the button with a yellowish color and I
already have that yellowish color all
written out so you don't watch me figure
out what color we want and basically to
make this yellowish color I just added
15 to the red to make it more red I took
away from the green to get less green
and set the yellow to 150 and that I
mean they blew the 150 and that all
together made it like a yellowish orange
so now that we have our color all set up
all we have to do is draw the button
with that color in the safe draw button
and then my color so now when we go back
to our form right here and be bug click
our button see it's yellow and then when
you release the mouse it's not yellow
anymore it's reset to the default all
right so now we're basically done in the
bottom the only thing that we're gonna
do now is make it so that the user can
choose what color their button is so
we're gonna do is go back to our button
and create a new property for the color
of your button so we're just going to
say a public color bucket in color and
then we're just going to set up color up
here by the color variable so that we
can get and set that so it's gonna say
color I'll call it so now we can set
this is my button colors and say my
button color equal value and we're just
going to hit and then turn the of my
button color alright so now that we have
this button color setup user can choose
the color for their button
so instead of using this control color
we can use the color that you are
selected smooth my button color same for
down all right so now let me go back to
the form and we build here arranged in
an area and that's because where the
color is default is set to white and mom
we cannot subtract 30 and like five from
white because that would make it
negative or make it like negative zero
so what we're gonna have to do right
here is when we set it we're going to
have to call this draw button method and
if there's an error we are basically
just going to tell the user that they
need to choose a valid color so it a try
and do this draw button method we're
going to call it and we're gonna pass
through the button color and then if
there's an error we're just going to
catch it and tell the user that they
must select a valid color so we're just
going to say message box show alright
and then if it once it catches it we're
just going to set this my button colors
equal to the default value which is just
control so I'm going to say my button
colors color from known color and then
just that control all right so now when
we go back to our form and
it's going to say that we need to choose
a valid color and instead of it just
crashing it changes the buttons color to
the default so now we change use a
button color like this active caption
right here it changes it perfectly for
us
now let me be bugged still have that
color and you can obviously set
properties for like when the user
selects it and then the user puts it as
well for those colors but I'm not going
to get it to you guys
basically I already know how to do it so
that's pretty much it for this tutorial
so see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
