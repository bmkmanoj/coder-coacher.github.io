tutorial and in this tutorial I'm gonna
show you guys how to build a time class
now what time class is is it's pretty
much a separate class that has a bunch
of different time functions and I'm
going to allow the users to enter three
numbers one for the hour minute and
seconds and it's going to convert that
in military time and regular time and
we're going to be needing this
information for a next couple tutorial
so make sure you build this with me so
first let's go ahead and our tuna class
right here make sure you're outside your
main class and I'm going to go ahead and
build three variables and they're going
to be private variables so not private
private same thing right and make sure
they're integer variables one for our
and another one for a minute and another
one for a second so just copy that
because I'm lazy and turn this one a
minute and turn this one a second so now
we've got three private variables but
now they have no value so what we want
to do is give them a value and we're
going to do that by letting the user
input the numbers so let's go ahead and
make a method to do this so public void
since it's not going to return anything
it just named a set time or you name
anything you want but this is also going
to take three arguments in H for our and
M for minutes and in s for second so
it's going to take three arguments but
we just don't want to let them enter any
number they want since the hour has to
be between 0 and 24 the minute has to be
between 0 and 60 since that's how many
minutes are an hour and the seconds also
have to be between 0 and 60 so what
we're going to do is check this data
before we enter it so let's plan our is
equal to and instead of just H let's go
ahead and check it so let's go ahead and
write let's just do this
Wow would you look at that if our is
less than or equal to zero and you have
to make a hand because it needs meat to
conditions and my ampersand is on seven
I put a bunch of stickers on my keyboard
for After Effects so now I can't see
them as symbols I have to look at my
laptop for it so and now if our is less
than 24 so if it's between zero what the
heck just happened there
I've caps lock on our sum no just a
funky little thing all right now our is
less than 24 there we go a mess up that
time so if these two conditions are met
and the question mark are these two
conditions met then our if not zero and
why is this little green bar right here
there we go
must've been something with my screen
recorder so here's what we're seeing
right now if our is greater than zero
and it's less than 24 then you can go
ahead and use that number if it's not
then go ahead and by default just put
zero so we don't mess up our whole
program just because they entered a
wrong number
so now we need to do this for min and
second so let's go ahead and change
minutes and changes the m and change
this to M in this to M and then go to
guess what we're going to do next second
it changes the s and this s and this
test and make sure this hms matches
whatever you put up here and now don't
forget to do this instead of 24 go ahead
and change these to 60 I know you got to
change all this it probably would have
been faster just to type it by hand but
well we didn't so too bad so now that we
got them to enter a time and what this
is going to do when we call this method
right here they're going to enter three
numbers is arguments so what we want to
do is repair must set the time right
there but we have no way to display it
so the first way I'm going to display it
is through military time so and that's
the time where you don't you can use
like 12 to 24
so you'll see what it is later so public
string since it's going to return a
string since it's going to display
something obviously to make sure I had
to spell military right and it's going
to take no arguments so I'm just going
to display and in the body I'm going to
return string format and remember our
format takes two arguments oh the added
appointment for us how kind delete those
kind but not kind enough would you fill
in the rest of it for us it's going to
take
and remember in here you need to put
percent and where's my % above the 502 d
:
% o 2 D : % o 2 D make sure I got that
right and what this is going to do is
display the first one in two decimal
places and then add a colon display the
second number two decimal places then
add column to display two seconds at two
decimal places and after that let's just
go ahead and add what we want to put in
our minutes second and now that they're
set right here we can display them down
here so now just add a colon after that
and now we built everything we need to
do so now we can go to our main apples
method right here or Apple's class
excuse me and we can begin building our
objects since this was the tuna class we
need two tuna object for that so tuna
tuna object and remember you need a
object so you can use the crap inside
the class so equal new tuna and first
let's just go ahead and even though we
didn't set a time yet we can go ahead
and display the military time just see
what it has for default so system out
and let's just go ahead and print line
and put tuna object
- or was it to military there we go to
military and so we didn't set a time yet
so whenever we run this make sure I
don't have any X's anywhere it should
give us all zeros by default so yeah
save those and look that by default we
get all zeroes right here so now now
that I lost my screen recorder oh man
hopefully it's somewhere in there
whenever I run this program my screen
recorder goes behind my java so I have
no idea what's going on right now oh oh
well anyways that's really annoying but
anyway so let's go ahead and set the
time now so tuna hopefully you guys can
see this object and now we can go ahead
and press set time and of course this is
going to take three arguments and let's
go ahead and press something like 13 for
hour and 27 for minutes and 6 for
seconds and now once you run this system
out well we can just go ahead and copy
this since real lazy copy once after we
set it we can go ahead and run this
again and hopefully if I don't have any
errors we can go ahead and see right
here the first one was zero that was
before we set the time and the second
one when we set the time right here
13:27 6 what that did is converted all
to military time and now I can see my
screen recorder but still behind so now
do my screen recorder is messing up got
to remember fix that somehow so now let
me show you guys what we did in our set
time 13 27 and 6 we weren't right here
passed these in right here 13:27 and 6 I
checked if 13 was between this it was
which sect if 27 was between this and 6
was between this since it was it used
all the values and set them in an hour
minute and second and that was when we
put print to military
pretty much a display method it pretty
much just put them in this format and
displayed them out to us as you can see
here so in the next tutorial I'm gonna
be showing you how to use not military
time regular American time or I don't
know what it's called just regular time
I guess so um thank you for watching in
the next tutorial you definitely want to
watch because we're going to need that
information
probably for next couple few tutorials
so again thank you guys for watching
don't forget to subscribe it and now see
you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
