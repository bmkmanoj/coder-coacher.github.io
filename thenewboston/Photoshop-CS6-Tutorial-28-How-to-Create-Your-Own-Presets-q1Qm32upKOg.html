Photoshop cs6 tutorial
I'm your host buddy Blackbird and today
I want to show you how to create your
own presets and in this one we're going
to start creating our own tool preset so
I work with a lot of video and I wanted
to create some a preset a selection
preset that I could use to create
vignettes on my videos easily so what I
did is I created a new document and let
me just up just close out of this one
and start from scratch
let's go to new document and I'm going
to type in video for my name and my
preset is going to be film and video
HDTV so this I usually work in HDTV so I
want to use this as my preset so I'm
going to hit OK and what I want to do is
take the selection tool and click on the
elliptical marquee tool I'm going to
drag from the corner here and I'm going
to hold down and I'm going to notice the
dimensions down here next to my cursor
says with twenty six point seven seven
eight and height 14 point nine eight six
so basically 27 by fifteen inches or I
could just do 1920 by 1080 but here
we're going to drop that down there I'm
going to come up here to style and this
is just to customize my certain
selection that I made right here so I'm
going to go to fixed size I'm going to
inside pixels so I want to do 1920 by
let's go to
ten eighty and that'll keep it so that I
can just click and it'll put this down
where it's supposed to go now I'm going
to come over here to the drop-down menu
and come over to this paper thing right
here and this is how we create a new
preset so I'm going to click on it and I
can name this I'm going to name this
HDTV or HDTV vignette I'm going to hit
OK and now I have this up here in the
preset in my preset list so I'm going to
deselect this right now that I have I'm
going to come up to my preset click on
it double click on it come up here in
the corner click and now I have a preset
to just click and it has my vignette
already made which is awesome now I
don't have to spend time every time
drawing out like the perfect vignette or
anything like that
so that's pretty easy there we can come
over to our tool panel so I can go over
to view or window and tool presets and
we can also select the preset from here
and create a new preset using this
button here so this is our tool panel
down here so that's really nice so
that's how you make presets you can make
them with your brushes you can make them
with your gradients or swatches or
styles or patterns or whatever else you
need to make presets with so good luck
making those and use it to your
advantage this speed up your speed up
your workflow so thanks for watching
this one it was a pretty quick tutorial
actually which is pretty sweet
so you thanks for watching again see you
guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
