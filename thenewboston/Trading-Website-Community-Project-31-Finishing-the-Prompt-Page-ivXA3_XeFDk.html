where we are gonna be building that
great message function very simple
function so before we get to that the
first thing that I forgot to do is
actually link to the main or not the
main the prompt CSS file so perhaps CSS
there you go how easy was that so now
the last thing we have to do is create
this create message function so what
this function consists of is grabbing a
value from the browser or the URL rather
and when we have that value we see what
that value is in output a message to the
user so of course the first thing we
need to do is we need to grab that value
from the URL and store it in a variable
called X so in order to do that just go
ahead and use the get get and value is
called X and now remember that value
stored in the variable X so we can go
ahead and create a function and pass in
that value of X into it so let's just go
ahead and copy this to save us some time
and function I'm gonna name it great
message and as you can see whatever
value we grab from URL gets passed in
there so now all I have to do is we need
to create a switch statement to switch
this value in have a bunch of different
cases but before we do that I just want
to do a little bit of security and test
if the value is in the marek so let me
go ahead and do this if is underscore
and um how do you spell numeric there we
go looks about right and I'm gonna pass
in the variable X now the reason I'm
doing this is just to make it a little
more secure I only want to run this
switch if the value is a number if they
threw some text into there or they were
goofing around and tried to hack our
website then this bit of code isn't
gonna run and that helps prevent against
injection and maybe some crushed ice
script in and stuff like that so either
way now that we got the boring stuff out
of the way here is the main meat of the
tutorial and that's the switch statement
so for the switch just go ahead and pass
in the variable X so it's basically
going to see what value X is and in the
case of zero I already know all these
values but uh and I hit the insert case
zero what do we want to do well what
we're going to be doing is we're going
to be setting a variable message equal
to a bunch of different messages and the
one that it gets set equal to is
obviously the one it's going to output
so let me go ahead and show you guys
that are ready now message equals and
let me think about this for a second
instead of you watching me type you know
ten different cases or whatever it's
probably going to be more interesting
for you and more beneficial if I just
pause the video write all the cases and
then come back or else you guys are
probably going to get bored and leave so
let me just go ahead and pause the video
right now and I will be back in one
second all right I went ahead and typed
them in another file so go ahead and do
that right now oh oh look how quickly I
type that and indent that and good to go
so as you can see I know that a lot of
these cases don't make sense because we
were not done with a website but when
the website is finished and complete
then here's what we're gonna be doing
like I said on the prompt page instead
of making a brand new web page for every
single time we need to give the user a
message what I did is we're just gonna
have this one prompt page pass them in a
value in depending on what value it is
it's going to give us a custom message
so for example whenever their account is
finally activated we give them this
message and give them a link to their
login page right after they register as
we created in the last file we say this
thank you for registering an email has
been sent please click on it if they
have an error message and the username
or email is already taken then we give
them this message so what we did is
we're only going to create this message
variable instead of equal to whatever
value we needed to be and of course when
we're
done with a switch what we need to do is
we need to actually display this message
so don't forget this it's crucial echo
message BAM look at that so now what we
can do is slap our hands together pat
ourselves on back in Currin gratulations
because this is done so I'm gonna go
ahead and open the FileZilla refresh
this and upload prompt in the new CSS
file and we can test this out right now
so hopefully I didn't mess up anything
or else I'm gonna be pretty mad so now
let's just go ahead and refresh this and
check out what happens username I'll
just put Tony let's give it a fake one
Tony at yahoo.com and give it a password
of password and submit it and check it
out instead of just giving us that error
page that says hey your file doesn't
exist we get a nice prompt page that
says thank you for registering account
for a confirmation email has been sent
to your email please click on the
activation link to activate your account
and if we verify in our database
hopefully oh yeah look at that
everything is going beautifully Tony is
now in temporary users his email
password in activation code it's all in
there now all Tony has to do is click on
that link in his email in well nothing's
gonna happen because we didn't create
that yet but eventually we will and
that's where we're gonna be working on
in the next soil so for now thank you
guys for a while watching you can close
out your prompt pages and your register
pages and go take a break and when we
come back we're going to be working on
the next step of this website</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
