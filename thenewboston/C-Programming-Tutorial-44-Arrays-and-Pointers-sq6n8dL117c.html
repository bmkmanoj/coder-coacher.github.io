basics of pointers and I also taught you
guys how to dereference a pointer to
pretty much get the value that it's
pointing to I now want to talk to you
guys about arrays and pointers in the
real relationship between them and by
the real relationship I mean that
there's more to an array that meets the
eye
so quote that write it on your wall
don't forget it
I'm going to show you guys what I'm
talking about right now so what I'm
going to be doing is creating a basic
array and looping through it and showing
you guys the details of each element
just like we did in the last tutorial
and then after that I'm going to be
showing you guys a really cool trick and
it's something that is probably going to
blow your mind
so of course I'm going to name my array
meatballs and it's going to have five
elements and set these equal to any
number I'll put my like seven nine 43213
the elements actually delve you even
matter just make sure you have five
integers in there whatever pops into
your head so now make a basic loop you
know put I equals zero I is less than
five and I plus plus so this is going to
loop five times and for each loop or
iteration we're going to print out this
the first thing is basically we're going
to put zero through four in here and
this is just a little indicator of what
element or on so since we pretty much
have to throw I in there is going to be
zero to four so it's decimal and then I
guess we'll just print each on the new
line so tab now for each element I want
to show you guys the memory address of
each one so percent P and that's going
to print the memory address and tap it
one more time and the last thing is of
course each elements value which is
going to be 7 9 4321 and 3 so those are
integers so we just use percent D now
for the first one we can just throw I in
there now for the memory address of each
one remember anytime we want to print
out a memory address you use
and % and meatballs and that's I write
in there so that's going to print out
the memory address of each element and
to print out the value of it which is
right in here
of course we just do that and I actually
want to kick each of these on a new line
and let me bump that to a new line to do
I want to actually do this right now
it'll just print out each of these but
I'll give you guys a real quick
indicator of which each one is and this
will be good for um if you're just
copying and pasting the source code on
the forum so the first one is the
element the second one is the memory
address and the third one is the value
and on a new line will print everything
out so as you can see I made a simple
program to loop through each element in
the array and it prints out the value of
it and also where it's stored the memory
address of it but if you remember I
already did this in the last couple
tutorials we already saw that variable
memory address value this is basic stuff
so why the heck would I waste the whole
tutorial showing you guys this for an
array well it's because of this line
right here what I want to do is add one
more print statement and inside here
actually want to put this between two
new lines what I'm going to do is type
meatballs and a tab and % P and now of
course actually let me tap that twice
since we have three columns up here and
now of course this is going to say
meatballs and then it's going to give
the memory address of meatballs so I'm
going to print this out and you're like
oh one second Bucky you got a little
mistake you told me that whenever you
want to print out the memory address of
something percent P you need to use that
ampersand sign right there
not then you're going to have a real bad
time but look what happens whenever I
run this it prints out the memory
address just fine so this is the first
kind of key concept I want to talk to
you guys about for every array the basic
name of it without any elements or
brackets after it an array name is just
a pointer to the first element in the
array so I don't know if you guys notice
that but whenever I ran this meatballs
just the name meatballs and nothing else
is equal to 0 0 2 a Fe f8 well if you
look up here that is also the memory
address of the first element in the
array so the word meatballs is a pointer
to the first element it kind of blows
your mind but that is why we don't need
that ampersand sign because this already
is a memory address we don't need to
explicitly tell it to get the memory
dress because that's what it already is
so I just so it sticks in your mind
there it is one more time now another
thing I want to point out is what we can
do is since this is already a pointer we
can go ahead and dereference it now
whenever we do reference this remember
it basically goes to ever it's pointing
to and it gets the value of it so if we
just dereference the meatballs and
nothing else it would get 7 kind of
weird but if you watch this tutorial
twice then you're probably going to
understand really easily what's going on
so let me add some comments right here
so you guys don't get confused
I'll put array names um are just so
array names are just pointers to the
first element now down here I'll put
dereference it I always have to remember
to put the extra e so um I guess I'll
just print this out right now so
everything looks good except on this
line what I'm going to print out is
asterisks meatballs which is basically
going to dereference meatballs and check
it out
and that is the pointer and we actually
want D because it's getting the value
and check it out
so meatballs just the name meatballs is
the memory address of the first element
meatball zero so whenever we dereference
meatballs what it does is it goes to
wherever it's pointing to which is this
one meatball zero and it gets the value
of it so the reference to meatballs
equals seven now the last thing I want
to point out is a concept that we're
going to be using a lot and it's also a
syntax that you're going to be seeing a
lot whenever people dereference um
arrays specifically it's this whenever
we dereference meatballs plus to put
that code or right over here so let me
run this and look at it now what we're
going to see a dereference meatballs
plus two is 43 and I'll show you guys
why this is what happens whenever we
made this or array is we're basically
saying fill each block in memory big
enough for int so what we're saying is
we're going to dereference meatballs
plus 2 so go to this pointer which is
basically a pointer to be ball 0 add 2
to it 1 2 and since it's the reference
get the value of that which is 43 so
again we can do this all the way for
meatballs 1 2 3 or 4 because we have 5
elements in our array so I know that
this is kind of confusing but if you
either watch its tutorial again arm or
just I don't know just try typing
everything out yourself then you guys
are going to see basically what I'm
talking about so just to sum up
everything for you guys the core concept
of this tutorial is this the array name
has a special meaning an array name is
just a pointer to the first element in
that array now whenever you dereference
the array name
what it does is it ghost that element
and it gets the value of it so a
dereference the ray name is the first
value in your array and of course if you
want to loop through or get other values
in the array you just let the array name
plus however many you want dereference
that and it gives you the value so I
guess the only thing you guys are
wondering about now is okay this is
interesting arrays are pretty much like
pointers but still what the heck can I
do with them this is just like
information that I'm never going to use
so who the heck cares
well I know I promised that in this
tutorial I'll show you guys something
useful but in the next tutorial what
we're going to be doing is I'm going to
be beginning showing you guys why all of
this information is actually um useful
whenever you're making programs but for
now thank you guys for watching don't
forget subscribe and study this when
it's stuck in your brain you're ready to
move on to the next video so thanks and
I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
