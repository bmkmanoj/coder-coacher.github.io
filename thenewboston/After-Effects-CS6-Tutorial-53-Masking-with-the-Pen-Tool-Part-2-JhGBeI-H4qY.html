with the pen tool it's called the mask
feather tool right here and I'm gonna
turn back on my shapes
paths there and if you hover if you have
the mass pen tool selected and you hover
over like this we got to click on it you
have to click on it first you hover over
any drag you can feather out your mask
like this now why would you want to do
something like that well sometimes if
you have like a person that's moving
their arm if you go frame by frame you
can you'll see that they're really
blurry so I'll show you an example of
that real quick let's bring up some
footage here where's my video here this
will go to that club Club footage that I
have
mmm scale it down a little because
it's gonna move to some an area where
there might be some blur oh here we go
here we go now you can see his hand is
really really blurry so if you try to
roto out his hand you try to make a pen
your pen tool around his hand here I
mean how you really gonna figure out
where to get how to get this stuff so
get get everything that seems like it's
in the view there then you can take your
your mask feather tool and and feather
out so it gets it gets the blur and that
way
you can include the motion blur in there
so so it looks real like if you're
trying to just like rotoscoped that
whole person that whole person out so he
doesn't look like chris but when he's
moving that's gonna look fake so that's
how you use the mask feather tool you
can move this little point around to
adjust your feather there now if you
don't want the mask feather tool to
feather out just at one point you can
come to another vertex point here and it
creates another feather point there so
this side can come out way farther than
this side so here you go and that that
works well well that works well when
you're trying to when when the hand is
like I'll show you the look at the hand
real quick you can see that this part of
the hand has more feathering to it than
say this part of the hand so add another
one here maybe I did look another one
there and you you fine-tune your mask
tool there that way
the mask feather tool is a new tool in
cs6 so I I'm gonna bring up this adobe
help here so you can you can read about
the the new mask feather tool so if you
look at this if you need any more help
figuring it out here's the link and
here's about the mask feather tool and
I'll do another tutorial on the feather
tool on itself that way we can learn the
new stuff about about a cs6 so that's it
for now for this tutorial we'll head on
to new parts of masking and then in the
next tutorial hopefully you guys can
apply this to your next project have a
good one and stay safe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
