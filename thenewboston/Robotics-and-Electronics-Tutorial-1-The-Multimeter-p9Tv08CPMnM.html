welcome to first tutorial in electronics
in robotics now over the series of this
tutorials we're going to be building a
robot and I'm going to teach you how to
build a robot with all the parts mean
and in the meantime I'm going to be
teaching you some electronics because
it's pretty essential to learn how to
build a robot but don't worry I'm going
to make it real easy for you guys so
there are a couple things that you guys
can do you can watch all these tutorials
and just watch me build a robot and
learn all the information or you can go
along and you can build it with me now
if you want to build along with me
there's one um critical measuring device
that you need and this is called a
multimeter this is what it looks like
right here and it's called a multimeter
because it because because it measures
multiple things it doesn't just measure
volts or power or resistance or
something like that it measures all of
it
so if you want to build a robot and get
into electronics you definitely need one
of these is your most important tool you
can have so like I said it pretty much
can help you to measure the voltage and
the power test if you have any broken
parts or anything like that um but
before you just go and buy any old
multimeter I'm going to call it a
multimeter for a lot just because that's
how they said not important it's called
a multimeter but if I say multimeter you
know what I'm talking about
anyways a couple things that you want to
look for when buying one of these number
one make sure it's digital and not
analog let me see if I can get here and
that means you see the screen right here
whatever you measure you're going to
have a digital value that pops up analog
means that you're going to have that
little needle that swings back and forth
like the gas gauge on your car is
probably analog has a little needle it's
going to be pretty hard to read when
you're measuring so please please please
make sure you get these
another thing when you're buying make
sure it comes with probes and it seems
pretty obvious that all will come with
probes but believe it or not not all
multimeters come with probes and you
kind of need these are really important
these are things that connect to your
circuit to test um another thing make
sure that it's auto-ranging
if it's not it's not that big a deal but
see how it says auto-ranging right there
if it says auto-ranging anywhere on it
then that's a good feature to have if it
doesn't say auto-ranging then what
you're going to need to do is kind of
guess where um how high of levels you're
measuring and it's just pain in the butt
so make sure it has Auto ranging and the
last thing that's kind of a neat thing
to have and you're going to thank me for
choosing this make sure it has a stand
like that because it's a lot easier to
read when you're measuring values just
set it on the table and you can't even
see that cuz off of my camera good job
but make sure you have stand if you
don't no big deal but it's a nice keep
in mind so next let me show you exactly
how to use one of these things</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
