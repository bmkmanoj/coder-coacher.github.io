with a video tutorial for the new boston
in this tutorial we're going to be
taking a look at a quick introduction to
the jQuery UI now this stands for the
jQuery use it interface go over to
jQuery UI comm and have a look at the
festival the short description of jQuery
UI and I'm going to be just be taking
you through these other sort of longer
or additional shorter descriptions and
we're just going to be discussing what
jQuery UI is and also how we can use it
and how we are going to be using it in
the following tutorials or the next few
tutorials
okay so jQuery UI provides abstractions
for low-level interaction animation
advanced effects and high-level fee
mobile widget app and high-level theme
bubble widgets built on top of the
jQuery library so quite a mouthful
essentially what this means is if we
come down here we can look at a few
things that we can use jQuery UI for now
what we're going to be focusing on in
the next few tutorials is rich effects
and UI widgets now what I mean by this
is effects such as dragging and dropping
elements and we're also going to be
looking at this calendar function here
as well as this scrollbar this sorry
loading bar percentage bar function here
which I believe is called a progress bar
you'll see that we've got the support
for the majority of browsers and
versions and obviously because this is
based on jQuery it's extremely easy so
if you come over to this little
paragraph here it leverages the power of
jQuery making it easier it's re making
it easy to start right away with
detailed documentation so blah blah
we've got a documentation for jQuery you
are you are I as sorry UI as well so we
can access the same information as we
would be able to just with jQuery
now with regards to including this on
our page we're going to take a look in
the next video actually installing the
jQuery UI and then we're going to take a
look at some basic examples so you can
go ahead and download the jQuery UI just
here we've got a stable version of one
point three point two here this is the
latest version and it will tell you the
compatibility
well sorry yet although you can look at
Matt ability and a stable version with
regards to the corresponding jQuery
version so we've got the latest version
one point eight point one four and this
is a compatible with jQuery one one
point three point two so if we take a
look inside of our our script that we've
been working without a generic index dot
PHP file you can see that I've included
jQuery j/s we're going to go ahead and
include jQuery UI as well in the next
video and then take a look at what we
can do with it so go ahead and download
this it will be downloaded in a zip
package and then we can go ahead and
look at looking in at installing it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
