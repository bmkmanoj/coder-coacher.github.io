the beginning of day two and let me
start off by saying last night was the
worst night of my entire life it was
freezing cold much colder than I
anticipated and I didn't get any sleep
at all
I'm incredibly thirsty I haven't had
anything to drink since it started nor
eat so today I need to find something to
eat and I need some water and I don't
know aside from just being freezing cold
it didn't rain or anything which if it
did I would just lose my mind if you did
that because I didn't have any shelter
but it wasn't that it was like dark out
and I I don't want to say that I'm I'm
not afraid of the dark and I'm not
really worried about any bears or snakes
even though I know that they're out here
but it's just you hear noises every
single second and it's just that
everything it's just that you don't know
what's out there so it was just uh
freaking me out more than anything and
especially out here where I mean I am
miles and miles and miles away from
anybody so if anything happens to me if
I sprained my ankle if you know I don't
know I get bit by snake or I do anything
there's no one that can help me and I
was thinking about that and that was
kind of freaking me out too but aside
from you know I wasn't that worried
about any animals but I started thinking
if they if I'm gonna get attacked you
kind of start to realize that you're in
their home now this is their home and
you know you're an outsider so uh uh
it's starting to feel like I really
don't belong out here and but anyways
what I did is I started walking away
from that River like I said and I was
gonna film but the Sun is just coming up
right now and in the woods is completely
dark
though this is the first time I could
film because it's the only little
clearing I found this little pond or
lake whatever you want to call it looks
like the creepiest freaking lake that
I've ever seen from a movie not a good
movie either
so anyways I left the river and ice
I started going east that's where I'm
going now because it just felt like the
river I was just walking and walking and
I was just getting nowhere so I found
this pond I don't want to stay here
because I don't know it it just doesn't
look like a good place to be just
following my heart if you guys can see
the little I don't know it just looks
creepy so I guess that's my plan for
right now I'm just gonna keep going east
and hopefully well I don't think I'm
like gonna set up camp for any days
pretty much I'm just gonna keep an eye
out for a road or you know a trail or a
telephone pole or any sign of
civilization and as soon as I find it
then I'm probably gonna you know call it
a trip because you know this experience
isn't exactly what I thought it was
going to be that was gonna be a lot more
fun like camping unless uh you know
dying out here
but um yeah I guess that's a plan for
now and another thing that sucks before
I let you guys go whenever I'm walking
through the woods I it's super hot
during the daytime and it's freezing
during the nighttime and they're in the
daytime I can't wear my bathing suit
because I'm afraid again poison ivy or
anything so that's why I have to keep my
pants on which makes everything a whole
lot more unbearable but anyways I'll
give you guys update once I find
something cool I'm gonna try to go
around this pond so uh talk to you guys
later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
