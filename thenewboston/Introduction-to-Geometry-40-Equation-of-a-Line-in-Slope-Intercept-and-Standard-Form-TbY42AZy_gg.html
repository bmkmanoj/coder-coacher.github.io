going to talk about the equation of a
line and writing the equation of a line
first we're going to talk about it in
slope-intercept form so this is what
slope in our form looks like it's y
equals MX plus B where m is the slope
and B is the y-intercept of the line and
the y-intercept is the place on the
graph where the line hits the y-axis so
this one the y intercept would be 0 2 so
given two points 1 2 &amp;amp; 5 3 we're going
to write the equation of a line so the
first thing we have to do is set is find
the slope so M is equal to y2 minus y1
over x2 minus x1 so 2 minus 3 is
negative 1 over 1 minus 5 which is
negative 4 so positive 1/4 now to find
that what this equals we're gonna plug
in one of these two points it doesn't
matter which one and the slope and the
solve for B so we're just gonna we're
gonna use this one because the numbers
are smaller so this is X and this is y
so we're both gonna plug these numbers
in for x and y so y equals MX plus B 2
equals M which is our slope X which is 1
plus B so 2 is equal to 1/4 plus B if
you subtract the 1/4 over you get B is
equal to 7/4 so if we're gonna write the
equation we're gonna write y is equal to
M
x+ 7/4 so now we're going to talk about
the equation of a line in what's called
standard form and this and a slope inner
or a standard form goes ax plus B y
equals C where a and B are coefficients
which means there are numbers that stay
in front of a variable and C is a
constant so this number doesn't change
so given M equals 1/4 and the point
negative 4 3 is on the line find the
equation of the line so we're gonna use
our slope intercept form to help us so y
equals MX plus B so if we plug this in
and we're gonna solve for B at the same
time so 3 is equal to 1/4
negative 4 plus B 3 is equal 1/4 times
negative 4 gives you negative 1 plus B
if you add the 1 over you get B equals 4
so y equals 1/4 X plus 4 now we want to
make this equation look like this
equation so we have to get the X and the
y on the same side so first thing we're
gonna do is we're gonna eliminate this
fraction right here so we're gonna
multiply every number times 4 so we get
negative all right now that's not a
negative 4 y is equal to X plus 16
so if you subtract or what we're gonna
do is we're gonna subtract Y over so we
get 0 is equal to X minus 4y plus 16
we're almost there but to get there all
the way we have to subtract this 16 over
and get 16 negative 16 is equal to X
minus 4y and that is your line in slope
intercept form or in standard form I'm
sorry so now we need to write an
equation for a line parallel to the line
y equals 2x minus 1 through the point 2
2 so if you remember our parallel lines
have equal slopes so this since this is
in the form y equals MX plus B where m
is the slope the slope of this line
equals 2 so our new line has to have a
slope of 2 in order to be parallel to
this line so now we're going to plug
this point into this equation to get our
new equation so 2 is equal to 2 times 2
this one's this 2 plus B so 2 is equal
to 4 plus B if you subtract the 4 over
you get B is equal to negative 2 so the
equation of the line parallel to y
equals 2x minus 1 through the point 2
negative 2 2 is equal to is y is equal
to 2x minus 2 in our last example we
want to line write the equation of the
line perpendicular to 3x plus 4y equals
7 through the point 1 3 so the first
thing we're going to do is
convert this to slope-intercept form so
we're going to convert this to
slope-intercept form so for X or for y
is equal we're gonna move the x over and
we're gonna divide by four X plus seven
fourths so we have a slope of negative
three-fourths so perpendicular lines
have opposite reciprocal slopes so the
slope of my second line needs to be the
opposite so the opposite sign so since
this is negative three-fourths our new
slope is going to be positive and the
reciprocal so all we do is switch the
top and bottom so we get 4/3 and so
we're gonna do the same thing we did in
the last one now and we're gonna plug
this and this into the slope intercept
form to find our B so we get Y is equal
to 4/3 times 1 plus B and this should
say 3 because this is our Y right here
so 3 is equal to 4/3 plus B if we
subtract 4/3 over we subtract the 4/3
over and get a common denominator we'll
get B is equal to 5/3 so because they
gave us their equation in point excuse
me in standard form we're going to write
our equation in standard form as well so
our slope-intercept form is y is equal
to 4/3 X plus 5/3
so to convert this just standard form we
have to get rid of all the fractions so
we're going to multiply everything by 3
so we'll get 3y is equal to 4x plus 5
we're going to subtract the x over and
get negative 4x plus 3y is equal to 5
and that's all we're gonna do today with
equation of a line but be sure to come
on to the next video where we're going
to take the equations that we just made
and graph them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
