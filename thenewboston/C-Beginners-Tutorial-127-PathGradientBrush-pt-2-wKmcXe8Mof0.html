tutorial that I'm making for the New
Boston and in this tutorial I'm going to
show you how to use the pack gradient
brush with shapes other than ellipses so
for this tutorial you need to have a
panel and then when the user clicks on
the panel just have a new graphics path
be created and it's pretty much
everything you had in the last tutorial
so just copy down what I have here
alright so in a previous tutorial we
only looked at creating gradients with
circles so we have like a center point
and then the gradient this slowly moves
out or the edge of it changes colors
well we're gonna do in this tutorial is
do other shapes as rectangles squares
and triangles and stuff so we're just
gonna have to add those shapes to our
graphics back so we're gonna do GP dot
add rectangle we're gonna be adding a
rectangle first so mom we're just going
to go ahead right here and pass through
a rectangle and as you can see you
cannot pass through the points like the
location and the size of it so what
words empty right here is create a new
rectangle words gonna go up here it's
like a rectangle I'll just call it R and
set a equal to a new rectangle and right
here we're just gonna pass through the
size of it and the location so here we
just have X Y and the width and I so
dislike report for the X on April 20 the
y will be 20 width will be 50 and the
height will be 50 just like I normally
do so now with this rectangle recreated
we can just pass it through this add
rectangle method and we'll just add that
rectangle to the graphics path so now on
the gradient brush we'll be in this
rectangle right here we start in the
center of the rectangle and work its way
out and change the black all right so
now that we have our path gradient brush
all set up we can actually draw a
rectangle use brush so we're just going
to do G to access our graphics or say
bill rectangle the brush that we're
going to be using is obviously our path
reading brush so these PTV
and our rectangle we can just use this
are up here that we already created to
just Nick a way you here
alright so now I'm going to bug here and
click we should see actually a square
because we made the width and the height
the same and in the center it should be
white and it should slowly turn into
black as it moves out yep perfect and
obviously if you wanted to make this be
like a rectangle or something you could
just change this to 100 and now it'd be
a rectangle yeah perfect alright so now
that we have our rectangle I'm going to
show you how to do a polygon so there's
new GP add polygon and it just calls for
points so we're gonna have to create a
new point array you don't need to
rectangle anymore so we go say point
let's call it points and this will
basically be the points or the locations
of the vertices of our polygon so if you
just want to have a triangle then we'll
just put three points right in here and
it'll draw a triangle out of those
points so we're just going to create
some points inside of this array all
right so now we can just pass our points
array or a point array through this at
polygon method to add a polygon to our
graphics path all right and now that our
path gradient brush is all set up we can
just fill a or paint a polygon using our
brush so we're gonna build polygon with
a brush which would be the path gradient
brush so there's P P P and the points we
can just use this point so a ray that we
already created so that we don't have to
rewrite it out so those dew points and
now when we click we should just see a
right triangle and it should the middle
of it should be white in it as we move
out it should be black yep
and if you wanted to make this like a
right or rectangle we could just add
another point make it if we did 70 70 so
to show you what it does is it goes
through these in the orders so this is
gonna look all straight up it's gonna
look like a bowtie yeah and that's
because it starts at 20 20 then it goes
to 20 70 which would be down here then
it goes to 70 20 which is over here and
then it goes to 70 70 down here so if we
want it to be a square we'll have to
have it go in the order that we want it
to so we're gonna have to move this 70
70 to the third one so that it goes here
here then there so what we're gonna do
is we're just going to copy this delete
that and paste it right there so now we
should get a square yep all right so
that's pretty much it for this tutorial
so see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
