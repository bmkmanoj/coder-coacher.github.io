welcome to your fifth tutorial and how
to build a computer and in this tutorial
we're gonna be learning how to pick out
RAM and what Ram is and what RAM does so
first thing I want to tell you guys what
Ram actually stands for just because I
always do are am just like the animal
stands for a random access memory and
the job of a RAM in your computer
because every component has a job
Rams job is to load programs and also is
the memory used when your programs are
running so it keeps you guys actually in
alright I know what the memory is in my
computer already it's called the hard
drive well actually your hard drive can
be used for this but the benefits of RAM
is that it's much much faster than your
hard drive
so therefore the more RAM you have in
your computer more programs you're going
to be able to run at the same time and
therefore also more RAM you have in your
computer
the faster your computer's gonna be and
more likely more expensive your
computer's gonna be but it's worth it
and another thing I want to talk to you
guys about before you guys just start
buying your amatoxin in your computer
you need to make sure that your
motherboard is compatible with the RAM
and to do this thing you need to check a
couple things first the first most
important thing is the style of RAM now
Ram comes in many different styles just
like many other parts of computer
there's three major styles I ran first
you got your DDR and DVR and for double
data rate and it got this name because
it was double the rate of the old type
of RAM that ever in place and that's
SDRAM you don't need to know that but
just in case you did
there's also ddr2 RAM and this kind of
thing
because it's twice as fast of DVR mmm
and there's also ddr3 ring and this is
even faster than everything I usually
use ddr2 ram just cuz it's a nice and
median it's if you put enough RAM on
your computer as trust me it's more than
your ever need another expect of RAM
that you need to make sure when choosing
it is the pin count and if you take a
look at a sticker ring you'll notice
that there are gold teeth on one the
sides of it
this these are the pins of the ring now
it doesn't really have anything to do
with performance but you need to make
sure that the number of pins on your RAM
is the same as number of pins in your
motherboard just so it can fit in</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
