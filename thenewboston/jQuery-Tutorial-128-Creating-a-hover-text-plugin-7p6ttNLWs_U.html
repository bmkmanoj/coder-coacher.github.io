how we've included them and where we've
obviously included jquery.js we've
included plug-in J s here and we've
included ext dot j s so plug in is our
plug in declaration and how our plugin
works at the moment it just alert
something out and ext is where we're
going to be calling our plugin or rather
where we're going to be making use of
our plugin okay so there's nothing
really else we need to do on this page
obviously you need a title attribute for
the the link that you're going to be
using but inside ext dot J s we want to
go ahead and actually call our plug-in
to make sure it's working so to alert
this out so the first thing we want to
go ahead and do is make sure the Dom is
loaded or ie our document is ready so we
want to say document dot ready so inside
this event handler we want to go ahead
and create a function and we'll just
pull that down so it just makes it a
little bit neater and easier to read
okay so now what we want to do is go
ahead and apply our plugin that we've
created called hover text to an element
on our page so we need to use a jQuery
selector and I'm going to apply this to
all a tags because I'm going to assume
that the only a tags found on a user's
page are links themselves so what we
want to go ahead and do is use a jQuery
selector and just write a and this will
select all a elements on a page and then
we just do dot and how we would usually
use any kind of functionality in jQuery
whether it be part of the standard
library or any other plugins that we've
used so we just call the function hover
text so we just use hover text like this
afterwards and obviously our parentheses
here like I said before we're not
supplying any parameters but if we were
they would go in there okay so now that
this is done when the document is ready
we actually apply this plug-in to all a
tags and therefore what's going to
happen is we're just going to allow out
working so let's go ahead and just take
a look at that you can see that we've
got this dialog box up here now so we
know that our plugin is actually working
because we have this alert out here
however we're going to go ahead and get
rid of that now okay so the first step
that we want to take is actually apply
the div to to the page we want to put
this div that we've created in style dot
CSS to the page and we're going to do
this after our link now it doesn't
really matter where we place it because
we're going to position it dynamically
but what we want to go ahead and do is
reference this and this applies to this
here so anything we call in our
essentially what is a function in our
plugin we apply it to the current
element that we used in the plug-in on
so this will apply to all H H tags and
we want to going to use after in jQuery
to apply some HTML code to the page so
we create our div here or we type out
our div declaration in here we want to
go ahead and set the ID of this to hover
text now setting the idea of this to
hover text will obviously pick this up
where we created it in style dot CSS
that's just going over than that once
again so it will apply this here or all
these you know options and values to our
div here so now what we see on the page
is when we refresh we get this little
box just appear here now we need to make
a change to style dot CSS I I know I
said we weren't going to use it but we
do want to set the div to be invisible
almost so we're just gonna say
display:none
so this just won't display it on the
page you'll just have nothing displayed
okay also this won't interfere with any
other elements on your page so you don't
need to worry about this actually taking
up any space because it's visibility set
to none or the display set to none it
essentially is not on our document so
we've applied this here afterwards it's
there but it can't be seen and it
doesn't interact in
with anything else so now that we've
applied this div we can go ahead and
later on apply some text to it and set
the top and the left dynamically to
follow the male Mouse now the next step
is to go ahead and get the title from
the the element that you've selected and
applied this plugin to so in this case
it's going to be the title here because
we've applied it to all a tags now the
flexibility issue in this plug-in is
that if we weren't using the this
keyword like this we would you know be
displaying the title for all links
because we've selected all links so we
need to make sure we're using this
instead now we could go ahead and say a
dot attribute title and what that would
take do is take the title attribute from
all a elements but because we've applied
it to that already we want to make this
unique by writing this so it will only
take it from the current current element
that we are applying this to so if there
are three links on the page each
attribute will be different by using the
this selector or this keyword so we've
gone and get the we've gone a got the
title we need to make sure that the
title has actually been defined we don't
want to display this div if the title
hasn't been defined so we need to check
if first of all the title is undefined
and second of all the title doesn't
equal nothing and by this I mean let's
just give an example this would be
undefined if we didn't have it actually
defined within our a tag and if we had
this set to nothing then in that
circumstance we wouldn't want to output
this div and we wouldn't want to put any
text in it because there's no real text
to put inside so we need to make sure
that we handle this within our plugin
just to make the user experience a lot
better so we want to create an if
statement and we want to inside of the
condition first of all check that the
title is not equal to undefined and also
or the title doesn't equal nothing so
we've already established the title here
by using the title
you so we want to make sure it doesn't
equal undefined or the title doesn't
equal nothing so just nothing insights
and tags there and this will just mean
that we don't get this the same effect
if you know what I demonstrated earlier
here wasn't available so if it hadn't
been defined er it was nothing okay so
inside of here we want to go ahead and
actually start to create an event
handler for when the mouse goes over a
link because that's the only time we
want to go ahead and actually display
this div in the now position so again we
use this to select the current link or
the color current element that we're
over and we want to use the mouse move
event handler now we do more or less
exactly thoughts sorry that's just
jumped over there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
