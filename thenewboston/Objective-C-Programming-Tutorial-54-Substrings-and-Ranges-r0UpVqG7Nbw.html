tutorial and I know if you're listening
my last order that I promised you guys
I'd be teaching about mutable shrinks
but I forgot
did you guys about substrings so let's
go ahead and make another string and
we'll go over mutable strings in next
tutorial
so NS string uh you know we don't really
need to create another one but we don't
really only want to have one Dewey
oh we just want another one to play
around with so let's go ahead we have
cats don't like bananas some more advice
don't feed grapes to dogs they might
choke so now let's go ahead and put us
in a string tester and make sure pointer
to it and we'll just make this one blank
so the first thing that I want to go
over is that you can a substring pretty
much is a piece of a regular string so
let's go ahead and let's go start out
with an example
let's make tester a substring of dog so
use your D or you know whatever string
you want and type in the method
substring to index ten and what this
does is it starts at the beginning and
it makes of substring of the first ten
characters so this would be remember
wrong dog so this would be like don't
feed somewhere right there so now let's
go ahead and NS log print it out
let's go first
first 10 chars are % a and then tester
so now let's go ahead and build run this
save it and see what we get don't feed
so pretty much we made a substring of
the main string just took a piece out of
it the first 10 characters and put it in
tester so I mean easy enough I
understand what sub strings are but what
if I want to get the end of a string
well let's go ahead and take that tester
and we'll set it equal to let's use the
S I shouldn't name these key C and D for
cats and dogs but you know I didn't
substring from index and remember this
one's too this one's from subtle yet
necessary and let's go ahead and put
something like 5 so what this does it
works a little bit differently it starts
at the 5th character in the string which
is I don't know this blank right here
between cats and don't and what it does
can't type and teach at the same time
what it does is pretty much go from 5
till the end so let's put that in the
right place and then I could show you
guys so put like from 5 till end is and
then just go ahead and put % a tester
looks good and me save all and what did
I do wrong
C is undeclared that's because I tried
using cats instead of s that's gonna get
confusing I'll probably just use the
dogs one from now on confusing and
embarrassing so check this out the first
10 characters are don't feed for 5:00 to
end remember the original string was
cats don't like bananas and cut out the
cats in the space and just gave you
don't like bananas so that is pretty
much how you get sub strings so I mean
let's go ahead and delete this this is
getting kind of clustered we already
know how to make sub strings big whoop
so what I want to teach you now is I
told you guys how to get it from the
beginning I told you how to get it from
N
but what if you only want to cut out a
piece in the middle should use substring
from or substrate to answer neither what
you need to do is you need to make a
special range of characters and what
range of character is is a location and
length so the range of don't would be
like five because it starts at character
five and four I think so I count that
way too quick so let's go ahead and put
tester and set this equal to again let's
use the dogs ones that D string with
range so now let's go ahead and say what
range do we want to make but you can't
just put coordinates you got to put NS
make range there we go
and this is your coordinate system and
again your coordinate system is first
where do you want to begin the fit
character and how many characters do you
want to go let's see five ten eleven so
we're gonna want to start at five which
is this space and count eleven
characters which should include feed
grapes so let's go ahead log test this
out percent won't putting any witty uh
comments to go along with it and just
for an out tester like that and we
should get that little substring in the
middle so check this out feed grapes so
what it does what it does what it did is
just start at five
what eleven characters and extracted
that range so that's how you get
arranged within a string
pretty cool huh I know that range can be
kind of confusing so let me give you
guys one more example and what I want to
do in this example is you can pretty
much I told you guys that range is a
location and a length so what you can do
is you can not only extract the
substring but you can give it a
substring and you can pretty much tell
it find the range find where the
substring is so you can give it the word
grapes
you can be like alright what's the range
of that pretty cool huh
so let's go ahead and do that NS range
let's make a range object and just go
ahead and name it
range no point are necessary and set
this equal to like D in the in the
excuse me method for this is range of
string I'll look that so instead of
giving it a range we're giving it a
string and telling it to give us the
range so this pretty much opposite what
we just did so give it a string and
we'll put like grapes since I mean it's
just chillin there right in the middle
and so now range is equal to whatever
the range of this is and remember range
is composed of location and length so
all we need to do right now is print out
NS log and this is a public location is
percent I and let's see what's that
location and length is
percent I simple enough uh got some
phlegm in my throat so now how do we
access the properties of location and
length ready for the easiest thing ever
take that range object that you just
created and just like any other thing
just call the property on it location
range length so whenever you create a
range object of a substring it
automatically applies certain properties
through it location and length so now if
we didn't mess up anything we should get
our range which is location is 10 right
there that means it starts at 10 so
check this out
grapes 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 that's where
it starts right there and it may have
been begin with 0 I'm not sure yeah it
begins with 0 that's why and the length
is 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 pretty cool huh
it's actually 0 1 2 3 4 5 but anyways
that's irrelevant it's still 6 either
way so that is pretty much what arrange
is arranged is pretty much a location in
the length and the substring is pretty
much a string or a piece of your string
I mean pretty easy to sort huh so now
that I finally got all that out of my
system I feel comfortable now now that
you know about sub strings to teach you
guys about mutable strings so you know
take a deep breath it's gonna be okay
and by the way and I know I tell you
this every story let's get annoying but
if you want any of the source code I'll
type it retype it all for you guys and
copy it right in my for room the link
below so thank you for watching don't
forget subscribe and uh yeah that's it
I'll see you next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
