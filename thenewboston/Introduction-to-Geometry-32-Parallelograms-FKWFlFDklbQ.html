like the name suggests opposite sides
are parallel that's how it so ad and BC
are parallel a a B and D C are parallel
opposite sides are congruent so a b is
congruent to d.c BC is congruent to AD
opposite angles are congruent so angle B
is congruent to angle D angle a is
congruent to angle C and consecutive
angles which remember are side by side
angles are supplementary so these two
are supplementary as well as these two
and these two and those two so if a B is
equal to 8 then DC is equal to what well
since it's a parallelogram and we know
that parallelograms opposite sides are
congruent Daisy
also has to equal 8 the measure of AD is
11 so the measure of bc which is
opposite it has to be 11 as well the
measure of angle 1 so the measure of
angle B equals 47 so this right here
equals 47 measure of angle D has to
equal what well since we know that
opposite side opposite angles are
congruent angle D has to equal 47
degrees so the measure of angle C has to
equal well consecutive sides or excuse
me
consecutive angles are supplementary so
we set 47 plus the measure
Anglesey equal to 180 to the measure of
angle C is a hundred and thirty three
degrees we had some more problems to do
so ad is congruent to BC angle a is
congruent to the angle opposite which is
angle C the measure of angle A plus what
is equal to 180 well there's actually
two different angles that could fit here
so it's consecutive angles that are
congruent so a and D are consecutive
angles and a and B are consecutive
angles so since they're supplementary we
can say the measure of angle A plus the
measure of angle T equals 180 or the
measure of angle A plus the measure of
angle B also equals 180 DC is congruent
to the side opposite which is a B the
measure of angle B is congruent to the
angle opposite that so angle D so now
what we're going to talk about is
diagonals of parallelograms so a
diagonal of a parallelogram which is
drawn through opposite angles divides
the parallelogram into two equal
triangles so if we're looking at this if
we're looking at this diagonal first
this triangle formed right here is
congruent to this triangle formed right
here and if we're looking at the other
diagonal right here this triangle right
here is
congruent to this triangle right here
the diagonals also bisect each other and
bisect right here if you don't know what
it means already it means cuts into two
equal parts so if I call this point
right here Point F that means that if
I'm looking at this lighter blue
diagonal first that that this part is
equal to this part or if I'm looking at
this dark blue diagonal this part is
equal to this part so now we're going to
do some examples using that information
so we know that triangle BCA which is
formed by this solid diagonal right here
that's gonna be congruent to this
triangle over here so triangle BCA is
congruent to triangle
D see a triangle abd which is formed by
this dotted diagonal abd is congruent to
triangle DC a so if this right here
equals five what does this part equal
well like we said we said that when
these diagonals cross each other they
bisect each other so when they bisect to
each other they cut them into two equal
pieces to this side equals five then
eight easy also has to equal five
so point E is the midpoint of what two
lines the midpoint is literally just the
point
point in the center of the line and we
know that it's a midpoint because the
lines the line segments are equal so
Point E is the midpoint of this diagonal
AC right and this diagonal BD because it
cuts this line into two equal pieces as
well so we went over this today so that
in the next lesson when we talk about
special kinds of parallelograms we
already have a ground knowledge so make
sure you come watch the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
