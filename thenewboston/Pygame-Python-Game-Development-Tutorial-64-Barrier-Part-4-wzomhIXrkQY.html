tutorial video in this video our meeting
about is stopping the tank from crossing
over the barrier as well as we're gonna
go ahead and fix the hard coating and
the width of the barrier so maybe later
on down the road you might decide hey I
want to make the barrier wider or
whatever and you can actually you can do
it a little bit better than what we've
done so real quick let's fix that hard
coating of the barriers so I'm gonna go
into our barrier function as soon as I
find it there it is and then I'm just
gonna add another parameter and it's
gonna be barrier underscore width I'm
gonna copy that and then we're gonna go
over into where we draw it come over and
then where we had this 50 in the you
know I've got two game display the color
black and then you've got X Y width
height I'm gonna replace 50 with barrier
width then what we want to do is we're
going to come down to our game loop here
and we've got where we draw down in the
bottom here we've got barrier and then
we'll just do comma barrier width and
then finally we want to all we need to
define barrier width so at the very top
of the game loop function let's just go
ahead and say barrier width equals 50 so
later on if you want we're not going to
change it I don't think in this series
but if you want to be able to change it
or modify that you can so now that we've
done that the other thing I want to do
more important thing I want us to do is
to stop our tank from being about cross
over the barrier so right now our tank
and just like I don't know drive over
the barrier drive through the barrier so
we don't want that to be happening so
instead what we need to do is basically
we've got you know this this event
handling functionality and then after
the event handling functionality we
should have a slight bit of logic
functionality no different than we have
logic functionality here so what do I
want to happen if the tank goes into the
barrier well it's a tank so if the tank
drives into the barrier we're not gonna
be like game over
you know I'm gonna do that
but if they take we want to make it to
the point where the tank cannot drive
through the barriers so almost like it
well it's a barrier right so let's go
ahead and add some quick logic here
since this seems to be where we've begun
our failsafe logic of sorts we'll just
continue building here and we're gonna
ask a few questions so we're gonna say
if and then here's the tank right so I
make sure you do this before you draw
the tank it doesn't totally matter it
would just look like your tank is
bouncing a lot more than it is but so
you're gonna say if main tank X if main
tank X - we've got well we have tank
with let's see if we have tank would
maintain where is our C let's look up
let me bring this over here tank height
right so we do have a tank width in a
tank height so we want to say tank we
could do tank width I suppose let's
level pass through tank with so if main
tank X - tank width if that is less than
the barrier underscore location or
barrier X location round there's a
barrier underscore X location + barrier
width
and actually all right that's just X
location on barrier X location I want to
make that barrier location but anyway
main take X minus tank width and really
we won't even need the minus tank width
I don't really we'll try this first - it
is less than X location plus barrier
width so maintain connection but I think
main tank X is where the turret is so
really you'd want to use half of the
width I'm almost positive actually so
minus tank width width / 2
and really this is all one thing so if
main tank X minus tank width / 2 is less
than the X location which is the left
hand side of the barrier plus barrier
width so if that is the case what do we
want to do we're just going to basically
move the tank so we're just gonna say
main tank X + equals 5 adding 2x will
move the tank right so we should be fine
so let's go ahead and save and run that
and see if we did that okay okay barrier
width is not defined what do we call
barrier
oh it's barrier underscore with barrier
underscore with play okay so let's draw
our tank into the barrier here and you
see that we're not able to get our tank
to run into the barrier so now we've got
that done so our tank is stuck there so
now we won't be driving it over the
barrier awesome so now that we've done
that we're ready to move on that's a
decent-enough barrier so the next thing
that we want to be able to do is
actually make our tank fire something so
this is actually going to be a slight
challenge because we need to be able to
program an arc and not just program any
arc it needs to be an arc that starts
and stops at specific points we need to
know where that arc is
and we can't really I mean we could use
something like a quadratic equation to
get that to work but the problem is x
and y first of all don't operate the way
that we might think they should here
this is not a coordinate plane and this
is x and y what zero zero is the top
left so it's a little bit of a challenge
we could you know write some code like
shift over the plane basically but I
think I've got an easier solution it's
just like a basic quadratic equation or
modified quadratic equation that we'll
probably do but we'll save that for the
next video so stay tuned for that thanks
