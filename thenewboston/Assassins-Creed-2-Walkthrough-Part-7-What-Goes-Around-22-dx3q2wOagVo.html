to the second part of what's a codeword
goes around memory number four and this
is the part where you assassinate Verity
Potsie so in this the best way to get
around it is to jump to the other
rooftop like you just saw and just jump
down to avoid all the fighting
pottsy is on top of this little tower
right here so just go ahead and climb up
here and you won't have to worry about
the other guards on the ground the only
thing you have to worry about is killing
all these guards at the top of the tower
so he has to with them by default and
then more come when they see that you're
fighting them so I like to get rid of
all the guards first before I go over
pottsy which i think it's pretty much
you need to do and make sure you keep an
eye on your health and make sure if it
gets too low then you use your medicine
because you definitely don't want to
fail it right now now that you're at the
end so I use a counters to kill and you
know if they're not attacking me then I
just want them but um it's probably
going to send some more guards and let
me get rid of these guys first
easy Patsy and yet you know you think
they'd want to attack me both at the
same time but
evidently not they want a low challenge
so sucks to be them come on come on yeah
one to the goat soin house is human
potty so a show-off and um and I'm gonna
yeah he's not countering me really so
I'm just gonna keep whomping them with
my sword there we go so just keep
whopping them until he dies in
eventually die hopefully so there we go
and now huh you get you're a little
movie that place is this what my father
discovered is this why he was killed
I'm sorry what are you hoping for a
confession baby seriously poorly so
lucky is it my fell again hit him again
who tell Fe that came here Atari spell
okay Pro he's gonna spit on come on
respect role it's happened do you think
he will say 'no i'm trying to beat the
crap out by Mario's like you want I've
done to it so that's pretty much the end
of that mission I mean um pretty simple
the main thing you want to take note of
is don't forget to keep an eye on your
health and you want to climb up right
there so um you don't lose a bunch of
health to the guards on the ground so
just go straight for Potsie and like
this you complete the mission
Mario's people takes care of the other
guards so that's it so thank you for
watching don't forget subscribe and I
will see you next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
