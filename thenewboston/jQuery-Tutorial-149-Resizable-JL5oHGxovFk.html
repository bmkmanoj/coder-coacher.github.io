with a video tutorial for the new Boston
in this video we are going to be looking
at the draggable interaction in the
jQuery UI just a few things to note
before we set up we have jQuery and the
jQuery UI included the JavaScript files
as well as J UI j s which we are going
to be working in here we also have a
stylesheet set up so we can style the
div that we're going to be allowing to
be draggable so we're gonna be creating
a div area which we're going to
essentially create a square from which
we can resize and drag over the page and
resize over the page and change some
options for this but we also need to
include which I haven't in previous
tutorials in this set we need to include
this CSS file here now by all means
rename it to something like jQuery UI
dot CSS just to keep it a bit cleaner
but it's found in the CSS of the with
CSS folder and then in the UI lightness
folder that came with your jQuery UI
package when you downloaded it so we
need to make sure that this stylesheet
is included before you start to use the
draggable interaction
oh the resizable interaction I mean ok
so let's go ahead and just start to
create our div so I'm going to outline
this here I'm gonna say div ID and we're
gonna give it an ID of box now if we go
over to our browser you can see that we
can't see anything currently so we need
to go ahead and style this box so into
style dot CSS we need to reference box
and let's go ahead and give this a width
of a hundred pixels give this a height
of a hundred pixels so it's a nice
square shape we'll go ahead and give it
a background color as well this will
just be a light ish gray and we'll also
get some padding as well so I'll say ten
pixels this doesn't really matter though
so now that we've got this box in fact
let's go ahead and get rid of padding
we'll just give it a border so border
it'll be a one pixel border so
and black and now we have a box with a
nice black border okay so the main thing
we want to do is first of all just make
this draggable and we're not going to
set any options here as well now in this
tutorial we're not going to be going
through events associated with this
because I've already gone through events
in the other tutorials in this series
and therefore it's going to be a waste
of time creating events and doing
something on these events so depending
on your application you'll want to set
specific events that are important to
you and you can find these at the jQuery
documentation so the first thing we want
to do in you ijs which again we've
included in our page along with our
other jQuery files we want to go ahead
and just make this resizable so I'm
going to use the selector to select box
and then I'm just going to choose resize
above so now that I've chosen resizable
this has applied the interaction to this
particular element so now when we
refresh you'll notice a difference you
now have this sort of square lined
resizable you know image here and what
we also have is these these are draggers
if you like dragging cursors that allow
us to drag the box so now that we have
this set up and the aesthetics of this
have been created we can actually go
ahead and drag this element anywhere we
won so we can make it smallest we can
make it wider than the window or the
document itself and there's no aspect
ratio so we can resize it to any shape
that we want now the options we're going
to be going through just now and there's
a variety of options so this is going to
take quite a while to look at each one
but they all do something interesting
and I've left some of the options out
but I've left the most interesting and
useful options available for us to use
now as with jQuery interactions we
specify the options between curly
brackets and the first one we're going
to take a look at is containment now
we've seen containment in a few other
interactions in jQuery such as the
draggable however
the resizable also allows for a
containment so I'm gonna set the
containment for example parent now at
the moment we don't have a parent
element to this div so what I'm gonna do
is around this I'm gonna create a parent
element and this is going to be called
bigger box and let's just end in that in
there so now what we actually have is
this element in here this div here but
we have a larger div what we're gonna
resize it in just a moment a larger div
that's gonna constrain the boundaries of
the resize okay so let's go ahead and
set some properties for this bigger box
in our style dot CSS file I'll go ahead
and reference bigger box and I'm gonna
make the width of this much larger say
400 pixels and the height again we could
say 400 pixels I'm going to set a
background color to this as well this is
gonna be F 0 F 0 F 0 which is a light
gray and we'll also go ahead and set a
border 1 pixel solid and again black
okay so let's go over to our browser and
refresh and you can see that we have a
larger div here now you'll see that I
set the containment to parent now that
the parent element element of this div
is this larger div here when we actually
resize we can't go any further than the
parent element so this won't allow the
resize to be bigger than the parent
element we can also specify its values
such as document and window but for for
now we're going to stick to parent
because this is a good example of when
you resize and you don't want it to come
out of a particular area now we can also
use a max height a min height a max
width and a min width as well so a
minimum and maximum height and width for
each for each axis but obviously it's
more appropriate to be able to resize
within a particular area that you've
predefined on your page</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
