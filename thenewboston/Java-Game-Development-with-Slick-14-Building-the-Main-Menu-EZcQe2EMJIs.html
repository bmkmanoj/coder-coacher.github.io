14th game development tutorial and in
this tutorial what I'm gonna be doing is
I'm gonna be showing you guys how to
develop the main menu because right now
our game looks like this if we go ahead
and play it a plain black screen not
very exciting unless you know you just
love the color black then this games
probably awesome to you but I want to
build a main menu that first of all it
gives a title that says welcome to Bucky
land and then it has two options the
first one is play the game of course
that's one button you can click on and
the other one is exit the game maybe you
I don't know you clicked on it by
accident
who knows but I already have the two
images that you should have downloaded
and loaded already so let's go ahead and
hop into our menu class and the first
thing we need to do is load those two
buttons again the title you can make
that you know a graphic ma I'm just
gonna you know do the lazy way and make
a really plain text on the screen but
the two buttons are gonna be images so
image play now is gonna be the button
you click whenever you want to play the
game and image exit game is gonna be the
button of course whenever you want to
exit the game so now that we went ahead
and said Java we're gonna make them now
we actually have to set them to the
image files so play now equals new image
and where is it's on the RTS folder and
it's called play now ping and the same
thing with the what's called exit game
so exit game equals new image where is
it some the re s folder and it's called
I make sure this code exit game exit
game and it's a ping because pings are
awesome by the way whenever you're
making your game you usually want to
stick the pings because well pings are
the best for a Java game just remember
that simple rule
so after this now that we basically
loaded them into a variable we actually
have to draw them on the screen so we're
in everyone draw things just go ahead
and hop into your render and this pretty
much draws things things initially on
the screen
so the first thing that we want to draw
remember is isn't actually the buttons
it's that title that just says welcome
to Bucky Lane because you know it's a
cool title so in order to draw text on
the screen on the screen G draw a string
not g string that would be embarrassing
and first of all what string do you
wanted you're on the screen well we just
want to say something stupid like
welcome to Bucky land there we go where
do you want to draw it at 150 I think
that would be good 100 across and 50
pixels down so now that we have the
title on the screen what we can do is
well let me just go ahead and run this
verify our titles right there looking
pretty good so now what I'm gonna do is
I'm gonna add the play now bun right
underneath here in the exit game button
underneath that so play now that's the
image in what do we wanted to do to it
we want to draw on the screen where do
we want to draw it at 100 100 so appears
right under this title right here now
the last thing we're gonna do in this
story is just draw exit if I don't hit
caps lock exit game draw this at 100 200
which will make that appear under the
Play Now button so now let's go ahead
and run this baby and check it out we
now have the pretty much this is all you
get for the main menu again it will
probably be a little bit better if I
through a graphic in here that says
welcome to Bucky land and it's Bucky
standing next to you know a mountain or
a tree or something but you know I did
it the lazy way but the important thing
is we got our two buttons one at 100 101
at 100 200 and notice if you click them
right now obviously nothing happens
because we didn't add that functionality
yet so in the next order what I'm going
to do is I'm going to add the
functionality to a enter the place state
whenever I click this button and be exit
the game whenever I click this button so
for now that's all you get but in the
next story that's what we have to look
forward to so think guys for watching
don't forget to subscribe and I'll see
you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
