is Bucky Roberts and welcome to your
very first SAS /se SS tutorial now the
first question I want to answer for you
guys is what the heck is SAS why would I
ever want to learn it what can I do with
it
well the easiest way to explain what it
is because it's actually a bunch of
different things combined to make your
web design life a whole lot easier but I
want to talk to you guys about one boom
because this is going to clear a lot of
things up so I'll tell you guys a story
that whenever I was making my social
network
I used this specific shade of blue all
over my site I used it in the links for
some backgrounds for some borders you
know just on a bunch of different web
pages now if I ever wanted to change
that shade of blue then what I would
need to do is I would have to go through
every single CSS file find that color
and change it one by one and that's
going to take a long time especially if
I have a boss who's you know changing
his mind all the time
well one of the things that you can do
with sass is you can actually make these
things called variables now with a
variable you can just stick this
variable and I'll show you guys how to
do this later I just want to give you
guys a quick example and you can pretty
much update the color in one location
and it can change it in every single
spot that you want to do so it's pretty
much going to save you guys a bunch of
time and not only variables or
placeholder words you can use but a ton
of other sweet features so the next
thing I want to clear up is well I just
got like phlegm in my throat I just ate
a roast beef sandwich and I put a bunch
of mayonnaise on it so I think that's
the problem anyways getting kind of
off-track here moving on what's the
difference between sass and scss I mean
I heard SCSS was the thing I wanted to
learn and this tutorials like sass or is
it it or what's it going on well they're
actually the same thing they're just a
different syntax so if we just look at
this quick example I know you guys don't
know any of the stuff is but sass is
pretty much the shorthand version and it
doesn't have any of those curly braces
or semicolons that you're familiar with
would
writing CSS now SCSS this is what syntax
I'm going to be teaching you guys in
this tutorial and this is what I'm going
to recommend learning so you can learn
both of them if you want but most people
use s CSS and it's kind of the newer um
it's a different syntax but it's you
know the more popular one and the one
that I recommend so okay so this is like
a new version of writing CSS that's a
whole lot better than the old version
sounds awesome
how do I you know like install it start
using it well the first thing you need
to do is you need to make sure that Ruby
is installed on your computer now if you
have Windows then go to this website
right here Ruby installer org and click
this big download button I'm not going
to show you guys how to download it
because a I'm on a Mac and B it's really
easy all you do is you follow a wizard
click Next Next Next the whole time and
then you have it at the end it's not
like you don't have to tweak any weird
settings or anything like that so if you
ever installed anything in your life
you're going to be golden now on my Mac
whenever I bought this Ruby actually
came pre-installed but no matter what
operating system you have after you have
Ruby installed you can install sass so
if you're on a Mac open up your terminal
if you're on Windows open up your
command prompt and type this command
sudo well don't type sudo for Windows
but if you're on a Mac type sudo and
then gem gem is a program that came with
Ruby and it pretty much allows you to
download and install things from the
internet it's like a built in tool and
it's actually really useful but that's
not important right now because we're
just using it to install one little
thing install SAS SAS s now if you hit
enter in meymaneh my password alright I
got it got a long password all right so
what's installed and again I know even
though I'm teaching you guys s CSS
that's just a syntax no matter if you
want to learn SAS or SCSS download SAS
it includes both
so that's all you have to do and I
already have it installed on my computer
so that's why my command prompts might
be a little bit different than you the
output that it gave me but either way
that's all you do SAS is now installed
on your computer and if you just want to
verify and make sure if you type SAS s
minus V then it's going to print out the
version of SAS and this should be the
latest version so says three point four
point one six during the time of this
tutorial
selectively Steve I guess that's their
codename pretty a weird codename
actually but let me close out of this
all right so we downloaded Ruby we don't
really need it for anything other to
install SAS we download the stat SAS we
now have it on our computer okay now
what the heck do we do well now open up
your IDE whatever IDE you're using and
just go ahead and make a basic HTML file
now before I actually start showing you
guys the syntax in all the cool things
that you can do with it I want to talk
to you guys about one other thing that
is kind of weird but we need to
understand so your browser whatever
browser used Chrome Safari Firefox
whatever it can't understand SAS files
and those are dot s CSS files it can
only understand plain CSS alright that's
a kind of a problem see I want to learn
SAS and we're going to be typing this
new cool syntax but what's the point if
my browser doesn't even understand it
well what we're going to be doing is
we're actually going to be typing this
syntax and here's a little demo right
here and I'll talk to you guys what all
this stuff means I said and what we need
to do after we type it is we need to
compile it in other words we need to
translate it into normal CSS so our
browser can use that and understand it
so depending on what operating system
you're using again you just type in uhm
like SAS compiler and Google and if
you're on Windows typing like SAS
compiler windows if you're on Mac type
in SAS compiler for Mac and this is the
program that translates scss to plain ol
CSS that our browser can understand now
another cool thing that I want to point
out is the reason that I'm not going to
download one is because I actually have
one built in to my IDE so if you have a
jetbrains IDE I'm using webstorm this
comes with a compiler now it actually
comes with a pretty fancy compiler
because instead of typing your sass and
then going Doug your your compiler and
hit compile it automatically watches for
sass files in anytime you make a change
of those files it's going to translate
it into the CSS on-the-fly
so I'll show you guys a real quick
example of this so I'm just going to go
ahead and right click new file and I'll
just type like main s CSS now watch what
happens in take note this isn't a CSS
file this is a s CSS file so it's a
special sass file I'm going to hit OK
and it's going to say okay dude I see
that you're trying to create a sass file
do you want me to add a file watcher and
this means that I'm going to watch this
file and any time you make a change to
it I'm going to look at it and try to
convert it into CSS so I'm like heck
yeah I do
that sounds awesome so if you just hit
add watcher and hit OK it's now watching
this file for any changes that we can
make now again this is your HTML file
and you want to add a link to main dot
CSS so we just created a s CSS file
which is our sass file and we're
actually going to link to a plain CSS
file um how's that going to work because
the CSS file doesn't even exist well
whenever we start typing code in here is
going to automatically compile it and
create that CSS file so I so that was
all the confusing stuff we can now
finally get in to the actual sass and
the first thing I want to teach you guys
about that is how to work with variables</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
