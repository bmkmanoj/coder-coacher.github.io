26th pagana tutorial video just gonna
pick off where we pick up where we left
off just right in the these crossover
statements here so uh with what we did
first with the X was we wrote it and
then we added an or sit combine since it
really is either-or statement but you
can also write that with an if L if
statement as well so that's what we're
going to do here is we're going to write
an Elif
so for the other side of the the why
cross over so now with this Elif we
could we would say L if lead y plus
block size actually I think it's block
underscore size plus block size is
greater than R and Apple y and lead y
plus block underscore size um is less
than R and Apple y plus Apple thickness
a little bit off the screen there but
that's okay then if that is all the case
we'll do the same thing we did before
and that is print x and y cross over and
then we move this makes a little more
sense and let me just iterate why we
wrote everything we wrote in this Elif
statement so we're asking here if lead y
plus block size so let's go over to our
lovely paint here and we're asking the
following question if lead y plus block
size so that's on this side of the box
so I've lead y plus block size so over
here is between is greater than R and
Apple y which is here it's greater than
this and then an leave Y Plus block size
is less than R and Apple y plus Apple
thickness so this is here greater than
over here but
less than over here that's what we're
asking so that was the other side and
ever basically why and get me over thank
you so we've asked both these questions
and now we're assessing whether or not
we have X&amp;amp;Y crossover so let's go ahead
and run that and see where we stand so
there's our snake as your Apple oops
okay let's plug play again all right so
no crossover that's good
just barely crossed over got it let's go
over here
cross over got it but over here cross
over good good good I can't really see
if it spacing out anything more yeah
definitely is it finally moved up the
window I wasn't really sure so now what
we're going to do is fix this to not be
just a you know pasting crossover
instead what we want to do is we
actually want it to output the Apple
resetting function which is right here
so we commented it out and let me make
sure this contains the commented out
tens yes so now we just copy this and
paste it basically so copy and then
we'll paste it right here uncomment
uncomment and then paste it right here
uncomment uncomment space sloppy and
then we'll delete this print statement
here and I'm just going to delete this
one as well
okay let's save and run that and let's
just check it make sure our code is
right so we'll play our game for a
minute here and just make sure that I'm
not really sure how I got away with that
reversal I'm pretty sure I should have
died there so so far everything seems to
be three frames per second is definitely
a little too fast oh my goodness
so I think we're fairly confident at
this point that that code is good so um
so we'll just leave it at that I think
so now at this point we've covered a lot
of like object interaction based their
object collision or whatever you want to
do when two objects come together so
we've got basically all the combinations
that are possible that I can kind of
think of out of my head so so you can
make all kinds of things collide and
have handling for them depending on
where it is I like the idea though of
making it as efficient as possible so if
you're a snake
or if you're two objects that are
colliding can be the exact same size why
not make them the same size or if the
object is always smaller and you can
always make sure they come into each
other like like with our snake in our
apple if we kept everything on like a
grid basically of tens that makes a lot
of sense so why not do that so if you
can do that that's great but for most
games you're not going to be able to get
away with doing that so it's really
important to understand writing logic
like this and again in this case we
showed two different forms of writing
logic either you can ask if this is the
this whole thing is a case or this is
the case do something or you can use if
and l-lift statements it really is it
doesn't matter that that much in the end
but and if the first statement is
correct it wouldn't even run the or
anyways so it doesn't matter it comes
down to preference really a lot of
people don't like to write really long
lines that's understandable so now that
we've got this far in our game what else
can we do with our game well first of
all I'm not really content finishing
snake and leaving snake until we've
actually fully completed the game so
what's wrong with our game still well
first of all our snake is ugly as heck
our Apple is ugly as heck very boring
and our text is ugly as heck very poorly
centered so we know we have to fix that
also it'd be nice to have some sort of
score it's a little hard to count how
many segments are in your snake so some
sort of scoring functionality we
definitely want to have and then maybe
like a really basic menu at the begin
it's going to be a lot like a quit
screen where you just sit you know play
with C or Q or whatever so that's what
we have in store now the other thing -
how to we're going to be talking about
how to change this little icon up here
as well and then we'll actually get to
distributing snake let's stuff look
forward to thanks for watching on this
video and in the next video probably do
changing the looks of the snake bulls it
so anyway stay tuned for that thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
