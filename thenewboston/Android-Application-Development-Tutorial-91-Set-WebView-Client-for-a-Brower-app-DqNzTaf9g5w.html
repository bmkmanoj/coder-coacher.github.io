Android tutorial for the new boss in and
what we're going to do in this tutorial
is get rid of that air I showed you in
the last tutorial we're not necessarily
an error but every time we use our
browser and we click a link you know
it's going to open up a new intent use
the intent to open up some kind of a
browser instead of using our webview
like we'd like and what we need to do is
we kind of need to override that intent
that's happening and so what we're going
to do is we do or how we're going to set
that up is by setting up a webview
client so what we're going to do first
is we're just going to say our browser
dot then we say set webview client and
as you can see it takes a webview client
within its parameters now we don't have
a webview client yet so we're going to
create one so we're going to create a
new class we can either do that over
here or down here down below in the code
which were which I'm going to do so ever
you guys feel cut more comfortable with
but we're going to create a new object
which again is a which is a webview
client so we're going to say new our
view client something like that doesn't
really matter what you guys want to
label that as and it's like hey we don't
know what this is we're going to say
create a class our view client right
here and we're gonna say whatever finish
dang it I hate how it does that I'm just
never mind I'm gonna do it yeah I might
as well just do it in this new code over
here so again basically all we're doing
is we created a new class that is going
to be a webview client so we're going to
just create a new object of the webview
class that we just created and then I
just hovered over and said create a
class which created this class for me as
you can see the most important thing is
it extends the webview client class so
that's that's going to allow us to again
since you know our set webview client is
looking for that we need to say extends
webview client as well so now what we
want this class to do is we're basically
going to make a
a boolean a true/false but so we're
going to override because it's coming
from something else so we just have to
override that method I know even really
got into what override means but it's
kind of a Java thing don't worry too
much about it we're just going to say
public boolean and say should override
URL loading and this is going to be a
web service or I'm sorry a webview
called D and we're going to call this or
the second parameter is going to be a
string called URL and this R we're gonna
have to import a webview so you're like
what's going on here basically this is
just a method that we need to set up and
it's going to say which view we want to
override and basically what you are all
when we use the load URL method on our
web view from the previous class it's
going to go through this whole thing
right here so we're going to need the
web view which web view we're dealing
with and what URL it's trying to load so
that's basically what that method is
doing right there and then what we're
going to say is we're going to say view
or V for a web view that's being passed
in right here and then we're just going
to say load URL the same method and then
we're going to say URL as well so
basically that's the method that we're
kind of setting up and it's still giving
us an error because it's boolean it's
looking for a true false statement and
so we're just going to say return true
so I'm I don't know if that that's kind
of confusing let's run it make sure it
works and I'm going to kind of talk over
everything that we did again and
hopefully we'll make a little bit more
sense whereas that's loading I'll just
talk over that again okay again Android
will use an intent that uses its own
browser to open up links of some sort so
we want to override that so how we're
going to do that is using the set web
View client and then we don't have a web
view client yet so we're going to say
create our own a new instance of this
class that we just created so we had to
create that class so it created s4
created it for us and it extended the
web view client which is what we're
looking for and then we created this
method called should override URL
loading which takes in a web view and a
URL so we take that web view and we use
the load URL method and then you know
basically we're just setting that to
true so it's going to load on our you
are on our web view if that makes sense
hopefully does but it might not and
sorry if it doesn't so let's try and
click like blog here and hopefully it'll
load now within here as you can see the
blog section is loading in here the next
and then just make sure tutorial section
right here as well so yeah it looks like
it's working the next thing that we're
going to do is we're going to kind of
scale down this browser to fit in this
window so as you can see right now it's
zoomed in we don't really want to start
zoomed in like this so we're going to
scale it down and show you some other
settings that we can use with the web
view class and I'll catch you guys then
have a good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
