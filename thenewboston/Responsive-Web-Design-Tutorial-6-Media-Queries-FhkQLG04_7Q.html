tutorial and in my opinion this is going
to be the coolest tutorial yet because
I'm going to talk to you guys about
something called media queries and it is
arguably the most important part of
responsive web design because what it's
going to do is it's going to allow you
to take your responsive websites to the
next level so up until now these
tutorials have been pretty cool I mean
we learned to make some menus at the top
that contracted either contracted or
expanded depending on the size of window
of the window and also we learned to
make some images that could shrink or
grow depending on of course the size of
the window but we haven't really learned
to make a truly responsive website a
website that style can actually change
if we were looking at it let's say on a
mobile phone versus a browser so there's
a difference between the entire styling
actually changing and just having stuff
shrink or grow so that's where media
queries come in now the easiest way I
can explain a media query is it's
basically a test so what your computer
does is it looks at your browser and it
says okay I'm going to test something
and of course what we're going to test
for is is the browser small like you're
looking at on a mobile device where is
it big like you're looking at it on just
a regular desktop like this and
depending on the results of that test it
says ok if the test results are this
display this styling if there's
something else display another styling
so that's what a media query is so now
let's go ahead and start using it and
right now as you can see the websites
blank I cleared everything out also what
clean our CSS file so just so we have
something to look at I'll just re bacon
and tuna is little out there ago alright
so this is just so we have something
other than you know just a blank white
web page so now let me hop over in index
CSS and
if I try to talk to you guys or talk you
guys through the entire process like as
I'm doing it it's going to be kind of
confusing so what I'm going to do is I'm
going to type all of this out and then
explain what each part means and then
it's going to be all really easy to
understand you guys are make okay that's
like the coolest thing ever
so type media screen and just re/max
with 800 pixels and inside here this is
going to look familiar because this is
where we're going to be applying some
styling so body you know what this does
I'll just sit like ohm on a background
color or something so background go
order the blue and I'll change the font
size so font size equals I'm not 40
pixels and I know I told you guys to
stay away from pixels but this is just a
quick example so this my friend is a
media query so first before we actually
start breaking this up and find out what
it does let's go ahead and look what it
does on my website refresh it and it
does hmm nothing what a waste of time a
waste of tutorial however check this out
watch what happens when I start
shrinking this website nothing nothing
nothing and then suddenly the background
turns blue in the text becomes 40 pixels
tall okay so so this isn't like two
different websites all I'm doing is
taking one website shrinking it and once
it gets below 800 pixels the style
completely changes to a blue background
and a different size font now of course
whenever you're making this a real life
you just don't want to change the
background color of your website for
mobile phones you're going to want to do
something like change the layout so
elements are easier to click on in view
but for right now it's good for
demonstrating what a media query is so
again a media query is set up like this
we already know what it does it tests
the browser so well I'll talk you guys
through it line by line now so we're
basically saying is we're making a media
query so computer we're going to be
testing the
browser and if the test is true apply
this styling if the test is false or if
this test if the test results come back
negative it sounds like you know my
testing my browser for HIV or something
but if there were test results are
negative then don't apply the styling at
all so the stuff inside this bracket
only gets applied if this test is true
so now let's look at the test so media
says we're making a query a test screen
means are you looking at this website on
a screen and you're thinking what the
heck else would I be looking at on on
there's actually CSS that you can apply
to print like every print stuff out but
99% of the time people just apply this
to screen so I'm not really worried
about print for these tutorials because
I don't know I just don't care about it
I don't think you guys are watching
these tutorials for that either so
that's our first test is it a screen a
smartphone a desktop on a tablet
anything like that and the other test we
want to apply or the other query is max
width so this is a really easy way to
test the width of your browser
now of course 800 is pretty good because
most desktop monitors are more than 800
pixels so if you're looking at on a
smartphone phone or a small screen
device then this styling is only going
to apply for mobiles or tablets and
stuff like that so this is one test that
we can have to apply styles only the
small screen devices there are other
ones too I'll talk to you guys later on
but for now that's what it does this is
okay this test is constantly going to be
running in checking itself and once the
test is true yes this is still screen
once it gets less than 800 pixels then
it says ok now I apply this styling
right here and there are also different
ways to set this up in oh okay I guess
I'll show you guys one way that we can
set it up right now instead of having
the CSS file set up like this what we
can do is something like this we can add
another
property in our link tag and we can add
our test right there so take this test
is it a screen and is it less than 800
pixels and stick it right in your media
attribute now in here what you can do is
apply your styling and let me say both
of these files and whenever you do it
like this you get the exact same results
so again this is just a different way to
set it up so this is pretty much saying
this this is a link to a style sheet
called index CSS and of course this
style sheet just turns your background
blue and makes your font big however I
only want you to load this style sheet
if this media test is true so only load
this style sheet if you're on a screen
with less than 800 pixels so instead of
embedding the test in a style sheet
that's always called again this is a
different way to set it up if you prefer
that
and they're actually benefits to either
one and I'll talk to you guys about that
later on but for now I think you guys
had enough umm if you want to go ahead
and take all the code from this it's on
my forum as always um I don't know I
guess that's all I have to say about
right now in the next tutorials what
we're going to be doing is we're going
to start setting up an actual websites
now that we have the basic pieces of
information that we need to make a full
responsive umm website so thank you guys
for watching don't forget to subscribe
yeah he added tomato tomahto I'll see
you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
