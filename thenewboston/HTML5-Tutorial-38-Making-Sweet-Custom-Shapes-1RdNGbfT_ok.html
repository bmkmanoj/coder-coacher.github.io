38th html5 tutorial and in this lesson
I'm going to teach you guys how to draw
custom shapes so now that we learn to
draw basically custom colors who is text
me right it does get into my dank
tutorial Joby oh ok Joby anyways
trying to do it tutorial now so I forgot
where I was that let's just go ahead and
get started with its oriole so what we
need to do in order to draw a shape is
we need to make a path now a path is
basically an outline of the shape so in
order to start making a path we first
need to call the function begin can you
guys guess it path and this just lets
our canvas know that hey we're going to
start making a shape right now so
pretend that you have a pen in your hand
the very first thing you want to do is
move to a certain point so canvas move
to and we're going to put two parameters
in here and X in the Y value what this
is going to represent is your starting
point where do you want to first start
writing and I'm just going to start
writing the shape at the coordinate
50/50 so over 50 and down 50 so right
around there so what I want to do after
this is okay
from here where do I want to move to now
canvas instead of move to since we
already did that
what you do is write line two so move to
is basically your starting point line
two basically says draw a line from this
point to this point however we didn't
give it a point yet so let's just say 72
50 now here's what we're basically
saying start at the point 50 50 and draw
a line to 72 50 so this is going to kind
of give you a diagonal shape over 70
down to 50 something like this so now
what we want to do is we want to draw
another line because again a shape can't
just be one line from point A to point B
that's not a shape at all that's just a
line so as a third coordinate let's just
put like 300
I don't know 200 so now we start at 50
50 we move over and to the right a
little bit and then we're moving right
around here over 300 down 200 so we got
a kind of weird up - looking triangle I
don't know if it's obtuse or not I can't
tell just from these coordinates but
it's a weird looking triangle it's not
like symmetrical or anything so now that
we got three points a starting point a
second point and ending point what we
want to do is we want to say okay now
we're done with our shape so the next
function we call it is canvas closed
path now we don't have any coordinates
in here because what this says is say
okay make a line from wherever we are
and in this case 300 200 right now back
to the starting point
so draws a line from here back to here
and of course whenever you draw a line
from your ending point to the starting
point you don't need to say you know you
don't need to explicitly say 50/50
because it just assumes that so whatever
shape we have so far it's going to go
ahead and close that path now what we
have now is an outline of a shape we
don't have a shape yet in order to make
a shape remember let's utilize what we
learned in like tutorials go canvas
stroke now this is going to do is it's
going to take that shape or excuse me
that path and convert it into a shape so
now this will actually draw something
that we can view this is pretty much
just all the information from it right
now in this we're saying okay now that
you got the info actually draw on the
screen so let's go ahead and save this
is as long as I didn't forget anything
we're going to go ahead and check out
our shape a nice beautiful looking
triangle so again 5050 we went over 50
down 50 that's where we started and from
there we went from 70 to 250 so 70 to 50
is right here and then we went from 300
to 200 so over 300 down 200 right here
and then the last thing we did is say
close that path which it closed it from
our ending point to our starting point
and draw a stroke
now we're saying okay I saw that
tutorial you're not fooling me what the
heck was this thing right here then well
this is actually a challenge that I have
for you guys the first person to message
me through YouTube and send me the code
of how to draw this fabulous eight
pointed star I'm going to send you guys
a free t-shirt don't worry about the
cost of the t-shirt don't worry about
shipping it's going to be the new Boston
t-shirt that I had printed up it's black
and it says the new Boston right across
the front so you know I just didn't want
to say that at the beginning so for
those of you who are dedicated to
watching my tutorials watch this all the
way through first person to send me the
code on how to draw an eight-pointed
star send me the code through YouTube
messaging and also send me your name
your address in your t-shirt size and
the first person to do that wins a brand
new t-shirt you'll get in the mail
shortly so thank you guys for watching
don't forget subscribe and a good luck
with the t-shirt</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
