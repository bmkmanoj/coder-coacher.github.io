slash on live gamer for the new Boston
and in this tutorial we're going to be
taking a look at what's called
concatenating strings now basically what
this means is taking one string and
adding another string to it and when you
do this it's stored in another variable
so let's go ahead and get started we're
going to create a concatenate demo so go
ahead and go to new project we will name
this string concatenate and then we'll
go ahead and click OK make sure you have
selected a console application now here
is module 1 let's go ahead and zoom in
here a bit ok so now what we're going to
do is we are going to create a string so
dim user string as string and we'll go
ahead and set that equal to nothing
because we're going to have them type in
a string now what we're going to do is
we're going to create another string
that will be stored in our program so
dim program string as string and we'll
just set that equal to something like
catfish so now what we're going to do is
we're going to prompt the user to enter
in a string so we'll do console dot
write line
type anything you want so now what we're
going to do is we're going to get what
they typed so user string equals console
dot readline so now what we're going to
do is we're going to take their user
string and add program string to it so
but first we're going to print out what
they type so console dot write line user
string and now what we're going to do is
we're going to add program string to it
so user string equals user string plus
program string so basically what this
does is it takes user string and adds
program string to it and it makes it all
one word now let's go ahead not one word
one string so let's go ahead and add a
space here in catfish so it will you
will be able to see the space in there
and now what we're going to do is we're
going to print out user string again and
then we'll just have the program pause
and wait for us to press Enter by using
console dot readline and now we'll just
run it and it'll say type anything you
want so if we type in snowboarding go
ahead and press ENTER it will say
snowboarding and then it will say
snowboarding which is what the user
entered and then it adds program string
to that now what we can do is we can
come back in here and we can add more
strings to this now these strings don't
have to be variable so we can go ahead
and add anything we want by enclosing it
in quotes so we'll just type fishing
so now we're just going to do is going
to take what they typed add catfish and
then add fishing now we can also use
this which is what we've used in several
other tutorials we can use the end sign
inside of our console dot write line
statement to add another string to it
soldiers type hello YouTube what this
does is it takes user string and adds
hello YouTube to it for the time being
and then it doesn't save hello YouTube
it's just there when this console dot
write line is called and then it
disappears so let's go ahead and run
this now I don't say type anything you
want so I'll just type in Sam it shows
us what we originally typed in Sam Sam
catfish
fishing hello YouTube so you can do this
any way you want you could even add
another string right here and
concatenate as much as you want in the
string but remember if you use the +
sign inside of the arguments for console
dot write line this is going to be
discarded as soon as you're done with
this statement or as soon as the program
start with this statement so this is a
very simple concept but I wanted to
teach you guys that and it should be
easy for you to understand and once you
understand that go ahead and move on to
the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
