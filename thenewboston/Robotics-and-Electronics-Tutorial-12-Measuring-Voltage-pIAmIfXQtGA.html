you guys how to test for voltage on your
circuit so we have our circuit right
here and the power is flowing to it this
little light is on not enough you can
tell her or not
but this circuit is going to stay on the
whole time while we're testing so now
plug your leads in to calm and voltage
respectively and the next thing that
you're gonna want to do is turn your
multimeter on DC voltage now I don't
know if you guys are gonna be able to
see this reading so I'm going to show
you guys or I'm gonna tell you guys what
it says sometimes if you can't see it
the next thing you want to do is take
your black leave it from your multimeter
right here and touch it to the black end
of their terminal from your battery this
is gonna stay here the whole time the
only part you move around is this red
one so go ahead and touch the red one -
you can touch it and let's go ahead and
test the battery first touch each other
the positive part on your battery and if
you can't see we're getting your reading
now 8.3 5 volts and this is typical this
is pretty much the battery's voltage so
we use a little bit of power on our
9-volt battery but it's still good next
go ahead and move it right before the
resistor and as you can see we still get
a reading of 8.3 3 and this is good
because this is just a pipeline then it
shouldn't use any current yet but let's
see what happens if you move it right
after the resistor if we move it right
after the resistor then we get a reading
of 2.8 1 5 volts and this is because the
resistor is doing its job it's a
limiting the amount of electric current
that flows through in since it's
resisting the electric current the
voltage drops significantly so that's
why that drops and as you can see it
should be the same right before the LED
light and let's see what we get two
point eight one three so that's good but
let's see what we get right after the
LED light in our circuit we get right
around zero volts amazing how that works
so let me show
guys are actually explain you guys why
this is as electric current goes through
the first thing it does is pass through
this resistor this resistor limits the
amount of electric current that's flown
and then after it passes through the LED
the LED is gonna use up the rest of your
current and that's why all the voltage
after your LED is gonna be zero so again
the resistor limited the voltage and
then once it hit the LED and use all the
rest of the electricity and that's why
after your LED you should have somewhere
close to zero on your voltage so again
to refresh one more time anytime you
want to test your voltage take your
multimeter keep your black probe on the
black end of the battery and the only
thing you do is move your red red probe
around to wherever you want to test for
voltage and like I showed you guys or
explain you guys this is useful and
determining how much voltage is going to
each part so you don't blow part like we
did earlier so that is that for this
tutorial make sure to check out my next
tutorial make sure to subscribe and I'll
see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
