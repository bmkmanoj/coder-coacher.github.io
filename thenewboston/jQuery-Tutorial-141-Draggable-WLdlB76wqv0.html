with a video tutorial for the new Boston
in this tutorial we're going to be
taking a look at the draggable
interaction in the jQuery UI and how we
can drag elements on a page we're also
going to be looking at the options that
we can supply there are a large variety
of options that you can choose from for
this interaction
however I've picked out probably the
most relevant in terms of usability
we're also going to take a look at some
of the events that are associated with
this this interaction okay so we're
going to be dragging a particular
element on a page so we're going to go
ahead and first of all create this
element on our page so I'm going to
create this as a span and inside of here
I'm just going to right drag me now we
did take a look at how to make an object
draggable in the last part of the
tutorial list jQuery UI tutorial series
and we looked at how to actually set the
draggable interaction on a particular
object obviously the difference in this
tutorial is it's going to be a lot
longer because we're going to be looking
at the different options we can supply
so I'm going to create a or call this
span so give it an ID of drag so we can
use a selector to reference this ID and
you'll notice that I've got UI j s open
in my browser and i've also included
this on the page as well as the jQuery
UI library and the jQuery library as
well so these two files will handle
everything we need this file however is
blank and this is where I'm going to be
writing my own code so the first thing
we need to do is set this to draggable
so let's go ahead to our browser and
just refresh you can see that we've just
got a span element here we can do
nothing with it at the moment so what we
want to do inside UI J s is check for
when the document is ready so we use the
document selector and ready and inside
here we create a function which will
handle ever
thing after the document is ready to use
or is it's loaded so we need to make
this ID heal this span with an ID of
drag draggable so the fundamental way to
do this would be to use a hash selector
to select the ID or the element with the
ID drag and then we just write draggable
now just this alone
is going to allow us to actually drag
the element however we don't have any
constraints and we don't have any
additional options supplied to it we
supply all the options within the
parentheses here so let's just take a
look in our browser what this is done we
can now actually drag this element
around the page the first thing you'll
notice is that we can drag it so it's
not in view and as well here if you look
at the bottom of my browser down here
you can see that we are actually
creating a large space because we've
were able to drag it wherever and you'll
see it does get a bit messy so we can
supply options to constrain this to a
particular area on the page we'll be
looking at that first we'll also be
looking at a few other options that
allow us to change the cursor create
some kind of create like a grid style to
this set the opacity and also reverting
back to the original position so there's
lots of options we're going to look at
and we'll be looking at that one by then
one by one will then be going on to look
at events where we can tell when the
dragging has started when the dragging
is happening and also when the dragging
has stopped so ie when the element has
been released and the mouse is Friel the
cursor is free from the element so the
first option that we're going to look
for or that we're going to talk about is
the axis now we can set the axis in
which our element moves in now at the
moment obviously we can move it in the X
and the y-axis we can move it wherever
we want however we want to particularly
constrain it to one access we can we can
specify this so for example if I wanted
to specify just to the x axis
only allow it to move along the x-axis I
can do so or if I want to constrain it
and only allow it to you know move on
the y-axis we can also do access we can
do that as well
so when we supply options inside of this
draggable function here we use curly
brackets so i've created some curly
brackets inside here our option name
goes here and our option value goes here
so we've got an option name and a value
and these are comma separated so we can
supply more than one so everything I'm
going to talk about you can combine into
the same element as well so like I said
the first thing we're going to be
looking at is the axis so let's go ahead
and specify the axis option now we can
either specify the constraint or the
restriction to X or Y and this is
supplied within single quotation marks
so for example if I wanted to constrain
movement only to the x axis I can do so
by specifying axis and then X in single
quotation marks let's go ahead and check
what that's done when you now when you
can you can see now that when I drag it
I can't move it downwards but I can move
it across the x-axis so now that I can
move it across the x-axis it won't
actually move down the y-axis at all so
we can do the opposite to this and
obviously specify that the constraint is
only in the Y access and we can only
drag it down now so that's how to
constrain to a particular axis inside
the draggable interaction we're going to
take a look now at the containment
option now containment is extremely
useful because as I mentioned earlier we
can actually drag this anywhere we want
we can drag it out of view here we can
drag it across so we create scroll bars
at the bottom however what happens if we
want to allow the
containment only to the current document
window current document or current
window now the current document will be
the document itself however the window
will be the current actual window that's
open so the document might be larger
than the window so we might want to
first of all only allow it to beam you
know moved inside of the document area
so let's go ahead and choose this
containment option
so that's containment and we have a few
options here the first one we're going
to look at is document as I mentioned so
we just type containment as the option
name and then document as the value</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
