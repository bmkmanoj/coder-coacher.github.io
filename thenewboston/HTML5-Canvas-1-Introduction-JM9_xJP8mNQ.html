is Bucky Robertson welcome to your very
first tutorial in using the html5 canvas
now if you've been watching my videos
before you probably already know that I
already made an entire series about
html5 so what the heck am i doing right
now making a whole nother series about
it well as the title implies this video
series is going to be only specifically
talking about the html5 canvas now the
canvas in html5 is in my opinion the
coolest part of html5 and that's because
this is the area where you do all your
cool drawing and interactivity and all
your awesome animations take place and
if you want to make any games with html5
this is the area where you need to focus
on so that's why I want to take a whole
miniseries and dedicate it specifically
to using the html5 canvas now for those
of you guys who have never you know even
heard of html5 I highly recommend
watching my html5 tutorials first there
on my website the new boston org once
you watch those you're going to have a
nice solid understanding of the language
in these tutorials are going to make a
whole lot more sense to you so don't
jump right into these please watch my
html5 tutorials first all right so now
that I wasted a minute of your lives
already let me go ahead and actually do
something useful start coding and shut
up so what I did already is I basically
made a HTML file in a JavaScript file so
obviously if you ever watch html5
tutorials the HTML file is where you're
going to be putting all of your basic
building blocks and all your cool things
your interactivity in your animations
are going to be taking place in the
JavaScript file so they basically go
hand in hand in creating a really cool
interactive awesome webpage so before we
get to the cool stuff we go ahead and we
have to make the basic building blocks
first so let me go ahead and do that so
go ahead and make a basic HTML file and
in it the first thing you need is your
doctype HTML and then we need all of the
boring tags HTML ending HTML and we also
need to do this for the head
head-head ending head and of course the
body the body because my body is so sexy
right now my body is my body my body and
coating at the same time singing at the
same time now we can go ahead and add a
style tag now inside your head the first
thing you want to do is you want to add
a style tag so let me go ahead and add a
style in unlike the previous versions of
XHTML you don't need to specify that at
CSS because CSS is the default in html5
so what's the first thing we want to do
to our webpage well the first thing I
want to do is I want to change the
background color of it because check
this out
go ahead launching Chrome Oh plain white
this looks pretty cool
not if you couldn't you know not catch
the sarcasm over there so what I want to
do very first thing is of course change
the background color so body and let me
just go ahead and make this um gray so
background nine nine nine nine nine nine
this is you know not dark grey not like
grey so well basically gray so now let
me go ahead and well if I save this and
show you guys refresh it we now have a
cool gray background now the reason I
want to make a gray background is
because I want my canvas to be white and
of course if you have white on white you
can't really tell where the canvas
starts and where the background you know
it pretty much looks cooler if they're
contrasting each other so that's why I
want my website to be a different color
alright so the next thing we want to do
is we want to set the properties for the
canvas using canvas ID so whenever we
make the canvas element of course we
need to go ahead and reference this ID
so the first thing I want to do is I
just want to add a margin margin of ten
pixels and also a padding ten pixels as
well
just because it looks a little bit
neater whenever we're you know drawing
stuff and now what I want to do is I
want to specify the background of this -
white never seen alright why do you need
to do that because isn't it white by
default
well actually whenever you make a canvas
in html5 it automatically inherits the
parent element and since the parent is
of course the body it would have a
default background of gray and obviously
if our canvas was gray and our
background was gray then everything
would be grey and gloomy and we probably
go into depression and slit our wrists
and that wouldn't be good
we're here to learn html5 so if you want
to avoid depression you need your
background to be white does that make
sense to you hopefully so now what we
want to do is we want want to add a
border of one pixel solid black and all
right this looks pretty good
so now we're saying alright we set the
background of our website to gray and
whenever we make a canvas with the ID of
canvas we want it to be white with the
black border so on and so forth but if
we save this website in refresh it
nothing happens why is that
well because even though we set the
properties of the canvas we didn't
actually make the canvas itself so how
do we do that well go ahead and canvas
and we actually might as well go ahead
and end it right now canvas and I want
to mention this the newer browsers at
Google Chrome and the any updated
browser can display html5 and can
display the canvas however if someone
like your mom has a really old computer
and she didn't update her browsers for a
long time they're not going to know what
the heck the canvas is just because the
browser is outdated so any browser
that's outdated is going to be able to
read the text in between this so we'll
just go ahead and write get a new
browser with a explanation point so
basically like I said if you have
updated browser that shows html5 you're
just going to see the canvas and not the
text however if you have an old browser
then we're just want to leave them a
little note get a new frickin browser
so the first thing I want to do in my
canvas which I just created is I want to
reference the ID canvas because that
sets this canvas to inherit these
properties which we would like so in
order to do that ID equals
canvas now the next thing you want to do
is you want to specify the size of your
canvas now for my canvas I just want the
width to equal 600 pixels and you just
go ahead and write 600 not px or
anything and the height is equal to 300
now you can actually make your canvas
any size the reason that I'm doing this
is because as you can see whenever I
launch it it fits nicely in my screen
recorder so in this tutorial obviously
what we did is we basically just made a
blank canvas on the screen pretty
freakin cool
but I told you guys that this thing was
like interactive and cool and right now
we just made a white box not that cool
so we're going to be saving the cool
stuff for the next tutorial but from now
thank you guys for watching don't forget
to subscribe and I'll see you guys in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
