with a video tutorial for the new boston
in this video we're going to be creating
a div element that we're using width and
height both for the window and the
object were able to place in the very
center of the page and this is also
dependent on moving the window as well
so you can see I've got my code just
behind me here and you can see that this
will stay in the center of the page if
we adjust the width or the height of the
window so we constantly place this
exactly in the middle of the page so
it's an extremely simple way to do
things we're going to create it a little
messily this would be good as for
example as as an example a plugin but
we're gonna go and create it just very
messily but just using the width and
height to calculate where we should
place this it's not as easy as placing
it at half the width and half the height
you have to then you know sub subtract
off of the actual object the half of the
object height and width as well but
we'll we'll cover that so we'll go ahead
and look at the code or go into our text
editor and start writing out the code
for this okay so the first thing that we
want to go ahead and do is create our
element and then we're gonna apply some
styling to it you'll notice I've
included style dot CSS on the page and
as well as jQuery obviously because
we're using jQuery and ext J's as well
let's go ahead and just create this div
and then we can start to style it and
preview it in our browser I've created a
div and I'm gonna give this an ID of
very center and let's just go ahead and
refresh the page you can see nothing but
the div does exist here so let's go
ahead into star dot CSS and actually go
ahead and style this so very Center
we're gonna apply a few properties to
this the first one is the height so I'm
going to have this at 150 pixels then
the width
again 150 pixels I'm going to set a
background color of black just so you
can see where it is properly let's just
refresh you can see that we've got that
there and let's just change that to 250
sorry and lastly what we want to do is
we want to set the position to absolute
and what this is going to allow us to do
is use top and left inside of jQuery
we're not going to do anything else to
this stylist discern div styling but
position:absolute means that we can move
it around on the page exactly where we
want it's it's fixed to our own custom
position we can choose where we want it
so for example I could say top 20 pixels
and you can see that shifted 20 pixels
from the top or left 200 pixels and that
will have shifted 200 pixels from the
left so we're going to be using the top
and left to move this around and
therefore we need position set to
absolute okay so now that we've created
our div on index dot PHP and our styling
on style dot CSS we can go ahead and
actually start to write this out and
we're going to be writing the resize
action inside of a function we're going
to be using the window resize event
handler to call this function every time
the windows resized but we're also going
to be calling this function initially so
it's set to the middle of the page
initially so like I said slightly messy
and it would be better used as you know
like a plug-in or something but for now
this will give you the general idea so
we want document and we want to apply
the ready event handler and inside of
here create a function we'll just go
ahead and bring that down just the
standard notation for when we use jQuery
and nothing to worry about
that's just how we write it out so let's
go ahead and create our move div
function so function move div this will
essentially this function will
essentially grab the height in the width
of the window the height and the width
of the div itself and then it will apply
some kind of position to this and then
we can you know call this function at
any time when out on our inside of our
dock
so the first thing we want to do is
establish the window width and the
window height so we use the width and
the height to calculate this so I'm
going to create a variable called window
width and that's going to be equal to
window dot width
quite simple we're using a jQuery
selector and we're selecting the window
and we're taking the width of the window
let's go ahead and say window height
equals and exactly the same thing let's
just have these over window dot height
okay so let's go ahead and alert out
window or let's go ahead and alert out
width x height X and let's just go ahead
and replace these X variables in here
okay and we can just append on window
height so we're taking the window width
from here and we're applying it to a
variable called window width we're
taking the height using window height
obviously windows the current window and
it will change depending on where you
move it and then we're letting out the
width so in here we can just call this
function move div or down here so when
the document is ready we define this
function we yeah we define this function
and then we call the function down here
so now when we refresh we get width 950
and height four five nine so that's the
current width of my window okay so now
what we want to do is we don't want to
just call that function yep in fact we
do so we're going to do some more
testing we want to grab the width and
the height of the object so I'm gonna
call this obstacle doubt div very center</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
