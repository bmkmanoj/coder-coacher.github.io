we learn about binding so what I want to
do now is show you guys an example of
how we can use these in Java FX so what
I'm going to be doing is I'm going to be
making a little demo where there's an
input and you can type some text in such
as your user name and then I'm going to
have a label underneath it and as you're
typing that label that text it gets
updated in real time so it's pretty cool
we're not going to have any buttons
whatsoever it's all going to be done
through binding so this is a cool way we
can update the user interface in real
time so let's get to it so let me
comment this bad boy so first I'll say
input and labels
all right so text field I'll just name
the place where the user types in like
user input set this equal to new text
field and I'm also going to do this user
input I'm just going to make sure it's
not too long so set max width equal to
something like 200 and that's just so it
doesn't take up the entire width of the
window which will look kind of weird and
now let me go ahead and add that text
underneath now we're actually going to
have two labels because the first label
is just going to be like some message
like welcome to the site and the second
one to the right of it is going to say
like Bucky or the new Boston whatever so
it's actually going to look like one
long label but well no behind the scenes
is actually two so first label set this
equal to new label and just like have
any message like welcome to the site and
add a space after that
second label equals new label we can
just leave this blank by default so
again we're going to be binding this to
whatever the user types in so it's going
to say welcome to the site Bucky if they
typed in Bucky welcome to the site Hoss
if they typed in Hoss whatever and
actually I already got my overall layout
so we need to position these
side-by-side so they look like one
sentence so I'm just going to make an H
box so I'll just name it like bottom
text set these equal to new h box what
do we want inside about just two labels
so first label and second label so
whenever the user first starts our
program is just going to say welcome to
the site since second label doesn't have
any initial value but as soon as they
start typing then it should look good so
bottom text I just need to make this
look a little bit prettier set alignment
and we can do POS that means piece of
snot Center and this is just for looks
so what I'm going to do now is probably
is going to appear bunch together if I
just run it right now so I'm going to
give a spacing of 10 that's what that
means and now I just have to say what
items do I want to add to that V box and
that is user input and then I can
actually just add the entire bottom
sentence and all right that looks pretty
good so we have our layout right now if
you run it okay that's good so what we
want to happen is I'm going to type in
value like Bucky and we need to bind
this label to whatever I type in and
it's actually really easy one line of
code
so after this V bucks we can just put it
we can take that second label which is
that second piece of the sentence and we
can call text property on it now
remember with properties we can bind
them to something else and we're just
binding it to whatever the user typed in
so the user name input or a user info
whatever we called it text property so
again then
well got a little Fleming my throat art
so this is of course the text that they
typed in to that input field and we're
going to be getting this in binding the
second label to it the second piece of
the sentence so whenever this updates
that label automatically updates so let
me run this and check it out so it says
welcome to the site Bucky
welcome to the site the new Boston
welcome to the site Hoss welcome to the
site now leave please whatever we want
to do so how awesome is that we can now
have a GUI hood did you ever hear people
call a GUI user interface
I mean GUI stands for graphical user
interface so Colin a GUI user interface
is kind of like saying graphical user
interface user interface but yeah we can
now have a dynamic GUI user interface
how awesome is that
that updates in a real-time we're going
to call it a GUI user interface from now
on I think it sounds pretty cool alright
so anyways I'm going to take this code
stick it on my github if you want it
thank you guys for watching see you next
