C++ tutorial and in the store I'm going
to make a real quick program and I'm
going to show you guys a trick to make
your future programming a whole lot
easier so for this magic trick to work
we actually need another function so
just go ahead it's going to return boy
name it funky funky function and all
it's going to do is print out something
on the screen so pass in void get back
void so go ahead
I forgot you can't copy that you have to
use the keyboard shortcuts so go ahead
and add a body and of course since we're
printing out something we using name
space STDs for using names Reese and ER
and C out and let's just print out bacon
and tuna look good look good do you
looks good to me and of course let's
print out something here like it doesn't
really matter see out umm I kissed a
girl and I like dis if you can name that
singer you win a prize all right and now
let's go ahead and call funky so what
we're doing is printing something out on
the screen calling this function which
in turn calls this and so we should when
you run this get some text on the screen
nothing you haven't seen before I kiss
the girl and I liked it that's coming
from Maine and bacon and tuna which is
coming from this funky method alright
so simple enough if you guys are saying
all right first of all you guys I told
you I was going to be teaching you the
trick involving using namespace standard
but before I even tell you guys what the
trick is
let me show you guys why you need this
in each of your functions let's go ahead
and comment this out and this pretty
much means make it visible to the
programmer but to the compiler this
align is not here at all so it's pretty
much let's go ahead and do this there
let's go ahead and delete that line
completely in try to run this program
because I told you guys that you need
that line but maybe I was lying to you
so
go ahead and run this and you see this
lower red box and I know you can't see
it but it says error message see out was
not declared in the scope and that is
why you need using namespace standard
every time you write a function it's
because it gives you access to the basic
functions already built into C++ and one
of those is C out all right so that's
why you need using namespace standard um
I guess I didn't really need to show
that to you guys but I just wanted to
prove you guys they actually didn't need
it and I wasn't just biessing yeah so
that wasn't the trick the trick is this
check this out
whenever we build programs I mean by now
you saw that we can build programs using
more than one function but whenever you
build an actual program that you know
you might want to sell or you do it for
maybe a class in college or any time you
build a fully functioning program it
doesn't have two functions it doesn't
have three functions it has like
hundreds and hundreds of functions and
they're all tied together into this huge
program so when you have rebuild a bunch
of functions we really want to only
concentrate on the useful stuff right
here and we don't want to have to
remember typing using namespace STD and
every time so here's what we can do go
ahead and delete using namespace STD and
take it out of every single function now
instead of putting it in the functions
individually what we can do is right
under your include go ahead and put
using namespace STD right at the top of
your program outside every single
function and now let's go ahead and run
this program and check it out it works
perfectly how awesome is that so now I
saying all right Bucky what the heck
this just happened why does this work
well it works because of this whenever
you post something at the top of your
program and we'll talk technically about
what's it called it's called scope and
we'll talk about that later but
now just remember this whenever we post
this at the top of our program every
function in our file that is the
function that it affects so anyway what
I'm trying to say is this whenever we
post the under the include it affects
every function in the file so this takes
away the hassle of having to type in
individually on every single function so
anyways that's the only trick I wanted
to tell you guys this isn't going to be
a 10 minute long tutorial that's the
only thing I wanted to cover and I
wanted to distress it so that's why I
need to put it in our own store so
anyways hopefully I see why this program
works now and now in the future when you
see this at the top and not in any other
functions you understand how this
program works so anyways I'm not going
to waste any more of your time that's
what my other tutorials are for so
anyways thank you guys for watching
don't forget subscribe don't forget to
check on my forum website yada yada do
all that and yeah I'll see you guys
later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
