tutorial I'm going to show you guys how
to add a video player to your app so if
you ever want to make an app or the user
can play videos then this is how you do
it however before we begin I want to
warn you of one thing
whenever you develop this project and
you run it in the emulator the emulator
is unable to play videos at this moment
I don't know if they're developing a
system where they can display videos in
the future but right now the emulator
that you make in Android studio can't
display videos so to test this out
you're probably going to need to run it
on an actual device and if you don't
know how to setup an actual device for
testing then I'll make a video in like
10 tutorials probably showing you guys
how to do that but for right now I just
want to warn you guys that if you try to
follow along with this and then you run
it in the emulator you're just going to
show up as a little black box and you're
not going to see anything moving so
nonetheless this is how you add videos
to your app so start a new Android
studio project and I'm just going to
name mine
video layer and make sure that you
select API 15 because the package that
we're going to be using this is the
minimum SDK that's going to be
compatible and then click Next and just
choose blank activity next good enough
all right so once everything is done
finished being setup we have our design
file of course the main activity so the
first thing I want to do is mention this
you see how we have this textview by
default we're going to delete this in a
little bit but take note of where it is
so we position this within our relative
layout but we still have this bit of
padding around the left-hand side in the
top now this is because if you go in
your source code view
see let me clean up my properties a
little bit so you guys can see what's
going on a little bit easier so by
default this relative layout was given
to us by 16 DPS of padding around the
edge now whenever I plop that video
player in there and I'm going to show
you guys how to do that in just a bit
I want it to butt up against the side of
the screen I don't want to look like
it's floating in the middle so what we
can do is we can actually select all of
this padding from the relative layout
and just delete it and now if you go
back to your design view you can see
that the widgets are now butted right up
against the edge pretty cool so of
course we don't need this textview so we
can just select that and delete it now
what we do need in order to play videos
is one widget so if you scroll down to
containers right here you're going to
see this widget called video view so
take this widget and drag it right on
your relative layout and just release so
by default it takes up the entire screen
good enough now the only other thing we
have to do for the design is select that
video view and we need to give it an ID
so I'm just going to name this oh what
can i name it like Lucky's video view
enter and now we can reference it
through our code RA so hop over to main
activity because this is all the
interface is going to be probably the
easiest GUI we ever designed
so again hop over here and the first
thing I want to do is delete these last
two methods these are just for the menu
and I don't really need those I just
want to keep this tutorial very simple
very basic alright so what we need to do
is we need to import two things so
import Android widgets the video view
and we already saw it that what was and
the next thing I want to import is this
Android dot widget dot media controller
now by default this video view is going
to be capable of displaying just pure
videos now this media controller is
pretty much the video player like you
would think of it by that I mean all of
the buttons like the play button the
pause button the stop button so if we
just want to display a video to play
automatically then we can just use this
video view but if we want to allow the
user the ability to play it stop
pause it whatever then we use this media
controller it's like video controller so
simple enough so now let me go ahead and
do this so in your on curry the first
thing we want to do is we want to get a
reference to that video view that area
that can display videos so final video
view
Bucky's video view and of course you set
this equal to video view right there
Bucky's video view so simple enough now
after this now that we have a reference
to it in order to say okay this is the
video that I wanted to display in this
area we actually need a video so what I
did is I uploaded a real quick sample
video all I did is I actually just
recorded my screen and I went in ms
paint and made a real quick smiley face
in this video I just moved my mouse
around and it looks like this little
face is talking so probably the dumbest
video ever but I wanted a real small and
before file just for testing so if you
guys want the same one of course you can
find any mp4 file on the internet and it
will work but if you guys want this one
then again the New Boston comm slash
forum
so let's project underscore files such
double oh-6 underscore test video mp4
alright so how do we set the video
player to play this video well just take
that view and call a method called a set
video path now inside here you just
throw in that string pretty simple so
now we said okay this video view is
going to display this video and in order
to actually play it you actually call
just one less method and that's video
view dot start so now if we actually run
this I'll show you guys again remember I
said that your emulator isn't going to
be capable of displaying the videos so
if you actually want to see you're going
to run on an actual device well
we can go ahead and run it right now to
make sure we don't have any bugs or
errors all right now one other thing I
forgot is you need to add a permission
to your manifest so and let's just say
that hey we want to use the Internet and
that's just because we are referencing a
file on the Internet
instead of locally on our device so
again go to your manifest and add this
and once you run it you are going to see
we close out of this you are going to
see this now typically this black box is
where the video will play and actually
whenever you run this program in your
emulator you are going to be able to
hear it you just are aren't going to be
able to see the video so your challenge
for this tutorial is type in in the
comment below what this dude is saying
because if you can hear it then
everything is working fine and also I
want to mention by default whenever you
take this in um flip it horizontally so
it's orientated in different direction
the video is automatically going to
stretch to fill up your entire screen so
that's another cool feature about it so
now that that's taken care of and also I
highly recommend doing this on a device
it's going to make a lot more sense many
ways now that our video is working I
want to show you guys how to add the
optional media controller and even
though it's optional you probably want
to do this like 99% of time unless you
have you know a really important reason
not to well I'll just say player
controls like play pause stop etc
alright so the first thing you need to
do is you need to get a reference to
this media controller class or the
objects on media controller I'll just
name mine media controller it set it
equal to new media controller object now
we're going to pass in this for context
so now the only thing we have to do is
we take that media controller object and
we're going to call a method called set
anchor view and for the anchor we need
to pass in
and whatever your view is named right
here so now one last line of code you
actually take this and I know it's kind
of weird but this is just how it's done
and for the view
you set the media controller which means
okay I want to set a video player on
this two media controller you think that
they could just do this in one line of
code but that isn't how it's done so
again three simple lines pretty much get
an object which is the video player and
set the videos view to that video player
alright guys so even though you can't
see it I just ran it on a device and it
works fine and another thing I probably
should mention if you hold down the left
ctrl key you know how you have to
control keys on your keyboard ones on
the very left bottom corner and one's
kind of to the right to the right of
your spacebar if you hold down the left
control key and hit f12 it's going to
rotate your emulator so I thought that
it might show if I rotated it but again
typically whenever you have a video your
videos can be right here and of course
all of your player controls are going to
be right here at the bottom pause rewind
forward all that good stuff so again
there you have it I know you can't see
it but trust me it's there if you can
hear it it is working correctly so for
now think eyes for watching in in the
next video I'm going to be showing you
guys how to use your camera to take
images and save them on your device</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
