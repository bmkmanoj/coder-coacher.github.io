43rd I think objective-c tutorial I
don't know who's keeping track but
anyways in this tutorial we're gonna be
covering the scope of variables sounds
super exciting it's not mouthwash scope
pretty much means who has permission to
use the variables that you create so
well first of all I probably tell you
this I created a new class called tuna
yeah that's all I need to tell you so
you probably don't even need to type
along with me in this story or just sit
back watch and learn but don't learn too
much that won't be fun so anyways check
this out we created a new class called
tuna and let's go ahead and make some
variables like an X and let's go ahead
and make another one why not an Y so by
default any methods say if we had a
method in here called void sum method
any methods that we create in the same
class
tuna have access to these X and y
variables easy enough we knew that
already obviously they have access to it
and also any class that is a subclass of
tuna also has access to these variables
well yeah duh Bucky since they inherit
the variables they obviously have access
to them so objective-c made a special
keyword and that's called these
variables are protected that means that
only methods in the same class and
subclasses of tuna can use these
variables so say for example our our
character's class right here we can't
alter the tune of variables x and y we
can only alter the character's variables
which is you know c1 c2 all that all the
variables we made in the character's
class right here and likewise tuna does
not have access to these variables right
here you're saying alright so why are
you telling me this I mean all variables
are going to be treated like this we
already knew this but you're wrong C
Objective C made things called
directives and
these are ways that you can treat
variables differently depending on how
they are directed I guess you could say
now by default these are all protected
but there's also something that you can
do and it's called to make the variables
private now I told you guys before not
only methods in this class cuz access
them but also if tuna had a sub class
then that sub class had access to these
variables as well but there's gonna come
times where you don't want subclasses to
have access to these variables so if you
want only the methods in this tune class
in no subclasses to have access to these
variables here's what you need to do in
your variable declaration before you
even start typing any variables go ahead
and press at private now any variables
you type under here and Y and G these
are going to be private variables and
what private variables mean is only
methods in this class are going to have
access to them so if you're saying
alright well what if I only want to
private variables and some the rest I
want protected which is pretty much the
ones we've been learning before by
default everything is protected we just
want these two special private ones well
anytime you want to go back that make
and protect variable variables go ahead
and put pro tect I got the like hiccup
slash burp right there go ahead and type
a protective now any variables you type
after to this and age and not Y again e
these are all going to be protected so
there are four directives by default
protected and private and these are the
main ones there's also two other ones
called public and packaged that hardly
anyone ever use except for a special
rare occasional but anyways just
concentrate on private which means only
the methods in this class and protected
these are the ones that we've been
learning by default and again by default
you don't need to put protected at all
that's a you know what they are usually
just if you
ever have private first then you need to
switch back to protected so these
directives are kind of like a switch as
soon as you put private any variables
that you create are gonna be private
until you switch back to protected so I
mean that's pretty much it so again what
I'm saying these two variables right
here they can only be used by methods in
this class not subclasses and these can
be used by methods in sub classes as
well as long as methods in this class
same thing we've been learning before
and the other directives public and
packaged you don't use until I tell you
to because you know you're probably
going to use them it's often bad program
practice to use those so that's actually
all I have for you guys for this story
next tutorial is going to be a it's
going to be you know kind of a doozy
saying I thought I'd give you guys break
so go you know get a glass of milk and
you know watch an episode of lost and
you know once you're ready to come back
for a next tutorial I'll see you then
but anyways thank you guys for watching
don't forget subscribe and you I guess
if you want the source code I can put it
on my forum so click the link below if
you want that but thank you guys for
watching now see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
