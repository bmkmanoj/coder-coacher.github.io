your 51st tutorial and intermediate Java
I'm just kidding guys I'm not old
British and and this is what we're going
to be doing is we're going to be
connecting to the server and pretty much
doing that connection start running
script so connect to server that's what
comment will do and you know how I said
that I was actually going to name things
different because whenever I make
programs personally I just don't like to
have like the same method names in this
program and on the server program but
since it will probably be a little bit
easier to understand what I did is I'm
just going to name everything the same
so I changes send data to a send message
because that's what I named it on the
server side so to connect to the server
what we need to do is we need to code
that public start running method so
public void start running start running
on start running oh all right so now of
course what we need to do is we need to
put a try-catch in here so try to do
this and if you can't do that then catch
an exception and the exception that we
want you the catch is eel if
okay there we go so whenever you catch
it they just show that okay I'm going to
have to blame that one on my keyboard
actually not me because it's never my
fault when I do typos it's always my
keyboard so show message and that would
just be something like client terminated
the connection and last but not least
actually okay let me just go ahead and
do one other thing catch another one I'm
going to go ahead and catch IO exception
exception and by the way if you want to
catch different types of um errors or
whatever they're called errors yeah I
guess you just calm exceptions I guess
um this is how you do that so I go
prints tech trace and hopefully this is
the one we don't see this is the one
that it's okay if we see but because
whenever the client arm basically says I
don't want to talk to you anymore then
it should just show this message but
this IO exception is a one that you know
hopefully we don't see because that
means that something really went wrong
with the program and you know we're just
not ending the connection so if we see
they see this then we'll just go ahead
and print stacktrace
now finally once you're done doing all
of that then what you need to do is
close all the crap down and close crap
remember that method was responsible for
doing all the housekeeping stuff like
closing the streams in the socket so on
and so forth so the only other thing we
need to do now besides building this
show message in closed crap method is we
need the code the three main methods
pretty much the meat of this program the
first one is connect to server and um I
think that whenever I was making the
server program then it was just like
wait for connections but since we don't
want to wait for any connection the
client is responsible for connecting to
the server not vice-versa so this one's
going to be connected servers and it's
going to connect to one specific server
and of course on that's why we need the
IP address so we know which server that
we want to connect to and after this
once you're connected then just go ahead
and set up streams and while chatting
there we go so make sure I put connected
server set up streams and while chatting
with a semicolon can't forget that so
now in the next tutorial basically what
we did in this one I'm not going to go
through everything again because I
explained it in the server class
whenever I coded that it's basically the
same thing the only line that's
different is connect to server and no
excuse me just like burp there hookup
there's something and this is because we
don't want to wait for connections from
every computer we only want to be
responsible for connecting to one
specific computer and actually what I'm
going to do is I'm going to show you
guys how to do this in the next tutorial
so we're going to be coding that method
in the next tutorial but for now thank
you guys for watching over to subscribe
follow me on Twitter and I'll see you
later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
