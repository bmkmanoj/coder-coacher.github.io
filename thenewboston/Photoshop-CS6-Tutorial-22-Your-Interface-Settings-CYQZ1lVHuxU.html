Photoshop cs6 tutorial my name is buddy
Blackford and today we're gonna be
setting up your interface preferences so
to get to your preferences all you got
to do is hit edit and then come down to
preferences down here at the bottom and
then choose interface in the last
tutorial I went over general preferences
and so this time I'm going over the
interface so no way nice yes six you're
able to choose the appearance of your
interface by the color theme here so you
can change how dark you want so I'll
just click on it and you'll see the
entire thing changing so that's dark and
then here's the really bright so
whatever feels good on your eyes I like
this one here up to you guys what feels
better on your eyes so just choose
whatever the next set that we have here
is the screen modes the standard screen
mode here pretty much each if you're
changing the background and you like the
border colors for the different screen
modes so here's our borders here we can
change like you can see like the back is
changing its gonna go with default
because I like that full screen with
menus so you get you can change the
different types of screens down here
with this button here you can go
standard full screen with menus or a
full screen and this is how you change
them here now let's come down here into
the options section let's look at the
auto collapse iconic panels here so what
this does is when you click off of your
panel here it'll go away so it won't
always stay up if you have Auto collapse
iconic panels on which sometimes that's
not useful when you want to use
something like your info panel so I keep
that off so the next one Auto Show
hidden panels
they temporary they temporarily appear
when you point to the agility of the
application window so where's the hidden
ones well that well I guess that's what
it does I can't do a while we're in the
preferences but that's what it does so I
like to keep that checked open documents
as tabs I like that that just makes
these tabs up here at the top enable
floating document window docking it
allows you to like pull out the tabs and
have them floating out so like a couple
of tutorials ago we talked about
managing windows and you able to pull
out like one window and work on it and
have an update in the other window so I
like to keep that one check because I do
that sometimes we gotta show channels in
color so so there's a channels panel
down here and it'll show these in color
instead of greyscale and actually I want
that on because that helps beneath so I
want to have that checked we've got show
menu colors and our I guess it's going
to show the different menus for the
colors it'll be in your user-defined
colors so that's where that's gonna be
it
will come over here to show tooltips and
I like to add that on while I'm doing my
tutorials but it's up to you whether or
not you want to have that on there so
when your cursor is over like when your
cursor is over top of something a
tooltip will appear let's see if I could
find one I think when I put my cursor
over this it appeared yep so those are
like tooltips like these yellow pop-up
boxes and then we have enable text drop
shadows and this is new so
you select this to have your drop
shadows on the panel labels but I've got
my panels over here with the labels
what's uncheck it me not really seeing
too much of a difference but I'm gonna
leave a check because it was already
left checked so that's fine for me show
transformation values here so basically
you got the top left bottom top right
bottom left and bottom right or never if
you want and I guess it just shows you
near the cursor where you want it to be
so like when I was pulling one when you
pull out like a shape in cs6 it'll show
the width and height next to your cursor
and this shows where to where to show it
we've got our text down here so we got
our default language here you wants to
answer a user interface and here's our
font sizes here so whatever you guys
feel like doing with the font size it
depends
I just goodbye not small just to keep
everything because I can read it and I
just keep everything like more compact
and so if everything's big let's put it
on large okay
no I didn't didn't do much oh well so go
back to preferences and interface you
might find size small oh it's for my
text changes will take effect the next
time you start Photoshop that's why I
didn't see it yeah so that's for the
text here like I restarted and able to
change the font size so that's full
that's it for the interface preferences
here and we're about six minutes in the
next one yeah well we'll go over the
file handing I know our file handling
preferences right now so we have our
saving options here so image previews
always save so I always keep that on
always safe goes out one knows like when
when you're like trying to use the
preview you can just like see it quick
like very quicker file extension use
lower case use upper case that's up to
you I think lower case is the norm and
so that's really up to you so we got
save as to original folder which it goes
back to the folder that you started out
in we got save and background where it
automatically saves so if I uncheck this
this one will become unchecked so
basically this is just an autosave every
10 minutes it's up to you how long some
people can work for a long time without
having to save but I would recommend
either 5 or 10 minutes for your autosave
I've got my not 10 minutes a lot can
happen in 10 minutes if you're working
really hard and you're in the zone so
here we got a file compatibility section
and we got our Camera Raw preferences so
if you click on this we got a whole
bunch of preferences here so you can
change how you like pretty much handle
them so
down here you can automatically open up
the JPEG with settings and Tiff's so DNG
is a file format for camera RAW files so
you don't really have to worry about
these I'd keep these on default for now
let's see rage is reading these through
a real quick to see so yeah yeah just
pretty much you can just keep these how
they are and that's a good setting that
I would recommend so we've got the
prefer Adobe Camera Raw or supported raw
files and that's it uses the Adobe
Camera Raw file like it uses the little
program it has inside so you can like
edit and everything like that so that's
what you would want to have checked if
you want to use that exit Probert
ignoring exif profile tag which is a
color space mid-may to data attached the
camera images so that's up to you if you
want to ignore it or not I have it
unchecked because I don't care
ignore rotation made of data so that's
also attached to digital cameras the
rotation metadata and this is new in cs6
so let's go to the next one that's up to
you I just keep it off these are my
settings that I keep for my file
handling asked before saving layered
TIFF files that's self-explanatory and
then disabled compression of PSD and PSB
files and that's new also if you don't
want to compress it that's up to you but
you're allowed it allows you to do
maximum compatibility so maximize PSD
and PSB file compatibility so you should
be good without having without having to
disable the compression so that's good
so those those are the preferences for
interface and file handling and I guess
that's all so thanks for watching this
one
we should be able to move on to some
cooler stuff after we get done with all
our preferences and there's a whole
bunch of preferences in Photoshop so
let's get through those and basically
we're gonna start chugging along so I'll
see you guys in the next tutorial keep
on watching
good bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
