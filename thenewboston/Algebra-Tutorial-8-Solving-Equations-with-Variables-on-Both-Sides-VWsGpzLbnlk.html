equations with variable terms on both
sides so what we're always gonna do
first is collect our like terms and then
we're gonna after we do that we're going
to solve our equation so first thing
we're gonna do is we're gonna collect
all of our X's together and then all of
our numbers together so for X and then
remember how we solve equations we would
subtract this from both sides so for X
minus X is 3x and then I'm going to move
this six over so I'm going to plus 6 on
the side and plus 6 on this side so we
get 3x is equal to 15 and now that we've
collected our terms we're gonna solve
this just like any other equation by
dividing by 3 and getting x equals 5 ok
so let's do some more examples so
remember the property we use when we
have something written like this we're
always gonna do this first before we
collect our like terms so 2 times
negative 3a gives me negative 6a plus 2
times 5 which is 10 is equal to negative
4 times 9 which is negative 36 minus 4
times 4 16
I mean mistake this should this is an a
not a nine so this should say negative
for a so now we're gonna collect our
terms together so I'm gonna move this
six this way and this 16 this way so I'm
going to plus 6a to both sides and I get
10 8 I'm going to plus 16 to both sides
and then when I get 26 is equal to 10
a oh sorry that was a negative so this
should say negative 4a plus 6a which is
2a divide both sides by 2 and we get a
is equal to 13 now we're gonna do the
same thing down here distribute this 2
and 2x minus 6 is equal to X minus 1
plus 7 we can drop these bars or these
parenthesis because we're gonna collect
all of our like terms anyway so we're
gonna subtract this x over we get X
minus 6 equals negative 1 plus 7 we're
gonna add 6 over get X is equal to
negative 1 plus 7 which is positive 6
plus 6 which is 12
so now we have fractions and you can do
this a couple different ways but I think
the easiest way is to multiply your
fraction in and reduce so for this we
would take one one six times 12 which is
12 divided by 6 minus 6 times 1/6 which
is divided by 6 is equal to 5x plus 20
so 12 divided by 6 is 2 minus X is equal
to 5x plus 20 so I'm gonna bring the X's
over here and the constants over here
I'm gonna subtract 5x from both sides
and I get negative 6x is equal to
subtract 2 from both sides it's equal to
18 divided by negative 6 and I get X is
equal to negative 3 we have one more
problem and we're gonna do it the same
way 6 divided by 3 times y minus 9
divided by 3 is equal to negative 2y
plus 13 6 divided by 3 is 2
2y minus 9 divided by 3 which is 3 it
was negative 2y plus 13 I'm gonna add 2y
to both sides get 4y is equal to add 3
to both sides 16 y is equal to 4 now if
you weren't being careful and you didn't
want your sign right here you would have
subtracted 2y from both sides and then
you would have ended up cancelling out
your Y so you should always be left with
a y if not that means you probably made
addition mistake so you should go back
and check that so that's all we're gonna
do with solving equations today make
sure here you come back when we talk
about
using equations to solve word problems</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
