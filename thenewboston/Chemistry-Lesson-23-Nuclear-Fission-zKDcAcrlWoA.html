23rd chemistry tutorial and in this
lesson I'm going to be talking to you
guys about nuclear fission the
technology that is responsible for all
of the nuclear plants in America today
and also is responsible for some atomic
bombs so I know you guys are probably
salivating over that thought so
basically what nuclear fission is is
it's when an isotope breaks into two or
more elements in other words whenever
you have the nucleus of an atom and it
breaks up into some smaller stuff that's
the process of nuclear fission now
nuclear fission happens everyday in
nature all the time however since this
process gives off energy scientists
wanted to kind of find a way to harness
the energy pretty much so they could
sell it for some cash so what they did
is they find out that two isotopes in
particular work really well in nuclear
reactions this is uranium 235 and
plutonium 239 and I'll talk to you guys
about why these two isotopes work so
well later on but for now let me show
you guys visually what goes on inside a
nuclear fission reactor so basically
we'll say that this will say that this
blue in green nucleus is the nucleus of
uranium-235 so here's a nucleus of
uranium in these three or all uranium
right here so what they do is they have
a bunch of uranium-235 and they go ahead
and they strike it with a neutron now
the reason they have a neutron is
because you can't have anything that's
charged like an alpha particle or
something since this is a nucleus of
uranium its positively charged
it has protons and neutrons in it so if
we would fire another proton in here
let's say then since this is positive
and this would be positive they would
repel each other and it couldn't blast
into it so that's why we choose a
neutron because the neutron has zero
charge it could collide with this
nucleus easily there you go so basically
whenever we have this collision that
happens the uranium nucleus becomes
instantly unstable and breaks apart so
uranium-235 can actually break apart
instead
different ways however uranium-235
typically produces two lighter elements
as we can see with this red and white
and green and red and it also typically
produces two or three additional
neutrons that's why they have to use
uranium-235 because it often spits
splits in this very particular way and
this is very important because whenever
you have these new neutrons then those
new neutrons those additional neutrons
are free to collide with other atoms of
uranium-235 causing the same reaction
over and over and over again and we call
this a chain reaction with other
elements we can split them apart but
they don't produce these additional
bullets so the reaction kind of just
fizzles out with this it takes only one
small amount of energy this one Neutron
being fired in to produce this chain
reaction in remember I just show arrows
here but this whenever this splits apart
is going to produce more elements and
other neutrons to go flying over this is
going to produce other neutrons to go
fly another this is going to produce
other and it's just going to happen into
this big huge chain reaction so that's
the beauty of nuclear fission that you
can make an entire an incredibly small
amount of energy and turn it into a huge
amount of energy now remember we are
only looking at for nucleus right here
for pieces of uranium basically but
member there are a million atoms in just
the width of your hair so it really
doesn't take a big sample of uranium to
produce a huge reaction so you're saying
okay I understand how you can have a
neutron burst into the nucleus of
uranium and it will produce two smaller
elements as well as three additional
neutrons but where the heck does the
energy come from
I don't see how this would produce
energy at all well let me go ahead and
answer that question for you so as soon
is the uranium nucleus splits the new
elements if we look at these are two
nucleus or nuclei from two different
elements since this is positively
charged
this is positively charged before
they're all one element and they were
together the force was holding them
together however now that they split
apart there are two positively charged
nuclei and they're going to repel each
other so whenever two things repel each
other it's going to cause motion which
causes kinetic energy which produces
heat so basically they're all held
together by the force or the glue before
and now they're going to break apart
move apart which is going to produce
kinetic energy which was before
potential and that movement is going to
cause Heat so this causes a lot of heat
now aside from that it also produces
gamma radiation now in addition to the
heat and gamma radiation depending on
how this um uranium nucleus split apart
these two elements or depending on the
isotope that it makes the new elements
may also emit beta radiation or gamma
radiation so basically you're guaranteed
to have at least gamma radiation and
also kinetic energy in there for heat
and aside from that you also may have
beta radiation and gamma radiation
coming from these new elements so with
all of that that is how it produces
energy in nuclear fission so hopefully
all of your answers with nuclear fission
are answer now in the next tutorial I'm
going to be talking about nuclear fusion
which is basically taking two different
elements and pushing them together into
one bigger one and the way that that
makes energy is totally different and
that's supposed to be like the future
energy of tomorrow the perfect energy so
that's what we're working for now and by
we I mean chemists all across the United
States and all over the world but we
have not gotten to that point yet so I'm
going to be talking all about all that
in the next tutorial so that's what you
guys have to look forward to but anyways
thank you guys for watching don't forget
