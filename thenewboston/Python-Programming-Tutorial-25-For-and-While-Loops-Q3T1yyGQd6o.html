time and this time I'm going to be
talking about loops now what a loop is
is it pretty much allows you to do a
certain block of code multiple times
without typing it multiple times so the
first type of loop I'm going to be
showing you guys what is something
called a while loop and that's whi le
and the syntax for that I'm just go
ahead and make a basic loop so the first
thing we need is a variable and I'm
going to make a variable called B and
set it equal to 1 and the next thing we
need to do is throw this baby into a
while loop so the while loop you pretty
much have a test condition you're right
Wow and while it just means as long as B
is less than or equal to n we'll put 10
because we wanted to loop ten times
put your colon so the first thing well
I'll write this loop to show you print
that variable and then we want to take B
and add 1 to it now here it's going to
happen the first time it's going to test
it's going to say all right 1 is less
than or equal to 10 so I'm going to
print out B which is 1 and now I'm going
to add 1 to B so now B is 2 so now let's
go up to the top and test again while B
is less than or equal to 10 which is
true because it's 2 I'm going to run
this again it's going to go 3 then do it
4 5 6 7 8 9 and then it's going to put
10 and then it's going to stop so this
is the piece of code it does and this is
so it gets to 10 if we didn't have this
then that B would be equal to 1 the
whole time and it would just keep
repeating forever so let me show you
guys what that does as you can see 1 2 3
5 6 7 8 9 10 and this is because we test
it starts out at 1 we define that right
here and then it tests that as 1 and
does the code and then it adds 1 to each
time and does that whole loop again so
by the time it gets to 10 our test
condition says as long as B is less than
or equal to 10 so by the time it gets to
11 is going to say false so
going to get out of that loop so that's
how you use a simple while loop to do a
piece of code over and over again
without having the type print be one
print to print 3d print for it's a
little compact way of doing large
processes now aside from the while loop
another loop I want to show you guys is
something called a for loop now what the
forward loop does is pretty much loops
through an object or sequence like a
list or something and let me show you
guys what the syntax for this is so
let's go ahead and make a list called
grocery let's just name it gee I don't
feel like taking that for grocery list
and what do we want in here bread let's
say think of some creative milk it's
pretty creative me and one more beef I
love beef now go ahead and press ENTER
and hopefully recreate it and now we
have a list called geo which is short
for grocery list
now the syntax for for list or for loop
excuse me is for then press space then
you write a name of a variable and I'm
going to name mine food and I'll show
you guys why I did this in a second and
put in geo the reason I did this is how
this is going to work the variable
variable you put after four is going to
be assigned to each one of these so the
first time this loops food equals bread
the next time it loops food equals milk
the next time of Luke's food equals me
and the last time it loops food is going
to be equal to beef and that's how how
the for loop works it just goes through
the list and assigns food to each one of
these items in a list so what do we want
to do for food in grocery list
whoa let's pronounce I want and then
let's put the name of the food so you
guys can see and I'll put
space right there's because it formats
easier so as you can see when we use the
four oh that says I want bread I want
milk I want me I'm a beef so the first
time you put four in grocery list and
four looped it it's a food and set it
equal to bread so printed out
I want bread and that says alright this
list is over let's do it again
food is now equal to milk so I want milk
BAM
next food is equal to meat I want me
than I want beef so those are your
basics of looping again the while loop
and the for loop is one way of doing
something multiple times in another way
of looping through a sequence and you
can actually use both these loops in the
same cases a lot of the times is just a
choice of personal preference but you'll
be seeing in the future why one of these
loops are better than other in certain
conditions and that's what we're
probably going to be going over shortly
so I hope you learned the basics of a
while loop and a for loop that's it for
today don't forget to subscribe to my
channel and I look forward to seeing you
in the next tutorial so thanks and I'll
see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
