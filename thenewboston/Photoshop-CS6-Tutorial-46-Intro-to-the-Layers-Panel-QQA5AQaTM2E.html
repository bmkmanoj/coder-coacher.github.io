Blackford here with another Photoshop
cs6 tutorial and in this tutorial we're
gonna start talking about layers and
layers is one of the most important
things in Photoshop and it basically
helps you organize your your document
and like setup things so that they
interact with each other so the
different layers can interact with each
other and there's a bunch of different
kinds of layers so I'm gonna go over
those at some point too so beginning
from this tutorial for a little while
we're gonna be just working with layers
so down here in the bottom right is the
layers panel if you don't have this
panel you should have it on at all times
and it should be like pretty much in
every single one of your workspaces if
you don't have it come up here to a
window and then come down into the
layers panel and make sure that is
checked and layers has a hotkey because
everybody uses it and the hotkey is f7
now let's come over here into our layers
panel and check out what the hell is
going on so we've got our different tabs
here so click on the layers tab to bring
up the panel so first here we've got our
layer filter options so we can filter
our layer by a kind name affect mote
attribute and color and what you can do
is just search so if I want to search
for a layer by name and I type in a
rectangle oops
basically it's going to bring up all the
layers that have that name now if we can
switch it off and on using this switch
button right here so that's how you can
quickly organize or find something that
you want to find so let me delete this
out oops one button so the next thing
that we've got going on is blending
modes now if I click on a layer let's
click on this layer here because it's
just a regular layer this one it's
actually the layer is this actual
picture right here and it has a bunch of
different blending modes these show how
the layer is going to
interact or blend with some of the other
layers around it
we've got opacity values here and that
shows how transparent or opaque the
layer is and it's got a slider that you
can just adjust we've got our fill here
and the fill pretty much changes the
opacity of the layer styles and I'll go
over that at some point with you now I'm
gonna go over some things and say some
words that we haven't gone over yet but
just keep them in the back of your mind
and at some point we will go over
different things like layer styles I
haven't talked about but just keep that
in mind that the fill like does the
opacity of the layer styles next to this
we have our lock options and you can
lock the transparent pixels you can lock
image pixels you can lock just the
position or you can lock everything and
that's what these buttons do this area
here below is where your different
layers are going to be so let's come
down to the bottom here where we've got
a bunch of different options also that
you might not know what they are so if
you hold your mouse over any of these at
some point well I thought they were
gonna I thought it was going to show up
but at some point the name of this
should show up yeah
so if you hold your mouse over it'll
show you what the actual name of these
are and that way if you forget later on
down the road after I tell you what they
are you can remember by just holding
your mouse over so the first one that we
have is link layers and basically you
just hold the shift key and or the ctrl
key to select two different layers and
then you click on the link layer button
and it'll link the layers pretty much so
the next one over is the effects
or the layer styles so if you click this
button let me have a layer selected if I
click this button then it's going to
show me the different layer styles that
I can put on so if I click on something
like stroke it's gonna bring up my layer
style options and then I can adjust
those and add that stuff to it if I want
it to so there's a whole bunch of
different layer styles that we can use
let me cancel out of that
the next one that we have over is the
layer mask and you just click on that to
pretty much apply a layer mask to the
layer that you have selected and if you
click it a second time you'll add a
vector mask so we'll go over those later
on everything well everything here will
actually go over later on the next one
we have is the adjusted or create a new
adjustment layer or you can also create
a fill layer if you would need it if you
needed to so what an adjustment layer
does is everything that's below it it
gets affected by the adjustment layer
and usually you're doing overall changes
like maybe like you want to make all the
images and everything in there darker or
lighter or something to that effect so
the next one that we have is is the
create a new group and this way you if
you have a few things selected or maybe
just one thing selected and you click on
this it'll create a group for you so I'm
gonna click on it it's gonna creep me a
group folder and then I can start
dragging things into it if I want it to
so might as well come over here to all
the way to the right this is the delete
button delete layer so I can either
click on it and delete something or I
can drag the layer down onto top of it
and delete it and then of course the
next one over which is a little page
here that I've gone over a few times is
the create a new layer button so if I
just click on that it'll create a new
blank layer for me with nothing in it
and then that way I can use that layer
to add stuff too if I wanted to and also
don't forget about the layer options
that we've got over here so it's this
arrow with a bunch of lines next to it
and we
got a bunch of different layer options I
have to go over some of these at some
point I'm just not gonna go over them
all at once because there's a whole
bunch of them and obviously some of them
need special parameters before they are
unlocked for you to be able to use now I
just wanted to let you know you can also
right-click on your different layers to
bring up more layer options for that
layer so we're already pretty much like
seven minutes in so I'll go over the
different layers and in another tutorial
so I'm gonna and this one and thank you
for watching this and keep tuned for
more tutorials about using the layers
and we're gonna start working with the
layers it's very important and this is
one of the most important parts of
Photoshop so thanks for watching see you
guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
