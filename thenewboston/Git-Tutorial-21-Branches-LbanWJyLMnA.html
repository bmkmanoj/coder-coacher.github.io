video we are going to learn about
branches now a branch all a branch is is
essentially a copy of your main
repository so now you're asking yourself
why the heck what do we ever want to
make a branch well in order to
understand why you want to make a branch
it's important to understand the overall
basics of a github workflow so whenever
you're working on an open source project
or it doesn't even have to be a open
source big project it can even be just
you know a little piece of software that
you're working on with a few of your
friends what you basically are going to
have is this the first thing is just
your main master repository and this is
called your master branch now any time
you want to make a change you're
basically going to make a new branch
which is a copy of this now with your
personal copy once you have that you're
going to make any bug fixes any you know
more files you want to add any changes
that you want to do so once you have all
the changes made your copy you're going
to submit your changes back to the main
repository and usually you have someone
that reviews all your changes and make
sure you didn't do anything stupid and
if they get accepted then they get
merged or accepted back into your main
master branch so again instead of just
working on this repository directly what
you do is you make a copy of it make all
your changes to that copy and then
submit it back and it's a lot cleaner
that way so that was a kind of amount of
breath after explaining how out of shape
of my if I'm out of breath after just
tucking wow I need to go on a diet or
something art so let's go ahead and
learn how the heck to do this so again
just to reiterate by default this is
called the main or master branch and
that's just your default main copy so
anytime you want to make a new one what
you do is you click this drop down list
and if you don't have one that exists
already just go ahead and write like a
name of frogs
so this main project is about dogs I'm
saying hard I want to make a copy
because this website also needs frogs
so that's what I'm going to make you
know that's what my changes are going to
be and just go ahead and hit enter and
then it's going to say okay check this
out you are now working on the copy
frogs so if you click this drop down you
can see that this is the main ones
though but the one that we are looking
at actively is frogs so always look
there to make sure you're on the right
branch and check it out we can now go
ahead and make whatever changes we need
to this copy or this branch and for this
example the easiest thing to do is just
add a readme file and if you guys don't
know what a readme is a readme is a
special file and it's basically like a
detailed overview of your project so it
goes on your home page and if you ever
want to add like a logo to your project
or like a couple paragraphs about what
your project is about maybe a few links
to your website you can but for now I'm
just going to write like this branch is
about frogs
we need more frog pictures and I'll talk
to you guys about the special symbols in
exactly you know more detail how you
write a good readme file but if you just
go to preview then we see that we
basically just got plain text so I'm
going to go ahead and commit this file
and all right so we now see that if we
toggle back and forth our main one
nothing changed we just have our
homepage in our get ignore and on our
frocks branch this copy is a little bit
different because we now have a readme
basically we have two versions of the
project but they're a little bit
different so I'm like wow I spend a lot
of time on that readme file I actually
want to go ahead and submit my changes
and make this the standard for the
master overall branch so how do I do
that well what I'm going to do is I'm
going to scroll up and if you click this
branches tab then this is basically a
way that you can see all of the
different branches and we only have two
the master and the frogs one we just
made so it's pretty easy but on whatever
branch you want to submit
for review you basically go down and hit
new pull request this means hey I want
to submit some changes to the main
master branch so just go ahead and click
that and now pretty much just like
making a commit message you have to
write a little indicator of what changes
you made to the project so it already
popped in this for else create readme MD
that looks pretty sweet now we just have
to verify create pull request and again
this is usually going to be done by
other people other people are going to
submit a bunch of changes to your
projects or you know suggestions or bug
fixes whatever and then you are going to
review them all and decide what ones you
want to accept so let's go ahead back in
dogs and as you can see this is just
like normal person back in their master
branch we're not in frogs anymore we can
see that we got a new pour request so
some user somewhere in the world decided
that they want to submit some changes so
we can click pull request to review them
so we only have one right now but if you
have a huge project they're going to
have like I don't know you might get
like 10 a day or something so in order
to see the changes just click this
little title right here their message
and as you can see their pull request is
broken up into three little sub tabs the
first tab right here is a conversation
so if this guy made some changes and I
wasn't quite sure why he made them maybe
I want to ask them a question or maybe I
wanted to discuss something I by Kay
these changes are great but you forgot
to add one more file then you can go
ahead and leave a comment right here and
it's pretty much like a chat room that
you can discuss stuff back and forth so
that's what all that is now this next
tab this commits right here you can
actually have a bunch of different
changes in a single pull request so if
this guy was working on a bunch of
changes for like a month then this would
be you know have multiple commits on it
but we just made a simple commit for
this little demo and this one right here
of course is pretty easy to understand
just like the last video we saw that the
old
was on the left and the new was on the
right well we just made this file for
the very first time so that's why it has
nothing on the left and it has our
changes on the right so you can go
through look at the pull request and see
all the files that they changed and if
this looks good then you can go ahead
and hit merge pull request this means
except these changes everything looks
good now if these changes are bad maybe
they edited something that you didn't
want changed or maybe it was just some
stupid guy and he made some bug in your
program I don't know for whatever reason
you didn't want to accept the changes
then you can just go ahead and hit close
pull request
so again merge means accept close means
basically no things so let me go ahead
and merge this pull request and you need
to hit confirm merge you can change your
message if you want I usually just keep
these the same confirm merge and again
if you go back to your home what that
did is it took the changes that they
made which was adding this little file
about frogs and it merges them or
accepts them into your main master
branch so now the entire world can see
that this is now pretty much the main
project the changes are now live so that
is essentially how everyone in the world
whenever you have these sweet big open
source projects can go ahead and work on
their own versions of it submit the
changes and we can all work together and
grow these projects and if you guys are
like all right that was pretty cool but
now I have this branch called frogs
forever so that's kind of annoying if
you ever want to get rid of that just to
clean it up then you just click branches
right here and delete all the old ones
that you don't need anymore so just
click this trash can and says delete
this branch and whenever you delete it
you still have all of your changes so it
didn't like revert it or anything so
there you go
pretty cool that's the basics of
branches basically copies of your main
project that you can work on tweak and
MIT for acceptance into the main one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
