biology video and in this video I want
to talk to you guys about DNA
replication but before we get into that
I need to discuss cell division
now cell division is basically just what
it sounds like it's when you have one
cell and it divides into two and you
know the process is a little more
complicated than that but that's
basically what cell division is and the
important thing to take away is since
we're studying biology all living things
it's important to note that all living
things all organisms can replicate or
reproduce their cells now why would a
living thing want to reproduce their
cells well for several reasons actually
one is growth remember you started out
as a single cell in your mom's little
belly and then now of course you are
trillions and trillions of cells so in
order to get to one cell to trillions
and trillions that cell need to divide
reproduce and then as an organism as a
human being you grew now it's not only
animals and human beings but it's also
plants you know small little flower
becomes a bigger flower maybe you know a
small little tree small sapling becomes
a big tree so all organisms grow so
growth that's the one reason that cells
reproduce another reason is repair
whenever you have a bone and you break
it we'll say that this is a broken bone
right there or maybe you just have a cut
on your knee or wherever on your body
new cells are needed to repair your body
so like broken bones and cuts that's
another reason why your cells need to
divide and the last reason is of course
reproduction we got to keep the species
going that's why we need more cells now
when a cell reproduces what it does is
actually makes copies of everything
inside it so here's all your crap inside
yourself and once it has copies well
first of all why does it need copies
well because it's gonna divide and each
of these cells is gonna need a full
functioning cell so right now we have
the pieces in the original cell for one
cell in whenever it reproduces again
like I said each of these cells right
here
they need all the pieces to function so
what it basically does is it makes
copies of all its parts and then it
divides it makes two new cells now of
course the process is a little bit more
you know the technical than that it
would be easy if you know you just say
okay one cell becomes two bada-bing cell
division but actually it's a pretty
complex process in the first part of
this process I want to talk about is DNA
replication so before a cell can split
in two it first needs to copy its DNA so
that each daughter cell can have a copy
of it so what happens in this process is
the DNA actually unzips and of course
here's our DNA I'll say it unzips double
helix unzips that's kind of you know
dramatic unzip but basically unzips so
that it has a nucleotide on each side so
remember that I often compare DNA to a
ladder that's kind of twisted well
whenever unzips it pretty much splits
those rungs in half so here's a rung
right here it would be paired up with
this one over here so this is basically
how DNA starts in another thing that I
want to remind you of the entire strand
of DNA right here
it doesn't unzip all at once actually
unzips a little at a time so at no point
in DNA replication is the entire strand
of DNA unzipped at once so once it's
unzipped a let me change my color would
I want to write with here island go
ahead DNA
polymerase is one of the main enzymes in
DNA replication what this enzyme does
right here is it basically reads the DNA
code on each strand the left strand in
the right shin cherie and we'll just
call it for now
and it builds a new partner strand
complementary to the original shrimp now
another thing I want to mention before
you know I go any further is that I know
I didn't talk to you guys about the
different type of nucleotides but
remember that I said the nucleotides
were basically the rungs of the ladder
now I won't be going over the exact
molecular formula of each nucleotide but
just remember this for now because I
just want to touch on the very basics
for now nucleotides which remember are
the pieces of the rungs in the ladder
they come in four different just call
them types for now and those are a t c
ng a T C and G so these are the four
different types of nucleotides you can
have now I mention this because there
are rules to making DNA and that's
whenever you have a strand of DNA a
always gets paired with T and C always
gets paired with G so if your original
strand whenever it was split in half
again this would be like that's very
funny this would be like I don't know a
C G a I don't know something like that
let me go ahead and give me an example
so if one of the strands was like a see
T T a G let's go ahead and remember our
rules right here here are the rules
right here in the rules are a always
gets paired with T and C always gets
paired with G so this would be can you
guess it a a T C so just remember this
would be the original in this purple
color and this would be the new yellow
one so that's what the enzyme DNA
polymerase would build this new yellow
strand right here based on this original
purple strand
so in the next video what I want to do
is I want to talk to you guys about the
exact process of DNA replication but for
now hopefully you guys understand a
brief overview of what it is so in the
next couple of videos I'll be clearing
things up so thank you guys for watching
don't forget to subscribe and I'll see
you guys then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
