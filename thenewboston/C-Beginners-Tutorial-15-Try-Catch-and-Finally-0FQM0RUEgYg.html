that I'm making for the new Boston and
in this tutorial I'm going to be showing
you how to use the try-catch and finally
statements so basically what the catch
does it will is it will catch an error
so if there's an error with your code
instead of your application crashing
it's just going to catch that error so
that your application doesn't crash so
all you'll need for this tutorial is a
button and some sort of code that gives
an error and basically what we're doing
right here is just creating a new string
right and inside of our string array we
have two strings so one in two and we're
trying to access a string at the index
of two and since computers start
counting at zero we go zero and then one
and wait there is no index if there is
no string at the index of two so it's
going to throw an error saying it's not
there so when we get bug here and click
our button you should get an error in
our application will crash yep it says
the index is outside the bounds of the
array that just basically means that
you're trying to access um an element or
a string that's not inside of our array
so I'm just going to stop bugging here
and click up six and yes I want stop
debugging
alright so instead of having our
application crash what if we don't want
that to happen that's not good so we're
gonna put a try around this code right
here and basically what it's going to do
is just going to try this code and if
there's an error with it it's going to
look for a catch statement so we have to
have a catch right here so it's go right
out catch and then put two curly braces
after that so what it's going to do here
it is just going to try this code and if
there's an error with it it's going to
jump down to this catch statement and do
the code inside of here so instead of
the application crashing it's just going
to do the code inside of here and we're
just gonna have a message box show
saying there wasn't there so there was
an error
alright and again it will only get to
this code if there actually is an error
with this code right here so when we
debug we should get that message box
because of course there is an error with
this code
trying to access an element inside of
the array that doesn't exist so yeah if
we get that message box there is an area
but if there wasn't an error with our
code and we're just trying to access on
the element at the index of zero then
we're not going to get that message box
since there isn't an error so yeah no
error but what if we want to tell the
user exactly what the error was when we
ran our code without the trying patch we
got that nice message saying the index
is outside of the bounds of the array so
that we sort of know what the problem is
and to get that message what you're
going to want to do is just put two
parentheses after the catch and then
inside of here you're just going to want
to write exception and then call it e^x
and basically what you're doing right
here is creating a new variable a new
exception variable and you're just
calling it e^x and this exception will
be equal to the exception that was
thrown or the error that was given so if
we want to get the information about
that exception that was thrown we're
just going to want to do e^x dot message
and that's just basically on that
message that is displayed when your
application crashes so we got indexes
outside of the bounds of the array and
that just basically means that we're
trying to access an element that isn't
inside of the array so if I were to just
try and access that string at the index
of two we're going to get an error
because it doesn't exist and we should
get indexes outside of the bounds of the
array in the message box since we're
getting the message of the exception is
thrown yep indexes outside the bounds of
the array perfect so that just gives the
person using your application sort of an
idea of what's going wrong and if a user
was using your application you could
just easily ask them what the problem
was and they could just tell you the
message so we have some sort of an idea
of what's wrong with your application
all right and lastly we're going to look
at the finally pas statement and these
go along with trying catch so if we were
to just go right here and type finally
basically what it's going to do it is
going to do this code inside of this
finally statement no matter what so if
there's an error with this or not it's
going to jump down to this finally
towards now have a message box show
saying on your code is done
so as well Sarah here your code is done
and no matter if there's an error or not
we're going to get this message of side
up here so currently there is an error
with our code so we're going to just
going to jump down here to this catch
and we're going to get the exception
then after that finally it's going to
give us this message frogs yep your code
is done and now if we were to change
this so that there's not an error we
just try and access the string at the
index of zero then there's no error with
this but it's still going to do this
code inside of the finally right here
yep we get your code is done even though
there wasn't an area alright so that's
pretty much it for this tutorial on try
catch and finally so see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
