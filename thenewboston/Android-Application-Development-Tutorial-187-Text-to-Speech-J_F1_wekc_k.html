seventh Android tutorial for the new
Boston and since we just did you know
speech recognition now what we're going
to do is we're going to allow our
emulator or phone to talk back to us so
that it's going to be able to you know
do text-to-speech so what I did is I set
up class called text voice and
implements onclicklistener
set the content view to basically our
layout which is just a button so you can
set that up and then set up your button
and set your own click listener and all
that good stuff so pretty basic first
thing that we're going to do after we
have all those references set up in our
onclicklistener setup we're going to set
up what phrases we want our application
to speak so we're just going to say
static final and we could have done like
you know an edit text to get the input
and then convert it to a string and read
that if you guys want to do that as well
you can I just you know we're wrapping
up here I want to finish off a few
different things here but again we're
just going to say static final string
array and we're going to call this text
and then we just set up what we want our
text to be here and so we're going to
say like something like what's what's up
gangsters gangstas and you know whatever
else we want you smell
I have a crush on Travis uh you know
that should be good for now and for some
reason I forgot again equals so there we
go we have to set what you know the text
is equal to which is we have three
things within here you can add some more
if you guys want but whatever so now we
have some simple text now what we want
to do is we also want to have a variable
or instance of our text-to-speech type
variable so we're going to set that up
up here is going to be a text-to-speech
type variable and we're going to call
this text-to-speech something like that
at our imports and we're good to go so
let's jump into the oncreate method
where we're going to set up this
text-to-speech and also actually just
you also want to add a on pause method
because we don't want this you know
text-to-speech thing on all the time so
you know you might want to add that in
our on pause method we're just going to
disable that text-to-speech so we're
just gonna say if text-to-speech is not
equal to null we're gonna kill it
gangster-style just going to hit dot
stop and then TTS dot shut down so
that's how we woah that's how we kill it
there all right so now that we know how
to kill it we want to actually be able
to know how to set it up so let's go
into our on create method we're just
going to say text-to-speech equals new
text-to-speech this takes two things
within its parameters first one is the
context so we're just going to say our
class name text voice dot this and the
second one is the listener so if we were
to implemented it that's cool but we're
just going to say new text-to-speech
dot and then on ant or on initialize
listener so we're just going to click
that and it's going to set up basically
you know the method that we need to ring
a closed-off for statement and this is
the method that gets called this on
initialize or whatever so you know
that's the basic framework we're
probably going to end the tutorial hero
kills we still have a lot to do and you
know I don't want to get into it too
much here so I'll catch you guys in the
next tutorial hope you have a good one
and see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
