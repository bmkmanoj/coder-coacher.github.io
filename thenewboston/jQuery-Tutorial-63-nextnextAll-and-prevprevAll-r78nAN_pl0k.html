went in for actual fatiah we could could
go ahead and use that so star dot CSS um
okay so what we want to do is we want
the user to be able to click on in fact
no we won't make it animated because
that's to sort of far away from the
tutorial what we'll do is we just want
to make the first element here bold so
for example what we could do here is we
could say dot menu down sorry no we use
a selector I mean and we could say
inside menu dot first dot add Clark or
sorry doc find Li dot first so the first
Li in this list which is user and then
we could say dot add class bold and
inside star dot CSS we can go ahead and
add that class or create that class and
that will be font weight field sorry not
null bold so now when we refresh you can
see that the first element is bold and
now what we could go ahead and do is say
let's just say dot next all dot hi it
okay so what we've done now is I think
this should work with this combination
but what we've done is we've from the
menu found the first li sort of in the
wrong order if you know what I mean so
we're finding the Li the first one we're
adding the class bold which we've
already seen has created it bold and now
we're using next all and hiding
everything after that particular class
so now you can see that all of the
different options are hidden in actual
fact let's go ahead and make this
animated we might as well
let's just say we'll keep that there
let's just say dot menu and then we'll
say dot find Li in actual fact no we can
go ahead and append this on to here I'm
going to say dot click and then create a
function inside of here okay so let me
just go ahead and explain for those of
you that you know so struggling with
this which I can understand we're
selecting the first menu with finding
the Li and we've seen that we've made
that bold by adding the class bold that
we created inside star dot CSS within
appending on a click event handler which
is going to do something when we click
it for example at the moment alert you
clicked me and then everything else
after that we're going to hide so let's
go ahead and click that it says you
clicked me so now once we've clicked it
I want to go ahead and I want to say
this dot find Li dot o we could say
first and then dot next all dot show
don't remember or don't forget the
brackets let's see if that works when we
click it no it's not so click function
this dot find also this dot next all
yeah there we go okay so let me just go
let me just change this here to toggle
and that should now allow us to yet hide
and show this menu okay so let me just
run through it and I'll sort of explain
why I've done this if for example you
wanted your users for example on a
website that you or template that you've
created you might have wanted them to
actually go ahead and allow them to
create their own simple menus now in the
case that your user or the persons are
viewing your page can see UL class
equals menu they automatically know that
this is a menu now they might see that
the first one I mean it's
slightly tricky to see but the first one
says user so by viewing the page you can
automatically assume now that this is
the menu title and then anything after
it so you know when we go ahead and add
some more elements on or some more Li
elements on so for example something
else now we know that when we click we
just you know gain these menu items on
and we can click this and click it again
to get rid of it I guess we could even
go ahead and just add on an href that
goes to nothing just to make it look a
bit more like a menu item and it will
essentially what we're doing now is
we're finding Li which we've talked
about the first one we'll add in class
to bold and but we're also then
appending on an event handler for the
click event so once this is clicked
everything else after this ie the first
menu item this being this here will be
shown or but will be toggled the reason
I use toggle is because if I was to you
show up I would have had to then go
ahead and create something else - you
know highlight toggle just does it for
you and then next door dot hide now this
is the initial stage of when we come
into the page so if we were to get rid
of this we would get the same effect but
the settings would just be shown
initially so obviously these two on the
end just depend you could even change
that to show but really it's a waste of
code having it in if you you know want
them to be hidden or shown so you know
that's something I've sort of gone over
over a bit on this but that's something
that you could bear in mind with this
first and next all and this first all as
well so you can go back and say first or
but you know the next nextdoor first
first or find or all sort of useful
things that can be tied in together and
you can see we've created a nice little
menu here and this could even be
something you know that's been really
nicely styled and it could be you know a
nice menu at the top you can either
either change that it sorry even change
this to something like
and then when we hover over it we get
the menu items come out again so you're
thinking sort of drop-down menus at the
top of a page so you know using these in
combination are really you know
effective and we've done this with you
know three lines of code which you know
is pretty impressive actually
so just by creating this li we've
demonstrated how we can use next
nextdoor first and first or we've also
used toggle in here and we've also used
find to help us find the element that we
want to apply this to so a nice example
pretty straightforward and a lot here
that could be put into practice</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
