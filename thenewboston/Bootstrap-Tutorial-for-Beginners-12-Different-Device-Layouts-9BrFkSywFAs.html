video I'm going to show you how to
create different layouts for different
types of devices now the easiest way to
explain this is actually just to show
you an example a bunch of examples so
that's what I'm going to be doing and
for the first one let's say that we're
making some kind of social network I
know maybe we'll call it the New Boston
comm whatever and we were designing the
user stream the page where they scroll
through all their friends posts now
whenever we're looking at this on a
phone each post we want to take with the
entire width of the screen you know use
the most face phones aren't that big
it looks great now if we try to do this
on the desktop imagine looking at it on
the desktop in every single picture took
up the entire width of the screen it
would look a little bit goofy so say on
phones take up the entire width but on
desktops take up half the width so
phones retire with desktops each post is
going to take up half the width so how
do we accomplish this well everything in
bootstrap that we want to be responsive
we need to stick inside a row and then
we make a whole bunch of columns alright
so up until now whenever we made a
column we just said something like
column MD you know whatever and we use
the same one for every single thing and
we kind of let bootstrap take care of
all the hard work well this is how we
accomplish different layouts for
different devices so we add a column now
remember on a phone which is an
extra-small device we want it to take up
the entire width of the screen so that
means 12 since bootstrap uses the 12
column system now for desktops desktops
are MD which are medium devices desktops
laptops these are just normal computers
we'll say whenever you run this on the
desktop take up 6 columns which would be
half the screen and just so we have
something look at let me change the
background to like a light
to blue and actually let me say this why
you giving me look at this it suggested
the name light blue to me and then it
told me there's a typo in it well maybe
you shouldn't gave me a typo when
remember you shouldn't suggested it if
you're just going to give me a frickin
typo so that's your fault all right so
now let me just change this color so
it's a little bit easier to see so what
do we have blue that's what I like about
IntelliJ to look at these these colors
pop up she can actually change them
right from here just pretty sweet and
all right good enough let me run this
alright so check it out I'm looking at
it on a desktop right now so each of
these little posts or images whatever
they would be they're going to take up
half the width of the screen and then if
I was looking at on my phone which is a
smaller device they would take up the
entire width of the screen
a brilliant user experience now let me
just run one more little example like
this just so we have something else to
play with so say that I don't know like
maybe on phones oh I'll see a half and
for the stops they can take up a third
let me change this right there and maybe
right there and for some reason this hex
color is kind of bothering me since
every other one is a name changer
Schroeder era and all right so for
phones since we want them to take up
half of the screen we're going to change
all these to six so six six six now for
desktop since we want those to tick up a
third what's the third of 12 I think
it's four do the math and check it out
so this is the desktop and remember on a
desktop 4 goes into 12 three times now
on phones in smaller devices check it
out each of these little sections take
up half of the width of the screen so
maybe you want to like the users menu
bar on the left and maybe like all their
content on the right whatever you want
to do get creative now another cool
thing I want to show you guys is how to
offset columns and by offsetting columns
I mean you see how this green column or
this little green section right here is
directly under this blue section
well sometimes you want to indent it a
little bit so you don't want it to start
until like right here where my mouse is
so how do you kind of offset it from the
side a little bit well I'll be like
offsetting columns offsetting is that
not a word I thought it was hmm
interesting
all right so div class row and div
columns right in there all right so what
we do here is let's just give it a
column of like a md4 so it's going to
take up a third of the screen whenever
you're looking at it on a desktop and
just put forward white or something in
here
and give it a color - all right so we
got one little chunk and it's taking up
a third whenever we're going to look at
it on the desktop now if I wanted to
make another row underneath it but I
wanted this to be offset by a little bit
what I can do is this
I can make pretty much the same exact
thing but I can pass in one other class
and that's column MD offset and will
offset it by like a - whatever so in
other words it's not going to start
right up against the left side it's
going to go to over and then start so if
I run this check it out so this one we
just said take up a third of the screen
which it did and this red one right here
it's also taking up a third of the
screen but we offset it in other words
you said before you begin move two
columns over and then do your thing now
remember whenever you're doing this that
you wasted two columns on offsetting so
you don't have you know on eight other
columns to work with the only half of
six since two for offsetting plus four
so and uh that wasn't me that was not me
all right now the last thing I want to
show you is how to nest rows so say that
um like you had a little chunk right
here or let's do this way so say that
each of these were like a post for your
social network and inside here you also
wanted to create a bootstrap so you
pretty much wanted to take a layout and
stick it inside another layout but you
want to make it all responsive sounds
confusing right well it's actually
pretty easy and you scroll up so you
guys all of that is out of sight out of
mind so nesting um rows so let's just go
ahead and make a generic um div in class
row
div class and we'll just say that we're
making like a column that's 9y so we
don't make it take up the entire screen
will say column on desktops and every
device actually this is going to take up
nine out of 12 which is three-quarters
of the screen all right so here is our
main content we'll say that like hey I
went to the movies today so this is you
know like some girls post on some social
network and inside here we wanted to
make another section let's say for the
comments that was also responsive well
all we have to do is we start making
actually let me separate this so it'd be
easier to see we start making that
entire structure again so div class row
in okay HUS so div class column and we
can do whatever we want here so MD and
let's just put two in here so six now
remember whenever you have the columns
right here even this took up nine this
new structure that you're making is
using this as a reference so it's pretty
much looking at it as an entire new
screen now remember you still can't
exceed twelve columns but even if this
is nine you can have twelve columns in
here just no more than that
so we'll say in here um oh I'll just say
like child one and let me just give us
style so
background what's this like light blue
when we had one more and this will be
light salmon like slamming and probably
should add a color to the outside or
else it may look at it bit goofy so the
outside will give it what's a good color
it lights see gree and also let me add
some padding so you guys can really see
easily what the heck is going on so be
like 30 pixels give some huge padding
alright so check this out the parent
took up 9 out of 12 columns so 3/4 of
the screen now the children that were
inside this entire thing is based on a
12 column system so child 1 and I named
them both child 1 for some reason so
child 1 is taking up 6 and child which
should be child 2 is taking up 6 as well
so remember every time you make a new
row you could 12 more columns and if you
wanted to you can actually do something
like this so you can have each of these
on a new row so child 1 and child 2 and
changes to like light coral so now
instead of being side by side they're
each on a new row and they're each going
to take up half of the parent which
looks like this so there you go now
usually in here you'd want to do
something like have them span all 12
columns and that's how like comments
usually work whenever you're looking at
a post or whatever but there yo
hopefully you guys understand how to use
multiple columns in multiple classes for
creating different dynamic types of
layouts for different devices so yeah
hopefully you guys enjoy see you next
