24th intermediate Jeff tutorial and in
this tutorial we are going to be
building the window that our panel goes
in but before we get to that I want to
read you a little ml ia I found last
night and in case you don't know this is
a little app for my ipod it says today I
tried calling my sister again and again
when I saw her the next day I asked why
she didn't answer her phone her reason
she changed her ringtone to the circle
of life and she and her husband
reenacted the first scene of blanking
with her baby boy each time the phone
rang so with that being said I suggest
any of you who have kids to do that now
that I got that on my system let's go
ahead and continue with my tutorial so
in the last order what we pretty much
did is build the panel now the panel is
pretty much this big white space on the
window and the jframe is the window
itself and this is the scroll bar on the
right hand side the title bar so what
happens is in java language well let's
say in windows language the body goes in
the window but in java language the
panel goes in the frame why they named
it two different things just because
people want to be different you know and
it confuses the rest of us but hopefully
i simplified that for you so like i said
in the last story we built the panel now
we have to build the frame so let's go
ahead and do a couple things first our
program consists of a slider and it's
underneath the panel so let's go ahead
and put let's make that slider right now
that's what I'm trying to say J slider
and this J slider is already class so
don't worry about being missed so I'm
going to go ahead and name my slider
slider because you know I'm not trying
to confuse you guys so now that we got a
slider on variable we need a panel
object because of course we didn't make
that for nothing so let's go ahead and
book to private draw oval because that
was the name of our other class if your
class is named different then don't copy
me and I'm just going to name on my
panel and this is what's going to sit
inside of our frame so now what do we
need to do with you know with this class
that we're making we're only going to be
making one method and that's actually
the constructor so as you can see I
named mine the window because I mean
that's what we're making the window so
let's go ahead and in order to make the
constructor go public the window and
it's not going to take any arguments so
inside your constructor let's go ahead
and first in order to change the title
of the window and your title bar appears
the very top of your window or frame
people call it frame but I'm going to be
saying window if I use them
interchangeably don't blame me so in
order to change the title what we need
to do is put super because we need to
call the super class which is J frame
right here and just go ahead and pass it
in whatever you want but I'm going to
just go and put the title keep things
really simple for you guys so that's how
you put title on your window so after
this what we need to do we already said
all right we're going to be having an
object from the class we just made now
we need to set it equal to something so
set my panel equal to new and whatever
you named your other class that we built
in the last tutorial that's what you
want to set it equal to I named mine
draw oval so of course I that takes no
parameters because we didn't do anything
weird with that constructor so now that
we have a panel object we can begin
doing cool stuff with that panel one of
the cool things we can do is change the
background color of it and this in
essence since it sits inside your window
it'll change your background color of
your window so let's go ahead and in
order to change the background color of
your panel go ahead and put my panel or
whatever you name your object dot set
background color right there
and we can set equal to any color we
want let's see our option should pop up
black blue let me think of something
good green you want something light
since your
we'll put it orange there you don't want
anything dark because our circle is
going to be dark and you know that just
wouldn't be good so there we go had to
see how much time I had left now let me
find this and all right so now that we
change the background color what we want
to do is right now we have a background
and a circle painted on it but we don't
have that slider yet that I promised you
guys would have so what we want to do
now is set up that J slider and we need
this in order to control the diameter
value so we already declared it up here
called slider so now let's go ahead and
set equal slider equals new J slider and
as a constructor for a J slider it takes
let me see one two three four parameters
the first parameter it takes is how you
want your slider to appear on the screen
now there are two different types there
are ones that go left and right and this
is horizontal or there is a vertical
slider that goes up and down of course
so we want the left and right kind
because it just looks better in our
window so swing constants dot horizontal
it already popped up for us so this
means all right we want our slider to go
left and right
so it takes three more parameters after
this the first one is the minimum and
maximum value of our slider so let's say
we want a minimum of zero and a maximum
of 200 and this means our diameter of
their circle can go no less than zero
and no more than 200 and of course you
can change this depending on how big
your window is but my window is only
going to be like I don't know like 150
pixels wide so I don't roll my circle to
be like a thousand pixels wide and the
last thing you want is just go ahead and
put ten I'll tell you guys what that
means later on so aside from just making
a plain old slider let's do some cool
things let's spice it up a little bit so
let's go ahead and take our slider
object
and the first thing we want to do is put
set major tick spacing now you have the
option of putting something called ticks
on your slider and what this is is
pretty much little hash marks so you
don't get lost and you can put these as
often as you want I'm going to put mine
every 10 pixels so as your argument just
go ahead and put 10 in here and this
will set your ticks every 10 pixels and
now they have them every 10 pixels you
need to do one more thing and this is
weird I know but it's a necessity you
need to put set paint ticks right here
and set this equal to true so set major
tick spacing says how far apart you want
your ticks and when you put set paint
extrude this actually paints them on the
screen so you think that they would make
only one method to you know paint them
both and set the spacing but they didn't
so this is the way we need to set it up
don't blame me
right son or Oracle or whoever heck owns
the company now and send your hate mail
to them but that's all the time we have
for this tutorial again real quick
overview let me check my time real quick
all right what we did is we made a
slider we made a panel from our other
class that we made and for the window
constructor which we aren't done
building yet in the next tutorial we're
going to be finished building this and
also well you'll see in the next
tutorial we made a title we change our
background to orange and we also finish
building our slider and put some cool
tick marks on it so that's all the time
I have for this tutorial I'm probably
going to go eat a piece of cake and yeah
like you guys cared about that so thank
you guys for watching don't forget to
subscribe and I'll see you next door</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
