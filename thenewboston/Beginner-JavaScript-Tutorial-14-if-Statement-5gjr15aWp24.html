14th JavaScript tutorial and in this
tutorial I'm going to start off teaching
you guys something called an if
statement and then we're going to learn
about something called comparison
operators so basically an if statement
is a really simple way to have your
computer make a decision you're going to
give it a scenario and if it's true it's
going to run a bit of code for example
if you say if the variable called Bucky
is equal to 24 then run this bit of code
if it's not then don't do anything so
really simple decision so let's go ahead
and do that right now let's go ahead and
make two variables and later on we'll
compare them to each other so make a
variable named apples and set this equal
to you know twenty or thirty four or
whatever and make a variable called hot
dogs and set this equal to like fifty
three it doesn't matter what numbers
they are as long as they don't equal
each other so we have two variables we
already know what those do now let's go
ahead and look at the basic syntax for
an if statement now the if statement is
set up like this all of the time have
the word if right there and then go
ahead and write two parentheses after
that now inside these parentheses is
where you're going to be making your
comparison you're going to say all right
if apples is equal to hot dogs
if apples is greater than hot dogs if
apples is less than hot dogs and all
that stuff you're going to be comparing
one thing against another now if that
comparison is true it's going to go
ahead and run the bit of code in between
these curly brackets so go ahead and
throw those in so basically if
statements work like this it's going to
test something right here and if that
test is true or if they do match each
other it's going to run this bit of code
so let's go ahead and give it something
really simple to run run document dot
right
yay it worked something stupid like that
so let's go ahead and give it a simple
comparison to right now and you may be
thinking right this all right a simple
comparison will make sense like apples
equals hot dogs I mean make one thing
equal to another and that's a test
that's how I did in math class that's
how it works but whenever we make a
comparison we have to follow one simple
rule we can't use a single equal sign
ever because JavaScript already uses
single equal sign whenever it sets a
variable equal to a value so whenever
you're comparing two values you need to
have two equal signs and now you're
testing RA does the value of apples
equal the value of hot dogs in other
words does 34 equal 53 if 34 does equal
53 it's going to print out yeah it
worked if it doesn't equal 53 or if they
don't equal each other nothing is going
to happen so since they don't equal each
other let's go ahead and refresh and
nothing happens so let's go ahead and
change these values to make apples equal
53 and hotdogs equal 53 so now apples
does indeed equal hotdogs so this is
going to be true and since this is true
this is going to run so let's go ahead
and save this refresh it and check it
out yay it worked so now we can see the
basics of an if statement it's basically
this again you you test what is called a
condition now this condition is going to
be true if it's true and it's going to
be false if it's not true if they equal
each other in this case is going to be
true if they don't it's going to be
false anytime it's true this bit of code
it's going to run anytime it's false
nothing is going to happen so you're
basically giving your computer a
decision to make if this is true run
this if it's not don't do anything so
aside from this double equal sign we
know that we can use the double equal
sign to tell JavaScript compare two
things we can also give it a couple
other symbols we
can say explanation point equals and
what this means is if Apple's doesn't
equal hot dogs go ahead and print this
out so check this out since they are
alike and they do equal each other then
this is going to be false since no let
me go ahead and run this and show you
guys nothing happens right here so why
is this false well does apples not equal
hot dogs no they do equal each other so
it's false so this is a way of saying
all right if apples is not equal to hot
dogs do this so when exactly will this
printout say you had 53 and 99 well now
they don't equal each other so this
statement is true and since this is true
I'm going to go ahead and print this out
and it worked so another thing that we
can do is I showed you guys how to make
it equals and how to make it not equals
so you can of course use greater than
and less than these are really easy ones
if apples is greater than hot dogs
aka if 53 is greater than 99 print this
out so can you guys guess what's going
to happen it doesn't print it out
because 53 is not higher than 99 and
again I don't need to show you this but
I might as well do it anyways if 53 is
less than 99 which is indeed true since
this statement is true then this is
going to print out just like that so
that is why when i refresh it it prints
out so those are the four most common
but I also need to include one other
thing you can also have greater than or
equals two in this say if it's greater
than or if it is equals to like 53 and
53 would work and also 56 is greater
than or equal to 53 but so just verify
that it does work there you go right
there and also you have less than in
equals two so in any scenario where
apples is less than or equal to hot dogs
which it would be false in this case
because 50
is not less than or equal to hot dogs
whenever you save it it doesn't work so
check it out
so those are the basic ones you there
are a couple other ones but I don't want
to confuse you guys for now so and when
you want to compare two values to each
other use double equal signs when you
want to make sure that they're not equal
to each other
use explanation point equal sign and
then you have your basics greater than
less than greater than or equal to less
than or equal to so that's basics of
what an if statement is it pretty much
test something and if it's true it runs
a little bit of code so now you
understand what conditional operators
are or excuse me comparison operators
and also the if statement so in the next
tutorial we're going to be going over
kind of a more complex if statement but
it's probably going to be the one that
you're going to be using more often so
it's actually not that difficult to
learn if you can understand this then
the next thing is going to be a breeze
so anyways thank you guys for watching
don't forget subscribe and I'll see you
guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
