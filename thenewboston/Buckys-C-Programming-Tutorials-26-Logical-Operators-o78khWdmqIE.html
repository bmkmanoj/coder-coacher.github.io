welcome to your twenty six tutorial and
C++ in this tutorial I'm going to be
talking to you guys about something
called logical operators now let me go
ahead and build a simple program right
now say we were the owner of a nightclub
and we wanted to calculate whether a
person was allowed in or whether they
weren't so first we looked at their age
and we're going to make sure it's you
know over 21 because we don't want to
get sued and the next thing we're going
to be looking at is how much money they
have because we don't want to allow poor
people into our you know 5-star
nightclub so let's say they need more
than $500 so let's go ahead and make
this like person has six hundred and
fifty dollars so we can test this like
this if H is greater than twenty one and
if money is greater than what I say five
hundred armed where would I just hit
insert where the hex might insert key on
this keyboard this keyboard is really my
stuff now that look about it so it took
me like five minutes to find the insert
it was actually by my up and down arrows
that's weird so anyways now that we had
our nice little break we can go ahead
and just write something like C out um
you are allowed in and make sure you
sell it with a nine and you and make
sure you spell in ion or else this
program just won't work so let's go
ahead and run this and see what we get
we are allowed in because we indeed are
greater than 21 and we have more than
$500 so resent are a pretty cool program
maybe I'll open up a nightclub now but
check this out this can get kind of
confusing after a while because this
brace goes to this and this goes to this
we're pretty easily distinguishable but
what if we had five different tests that
we need to check what if we had 20
different tests well one little mistake
say we had this over here or program
still going to run fine but it looks
like this goes to this and this goes the
main or something who knows where this
one goes
I mean putting a bunch of if statements
inside other if statements is not always
the best idea so we have a better way
to test two or more things and that's
the reviews of something called logical
operators and this allows you to make
all your tests on a single line
so here's what we can do in this case go
ahead and make your if statement and
then might as well make our C out right
now like you are allowed in explanation
point with endline and in our if
statement go ahead and write your to
test like what do you put age is greater
than 21 and whenever you join them you
use this logical operator and and and
now go ahead and write money is greater
than 500 now let's go ahead and run this
and check it out same results a whole
lot less programming so what and and
means do this test and do this test if
they're both true then run this bit of
code and since they both were true it
ran this bit of code if one of them must
fall say we only had you know four
dollars like that well yeah this test is
going to be true because we're great
entering turn one but this is going to
be false because four dollars is not
greater than 500 and whenever you run it
we are not allowed and check it out and
also if both the tests are false like
we're only two and oops right or wrong
space for that say we're only two years
old and we only have four dollars
probably from tooth fairy
of course we are not going to be allowed
in the club not cool but you know we're
two year old who needs to go clubbing
when they're two anyways so basically a
double + sign means this test all these
tests and if they're both true then you
can run this bit of code but if one of
them is false or both of them is false
then we don't run it simple enough on
and I say and with this test in this
test but you can also have an
and in another test and even in an in
another test and it's just going to run
all of your tests and make sure that
they're all true so the only way this
bit of code is going to run is if all
your tests and this is true so if we
send alright I understand that logical
operator all the tests need to be true
in order to run but what if you say this
all right
I'm on you know not the most
professional nightclub owner so I'm
going to allow them in if only one of
these tests is true if they're over 21
and they're loud and of course or if
they have over 500 dollars I'm gonna lie
to allow him because you know if 20 year
old walks in with like 8 grand I know
he's not 21 but I think we should let
him in anyways so say we want to do that
make sure only one of the tests is true
what we do is use a logical operator
called the or logical operator and
that's if you see above the enter key on
your keyboard and hold shift you get
these two little things I call them
pipes but I think some people call them
pipe lines tell you truth I don't know
what they're called um it's like a
straight line up and down as you can see
but that's what little that's what it is
and two of them in a row is the or
logical operator and what the or logical
operator says is this
unlike the end where this one and this
one had to be true only one of them has
to be true and the other one can be
false and it still runs the bit of code
so check this out
we pass this test is true 26 is greater
than 21 but we don't have more than $500
so this is going to be false so true and
false so we run it and it allows us in
even though one of these was false but
if both of these were false say we're on
the six years old
it wouldn't allow sin so anyways what
you have to remember is this that and
logical operator both the tests have to
be true with the or logical operator one
of the tests have to be true and another
thing if both of the tests are true
and/or it's going to run your bit of
code so let's say you were you know 64
and you had you know a crapload of money
it would run and even though they're
both true it would allow you in anyway
so with or this one or this one or both
of them have to be true and with and
this one and this one has to be true and
of course you can add another or test
and another or test and another or test
and when you ran a program like this
it's going to run through all of your
tests and as long as one of them is true
for example this one could be true and
all these other ones could be false and
it was still around this bit of code an
order basically means look for at least
one that's true and if it's true run the
bit of code so now that I've repeated
that about 800 times you guys should
understand the difference between an and
and or logical operator and when you
would want to use one versus the other I
guess it depends on what kind of
nightclub owner you want to be but for
now that's all the code on I'm going to
do so thank you guys for watching this
tutorial don't know what I'm going to
cover in next tutorial but if you click
on the next link you can see so thank
you guys for watching and I'll see you
then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
