tutorial and in this tutorial I'm going
to be going over something called
compound objects or compound materials
and this is the way how you apply say
you want to apply a bunch of different
materials to one object instead of only
having one material and applying it to
the object that's what I'm going to be
showing you how to do so what I did
already was I built this cube and I
right clicked it and put convert to
editable poly and the reason I did that
before this tutorial began is because
when I right click my screen recorder
messes up so go ahead and make basic
cube and convert it to an editable poly
and then go ahead and you want to work
in the polygon sub-object mode and what
this is going to do is it's going to
allow you to work with each of these
faces individually and we need these
faces for a specific reason so go ahead
and do that and now select your first
face I'm only going to be working with
these three faces since that's we can
only see three at a time when you render
so but you're going to know what to do
by the end so go ahead and select this
first face and then scroll down until
you get to polygon material ID what
we're going to be doing in order to give
this object different materials on each
one of his faces we need to say are a
3ds max each of these faces are
different from another and we're going
to identify each of them by setting an
ID for each of them so we're going to
set this first one to ID 1 so go ahead
and press 1 in your set ID and press
Enter
go to your second one and go ahead and
press 2 and press Enter and then go to
your third one and then go ahead and
press 3 and press Enter
now each of these faces have their own
ID 1 2 and 3 so now let's deselect that
or deselect the faces you can keep the
cube selected if you want and go ahead
and bring up m and what this does is
bring up your material editor now unlike
last time we're going to be one working
with a compound object this means um
I've been one material on this object
and the button to do this is the
standard button right here this means
we're working with a standard object
right now and we're not so go ahead and
click that and now we get this all of
these compound objects our compound
materials materials we can choose from
we want multi/sub-object because that's
what we did we took one object and we
split it up into multiple or sub objects
so double click that and discard the old
material if this pops up and now we get
all of this right here so by default it
comes with ten IDs but we only have
three but actually our cube has six
sides so go ahead and put set number and
put six even though we're only going to
be working with three put six because if
we decide to go on this cube has six
sides now what we're going to want to do
this ID number one remember that's this
face right here so we're going to change
this material from standard to another
image so click material number 25
standard and now we get to choose our
material for this we actually want to
choose an image for this so click on
maps
then click diffuse color none and
remember diffuse color is the main color
or image click none and then we want to
put a bitmap on this so click bitmap and
let's just go autumn leaves right here
so double-click autumn leaves and as you
can see our little preview now has
autumn leaves on it so now let's go back
to our parent and do that from the other
IDs so go to parent go to parent and now
we got ID autumn leaves you can see a
little autumn leaf right there we want
to change ID number two to an image as
well so go ahead and click material 26
and this is going to give us a material
for ID number two so go to maps since we
want an image on it go to diffuse color
for this bitmap and go to
doc that's a different looking one so
now go up go to parent go to parent and
now you can see in our preview we have
two different checker boards um when in
this represents the two different IDs so
we're only going to do this one more
time for the third ID so we got ID one
that's the first face ID - that's the
second face and you can apply this to
any material that has six IDs on it or
less so this is only this specific any
object that has IDs on it you can apply
this to but let's do it one more time
for heidi number three go to material
twenty seven cents that's material we're
going to be changing got a Maps diffuse
color none bitmap and then pick like
waterfall or garden this this one looks
good you probably don't even have these
images up you can pick whatever images
you want go ahead and open that then
just go to parent make sure it took idea
one two three are now converted into
images so let's go ahead and apply this
by dragging this on our object and now
let's render it out and see what we got
now as you can see instead of before
we're only took one solid material you
can apply different materials to
different parts of this by just changing
the ID number and then where it says all
right well image do you want on this ID
number you just pick an ID so thank you
guys for watching that's it for this
tutorial
and again those things are called
compound materials and it pretty much
puts many different materials on on the
same object and they have different
compound types if you clicked another
one standard like blending blends two
different materials together and double
sided puts two different sides of a
faces on a material and they do a cool
or stuff like that but for now I just
want to introduce you to compound
materials we're probably getting it in a
more later but again like I said thank
you for watching don't forget to
subscribe and I'll see you next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
