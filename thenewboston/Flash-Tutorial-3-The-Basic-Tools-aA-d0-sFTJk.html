and flash today we're gonna be talking
about the basic tools but before I
actually get talking about the basic
tools I want to show you guys how to do
one thing that's really important and
that's it change the background color of
your image to do that just all under the
properties panel what should be at the
bottom of your screen and click this
little box called background color and
when you click it a whole panel of
colors pops up and these are all the
background colors that you can choose
for your image just click a color I'm
going to be working with Y today since
it's easy for you to see what tools I'm
working with now the first tool I want
to talk to you guys about is called the
selection tool and that's the first tool
on your toolbar just the black arrow
what this tool allows you to do is allow
you to select shapes in your flash in
the canvas that allows these inter mover
anywhere you can also select it when
you're doing some other stuff to talk
about later but this next tool I want to
talk about is called the sub selection
tool and that's the white arrow and what
this allows you to do to select one or
more points and move them on your shape
not you can use this tool to split up
stretch them do you like
now the next thing I want to talk to you
guys about is the next one called the
free transform tool what this is allows
you to do is to transform your entire
image you can also like that or another
thing you can do is select only a
portion of your image it's not this
bottom corner picks up move it been in
this so this is one way to select
portions of your image or an entire
image so I'm gonna give her this
sprite here since it's getting kind of
messy and the next tool I want to talk
to you guys about in the last selection
tool it's called the lasso tool and what
this allows you to do is select freehand
any portion of your image so say you
want to select part it's whipping around
it with the lasso to simply pick it up
and move it you can also such as you
want with your lasso tool and pick it up
and move it out and this is pretty
useful when you're trying to get a
specific area that isn't really have
clear defined lines and the next tool I
want to talk to guys about it's called
the pen tool and what this tool does is
allow you to make your own shape with
any of the points of like so say you
want to make a custom shape with these
points right here just click and add
your points and when you get to your
last point to close it off a little
circle where will appear next to your
cursor this tells you that it's going to
close the shape as you can see we can
now have custom shapes and create any
shape we want using the pen tool
this next tool text Allah knows how to
use this just drag to create a text box
and go ahead and type in some text now
the text is going to be the color of
your fill down here which we'll talk
about later the next tool the line tool
allows you to create basic lines and the
line color is the color of the stroke
tool right down here so click it and
choose the color of the line you wish to
get and you can release and it gives you
a nice straight line you can also make
straight horizontal and vertical and
45-degree angles by holding down the
shift key and then drink and get perfect
horizontal picked vertical lines the
next tool is called the rectangle tool
or I call them the basic shapes tool
once if you hold down this it gives you
all the basic shapes that you can make
and of course for the rectangle and
it'll give you a basic rectangle for the
circle you have an oval tool kit as you
can see we now have a perfect circle
and let me get rid of this using the
free transform tool settle too cluttered
just highlight it and tap delete this
next why I want to go over you guys with
a pencil tool the pencil tool and the
brush tool allows you to draw freehand
anywhere on your canvas so let's select
one of these looking now
now draw freehand and your I wish it
draws with this color the fill color and
the stroke tool is for the pencil the
stroke color and say you have an image
such as the sûreté finger this black
border around it I call the outline or
the stroke and to change this color you
simply need to use this ink bottle tool
this allows you to change the color
looks such as any outlines or any simple
strokes that you do with pencil just go
ahead and pick your stroke and as you
see when we click it it changes the
color of the stroke now if you wanted to
change the fill inside it you need to
use the paint bucket tool just go ahead
and select the color for your paint
bucket and just click it and as you can
see it changes the fill
now anytime you want to select the color
but you forgot which one you picked
that's when you use the eyedropper tool
simply click the eyedropper tool select
the color you wish and then that color
becomes your fill color it's pretty easy
to use just select select any color and
that becomes the color the next tool I
want to talk to you guys about is called
the eraser tool and this is really
simple we're gonna erase and it erases
pretty self-explanatory
this next tool called the hand tool
allows you to pick this next tool called
the zoom tool gives you these two little
plus and reduce magnifying glasses plus
of course enlarges your image or zooms
in and minus one of course zooms out but
there are two easier ways to do this and
that's the hold down ctrl and then tap
plus the zoom in or hold down control
stone and tap minus the zoom out
now of course we went over the stroke
color and the fill color to pick your
stroke color simply click the stroke box
and I'll give you the list of shrill
colors you can pick and to pick your
fill color simply tap the Focolare box
and you can pick your list of colors so
now that we went over all the basic
tools in the next subject we're gonna be
making our first animation of course if
you missed anything you go to my website
the new boston.com and I'll go over
everything we went over today thank you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
