slash on live gamer for the new Boston
and in this tutorial we're going to be
talking about updating the server now we
don't want the user to just be able to
put in any server they want and then
username and screw up what's going on
and even if they do just put something
new in it's not gonna do anything with
it because it's already set the username
and the password
and the server so what we want to do is
for each one of these we want to disable
them so we'll set enabled equal false
enabled equal to false and then enabled
equal to false on this so when they
click update server or update settings
what we want to do is we want to give
them the opportunity to update their
settings so let's go ahead and create a
Belene up here so private is updating as
bulan
and let's go ahead and set that equal to
false
so what it lets it equal to yeah false
so whenever they click it is updating is
going to be equal to not is updating so
basically what this means is it's gonna
give you the opposite each time you
click the button so when you click the
button the first time is updating its
going to be equal to true and then when
you click it again it's gonna be equal
to false so each time this is clicked it
just switches this to the opposite and
because it's million it's easy to do
that so it is updating is equal to not
is updating which is basically just flip
it so if is updating then what do we
want to do now we could use if is
updating equals to true but we all we
have to do is type if is updating so if
is updating so if this is true right
here then what do we want to do well we
want to enable the server credential so
private enable updating so under enable
updating let's go ahead and type text F
to be passed dot enabled equals true
text FTP server that enabled equals true
and text FTP user that enabled
equals true
and what we can do instead of having to
create two subs enable updating and
disable updating we can just do a public
sub updating server and we'll have it
take a baleen so by Val is updating as
you lean so text FTP fast
xtp FTP pass not enabled is going to be
equal to is updating and now let's go
ahead and change this right here to
something else so let's just do is up
because we don't want to duplicate
variables so text FTP server enabled
equals is up and then once again it's
going to be equal to is so if they're
updating then what we want to do is type
updating server and for the baleen let's
just go ahead and do true
then what we want to do is we want to
set the credentials so FTP downloader
well before we do that so if it's up
anything then it's going to enable those
and then it's going to change the button
label so button update settings dot text
equals Save Settings let's make sure
this corresponds to what we have what
we'll do
save server settings so it's going to be
equal to that and then what we can do is
if not is updating so if they clicked it
again and then we need to do else if so
if they're not updating so if they
clicked it and it lets them update it
and they it says save server settings
and they click it again what we want to
do is save those settings so we'll type
updating server and we will pass false
to that and then we'll set the text
button update settings dot text is going
to be equal to update server
okay so now what we want to do is we
want to save their settings so FTP
downloaded dot username is going to be
equal to text FTP user dot txt and then
it will set the password and the server
and then we'll just go ahead and trim
that to get rid of any white spaces so
we can go ahead and run this and when we
click update server it gives us save
server settings and let's just leave it
the same and when we click Save server
settings it's gonna save those settings
now what we can also do is we can
disable all these buttons whenever
that's happening so that they can't use
them so go ahead put this code in and
then once you've done that move on to
the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
