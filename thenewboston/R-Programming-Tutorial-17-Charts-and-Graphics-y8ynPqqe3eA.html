tutorial and also um I want to mention
that I just switched my headphone it's
the same brand in the same type of
headphone but I had the old one since I
like started making videos and I just
got a new one because the old one was
like they'll start like creak whenever I
move my head and it was just like the
cord was like coming apart so tell me
guys if this is any better quality
hopefully it is but uh anyways in this
video we're finally going to start
learning how to make charts in some
sweet graphs gonna be awesome so the
first thing that we need is of course
some data to actually graph and I'm just
going to be using this data from you
know it's like from Bucky's room fake
data that I just made up basically so if
you want to download this of course the
link is right below this video click
that download it and you can actually
use any data frame but like I said I'm
going to be using this one and I'm just
going to call it B data for Bucky's data
and in order to load that in use the
read CSV function in the parameters the
first parameter is the name of the file
B our users the CSV file the second
parameter is true and that is because
it's basically saying is this first row
the name of the columns well yes it is
so I'm going to put true and the third
parameter said how is your data
separated well it's a comma separated
value data chart or whatever you want to
call it file and they're separated with
commas
any CSV file you're always going to put
a comma right there so the next thing
that I want to do real quick is actually
just read the head of this to make sure
that we loaded it properly and yes it
does so now that we have a data frame
what we can do is we can start making
basically converting this data and
viewing it visually in charts so the
first chart I'm going to show you guys
is a histogram in a histogram if you
don't know what it is it's kind of like
a bar chart but it graphs in intervals
and actually what I should probably do
is just graph it and then show you guys
because you know that's a point of a
graph so you can visualize that up there
so let me just go ahead and make this
real quick so the key that or excuse me
the name to make a function what the f
am I talking about the name of this
function that you use to make a
histogram is hist
and Wow I kind of hat was like having a
brain fart there and the first parameter
it takes is basically saying okay what
column do you want to use in your
histogram so let's just use this
actually let's use age right here so
what we want to do is we want to see the
rages ranges of Ages that people are
using on Bucky's room so how old are the
members of Bucky's room so of course
what we need to do is we rate B data and
in order to access that column use the
dollar sign and press age so what this
is going to do is it's going to graph
the ages now the rest of the three
parameters are actually really easy the
main one is basically saying what do you
want the title of your chart to be and I
just named this ages of users on Bucky's
room now the next parameters are just
the Y in the x ones so the y axis which
is y lab we can name this users and the
X lab which is the x-axis title we can
just go ahead and name this ages and
guys that's it basically what we're
saying is we made a histogram and let me
go ahead and run this real quick as you
can see right here and basically we're
using the ages parameter which is down
here and the title of it is this ages of
users on Bucky's room and these are just
the names of the Y in the x-axis so as
you can see it looks very similar to a
bar graph and what this is basically
saying is how many users are in Bucky's
room between the ages of 10 and 20 well
there are 20 users in that age range
what about how many users on Bucky's
room are between the ages of 30 and 40
not that many only 12 or so so as you
can see instead of having a bar
where you need every single age 10 11 12
13 in a bar for each this takes it and
graphs it in intervals pretty freakin
sweet and it's a lot more you know
better than looking at a bar graph with
you know like 60 different ages on it so
that is how you make a histogram and
what other one can I show you guys real
quick let's say that we wanted to make a
scatterplot
I'll show you guys how to do that so
delete this if you guys don't know what
a scatter plot is a scatter plot is
really good whenever you have two
variables and you want to see if there's
a correlation between two so what kind
of things can we do let's say that uh we
wanted to graph the correlation between
age and income so you know we have a
theory that the older you are the more
money you make but my girlfriend was
saying that the younger people make more
money because I don't know because she's
an idiot
so actually she's kind of smart but
let's go ahead and graph this theory to
see who's right
so in order to make a scatter plot just
go ahead and type plot and of course
instead of just having one variable like
a histogram we need two variables so we
cannot test them against each other so
the first thing that we said well we
were you're going to say age and income
so B data age and let me copy this due
to laziness and we're going to compare
it against income now the only other
thing is the Y lab is age were say yeah
just say H F it and X lab is income now
if we go ahead and graph this check it
out we see that there is indeed a
correlation between age and income
basically what this is saying is and I
graph this backwards income and age let
me run this and basically what this is
saying is the each of these bubbles is a
user so example this bubble is at the
age
14 and they have an income of I don't
even know what this is pretty low
let's go ahead and think of an easier
one oh this user right here
he's about 68 and he has an income of
about seventy thousand dollars so as you
can see this income which is in dollar
amount is correlated to age and
essentially what this graph is saying is
the older people are the more income
they have or the more money they make so
it turns out I was right I'm going to go
ahead and tell her booyah what up what
up so let's go ahead and I want to show
you guys how to graph one more thing
since we have some time and that is a
box plot now you're going to see this a
lot although personally I don't really
like them what a box plot is well this
will be easier if I just show you guys
so in order to make this type the word
box plot that's the name of the function
and it only takes one single parameter
so say that we were looking at the ages
of people on Bucky's room but what we
can do is we can run this and we see we
get a weird looking chart like this so
what does this mean this is of course
the ages we have users from 10 to 70
years old and this middle line right
here this is the median in this box I
don't know if you guys are familiar with
statistics or if you ever took a class
in you know statistics or anyone
anything with quartiles but this box
pretty much outlines your quartiles this
bottom one is the first quartile and the
top one is your third quartile
and the lines are just the ranges of
high and low so basically it's saying
the youngest member is 10 the highest
member is 69 or 68 and the median age of
users on Bucky's room is about 41 so
that's what this box plot means and
again you're going to see this a lot but
I really don't like it because you know
if I'm going to look at a stupid box I
might as well just look at the data
itself
I want a chart with colors and freaking
bubbles and stuff like that
we're going to be learning how to make
some cool charts and graphs like that
later on and I'm also being showing you
guys how to make different themed charts
different colors arm and it's going to
be freaking awesome so this was your
core basic introduction how to make a
very basic chart and graph again tell me
how the sound was on my microphone thank
guys for watching and I'll see you next
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
