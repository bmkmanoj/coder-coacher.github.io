biology tutorial in in this video I want
to discuss how molecules transport
across the membrane of a cell because in
the last tutorial I was like all right
you have a cell things can go out things
can come in by being bah Dabang that's
all there is about transportation but
the thing is that's not all there is and
that we need to take a closer look at
the exact method that molecules cross
the membrane of the cell it's actually
really important so basically there are
two different methods of transportation
across the membrane of the cell one is
called passive and the other one is
called active but in this tutorial we're
only going to be looking at passive so
let's go ahead and get started and I
want to talk to you guys first about
diffusion but before we begin I want to
talk to you guys what passive means
anytime you talk about passive transport
it means that no energy is required from
the cell active of course means that the
cell has to use some energy to get that
crap crossed but passive is just like
the cell is just chillin there doing
nothing and it doesn't require any
energy because it's more of a natural
process it's what happens naturally and
we're going to see an example of this
right now
so let's go ahead and first talk about
the first type of passive transport and
that's called diffusion diffusion now of
course whenever we're talking about
biology we mean that materials are going
to be passing through you know the cell
membrane but let me go ahead and give
you an even more simple example of
diffusion I just I don't know kind of a
real-life example so if you had I don't
know a big bucket and you had a screen
in the bucket now of course a screen and
I'm talking about just a screen from
like your screen door or something we
would call this semi permeable because
some things can pass through of course
some small things like water could pass
through the screen some bigger things
like I don't know a cheeseburger
couldn't pass through that screen so let
me go ahead and draw my bucket a little
bit thicker
all right there we go looking pretty
good all right so we filled this bucket
up with water so we filled it up with
water and we put a screen in the middle
now of course there are water molecules
all around here so this entire section
right here is water now say on one side
of the screen that we dumped some I
don't know what can we dump in there
sugar or something so there's a bunch of
sugar molecules over here
now of course sugar what happens is it
pretty much is going to dissolve in the
water and of course on the left side
right now as soon as we dump it in say
that this is I don't know maybe it's
green because we dumped the green pixie
stick in there all that sugar is going
to be concentrated in this area on the
left hand side of the bucket however
over time this is what's going to happen
so now let me God go and drop my
freaking bucket again this is a pretty
nice looking bucket by the way so we
have our bucket and we have our screen
and I don't know I don't know what the
heck those little lines are gets just
holes in the screen or something but
anyways over time what the sugar is
going to do is the sugar molecules are
going to move from the area of higher
concentration on the left-hand side to
lower concentration on the right-hand
side so pretty much it's still going to
be filled with water just like this
however the sugar molecules are going to
look like this so that's basically what
diffusion is the definition is a
movement of molecules from areas of
higher concentration and by higher
concentration pretty much mean areas
where there are more molecules to lower
concentration areas where there are less
molecules so pretty much in diffusion
molecules spread out randomly
and uniformly so obviously as we can see
just through the process of nature in
how things spread out randomly the sugar
molecules aren't is going to you know
remain packed on one side for no reason
even though that there is a screen at
semipermeable they can go ahead and
spread out in the water and that's
because sugar molecules are of course a
lot smaller than the holes in the screen
and of course in a cell I'm not just
chucking talking about you know how to
put screens and buckets here this screen
right here would be the cell membrane so
that's the first process of how
particles or molecules move past the
cell membrane whenever you have a really
small molecule like oxygen or carbon
dioxide what they can do is inside a
cell let me go ahead and draw the cell
membrane this is a cell if you have a
bunch of I don't know oxygen outside the
cell through natural process it can go
ahead and move to areas of lower
concentration inside the cell and
remember this process is called
diffusion a natural process and remember
I said it's passive so as you can see
the cell isn't doing anything it isn't
burning any calories isn't you know
converting any food to energy to make
this happen this is a natural process of
the movement of molecules from areas of
high concentration this is high
concentration there are a lot of oxygen
molecules out here to low concentration
I'll just put low number of oxygen
molecules and that's what concentration
is high concentration means a lot of
molecules low means not that many
molecules so that's what diffusion is
and this is how particles move across
the cell membrane in a cell whenever
we're talking about diffusion so that's
one method of passive transport and in
the next story I'm going to be talking
to you guys about the other method of
passive transport and it's called
osmosis it's pretty cool but I'll say
that for the next video since this one
is getting kind of long but anyways
thank you for watching and I'll see them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
