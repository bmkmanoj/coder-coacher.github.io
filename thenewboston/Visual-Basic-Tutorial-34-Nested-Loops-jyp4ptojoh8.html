slash on live gamer for the new Boston
and in this tutorial we're going to be
taking a look at nested loops now if you
remember back a couple tutorials we
learned about if statements and that how
you can nest if statements inside of
each other so we're in the if statement
case both of the values have to be true
for it to run now it's a little
different for for loops but the concept
is still the same so let's go ahead and
make a demo project for it so we'll go
to new project and we will call this
nested loops now we can also nest do
until loops we can nest do-while loops
there's a lot of stuff in Visual Basic
that you can nest inside of each other
so let's go ahead and zoom in here so
let's go ahead and create a for loop so
for number one equals one two let's just
go ten then go ahead and do the code
that is inside of this for loop so let's
come down here and after our next we'll
go ahead and add console dot readline
okay so now inside of our for loop we're
going to add another for loop so for
num2 num2 equals one to ten
go ahead and console dot write line and
we'll just write line num2 so what this
is what this is going to do is the first
time this for loop runs it's going to
print out one two three four five six
seven eight nine ten and then it's going
to go back to the top it's going to
print it out again so what I mean by
this is if we run this we get
one two three four five six seven eight
nine ten and it does this ten times so
we have 100 integer values here printed
out on our screen now let's go ahead and
organize this a little bit better so
instead of using console dot write line
let's just go ahead and use console dot
write and you can see here that it will
print one two three four five six seven
eight nine ten and it goes through this
now this isn't very nice-looking either
so there's one more thing that we can do
to kind of clean this up and make a grid
out of the numbers that we have so
inside of our first for loop will just
do console dot write line so I'll go
ahead and run this and then explain to
you how this code works so you can see
that it's got one two three four five
six seven eight nine ten
it goes down to the line below it and
this is a 10 by 10 grid so there's 100
integer values on this grid okay so now
basically what happens when we create
this for loop is we have for number 1
equals 1 to 10 and every time this is
this for loop is iterated it iterates
this for loop right here so starting off
num1 is equal to 1
it's going to do 1 to 10 it's going to
console dot right and it's going to have
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 and then after this
outside of this for loop which is all by
itself it's going to do console dot
write line inside of this for loop
so it goes 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 and then
down the line and it goes back up to the
top and it does that again and it's
going to do that ten times to give us a
grid now we can also do this with like I
said do Wiles and do 1 2 loops on so I'm
going to leave it up to you guys to
figure out how to do that with your do
loops and once you practice that a bit
go ahead and move on to the next
tutorial and thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
