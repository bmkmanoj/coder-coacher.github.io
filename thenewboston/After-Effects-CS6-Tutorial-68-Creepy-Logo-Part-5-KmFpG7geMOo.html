five of the creepy logo tutorial where
in the last tutorial we went through
adding smoke on top of the of the text
layer so now we have smoke moving across
the top and it comes out and we
feathered it and everything like that so
check out part 4 if you haven't been to
this part yet we're on part 5 now so in
part 5 we're going to put some effects
on our smokey title which is the text
comp to make it pop off more and change
change around the like the fluidity of
the of the text so it's like creepy
crawly so the first the fact I want to
put on is a glow and where is that it's
in generate maybe I'm just gonna type it
on can't remember where all of them
always are glow it would have been under
stylize I drag that on to my comp here
now I'd already did something there so
we're gonna change some of the settings
so look a little better we can move the
glow threshold up a little bit won't
move the glow radius up decent amount
mmm even more so that's good
glue intensity maybe down a little
well base it off the Alpha Channel there
we go
and let's change these colors up so we
have color a here let's make that
it's a dark dark blue something like
this
actually now we're making that a light
blue there we go and then this color B
we're gonna make the dark blue go down
here a little more about that there we
go
I mean it pop off a little bit more you
can see I'm doing that by pressing this
effects button here and I'm toggling the
effect on and off to see how it actually
affected the the layer I'm gonna add
some color correction to it by going to
effect color correction and levels again
I'm gonna pull the gray here to the
right
and a whole lot
it's too
60 so it looks like Oh wrong one
not that point point six zero
so what that looks like yeah there we go
the next thing I'm going to add is a
roughing edges to give it a the crawley
kind of look is that under stylize
yep roughing edges now the Edit type we
want is I think it's gonna be rusty no
it's gonna be roughing so to make it
like Crawley the first thing we're gonna
do is edit the evolution so we'll add a
keyframe here at the beginning and then
at the very end I found out that six
times that evolved was pretty nice so
here we go with that it crawls around
now the border comes out a little too
far I'll zoom in you can see it's like
going into the other one so we'll put
that down that's good enough and we'll
scale make a scale change doing 125
and it looks a little too crisp for my
tastes here so we're gonna add a blur
sorry effect blur and sharpen and a
Gaussian blur yeah I think just like one
is this this blur is pretty strong so
you don't really want to jack it up too
much there and I change this to alpha
add on the blending mode and that seems
pretty good
might be a little too dark so let me try
the levels and move this back a little
more yeah that looks a little better put
up point seven six my gamma there
there's a little too dark and you
couldn't really read what was going on
so those are what's going on with the
with the text I'll do a Ram preview I'm
gonna put this at half so that we can
Ram preview it quicker and I'm gonna hit
this and probably pause because it's
probably gonna take a bit you definitely
going to pause it and then come back
when it done so the render is complete
and let's take a look at what we got
here
there we go
you see the letters are growing now and
crawling better smoke across you can
read the text so looks like we're doing
pretty well there no there we go for
that let's uh stop here for this part of
the tutorial we'll head on to part 6
next where we'll decide how we're gonna
make this come on and what I decided was
a smoke trail running across and we can
create the smoke trail right in
after-effects so I'll see you guys in
the next part thanks for staying and
watching it this far</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
