tutorial and in this video all I want to
do is I want to show you guys how you
would keep score in this game I'm not
gonna be building an entire heads-up
display because you guys already know
how to do that for my other tutorials
but basically in order to score points
in this game you would have to destroy
this bar right here now whenever this
ball gets destroyed of course the
explosion happens and then well also you
want to do is you want to put a little
text notification that says like plus 10
plus 100 wherever the explosion happened
just to show the user okay um this is
how many points you got for destroying
this enemy so the first thing that we
need to do is we need to add another
global variable now I'll just call this
one score of course the initial value of
score is zero by default and now what
you can do is we'll just go ahead and
add it with a collision on meatball I
guess so basically um you're gonna want
to add it eventually with the ground but
for right now we're just work with
winning whenever you hit it directly
with a meatball so the first thing we
want to do is whenever you hit the
target with a meatball we want to add
will say like a hundred points of the
score so system and this is actually
just add two right here so basically add
I don't know a hundred points to the
variable score so that's what that does
and now what's going to happen is
whenever we shoot this it's gonna add
ten or excuse me 100 points to score
however the user doesn't have any way of
seeing that or ever knowing that so what
we need to do now is actually add some
text notification on the screen so
double click on your screen and add a
text and we can just go ahead and click
anywhere right now let me expand this
alright so this if we put fonts in I'll
make it a little bit bigger
you like 18 you bigger than that 22
we'll leave it at uh
I should put it like hot pink I think is
always really easy to see even hotter or
maybe something different this is a yeah
kind of like that I'm spending like half
the story oh just picking a frickin
color but anyways now that we have a
text object on the screen what we can do
now is go over back in the event sheets
and actually I want to set this is plus
100 hit enter and it doesn't really
matter where it is at this point because
we're gonna be spawning it right where
the explosion happens so you can just
leave it off your screen right there
so basically um take your pretty much go
to this event I don't know what I'm
thinking I'm thinking of some stupid and
add another action and the action is
this target ball spawned another object
just like we did with the explosion and
this time we're gonna spawn that text
object and I probably should have
renamed it something different but I'm
an idiot so I didn't
so spawn it just like you would
explosion on layer one and now check it
out now whenever we hit it with a
meatball it says 100 now we're gonna
notice one thing that's weird right here
and that's this whenever we hit it it
displays but it displays it kind of an
angle and the reason for that is because
it's actually um parented to something
else I won't get in there right now but
I'll show you guys how to fix that
little problem if you add another action
and you just select this text right here
what you can do is set angle you can
just go ahead and set the angle of this
text object to zero right after you
spawn it and this kind of spawn a real
quick and switches to zero so to the
user it's gonna look like um I'll show
you guys it's just kind of look normal
like you would want it to
so right there there's your little
notification that says +100 you got a
hundred points and also if you're
keeping score um it would add 100 to
that local orc sees me the global
variable score so again I'm not going to
be building an entire heads-up display
because you guys already know how to do
that um you probably want to have a
score notification tally in the top left
corner something cool like that but for
now hopefully you guys understand the
basics of how to make a physics particle
you know like Angry Birds style game if
you have any questions at all of them
please ask me on my forum buggies room
org slash forum download all the files
for free and well hopefully you guys
enjoyed this tutorial and I'll see you
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
