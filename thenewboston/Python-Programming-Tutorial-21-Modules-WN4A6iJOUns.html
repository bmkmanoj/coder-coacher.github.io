talk to you about modules so sometimes
you're going to have functions that
you're going to want to use over and
over and over again maybe not only in
the same program but maybe in different
programs so instead of having to rewrite
the function every single time what you
can do is you can throw all the
functions that you're going to use over
and over again in a separate file and
then just include that file in whatever
program you're working on so not only
does it help you from writing a bunch of
code but it also helps organize your
program a little bit better and I'm
going to show you guys how to make those
right now so again like I said right now
we're going to make a module that's just
a function included in another file so
we're going to need another file so
right click on your project and write
new Python file so I'll just name this
home I don't know like tuna
so tuna dot P Y dot py is the extension
for a Python file and then hit OK so now
our project has two files in the same
directory this main which is our main
program the one we've been working on
and this tuna is the one we just made
and we can just delete that that doesn't
really matter
so in this tune file I'm just going to
make a really simple function right now
so def now I'll just call it you can
call it anything you want I'm just name
it fish because I don't know modules
name to us so why the heck not all right
so this function is just kind of like
prints on my land screen easy colons
alright I'll just say I am a tuna fish
there we go alright so say that we
wanted to use this function over and
over and over again so we just wrote it
once we threw in a module and we're good
to go so now whenever we actually want
to use it go back to your main program
and what you can do is in order to use
any of the stuff in your module you
first need to say ok we want to include
another file so how do we do that well
we actually type the word import and
that means go get a file from somewhere
else in
use it in this program so then it says
okay well what's the name of your file
well it's just called tuna and you don't
write py because whenever you import a
module it knows that of course it's
another Python Python file so again no
need to include that py don't do it it
knows so right now in this program we're
working on we included basically this
basically what's going on behind the
scenes is it goes to this file copies it
and paste it right in here even though
you know you don't see it that's kind of
a good example so if you just run this
right now check it out
nothing happens why is that well we
included this but we didn't say to
actually use this function right in here
so in order to use functions that are
inside modules we just can't write fish
like this even though this function is
named fish right here check it out if we
run it it says okay fish is not defined
so why can't we do that well the reason
for that is say we were including a
bunch of modules maybe root um there's
some modules that we wrote maybe some
that our friends wrote maybe some that
some random people on the internet wrote
well maybe each of those modules each
have a function name fish so whenever we
just call it like this it's not going to
know which function or which function
from the module to use so before we call
the function we need to specify the name
of the module that we're using it from
so tuna da fish what this means is go to
tuna the tuna module and from there call
the function named fish so now whenever
you run it check it out
it goes to tuna finds fish and cause
this or runs it whatever you want to
call it so that is how we can build our
own module and use the crap inside it
but there are also ways to use other
people's modules and I'll show you how
to do that right now
so one module that you're going to be
using a lot is called a random and this
is just a simple one to generate a
random number another random stuff so if
you write import random actually it just
pops up right there
and enter what you did is it basically
includes a bunch of functions that they
aren't built into the core Python
language but we can just import them
really easily and we can also download
other modules from the internet and use
those as well but this is the one or
excuse me this is one that's included
with PyCharm so whenever we import it we
can use those functions and I'll show
you you guys are Oh a simple one real
quick so we'll just make a random number
from like one to a thousand of course
the modules name is random and a
function that is inside it it's called
Rand range and this just takes a range
of numbers like 1 like I said to a
thousand so now what we did is we
generated a random number 1 mm stored it
in the variable X and if I just print
that out and hopefully this time it was
236 and who the heck is texting me right
now all right anyways I gotta go deal
with that and actually in the next video
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
show you guys a real cool way in easy
way where you can go grab modules from
the internet and download them and the
cool thing about it is we don't have to
open up our browser or anything all the
tools are built right into PyCharm so
that's what you have to look forward to
I'll see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
