section or button here it's gonna bring
you to basically your some extra options
here if you have an nvidia video card
which i don't seem to have it works
better with After Effects because the
new compatibility in cs6 allows the use
of the CUDA cores of the Nvidia graphics
card to help like drive things in After
Effects so if you have the NVIDIA GPU
you'll be able to change this
ray-tracing from CPU to GPU and then
you'll be able to probably render a bit
faster and everything like that
I have Radeon now I had this before cs6
came out so I I'm sticking with that
until I decide to buy a new one or this
one dies or I get enough money randomly
somehow to buy a new one but I want to
buy a house first so I'm gonna get that
first so I'm gonna hit OK and just stick
with these 1/8 here on my adapter of a
resolution it's gonna render because I
didn't let it render before and there we
go so there is one more down here under
renderer options now this helps you out
with your ray tracing quality and how
its going to do it you can read this
section here which I encourage you to do
I'm not gonna read it for you because
basically what it says is that the
higher you set up your ray tracing
quality the more noise it's going to
take out but the longer it's going to
pretty much take it's going to take a
longer time to compute and render every
time so you want to set this down to the
lowest possible quality that seems
acceptable to you now it's
gonna increase like the sharpness or
anything like that so don't try to
increase it and expect that the edges
are gonna be nicer or anything like that
it's just going to affect the noise this
drop-down box here has a few different
sections here we got none box tenth and
cubic and these are the anti-aliasing
filters and with ray tracing Ray's are
fired into the pixels to produce a
render image and it shows off the
texture and everything like that so
you've got these different types of
methods here where the the result kind
of is will look a little better in
quality and these go from but worse are
from better quality or not from worse
quality to better quality there so the
anti-aliasing filters controlled the
amount of blurriness none here it'll
give the sharpest result but the the
edges may be more aliased which means
they're a little more jagged II and
stuff but the other ones give these ones
here they give blurry or results but the
edges aren't gonna be all earliest for
you so hopefully that made sense and I
explained it a little bit I'm gonna hit
okay and I just wanted to let you know
that this menu here is new in cs6 if you
look at it in cs5 there's going to be
different menus so if you if you
remember or if you have cs5 now there
used to be a section that was off
wireframe adaptive resolution which had
a dash that said OpenGL off OpenGL
interact
OpenGL always on so most people didn't
like OpenGL at all and after-effects so
this that's kind of why they got rid of
it in here they would always put it on
adaptive resolution so if you have cs5
keep yours on adaptive resolution for
the most for the most part you don't
really want to use the opengl that's
gonna be it for this tutorial I just
went over the different types of
previews and what they meant and then
the options here I went over those in
basic so hopefully you guys figured out
what I was talking about and it wasn't
too confusing thank you for watching
give it a thumbs up if you liked it a
thumbs down if you thought it was
horrible and just I look forward to
seeing you guys in the next tutorial see
you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
