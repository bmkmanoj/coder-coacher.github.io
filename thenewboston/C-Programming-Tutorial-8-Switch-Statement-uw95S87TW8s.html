to your eighth seat tutorial and this
tutorial we're going to be going over
something called the switch statement
now what the switch statement is is
pretty much an alternative to the
if-else if-else statement now in case
you guys forgot what that did it pretty
much takes a number in it tests that
number and whatever equals to gives you
a bunch of different pieces of code to
execute and this is much easier just
type and show you guys so I'm going to
do just that the first thing we need to
do is declare our define a variable
let's say integer called what is the
name a number just keep things simple
the next thing that we're going to want
to do is make a scan to get some input
from the user so let's put percent D
since this is decimal and let's put
ampersand Lauria number so whatever the
user enters it's going to be stored in
the number variable I'm not going to
have any output on the screen no print
statements I just keep things simple for
now and the syntax for this switch
statement is this type in the word
switch now in your argument you only
have to write what variable you want to
test so you're going to write okay I
want to test the variable number to see
what they entered and then you have to
make something or a bunch of things
called cases now what a case has to be
is an option of what they could have
entered so if it says in case they
entered the value on to then add a colon
not a semicolon just a regular colon and
on the next line you write what you want
it to do in case you enter too I want
you to print F um what are we going to
print you entered too
and so the first thing you enter is the
case of a possible option then after
your case you are enter what you want
the code to do in case they did enter to
and after your case and your code you
enter one last thing and that is a break
and now and what break means is alright
we found the answer
keep going to the you don't have to test
anymore
so pretty much anytime you want to test
an option you need a new case new code
in a new break so since we just need a
new one of those let's just copy that a
couple times and let's put four six so
you entered four and you entered six and
just to show you guys let me move this
up if you didn't have this break right
here what the code would do is this it
would test for two and if you and if you
say you entered a number like three it's
going to fail this and keep going onto
this and keep going onto this but if you
enter two it's going to keep going onto
this and stop since it's already found
an answer if you didn't have that break
right there it would keep testing all
these but since you already found your
answer there is no need to test so might
as well have a break might as well save
your computer some time and the last
thing that you need at of every switch
is something called default
now what default does is pretty much the
syntax for that is just default with the
colon after it and it says all right in
case it tests all of these numbers and
they're all false
none of them pass what code do you want
to execute so let's write let's just
copy this actually it'll be a lot easier
copy-paste
prynt say i don't know what you entered
and of course with the default you also
need a break this is no exception so let
me execute compiling to run this and
I'll show you guys what this program
actually does as long as I didn't make
any errors or anything so here's our
program right here wanting us to enter a
number let's go ahead and enter the
number four and press enter and it says
alright you enter the number four and
let's go ahead and execute uh let's run
this one more time and I'm going to
enter a number that's not two four six
just show you guys what the default does
say enter 21 press Enter I don't know
what you entered so again to reiterate
this concept so it sticks in your head
one more time a switch statement takes
any variable and they in by using
something called a case you can test
whatever that variable is equal to if
any of these cases are true then execute
the code underneath it but if any of
them or sorry if all of them are false
then executes the default statement and
this is just an alternative to this
if-else if-else statement it's a lot
easier way of testing a single variable
if you have multiple options
um this is useful this is actually going
to be really useful in the programs
we're going to be making so make sure
you learn this I'm going to go ahead and
copy this right now and post it to my
website the new Boston comm so if you're
too lazy to type all of this just go to
my site the new Boston comm copy it I'll
have it for you there so study this
tutorial make sure to please subscribe
to my channel thank you guys for
watching and I'll see you guys next
