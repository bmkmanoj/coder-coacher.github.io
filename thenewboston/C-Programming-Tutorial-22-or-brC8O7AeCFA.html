and in this tutorial I want to show you
guys another way and this is actually
kind of a simple way that you can test
multiple conditions as well so this is
actually really good whenever you have
the user enter input into the keyboard
and you want to check and make sure they
entered it properly so let's just go
ahead and make a simple program to ask
the user if they like bagels or not
because I know that Cal side my window
he loves bagels so he would say yes but
we'll see what the user has to say so go
ahead and we'll just have the user to
type in Y for yes and n for no so we can
just store that in one character so char
answer is what we'll put their response
in and for the question we'll just print
it out and we'll just say do you like
bagels and also let's give them the
little prompt on Y / n to let them know
they can only enter yes or no and also
for the skin we'll kick that to newline
now of course give them a place where
they can enter their answer scanf now
for this remember in between your
parentheses hit a space % see since
we're only doing one character and where
do we want to store their answer well we
want to store it right in the variable
answer and we need the ampersand sign
because it is not an array so basically
right now we stored either the letter Y
or n an answer now we want to make sure
that they actually did write wire and
and they didn't type something stupid
like um P or type the word meatball or
anything like that because if they did
well then it just like broke our
computer program so let's go ahead and
make the basic structure first so we'll
just go ahead and make a test eventually
that if they enter the correct data then
we'll print out I don't know what can
you say like uh we'll just say I feel
this now what can you say good job you
didn't
mess anything up we'll say we're taking
a survey about bagels or something
now else what's going to happen is we're
going to tell us say basically we're
going to test if they entered Y or n and
if they did good job else they must have
like typed in the word a tunafish or
entered like the word or the letter X by
accident or something like that so we'll
just print out something very mean like
keyboard much all right so now we need
to figure out how do we test this thing
and the reason that it's a little bit
different than that and is because
remember last time we use two ampersands
and both of those things had to be true
however we can't do this time because
there's no way that the user can enter Y
and n both of those things can't be true
so we need to use a new test and that is
called or and that if you look on that
um Enter key on your keyboard you see
the backslash at least it is on mine if
you hold shift and press it twice I call
them the pipe symbols I don't know what
they're really called I think they're
called something like that but in C
language two pipe symbols stands for or
so basically we're going to have test
one which we're going to say is the
character equal to Y and we're going to
say test 2 which we say or is equal to n
as long as it's equal to one of those
things then it's good to go so the first
thing we'll put is is answer equal to Y
or is their answer equal to n as long as
it's one of those things at least one of
these things has to be true to say good
job you didn't mess up if it's not and
both of those things are false then
we'll just say keyboard much so run this
and we'll say a deal like bagels and
we'll hit you know n to enter an
accepted job you didn't mess up anything
now let's say the user types in
something silly like do you like bagels
z hit enter like an idiot
and it says keyboard much and of course
we typically want to display like a
proper error messages okay dude you
actually need a press Y or n but that's
the basics of or and also if there's an
instance like this where both of these
conditions were true then this would
still run basically just one of these
conditions need to be true this one or
this one or both of them and let me show
you guys an example both them so we'll
say is a is five less than ninety or is
a 10 mm equal to ten well this is true
five is less than 90 and ten is equal to
ten so even though both of these are
true you still need to do this even
though it doesn't really matter we still
get this so I just want to explain to
you guys that one the first one has to
be true the second one or both of them
it only doesn't return true if both of
these are false so hopefully you guys
understood that and if not just play
around with it for a little bit and you
guys will get it so that is pretty much
all the basic text or excuse me
test I want to talk you guys about and
in the next tutorial well I guess I'll
just teach you guys that next story so
thank you guys for watching see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
