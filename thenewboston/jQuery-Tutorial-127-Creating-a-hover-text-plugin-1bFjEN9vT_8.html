with the video tutorial for the new
boston in this video we're going to be
creating a plugin that's gonna allow us
to hover over a particular link it's
gonna take the title from the link and
it's going to display it on the page as
a sort of hover over and follow div so
at the moment you can see I've got this
link here which is Google and I
obviously have a link location and then
I've just applied a title as we usually
would now what's going to happen here is
the plug-in inside ext is it's gonna
call it's gonna be called here so we've
got this text this plug-in called hover
text and that's applied to all a
elements so all essentially what could
be links on a page and what this plug-in
does is it takes the title attribute
from this link and it applies it in such
a way that it will display as a hover
over description and this will be
obviously taken from the title so you'll
see that when I hover over this link
here we have the text appear a powerful
search engine so essentially what we're
doing is something that we could usually
do in jQuery but we've applied it
actually to a plug-in so we're going to
be working with creating this as a
plugin so essentially all we do is just
call it and and that's it basically
so plug-in j/s contains all of the
plug-in files EXT is just an external
script that we would usually use we
could apply it in line but obviously
with you know maintaining sort of some
kind of structure we tend to keep
javascript away from our document body
but include it in an external file
instead so the demonstration is here
obviously if you were to go ahead and
change the title of this let's just say
to google it would obviously pick up on
this and it would change the text inside
of this hovering div here and obviously
it's styled using style dot CSS which
we'll go through and create the actual
div itself and then apply that to the
document and place this text inside so
we'll it really needs is hover text and
this just this will just give you an
idea of
of how to create your own plugin but
also how we can apply a functionality to
that as well so let's go ahead and take
a look at some of the code inside of the
files and let's start writing this
plugin out okay so over to the text
editor like I said we have ext J s and
plug-in is at the moment these are both
empty because we're gonna be writing
them out in just a moment we've got my
link here and I'm gonna go ahead and
open up the style sheet that I've used
as well let's just open up style dot CSS
let's just get rid of that because we'll
start from a fresh so we understand how
this is all working and how the divs
created you can see at the moment this
does link to Google however we don't get
our hover over text you'll notice
however we get the default tooltip here
which just says Google when I hover over
let's just go back and change this to a
powerful search engine so when we hover
over you see we get this tooltip now
we're going to be disabling that but
displaying the div instead so we'll
obviously go through this process the
first thing really to do is to style out
the div that we want to display so what
I'm going to do is just in my document
body I'm gonna create the div above this
link and I'm gonna call this hover text
so when i refresh the div is now in
place but obviously we haven't styled it
in style dot CSS so let's go ahead and
say hover text and we'll start to
actually star this out now the first
thing we want to do is make sure the
position is set to absolute and this
just means that we can modify the top
and left position of this div that's
quite important because we're gonna need
to set that to follow the mouse
initially we're gonna have the display
as none because obviously we don't want
to display this you know just on the
page as normal we want to only display
it when we hover over this link here so
you know with setting display to number
for now we'll just go ahead and comment
this out so we don't have it
you know hidden we want to see what's
going on let's just go ahead and just
put some text inside of here so we can
see our progress so at the moment we've
just got oh okay so it's overlap that
link at the moment so let's just go
ahead and comment this link out okay so
we've got some text this is our div as
it currently looks but we want to go
ahead and add some other aspects to this
so I'm gonna add a background color and
this is gonna be F 0 F 0 F 0 which is
just a light gray color I'm gonna set
the border to 1 pixel solid and 40 40 40
which is sort of a a mid gray color and
then we're gonna go ahead and set the
padding of this to let's say 6 pixels so
now you can see that that's been
transformed to this what we can see here
we've got the border we've got the text
inside and we've got a grey background
color so essentially now we have the div
that we want to you know follow we don't
actually we don't actually need to you
know so do anything with this
in actual fact I think we're gonna leave
out display:none because what we're
gonna be doing is generating this div
when we actually hover over a link so we
don't really need the display:none at
the moment obviously we're not going to
be including this on the page every time
we're going to let jQuery add that to
our document for us so back to original
we have Google here and we have the
hover over tooltip a powerful search
engine we want to go ahead and change
this so style dot CSS is done now we can
go ahead and close that off we're not
going to do a XT dot J's just for now
but we're gonna start to create the
outline and body of our plugin so to
create our plugin we're gonna have two
brackets and inside this we're going to
have a function and just inside that we
need a dollar sign this just means that
we can go ahead and use you know a
dollar sign rather than replacing this
with you know jQuery having to write
jQuery in here and what we're gonna do
is we're gonna go ahead and actually
create a sort of like our function body
bring this down and after here we just
want to write J sorry J query
and that's just gonna that's essentially
all this is is just the outline for our
plugin so inside of here we can start to
name our plugin as well so I'm going to
use dollar sign F n which obviously
stands for function and we want to go
ahead and name our plugin so I'm gonna
name this hover text so now we've
included a name of our plugin okay so
this is gonna be equal to a function now
in here you'd usually put sort of
parameters but we're not going to need a
parameter here because everything's
dynamic it works for us we have no
options or settings but obviously you
know that's an option okay so now that
we've created our plugin this is done so
to test I'm going to go ahead and write
alert let's just say working so now that
we've created our plugin all that's
going to happen is when we call our
plugin we're just going to alert the
text working now at the moment obviously
on the page there is nothing because we
haven't actually called our plugin but
if we go over to ext dorje s we can go
ahead and call this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
