Blackford here with another Photoshop
cs6 tutorial and in this tutorial we're
just going to learn how to create a
selection from a layer and let's just
get started on that there's no really
need to explain it so let's just get
started I guess so we're going to just
use our text tool to create a new layer
so click on the text tool then click in
your canvas and just start typing
something and I'm just going to type
select me with a nice wing key there and
if you hold ctrl you can adjust the size
of your text there and then if we use
the move tool up here we can move it
back to the center so that's what I'm
going to use for our selection now to
select something you're going to hold
down control and then go over the
thumbnail in the layers panel and you
can see it turns into a finger a
pointing finger with a dotted box so
click on that now and you can see that
your layer has been selected
now since the layer has a transparency
to it so if I turn off this background
you can see the transparency it's
selecting the total like everything in
the layer now if you had a layer like if
these two layers were combined and it
was the select me on a white background
it it would select the entire layer so
for example if I can make like a quick
example for you let's make a new layer
real quick and set it underneath and
then we'll just fill this entire layer
up with this yellow color because it's
right already there
man come on work
oh yeah the reason why it's not working
is good because there's a selection so
if I deselect this now I can put the
image in the background on there and I'm
just going to combine these two layers
by right-clicking and then going to
merge layers and now there are 1 layer
now if I try to make a selection off of
this layer since the whole thing is
filled up and there's no transparency at
all it's going to select the entire
thing just like like if you hit select
all that's what it would do so this is
what's going on there you need to have
transparency for the layer to be
selected correctly so all I'm going to
do is back up a few steps control
holding control and all and pressing Z
just to back up until this the layers
are separated now if you want to add a
more of a more selections to your layer
so let's create another text and just
say second selection man no one's gonna
be able to see that now we can cool and
I move that some like around here if I
want to select that and I want to select
the other text all you need to do is
hold down ctrl to select and then hold
down shift and then you can see a plus
button goes in click on that click on
the other thumbnail that you want to
select and it selects them both so
that's really nice and that's all there
is to making selections from layers so
use that in our upcoming tutorial that
we're going that I'm going to do next
about creating a layer from a selection
so I'll see you guys in that tutorial
and thanks for watching this one and
give a thumbs up if you liked so see you
guys later have fun</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
