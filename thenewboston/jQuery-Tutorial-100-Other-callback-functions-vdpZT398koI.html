and this is a video tutorial for the new
Boston now in the last tutorial we
looked at the get and post HTTP requests
in jQuery now there's a few additional
things you can do to actually create a
better working and you know more flowing
script I guess okay so we have some cool
back functions additional callback
functions that we can append onto the
end of our request so we have our post I
poke dollar sign post here so we have
our HTTP request in place now what
happens if we receive an error now if we
receive an error in this at all for any
reason for example reverse doesn't exist
or you know something's gone wrong
we can actually bind onto the end some
checks now we have three checks that we
can complete and that is success
complete and error so for example let's
go ahead and try error I'm just going to
use at the end of this here you'll
notice that it starts here where my text
editor is highlighted it read and ends
here so this is really after the post
initial post request we can set another
callback function so function again we
create a function inside of here and
then we have some curly brackets I'm
going to bring this down and if there is
an error I'm just gonna alert to the
user an error so an error
occurred okay so you don't obviously
don't have to have an alert you can do
absolutely anything with this you could
put some data into this feedback just
say error occurred in fact other thing
we'd probably do that now that's
probably better feedback dot text an
error occurred okay so if we have an
error we are using a callback function
to put the text an error occurred inside
the feedback div so let's go ahead and
test our script again Alec says hello
that would just be Alex s hello now what
happens if for example our file doesn't
exist well let's go ahead and rename it
let's go over to PHP remember our file
is called reverse PHP that we've called
just here so let's go ahead and rename
that to reverse one dot PHP okay so
let's go ahead into our browser let's
press Enter let's go ahead and type my
name and a little message again we click
go now we get an error has occurred
error message being returned to us the
reason that there's an error is because
this file doesn't exist and this error
will be fed back for a variety of other
reasons as well depending
okay so let's rename our file back the
way it was and I'm gonna go through some
other you know callback functions we can
use so we also have dot complete and
this is a callback function to run when
the request is complete so let's go
ahead and for this we'll just alert in
fact we'll create another div just under
this one
and we'll call this messages okay so
back into Ajax j/s will put this here as
messages so if there's an error we have
a request a some text going to there now
if the function or if the post request
is complete we can again put a message
into messages so dot text request
complete okay so now let's go ahead and
press refresh have Alex and hello click
go request complete and Alex says hello
so now that's telling us that the
request is complete okay we also have
dot success now this is only run if the
current operation is successful now if
we look at the difference here we could
say get rid of that now and go ahead and
rename our PHP file again so let's go
ahead into our PHP directory and go
ahead and rename reverse ok I'm also
going to use this and say append rather
than text that just makes it easier to
see each request in total so let's go
ahead and run this
and click go okay so you'll notice that
we have a request complete but we also
have an error occurred now that's the
difference between complete and the
success callback which we're going to
write in a moment successful only
success will only be returned if the if
the operation is obviously a success if
everything's gone to plan and we've
returned some data in the file exists
bla bla bla complete will always happen
as long as this post request this HTTP
request has been completed so we can go
ahead and we can add on a success
callback function as well so inside here
we create a function and we pull that
down and we can go ahead and copy and
paste this into here and this will be
messages dot append requests successful
okay so now when we return here and we
click go again you'll see that we have
is appended it on but we have an error
occurred and requests complete however
we don't have a success message so now
let's go ahead and go back to our PHP
directory rename are far back again so
we have the the correct file being
called now the callback functions that
will be returned our request complete
and request successful we don't have an
error the request remember always
completes well almost always completes
and the request will be successful
because we already know it works so
let's go ahead and test out and we'll
see them two messages appear okay so
we've got risk request successful and
request complete so why is this useful
well if we have an error for example we
might want to log this error we might
want to go on and display a message to
the user to say there was an error
retrieving your account information an
excellent example is Twitter
twitter has a system in place that when
the loading point is taken to
it tells you that tweets are taking too
long to load so this wouldn't really
have anything to do with the error part
of this but it does give a good example
of how if there is an error for example
if you know something wrong was returned
or if the file didn't exist you can
alert the user rather than nothing
happening or displaying them with a long
error inside of the page okay so these
are the callback functions that you can
use on either the post or the get HTTP
request in jQuery</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
