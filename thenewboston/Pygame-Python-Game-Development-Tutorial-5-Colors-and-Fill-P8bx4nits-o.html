another PI game tutorial video in this
video what we're talking about is how
can we actually put something on the
screen and draw to the screen so there's
actually quite a few ways that we can
put things on the screen but there's
really two main ways the first is going
to be using like sprites which is where
we take an image and we kind of put it
on our surface and by image I mean
something that we've created maybe in
Photoshop or something like that and
then we load it in to PI game but
there's another way built into PI game
that we can draw to the screen and
that's quite literally just drawing
using PI games so we can draw various
shapes poly like polygons and squares
and circles and this kind of stuff and
you can draw lines and to do it we use
coordinates so that's what we're gonna
be doing in this video is I'm going to
show you guys really actually two ways
that you can draw the screen and what
the difference between those two ways of
drawing to the screen are and how to get
that to update to the screen so with
that let's go ahead and get started so
this is our code at the moment it's very
simple code just runs and when we exit
it's going to quit the game um first
thing we need to do is we don't need
this first update so I'm going to go
ahead and just delete the X we don't
really need that now probably one of the
most popular things that you're going to
see at the top of people scripts
obviously going to see this this
bare-bones stuff that I was telling you
guys about but you're going to quickly
see after PI game got in it or even
maybe above it you're going to see
somewhere that people are defining their
colors for whatever reason I wish that
PI game had at least you know red orange
yellow green blue purple black white
predefined for us but they don't so or
at least if they if they do I don't know
it but to define colors you give the RGB
value which is red green blue so for
example white would equal and you can
give it a list or a tuple I prefer to
give it as it as a tuple so white is
going to be 255 255 255 and what this
means
it's actually the 256th element of each
spectrum of red green and blue and
conversely black as you might guess is
going to be zero zero zero so let's talk
real briefly about this so first of all
this would be 256 bit color so you've
got 256 x 256 x 256 combinations of
colors that you can choose from here and
also what is RGB what why do we use red
green blue as opposed to red yellow blue
as we're taught in school pretty soon
we're going to see another thing that is
kind of different compared to what you
were taught in school and that's
coordinates but here we use red green
blue and the reason mommies are yeah red
green blue the reason why we use red
green blue in like computers and stuff
is because computers have like a
backlight right when you look at your
screen you have a backlight and and
really some of the first monitors really
did there was like a true backlight
whereas now we have either LED and
there's all kinds of other fancy stuff
going on so we're going to have to
necessarily be used continue using RGB
but that's just what we got stuck with
and you've got basically two different
types so red yellow and blue you can
think of it this way if you have like a
piece of paper and you paint some green
on there um and then you take that same
brush and you brush another like stroke
of green over the previous screen is
that green going to be darker or lighter
to darker so the more color that you add
in the red yellow blue um kind of arena
the darker it's going to get whereas so
really black in our bar you know red
yellow blue is almost really a mixture
of everything and even though in reality
by law like white is actually a mixture
of all colors but anyway that's aside
anyway if you were to mix all of your
colors you get a blackish color with
paint
whereas with when we consider light for
example the absence of light is what
black obviously and if we mix all of the
light colors what do we get white and
that's how we actually are told in
school as well that why does it
extra of all the colors and this blows
people's minds well it's because the
human eye sees colors based on whites so
that's why but anyway moving on that's
why we use RGB with computers so that's
a black and white RGB I'll show you guys
a few other ones obviously like for
example this is red green blue right so
so we should be able to deduce that red
would equal what well to 5500 not 2001
to 5500 there's also an optional
parameter usually and that's alpha and
alpha is a degree of transparency
actually alpha i think is opaqueness but
anyway more on that later so now we've
defined a few colors here let's actually
go ahead and use these colors so for
example the most basic way to draw
something to the screen is by using fill
so right now when we run our game up
pops a purely black screen so I don't
have anything we can clearly see the
default is black well we don't really
want black so let's go ahead and close
out of that and let's say we wanted a
white background well the way that we're
going to generate a white background so
it is we're going to have to use fill
and we can see here that this is our
while loop so this is the loop that is
currently functioning as our game loop
so basically like you hear main loop a
lot in games we have a game loop this is
our game loop right here this anything
that's falling under wow so we obviously
want to put it in the event handling
loop here which is our for loop that's
our event handling loop we actually
really kind of want this in just in its
own little right so that's going to be
here and what we're going to do is we're
going to say we're going to use fill and
fill is something you apply to a surface
object so what is our surface object
well if you recall tie game display dot
set mode returns a I game dot surface
object so that's what we're going to
fill so we would say game display dot
fill and here you can say what color you
want to fill with well let's say we want
to fill
um whites so we'll save that and we can
run that and a parent oh I know what is
it huh okay so it's a good a good
opportunity to bring up um updating and
all that again as well so keep in mind
like I was saying before that what you
do first is you draw everything in the
background and then once everything's
drawn then we render it because like I
was saying before rendering is what
takes the most graphics or rather the
most processing power is the actual
showing of the graphics so what's nice
is in the background we can generate it
and say okay we want this here this year
this year and as you can imagine say
we've got a white background and then
we've got a snake and some apples
well that snake and some apples is
covering over some of that background so
in theory we wouldn't have to we don't
necessarily generate that but what if we
were generating the whole background
then a snake then some apples there's
some waste there so anyway um so what we
have to do is after we've done in action
and we're completely done with all the
actions that we want to draw to our
screen for that frame and that frames
per second then we have to do a PI game
dot display update and that will update
our display currently we still don't
have frames per second that is coming
but this will still work because it will
work within our while loop anyways so so
let's go ahead and save and run that
real quick and now we have our white our
white background so that's how we can
fill in and give ourselves a background
in the next video and we talking about
how we can actually draw like smaller
like we draw a smaller shape and I'll
actually blow your mind with fill
because most people actually use fill to
totally fill the background you don't
have to do that and actually fill is the
superior choice because you can use
accelerated graphics acceleration but
more on that next video so stay tuned
for that thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
