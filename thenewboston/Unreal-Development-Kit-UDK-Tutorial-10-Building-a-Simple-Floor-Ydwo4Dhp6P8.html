tutorial and now that we know the basics
of brushes we can go ahead and start
putting our skills to use and build a
very simple level so in this tutorial
I'm only probably going to be creating a
floor for our player or character to run
around on but throughout these tutorials
I'm gonna be creating a full I don't
actually don't know maybe a house maybe
a map maybe some kind of building but
anyways and this tutorial I just want to
get a floor a foundation built and we're
gonna be testing it out so the very
first thing we want to do is we want to
change the size and shape of this red
builder brush because well it's gonna be
a kind of weird-looking floor if it's
just a square so go ahead and right
click this red builder brush and we
bring up the options so X is pretty much
how wide do you want it and I'm gonna go
ahead and change this to 1024 again look
at your grid and make sure whatever
numbers you have are divisible by
whatever grid size so I'm gonna make
sure all my numbers are divisible by 8
that way it snaps nicely to the grid
whenever I'm trying to line things up so
1024 is divisible by 8 let's think of a
length for it um 1280 whoa hey-oh 1280
and for Z Z is the height of the floor
now we really could give us something
like 2 but we want to add some depth to
it so give it something like 32 and now
whenever we hit build we see the basic
shape so that's a pretty good size I
think good enough for now so now if you
go ahead and we want to add masks go
ahead and hit CS g add and now you can
see we have some mass on the floor
pretty cool huh so actually believe it
or not this is a very basic level we
could play this if we wanted to so in
order to test out your geometry actually
let me do this first anytime you're
making a map and you want to test it out
go ahead and right click anywhere on the
map and hit play from here and whenever
you do it's gonna pretty much throw your
character in your map and first of all
you guys are probably saying this what
the heck Bucky how the heck did I make
you know a radar in a gun
and a character with ammo and health I
mean I thought we just made a four I
didn't think I was that good yeah well
by default before you you know start
making any characters and you just want
to test something out the UDK
automatically gives you a test character
basically to run around on so don't
think that we created this by accident
we didn't so with that being said you're
probably gonna notice one thing first of
all if we shoot we can see that our
floor is indeed there but I mean the
lighting doesn't really resemble what we
were seeing right here and the reason
behind that is because whenever we're
working in the UDK by default we get
unlit mode and that's pretty much the
designers view it lights up everything
with a consistent light but it isn't
what the gamer would see the gamer would
see this a lipid just like that so as
you can see whenever we enter lit mode
or game mode everything kind of turns
the black so in order to get in order to
you know have the character play the
level successfully we need to add a
light to this map now I know I'm not
gonna cover lights in this story but for
now just follow along with me go ahead
and hold down L on your keyboard and
click with your left mouse and once you
do you get a light on your map now go
ahead and with your move tool aka the
translation mode go ahead and pull that
light up and as you can see it
automatically switches to lit mode again
lett mode is kind of what the character
would see unlit mode is what the
designer sees it just makes it easier to
work with but go ahead and switch the
lit mode and as you can see this is what
the character would see so now the
character has a nice light however if we
go ahead and hit right click play for a
mere check it out we're giving a bunch
of error messages that say lighting
needs to be rebuilt and passing need to
be rebuilt and it didn't light up our
level the reason behind that is because
just like any time you make a update you
need to update geometry aka bow geometry
anytime you add new lights you need to
build all so go ahead and hit build all
and as you can see a bunch of the little
boxes are gonna pop open
and our lights are gonna start to build
it's basically gonna put our level
together for us and we have a bunch of
these errors right now but don't worry
about those right now and now that
everything is built our light our
geometry go ahead and right-click it and
hit play from here and now check it out
how awesome is that by the way for the
Unreal Tournament if you never played
the game how you move around is the WASD
just like that how you can turn is with
your mouse and how you can shoot is
either clicking left button or the right
mouse button so check it out we have an
awesome amazing level we can go ahead
and you know shoot the ground I guess
that might be kind of fun or if we hold
the right mouse button we can go ahead
and build a spaceship Oh
pretty cool huh so with that being said
that's all I'm gonna cover in this
tutorial again the couple things I want
to mention is in order to change the
shape for your brush go ahead and
right-click it and you could choose the
shape choose something big enough where
we can work with later on if you want to
copy my numbers they're 1024 1280 and 32
in order to add a light go ahead and
hold L on your keyboard and hit left
click with the mouse again I know I
didn't cover lights in this tutorial but
I just want to give us the light so we
can test out our map and aside from that
make sure you hit build all and that's
the list little button up here and
that's gonna put everything together for
you so that being said I'm gonna go
ahead and save my map go ahead and press
file save as and I actually want to make
a new folder so new folder and I'm just
gonna name this like YouTube and then go
ahead and save it as like damn I've got
to think of a good name this is
obviously really stressful for me so I
was naming my buckey's map and by the
way this is DM make sure whatever you
save your map is make sure it's DM -
because this means the deathmatch mode
and that's what gives you your character
in your radar and allows you to test out
the map a whole lot easier than if you
didn't have it so
go ahead and save it make sure before
your map name you have that prefix diem
and that's gonna give you that character
and gun so for now that's all I want to
cover in this soil
hopefully you have also created a very
simple floor and now that you have we're
ready to month and next oriole so thank
you guys for watching don't forget to
subscribe and I'll see you guys in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
