tutorial that I'm making for the new
Boston and in this tutorial weren't
continue working in our writer class
alright so the first thing that we're
gonna do is create a method to write a
single play so we're just going to
create on public map that with a return
type of void since we don't need to use
it to get any information from this
method and then we're just going to name
this method right just writing a single
byte and then we're gonna need to get
and love bite you to want written so
does it have user passed through here
the fight they want right and we're just
going to say bite and I'm just a college
to write all right and now we're going
to use like Methodist I was a binary
writer class to write this single body
so I'm just gonna say BW right and then
that single bite that the user wants to
write so who's right all right now just
like in the reader class we just had
something for a read bite and we don't
really have to do much to the read bite
or write bite because it's just a single
bite and doesn't have anything to do
with big-endian or little-endian but now
in the next method of looking up to when
we're writing a fighter i actually
change the order of the ball your a
depending on if it's big-endian or
little-endian so we're gonna go right
here and create a new method so it's a
public void right bytes and in this
method the user will be able to write a
fighter ace who's gonna save byte array
and then bytes do right all right and
like i said if the user has the byte
order sets a big-endian when we're gonna
have to reverse this flights to right
array so it'll end up writing it in the
correct order because the fawley the
binary writer class just like the binary
reader class will write in little-endian
so what we're gonna have to stay here is
if byte order equals byte order dot
big-endian now we're just an actor
reverse this bites
- right erase
stay right doc reverse reverse
and that plates to right eraser just
basically reverses arrays order all
right and only if it's big endian it'll
reverse co-worker ray and then after
that we're just going to have it right
this byte array so it's a BW for a
binary writer doc right and then our
biker a right here so bytes to right all
right so let me just explain why we're
gonna have to reverse it right here so
imagine if user passed through here a
byte array with two elements and had
epi' and all right so basically what the
user wants us to see in the file would
be FF and then FPU right inside the file
all right well if we didn't have this if
statement right here what I would just
go ahead and do is start writing at the
right so let's start writing all right
right now and then we're gonna go here
and write happy all right so that's
little endian perfect well if it's big
endian we want it to start writing at
the last so we wanted to start writing a
path and then F be like it that way
so as you can see if we didn't reverse
it it would end up writing at e FF well
if it's big endian we want it to write
FF e alright so now that you understand
that let's just move on to writing on
integers like in 16 for example so we're
gonna go right here and say public Boyd
right into 16 and then we're just gonna
have them pass through the short or the
in 16 that they want to write
so this Masseria here short and all this
too right all right so just like before
we're gonna have to reverse it if you
buy order is big endian so we're going
to say byte array buffer equals bit
converter get bytes
then that short - right - right and the
reason that we're converting it into a
bugger it is so that we'll be able to
reverse it if the byte order is big
endian and then we can just write it as
a fire at the end so we're staring here
in white if by order you this that is
big onion that we just want to reverse
this buffer right so if it's big endian
we're just going to say array reverse
and then buffer and only if it's big
endian it'll reverse it otherwise do
nothing and then we're just going to
write that buffer array right here so
just a w-4 a binary writer and then dot
right and then we're just gonna write
this fiery right here called buffer all
right and you're gonna want to do this
for all the different data types so
warrant for a un 16 for an in 32 a un 32
and 64 and a un 64 something give you a
real quick example of just changing this
all you're gonna have to really do is
copy it paste change the name of the
method so it'll be a un 16 now we're
writing at you shorts on unsigned in 16
and that's really all you have to do so
you're gonna want to do that for like I
said in 32 you 32 in 64 and um support
alright and one more thing you're
probably gonna want to do is just have a
quick summary of what each method does
but it's not mandatory I think it just
makes it a lot easier for user to your
class alright so that's pretty much it
for this tutorial so see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
