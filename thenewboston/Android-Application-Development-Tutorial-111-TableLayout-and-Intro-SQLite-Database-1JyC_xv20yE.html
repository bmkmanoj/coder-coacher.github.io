and eleventh Android tutorial for the
new boss in and what we're going to do
in this tutorial is basically set up
some stuff that we're going to need for
SQL Lite and creating a database and
basically what our application is going
to do is you're just going to enter a
name and a hotness like if you made a
girl at a bar and you know you just want
to like in the morning you're like
what's she hot or not you can check your
phone and see what you ranked her on a
one to ten scale and then if you meet
back up with her and you're like whoa
man I must been really drunk because I
read it or higher than I thought so
that's basically the application it's
pretty shallow but yeah that's what
we're going to do we're just going to
hit update create some kind of database
with the name and the hotness or the
attractiveness rating we hit view and
then it's going to pull up with that
database so first
xml layout I call the SQL Lite example
and as you can see I've edit text or two
text views and to edit text
I had an age in there I'm gonna probably
delete that and then to book two buttons
there so let's go over to the code so
you guys can match up exactly to follow
along with now this SQL thing might take
a little bit I'll kind of explain what
it is and what we're going to you know
what we're going to do but here we go
with our edit text I just called it et
SQL name for the first one and for the
second one et SQL hotness and for button
I just referenced it as be SQL update
and B SQL open view so you guys can get
that set up or you know if you don't
like this layout you can set up however
you'd like next we need to create a Java
class I called it SQLite and it extends
activity implements onclicklistener
nothing new just added those two buttons
and those two edit text and we're going
to set the content view
to that XML layout that I just showed
you set up our references again nothing
new I'm just talking through what I've
done so far just in case and I set our
own click listeners and created a
switching case too you know we've done
this many times just to determine which
button was pressed so that's one class I
call the SQL Lite example and I put that
one in our menu activity so you can
select this this class now we need
another class that we're going to view
viewer database so I called that one SQL
view and extends activity and we're
going to set content view to our next
XML layout that we're going to sitt
setup now it's called our de ID oops our
dot layout dot SQL view like that
so there we go now now we have to create
this you know this XML file so right now
it's just blank probably talk through
what we're going to set this one up as
in this tutorial and then also after you
have that set up you also want to create
one more class that's going to handle
all of our pretty much all of our
database or SQL stuff and I called that
one hot-or-not because again our
application is going to be just judging
the attractiveness of someone so now
that you have those all set up again
this is just a class doesn't extends
anything or and implement anything at
the moment so there we go we have that
setup now let's go into our SQL view XML
file alright and so just to do something
a little bit different with this XML
layout we're going to use a table view
so I'll kind of explain or show you guys
just a brief example of that so we're
going to go into our layouts drag and
drop a table layout here and also one
row then we also want to have three text
views so we're just going to drag and
drop three text views and switch over to
the code we're going to format
everything now we have a
okay maybe we didn't need to drag and
drop that row in there so actually we're
just going to alright and for first our
everything's kind of messed up not the
way that we want it for a first text
view we want this to be your names and
we don't actually need an ID for this so
we're just going to delete the ID for a
text view and we want to fill parent for
width and fill parent for height because
we're going to use weights um so we're
actually going to cut that textview and
paste it within our first row here so
let me reformat and now what we need to
do is actually we don't need to define
anything for a row so we're just going
to delete everything for a row here as
you can see added a few extra rows are
actually going to delete that
you know delete all these extra rows and
then we're just going to drag our table
cut that paste it right here and let me
reformat so you guys can see what's
going on here
so basically we have a linear layout
that's vertical fills parent then we
have this table layout that we want to
also fill the parent for both width and
height
and then we have one row within that row
we have two text views which we want
both of those text views to fill you
know everything it can so fill parents
and fill parent and we also want this
third textview to fill the parent as
well
and for this last textview as well this
is what we're going to actually you know
get info from database we won't see this
text really because our databases we're
going to set you know our database
information to this text view but you
know just for reference you can do that
and we're going to label this text view
TV SQL info something like that now for
a second text view we want you know
attractiveness or hotness or whatever
you guys you know what this application
to do for the most part again we don't
need really an ID for here as well so
let me again format everything check out
how it looks looks pretty good
they're side by side on the same row
neck next we just need to add you know
some layout weight to each text view so
we're just going to add that real
quickly kind of review here but you know
the table layouts something a little bit
different so thought I'd show you guys
that I mean it it might be convenient
you can do you know different rows and
then in define how those rows work it's
really up to you what you want to do but
you know it's supposed to be beginner
series so I thought I'd show you guys
all the options or you know most of them
do something new every time as you can
see that looks pretty good the only
other thing that we we aren't getting is
our third text view so what we're going
to do is we're just going to wrap the
content of our whole linear layout which
will kind of pull everything together so
for the height anyway so wrap content
and let's check that out
so that's pretty good so that's table
layout and introduction to SQL which
we're going to actually get into in the
next tutorial but hopefully you guys
have everything set up again we have
created five things SQL Lite example XML
SQL Lite example
class SQL view SQL view XML and
hot-or-not Java class so hopefully you
guys got everything set up and I'll
catch you guys in the next tutorial have
a good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
