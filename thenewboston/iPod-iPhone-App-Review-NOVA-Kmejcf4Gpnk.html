welcome to another app review in this
app is for a game called Nova n 0 VA now
Nova is a game made by gameloft and it
cost 699 on the app store and it is I
will might have to say I think it's my
second favorite game that I played so
far so let's go ahead and skip this
video right here and I'll show you what
it's all about it's pretty much a
first-person shooter and says touch the
screen to continue and I already have a
game going so I'm going to go ahead and
click continue and now once it's loaded
I'll pretty much show you how to do
everything now let's go ahead and get
this in focus and as you can see i er
I'm like in the middle of a mission
right now but let's go over the controls
now in order to aim what you need to do
is pretty much just slide or paying your
finger on the screen and that's going to
aim your gun for you right there now in
order to look around I mean that's
pretty much the same thing in order to
fire your gun go ahead and click this
little red I don't know what it is
really whatever you would call that
crosshair I guess and this is going to
shoot your gun for you so I mean that's
all you need to do in order to shoot so
in order to move around oh that's why I
had that this is what you do it's like a
little xbox joystick where you go
forward back left and right so this is
look around this is moving around about
the same time hmm not bad so any time
you need to reload and you kill this guy
first anytime you need to reload just go
ahead and click right up here and this
is going to reload for you so just click
your gun right there and anytime you
want to change weapons just slide this
right here but I like this weapon right
here so I'm going to keep that but just
remember anytime you want to change guns
just slide your weapon so I guess that's
it except for this thing grenades
anytime on you use a grenade just tap
you a little grenade no throw it just
like that and that probably hurt me and
the last thing I want to talk to you
guys about any time you want to stun an
enemy let's see if I can get 10
I could find an enemy well here's what
you do you press this a lightning bolt
right here and they're like sticks out
of your hand or something and he's like
BAM talk to the hand and it stuns them
so you know it takes some of your power
but that's what it does so I don't know
really why they had that in there but
it's pretty cool just like hold out your
hand you like top that hand and then
this thumbs them so let me go ahead and
kill these guys are real quick and this
guy looked in a pretty rough you might
tell me but oh I'm a nice new all right
anyways and like I said what she she's
that way this is my health up here once
I go through it I mean whenever someone
shoots me at the police but it
regenerates so that's another cool thing
and so I told you about this paralyzed
thing with a hand and you know that's
pretty much it we do is pretty much you
just go through these levels killing
monsters like that and also you know
that's it go through killing monsters
and doing what they tell you do and the
cool thing is that they have this little
arrow to tell you where it goes and you
see that thing that pop up that cone
that's called your progress safe this is
one of my favorite games you because you
don't have to go in summer checkpoint
and save automatically this game
automatically saves it for you which is
just amazingly amazing so that's why
once I kill these two people all finish
talking but you know can't do two things
going really good keeper generating
right there so I mean for an iphone or
ipod app this game is absolutely amazing
it's so in depth and I mean it's just
really a lot for iphone game so that's
why i'm going to give this game my first
ever 10 out of 10 rating so I mean
that's pretty much it for this game I
guess I don't got a whole lot to say
except i highly recommend downloading it
the game controls are really easy
use and it's one of the most addicting
funnest in-depth well made games for the
iphone so i guess that's it for this
tutorial I'm going to play this and you
can check out my other tutorials I guess
