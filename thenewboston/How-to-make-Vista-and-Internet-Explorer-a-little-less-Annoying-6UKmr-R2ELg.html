tutorial I'm going to be teaching you
how to get rid of some annoying Vista
features um the first thing I'm going to
show you guys how to do is make sure
that Vista doesn't notify you every
single time you adjust your security
settings and how to get rid of the
annoying information bar on Internet
explorer so go ahead in in the start
search type in the GP edit and what this
stands for is group group policy edit
then type dot M SC now press ENTER and
it's going to bring up the after you
confirm that it's going to bring up the
group policy editor now from here once
you have this open you want to go ahead
and click computer configuration from
here you want to go ahead and click
administrative templates windows
components and go to where it says
internet explorer everything we want to
fix is going to be the in this Internet
Explorer settings the first thing they
were going to want to do is turn off
security settings so go ahead not
security settings but security settings
check feature this is going to allow you
to once you double click that you will
guarantee use me I'm going to want to
disable it and once you disable it it's
going to not warn you every time you
change the little security setting and
um vista using internet explorer so once
you have that turn off the next thing
that you're going to want to do is a
what did I say Oh get rid of the
information bar so to do this double
click on the security features folder
and from here you're going to want to
click on the folder that says
information bar in the file you want to
work on is internet explorer processes
double click this and disable this as
well and what this is the information
bar is that little bar let me
try to open their real quick actually
that's a Firefox nevermind that when you
um it's a little bar that pops up on the
top of your browser right here would pop
up that says like I'm here at this
website you don't have this installed or
this thing is running inches pops up
pretty much like on half the website to
go to so if you want to get rid of that
this is how you do it again click
internet explorer processes and disable
it here so those are two ways that you
can make vista less annoying in um if
you want to leave those you can always
enable them again but pretty much if you
don't go to any websites you don't know
or that you don't think our fishy then
you're not going to have problem with
that anyway so and if you do then you
deserve to have your computer ruined or
download virus or something so uh thanks
for watching I hope I helped you out a
little help it I hope I said some
aggravation so I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
