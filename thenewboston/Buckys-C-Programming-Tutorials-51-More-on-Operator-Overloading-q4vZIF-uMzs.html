so basically we're going to have to
Sally objects already we're going to
have a Sally object that say has a
number of 20 and another Sally object
that has a number of 30 and whenever we
create the brand new number it's going
to have a value of 50 so that's where
we're going to be returning the
brand-new Sally object so in order to do
that all you do is this return brand-new
just like that
and what this is going to is return the
brand-new Sally object so basically
we're going to be calling this on a
Sally object that already exists and
what it's going to do is this line is
going to create a brand new Sally object
right here we give a number value to the
brand new Sally object and right here
we're just returning that brand new
Sally object simple enough so let's go
ahead and well I guess now we can hop
over to main and I can actually you know
show you guys what's going on so the
first thing we need is two already
existing Sally objects with the number
property that we can add together so
Sally well we call this object a and
we'll give it a value of like 34 now we
need another one
Sally B and we'll give this value 21 now
we need a blank one because whenever we
call this value remember it doesn't have
a number property yet so that's what
we're going to be giving it so let's go
ahead and create a blank
Sally object with a C and now all we
need to do is this you might be thinking
are a whenever I wanted to before like
give a number property to the C value I
would do something like C equals a dot
add and then you would add B to that and
I mean what that would do is
whenever you wanted to add a number
property to see it would take a and add
B get some integer and add it to the
property of C right there well with this
overloaded operator you don't have to do
that anymore
here's we need to do C equals a plus B
in that way whenever we use the plus
sign C++ already knows that we have a
special meaning for it right here so
whenever it sees the plus sign call it
on one of these objects it's going to
know to run this function right here so
let's go ahead and run this in now that
we use that plus sign the C object has a
number operty so let's go ahead and see
out um c dot num and then let's go ahead
and end that line and let me go ahead
and run this real quick and I'll show
you guys that it says 55 so what it did
is basically this it took this number
value 34 added this number value 21 it
gave us 55 and through the use of our
overloaded operator that's where we got
the Sally num so let me talk you guys
through one last time what's going on
maybe this will clear things up for you
in our very first line of code we
created a Sally object and then um had a
value of 34 so we know whenever we
created a Sally object and we passed in
an integer then assign that integer to
the property of num so we have a Sally
object in a Sally object is num 34b
Sally object is num 21 and then we
created a see Sally object and remember
whenever we created a Sally object that
we didn't pass in a parameter it just
created a blank
Sally object right here so we said all
right with our blank Sally object we
want to use a plus B so set all right I
know this plus since you're trying to do
something weird I know that you're
trying to use this overloaded operator
so it said RAC goes a plus B that means
you're trying to use
the Sallee object with this function
right now so what it did is it took the
current object which was a right there
and this B was treated as the parameter
another Sallee object so what it did it
was it took the current object's number
which was 34 it added another Sallee
objects number which was 21 and it
returned a brand new sally object with
55 is as its number so as its returned
value we said equal to C so C now equals
a brand new sally object with 55 as its
number so that way whenever we printed
out our brand new sally object with its
new number that's why you printed out 55
on the screen right there so again like
I said operator overloading is a little
weird because it basically takes your
plus sign and you know you don't have to
use a function name anymore so instead
of this it pretty much changes that all
into a plus sign so I know it's kind of
a weird syntax at first and to be honest
I don't use it a whole lot in my
programming so if that gives you
confidence that you're probably not
going to be seeing this a whole lot then
you know you can relax but I just want
to give you guys the idea of what
operator operator overloading is because
you know whenever you're at a job and
people are talking about it you don't
get lost or whatever so that's what it
is but you won't be seeing it all too
much in my programs so now that you guys
understand the concept of it thank you
guys for watching don't forget
subscribing you're probably going to
have to re-watch this video a couple
times and do some examples of your own
and if you have any questions don't
forget to check out my form the New
Boston comm slash for them and hopefully
I can answer for you so anyways one last
time thank you guys for watching don't
forget to subscribe and I'll see you
guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
