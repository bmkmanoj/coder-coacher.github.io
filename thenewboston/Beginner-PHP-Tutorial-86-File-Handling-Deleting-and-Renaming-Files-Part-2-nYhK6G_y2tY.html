see what result we achieve so let me
just refresh the page and you can see
that the file deletes is still there so
we can double check if this is working
we're making sure it's there first of
all let's click on file dot PHP okay so
file file to delete ext has been deleted
let's go back and refresh and you can
see that that's been deleted so now what
happens if we run the code again this
function is not going to work because
it's not going to be able to find the
file specified let's click on that okay
so we get a warning up so unlink file to
delete no such file or directory and
we've got our error message up here so
what we can do is we can actually change
our code it says here file has been
deleted we don't keep that in the editor
so what we can do is we can change our
code and we can burn at symbol before
this so we're not going to get this
warning up in PHP let's go ahead and
refresh and you can see that we've just
got our plain error message on its own
so now we've successfully looked at
deleting a file what happens if we want
to rename a file so let's go ahead and
get rid of everything on this page okay
so we want to fire we want to rename
this file to a random array if you like
of numbers so we're going to be using
the round function to generate a large
random number and then we're going to
rename this file here to that random
number and then dot txt so we're still
maintaining the file extension okay so
let's go ahead to file dot PHP let's
first of all specify the file name in in
a string datatype so this is far to
rename txt now let's go ahead and create
a random number now if you haven't
already looked at creating random
numbers in PHP we use the rand function
so let's go ahead and say Rand is equal
to Rand and this is going to take two
parameters it's going to take a lower
and an upper limit so we can say set our
lower limit to 10,000 and we can set our
upper limit to 99999 so this is going to
generate a five digit number between
these two numbers so this is the lower
and this is the upper here so the
function name that we use is simply
rename so remember before I said delete
isn't as obvious when we use the unlink
function but with renaming we just use
the rename function okay so let's go
ahead and do that
so let's say rename now this is going to
take two parameters obviously because
what we need to do is specify the file
name to rename and also what we want to
call it after that so let's go ahead and
we'll say rename file name and we're
renaming this to R and remember you need
to append on txt because we're still
maintaining the file extension so if you
don't have if you don't depend on a dot
txt this R and value is just going to be
the file itself so we're just going to
have a number so it's going to be an
unspecified file type so again let's go
ahead and enclose this in an if
statement so what we're doing is we're
checking that the file has been
successfully renamed and then otherwise
we're giving an error message so let's
go ahead and say echo file and then we
can append on file name and then we can
append on has been renamed to and then
we can append on the phone name that has
been renamed to so R and and then its
dot txt so we'll put that in strong and
we'll put that in strong there and then
file file name so it's just basically
basic concatenation of string data with
the inclusion of variables so otherwise
let's go ahead and say error renaming
okay so this is going to happen this
error is going to be produced when we've
already renamed the file name to the
random txt so like I said before the
reason you might want to rename your
files to a random number is to keep them
hidden from users you may have this
random number stored in a database
somewhere so your database knows where
the file is but your users don't so they
won't be able to look at the file
specifically on the server there's many
reasons why you'd want to obviously
rename a file but I'm just giving this
as an example so let's go back and
refresh you can see that we've still got
file to rename dot txt that's going to
file dot PHP so now it says file file to
rename txt has been renamed to four one
nine seven five TX
- okay so we've successfully renamed it
to a random number now let's go back
again and let's refresh and you can see
that that in fact has changed to four
one nine seven five txt so in this
tutorial we've looked excessively at the
unlink and the rename function why they
might be useful and we've just given a
brief example so remember when you put
your functions inside an if statement
what we're doing is we're checking that
this function is successful therefore
we're only giving a confirmation message
when we've successfully let's say
renamed or deleted a file</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
