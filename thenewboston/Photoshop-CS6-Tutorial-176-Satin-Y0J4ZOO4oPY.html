Photoshop cs6 tutorial
I'm your host buddy black Ford and today
we're gonna go over the last layer style
called senton and this effect gives you
like kind of like a sanity look like I
guess and this this layer style can also
be used to add additional depth to make
like realistic looking glass text or
metal text and I'll go ahead and show
you that in the next tutorial we're
gonna combine all the things that we
learned and put them into making a new
type of text so let's go ahead and just
learn about satin for now and then we'll
continue on later so go ahead and draw
out your shape and I'm gonna turn my
effects off right now and we should have
just a plain shape like this so go ahead
and add your satin layer style and the
things you want to start out with
probably for sin in your blend mode are
either a linear burn with a black or
linear dodge with a white color and
that'll give you this nice looking
effect around the outsides we've got our
opacity here which is our transparency
and usually for this effect you want to
have a kind of lower down like in the
30s our angle is going to decide which
way the effect is going to be applied so
just adjust the angle to whatever you
need we've got our distance here which
is going to show how large the effect is
and then our size which is going to show
how it blended in our effect is as well
and then of course our contour here
we've got Gaussian here our Gaussian and
that's a pretty good contour for this
specific layer style and then I could I
could try and change it to other things
let me move this away around linear
looks like this but I like Gaussian
because
has a nice like a curved it's like it's
like a nice fading on fading off kind of
effect you'll want to uncheck invert
because if you have it invert on it
looks like this and that's totally
taking over the color that you wanted to
have before so click uncheck invert so
you just get like the sides and then
anti-alias do you want to have checked
so now we can change this let's check
out with a linear dodge and we'll change
this to a white and this is what it
looks like with white now this is kind
of more of like a feminine look and the
other one was more of a masculine look
so take that into account when you're
making things like this and now you've
got the basic overview of setting and
what it's used for and how it's supposed
to be used so thanks a lot for watching
the tutorial and I look forward to
seeing you in the next tutorial we're
gonna combine a bunch of things to make
some cool look and text so thanks a lot
for watching have a good one everyone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
