tutorial that I'm making for the New
Boston and in this tutorial I'm going to
be showing you how to access selected
items inside of your list view but in
order to do that we're first going have
to take a look at the context menu strip
so first off we're going to look at the
context menu strip and in order to
create one just pure I get on your form
right here and as you can see it's one
of those controls you can't see however
it shows up right here and in case you
don't know a context menu is basically
the menu that comes up when you
right-click on something and we're going
to be using this context menu in order
to access selected items inside of your
list view so basically the first thing
that we're going to have you to be able
to do with selected items is just get
name of item so now in order to use this
context menu strip on our list view
we're just gonna have to have our list
you selected and go over to the
properties panel go down to context menu
strip and choose the context menu strip
we just created so now let me be bug
here and right-click on this control or
list view you should get to context menu
that we created if we have that item get
name of item we haven't programmed I
think Tia that yeah but we'll get to
that in a little bit so what we're going
to do right here is double click on this
so whenever someone clicks on this item
in the context menu something will
happen or whatever code blue button here
will be executed now first thing that
we're going to do is make sure that
there is an actual item selected in the
list view so it's going to create an if
statement in here sang-su one selected
items dot count doesn't equal zero then
we're going to do some point and in
order to access selected items you first
have to type out the name of the
ListView created I just call it list v1
there go on to use a selected items
property and this returns a collection
so we're going to treat it like an array
so just put in here
index of the selected items we want to
access and it will always be zero unless
you're selecting multiple items which
we'll get into in the next tutorial so
what is going to be accessing a single
item and then we're going to do sub
items and this also is a collection so
we're going to put it in here on the
index of the sytem sub item that we want
to access and if you wanted to access
the full name that would be zero you
want to access the age it would be one
if you wanted to access the email
address that would be too if we had more
discontinued on like that the first one
is just always zero though remember that
so we're going to be accessing the name
so we're just going to put a zero in
there and now we have a ListView item
and we created a ListView item and keep
up here so now we can just use on the
properties inside of the ListView item
class such as
text and this will basically just return
the text of the ListView item
so whatever displayed in this full name
cell right here we should get in a
message box so we're just going to
display that match box
so now needy bug here is not ad person's
name Adam Smith the age and stuff
doesn't matter right now all right so
now I'm going to add this person so now
on the right click get name of item we
get Adam Smith but if we don't have an
item selected and click get name of item
nothing happens you don't get an error
because of this if statement right here
so that's pretty much all we're gonna
get into for this tutorial in the next
tutorial we're going to be doing more
things with selected items and things
like that so see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
