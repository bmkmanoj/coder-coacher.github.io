android tutorial for the new boss and
what we're gonna do in this tutorials
kind of link those things together that
we set up and finally get a little bit
of drawing action to happen here so the
first thing I want you guys to do is go
into the might bring back surface clasp
and grab the entire class and cut it so
don't grab your imports or your package
but everything else grab that cut it and
then go into the graphics surface class
and we're gonna paste that within you
know within our graphics class here so
one bracket from the bottom that's where
we're going to paste and so just hit
control V and paste the reason why you
did that is because we set up these x
and y values within this class and we
and you know we said that this whole
class the graphic surface class can use
those values so if we paste that other
class within this class we can still
have access to the X and y which is what
we're gonna want another thing we can do
is actually you know delete this might
bring back surface class just to do
something a little different I'm having
a class within another class is another
example or no reason I did this and then
we go
there we go now what we need to do is
since we defined what our X and Y is
going to be when we click when we click
our view for the most part we want to
kind of draw a bitmap at that location
so we're gonna do that within our canvas
here and after our background after we
draw our background and we're gonna say
if expression mark or exclamation mark
can't I'm sorry X exclamation mark
equals 0 so basically this is checking
if X is not equal to 0 do whatever is
within whatever is below for the most
part we're gonna have two different
things that's looking for so we're gonna
say and and to do with the and statement
you
- and signs and then we say why is not
equal to zero as well because again we
set X and y equal to b0 right at the
beginning and we don't want to draw that
ball right when our applications start
so that's the only time we're going to
draw the ball is if the x and y is not
equal to zero so there we go now we're
gonna set up our bitmap this kind of
review we're gonna call this like test
something like that and import bitmap
and then again from the bitmap factory I
can't spell dots decode resource and
then for again for this one we say get
resources like use the get resource
method the first parameter for the
second parameter it's our actual bitmap
that won't want to decode so we're gonna
say our drawable dot green ball and then
finish off our statement so now that we
have our bitmap set up all we have to do
is draw it to the canvas so we're gonna
say our canvas name and then we're gonna
say draw bitmap and we're gonna use this
one that takes a float for the left and
the top and the paint as well so we're
clicking that and then for a bitmap
we're gonna use the tests that we just
set up here to the left we're going to
use our x value again that's going to be
the information that we get from the
touch that we set up in that method up
above and then for the top it's gonna be
the Y value and for the paint it's gonna
be null now we basically have everything
set up for our little for our first
little you know painting to the canvas
here so I'm just gonna run it make sure
everything works the most part and and
in the next tutorial we're just gonna
find tune everything I'll show you some
of the problems that we're having right
now within the way this application
setup but I just want to show you that
is kind of working for the most part so
we angled our graphics surface surface
class as you can see the ball is not
drawn yet but when we click the ball is
drawn
and again it's being drawn by the
top-left corner of our bitmap so I'll
show you how to fix that in the next
tutorial as well as when we click and
hold and drag that ball is not following
us for the most part so we're gonna get
you know solve that issue which isn't
gonna be a difficult issue at all I just
wanted to show you what it looks like
now so I'll catch you guys in the next
tutorial peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
