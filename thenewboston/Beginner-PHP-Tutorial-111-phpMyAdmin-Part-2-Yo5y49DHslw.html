almost like storing a variable with a
different type of data and you can see
that we've got a really extensive list
of data inside here now through the
tutorials that I'm going to be taking
you through we're not going to be
focusing on lots of different types of
data but there for you to play around
with and match them to your suitability
when you go on and develop further
applications now the ID remember is a
number that auto increments to give each
row a unique value and you'll see how
that works in a moment if you don't
quite understand it yeah so what I'm
going to do is I'm going to choose this
as a type int because it's an integer
you can also have things like tiny int
small and medium and big in so they're
all different types of numeric data
values decimal float double as well so
I'm going to choose int for this you can
even choose something like small int or
medium in however if you expect say a
hundred users on your website this is
fine
however if you're going to be taking
into the millions then you're going to
need to stick with int okay so lengths
values we don't need to worry about
default we don't need to worry about in
this case because ID is going to be
incrementing the two we need to focus on
in this case are the index now remember
I said the primary keys is the field or
the column that's you the unique column
so we have specified unique column this
is the unique number color and now we
can tick auto increment and this allows
us to every time we create a record we
are incrementing this value so we'll
start at 0 by default and then when you
create a record you'll have value 1 &amp;amp; 2
then 3 so you'll never have this will
never equal 0 so let's come a little to
username and password now obviously we
don't want to store user name or
password is just int but what we do want
is varchar' the vital span stands for
variable character so what we can do
here is we must specify a length and a
value whereas in here oh let's just get
rid of that whereas in here we didn't so
a username would typically be say no
more than 30 characters
so we can specify this as 30 password
exactly the same it might be it might be
less than 30 characters but this is
something you're going to have to
specify in your program let's say you
were to create a user or user login
system you'd have to say you know give a
max length to your text field and check
inside PHP if the password specified are
the usernames specified weren't bigger
than 30 because anything bigger than 30
attempting to be written into this table
is going to be cut off if we were to
create a password that was 32 characters
it would end up getting rid of the last
two characters and we'd just end up with
30 so there's nothing else we need to
set for the username and password in
this case we can set default values but
because we already want these always
want these to be specified there's no
need
default just means you can specify a
default value if this isn't if no data
is specified to be written so for
example we could create a field on the
end here called stay logged in and this
might be equal to 1 or 0 depending on
whether the user want to be logged in
but by default it might be 0 if that
makes sense so now what we do is we come
down and we click Save now what you can
see is that we've created now a table
here called users and we've got a number
1 in here to show that we've got one
table so let's click back on this table
so we can have a look inside and you see
we've got the information are outlined
here for us in a table you can see that
ideas underlined which means it's a
primary key and we've got our type here
so you can see int is a map is a length
of 11 so a length of it 11 digits of
integer data this might be considered a
bit too much but like I said if you were
going to go into say millions of users
this is what you specify otherwise you
could have something smaller
you've got a varchar 30 and we didn't
change the password I've just noticed
we've kept this as an int so this is a
good time to show how we're going to
edit some of our values you can check
each value that you want to edit and
perform an operation underneath here so
for example at the moment I just want to
edit password and I'm going to click on
this change thing here so
or pencil so now it's giving me just
this password on its own where I can
change the type of it to varchar' and I
can come down and I can click Save okay
so that's safe know that you can see
it's updated that we've got everything
in here
oh you can also individually edit each
one so you can see that we've got extra
here we've got auto increment now how do
we go about inserting some data into
this table because at the moment we've
got the table but we've got no data now
this would usually be done for PHP if
you were say registering users you'd be
inserting this data from PHP once the
form has been checked for example you'd
certainly use them a password however we
can do it manually from PHP myadmin if
we wish to do so so I'm going to click
on insert and I'm going to scroll along
a bit an ID we can leave blank because
remember this is an also incremented
field we can specify it being left blank
and it will automatically update for us
we've got user name and password so
let's enter a user name and let's enter
a password what we can also do is
specify the amount of rows we want to
insert so we can say restart in citation
with 40 rows for example but for now I'm
just going to insert the data Alex and
password and I'm just going to click go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
