we got all those animations loaded in
and it knows how to use those different
animations and what the names of them
are we need to tell the game exactly
when to use each animation so basically
we created an animation to make the guy
run but we didn't tell the game when we
should use it yet so in order to do this
we need to hop over to the event sheets
and said when a specific event occurs
use this animation simple stuff so the
first thing I'm going to be taking care
of is him running so for this we need to
add an event and also remember that what
we want to look out for is this player
box this player is basically just an
animation but this player box is the
thing that the game is going to
recognize it's pretty much the thing
that the user is going to control but
the player doesn't even know it that's
like behind the scenes though so what we
want to do is we want to check when the
player starts moving this player box so
what we can do is scroll down to
platform on move basically saying when
this box starts moving then what does
that mean that means the player press
left or right started moving so whenever
this happens what animation do we want
to occur well the first thing we want to
do is set the animation to idle to run
so the add action in the animation is of
course the player this box is an anime
is always going to be a box so once they
start moving the box start animating the
player and the animation for this is set
animation here it is right here and
right now you just type in the name of
the animation and if you forgot its idle
to run and of course you just want to
play from the beginning of the animation
so done so basically whenever the box
starts moving set the animation to
standing still to start running now what
we need to do next is say this once this
animation gets over then just use the
running animation so it's going to be
idle idle to run and then once this
animation ends
use the idol or excuse me use the
running animation so the event for this
is of course we want to check if the
player because that's the one the
animation is occurring on and we want to
put information unfinished and for this
we just go ahead and type in vital to
run and hit done
so basically saying when the idle to run
animation is finished what do you want
to do well very simple stuff here we
just want to set the animation of the
player to of course run and hit done and
of course you're going to hit play for
from beginning for pretty much all of
these so the last one we want to say is
this right now we got the user and he
can make his player run but we didn't
tell them okay when the dude stops
running you need to go back to idle
because you know it's well just common
sense so what we need to do now is we
need to add another event and remember
whenever we're tracking the movement of
something we use this player box
whenever we're looking out for
animations we use this but we want to
check is the player did he stop moving
so is the player box and scroll down to
remember it's a platform behavior so on
moved and we want to actually change it
on stopped that's why I meant to do so
basically when this box is stopped or
stopped moving what do you want to do
well all we want to do is set the player
animation to set the animation to idle
done so right now what we did in this
tutorial in I'll show you guys real
quick and it's just kind of look like
he's running which is actually perfect
but once he goes right it looks like
he's just moving into running but
there's actually a idle to run in
between there so you guys from idle to
idle to run to running and then
when he stops he goes back to idle so
that's exactly how we wanted our
behavior tact the only thing now is look
at him to jump it looks really weird
he's like not even moving his feet just
like teleporting up and also once he's
running that looks kind of weird too
like he's doing some weird like a
moonwalk or something so and well that's
another issue right there so right now
we're going to be fixing all this issues
so he doesn't do like the running man or
anything like that so hopefully you guys
understood that tutorial if not remember
to ask me on my forum I'll be happy to
answer it for you guys so thanks for
watching and I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
