tutorial and construct 2 and now that
you got all those images downloaded and
pretty much you know the software is
installed and ready to go then we can go
ahead and double click this little icon
to boot up the software and of course
the first thing that you see is this a
little splash screen at the beginning
and like I said before just click a new
project and create empty new project or
new empty project tomato tomahto so
right now we are a little overwhelmed at
first with all the crap on the screen as
pretty much you are with any software
we're going to open it for the first
time but as you guys are going to see
once I start teaching this interface is
going to become really familiar and
simple and comfortable and also what I'm
going to do is I'm just going to show
you guys the real basics of how to make
a game step by step and I'm going to be
introducing all these settings as we
need them I'm not just going to take a
video in back ok this is the tools panel
and layers and menus and talk about
everything because then you're gonna be
like ok well it's nice but what the heck
do I do with it so let's just go ahead
and get started creating a game and I
think you guys will understand a little
bit easier that way so ok right now our
game is just a white blob on a screen
and if you ever want to test it out just
go ahead and click this button run
layout ok so pretty boring game so far
the first thing that I want to do is add
some kind of background some texture so
what we can do is we if we actually
click right click this in fact we're
going to see a menu that appears and
this is called the layout this big white
part right here this is basically where
your main game is in the gray spot is
the off-screen spot it just gives you a
little buffer space so you know your
entire game you have a little room to
work with
but anyways somewhere in your layout
right click and then press insert new
object now what we want to do now is we
want to insert a tiled background so
scroll down and under the general you're
going to see tiled background now
whenever you select this what it's going
to do
is going to allow you to select the
image and it's not just going to stretch
it over your entire thing it's going to
tile that image so you don't lose any
quality whenever you're playing your
game but anyways right after you select
that you're going to see that your
cursor now turns into little crosshairs
so just go ahead and click it anywhere
because we're going to be changing the
position later on but now once you click
that you can see that you get this thing
right here and this is pretty much
called your texture editor window so
right now we just told the game okay we
want a tiled background the next thing
we have to tell it is well what picture
do you want to use for the tiled
background so in the texture editor
window go ahead and click this folder
right here and actually I don't know if
you guys saw but when you hover over it
it says load an image from your computer
and of course of all the images we
downloaded let's go ahead and use the
background for the background so we
selected and pretty much told construct
to okay we want to use this image and
actually if we just close out of this
right now we don't have to press Save or
anything it just automatically loads
that image so now another thing you want
to do is make sure that you have the
image selected because once it's
selected we can change all of the
properties in it including position if
it's not selected for example just click
on that white right here and it's going
to see that a you deselected it you're
going to see that all the properties are
changed to the layout when you select it
again the properties change so just
remember that whenever you're working
with a bunch of objects the one that you
have selected are the properties that
are going to appear right here and this
thing on the left hand side is called
the properties panel simple enough so
the first thing that I want to do is I
want to set the position of this and we
can do it manually by you know just
trying to get it in that corner right
there but there's an easier way once
it's selected go to this little position
property and change it to zero comma
space zero now these are the X&amp;amp;Y
coordinates and whenever you hit enter
it's going to set
x and y 2 0 0 pretty much means put this
in the very top left of our game so the
next thing that we want to do since it's
in the top left is we want to set the
size of it now a good thing that we can
do is we can see that how big should
this be well I'm not sure probably the
size of the layout which is the game
itself but we don't know how big the
layout is itself so how do we know how
big to make the texture or the
background well a cool way that you can
get the and actually it's not that cool
but it's a really easy way that you can
get the size of your layout is just to
left-click somewhere on your layout and
the layout size is right here so mine is
1708 by 960 now if you copy this and
what you can do is whenever you click on
texture and get the texture properties
you can change the size from 512 to 512
paste that out paste that in right there
and press Enter now the size of this is
1708 by 960 and also take note of the
fact that it didn't just stretch it out
like you would in Photoshop or something
it tiled it to match that size so now if
you scroll down you can see that your
background now matches the size of your
layout now another cool thing that I
want to teach you guys is how to move
around your your game so if you hold
ctrl on your keyboard and scroll out
with your mouse wheel that's going to
scroll out so instead of just you know
scrolling up and down like that it's a
little bit easier and also if you hold
the middle mouse button down and drag
you can pan around so again that's
easier for me that's what I do all the
time instead of you know using these
scroll bars you know I got time to use
scroll bars and also if you want to
reset back to the zoom level of 100 hold
down ctrl on your keyboard and press 0
so if you ever you know accidentally
scroll out too far scrolling too far
again that's ctrl + 0 and it's going to
take you back to basic
so now pan 2 pretty much where you start
at the top left corner and once you have
that texture background on what I want
to do now is I want to show you guys how
to create another layer so we can
organize our game a little bit better so
we got the background down it's good to
go
now let's do something a little bit
cooler so that's where we're going to be
doing in the next video and I'll see you
then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
