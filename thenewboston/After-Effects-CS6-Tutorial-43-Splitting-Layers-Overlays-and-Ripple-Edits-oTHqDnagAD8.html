name is buddy Blackford and this is
another After Effects cs6 tutorial this
time we're going to be talking about how
to split your lair and why you want to
do it and also overlays and ripple edits
since we're doing effects and different
special like cool-looking things I saw
this video today on a bombs world and I
just wanted to show you like a little
bit of it because it's the best special
effects I've ever seen in my life so
maybe you've seen this one before but
we'll give it a little play
yeah
now this was what a purpose
so if you want to check out the rest
that video I mean you saw the link
earlier you can go to that video special
effects done right is hilarious I
thought maybe laughs there are some
other parts where you like punched a
t-rex and stuff like that so I mean that
made me that made my morning a little
more bearable so let's get over to
sequencing are not sequencing splitting
layers and what you what you do for that
is if you're like moving across an
object and you want it to go in front
first and then you want it to go behind
after you can split your layer and move
the move the layers so that the second
part of the layer will go behind so I'll
show you what I mean real quick so a
little bit bit better at showing than
explaining I guess on this one so I have
some position keyframes that I made up
here where it comes over to the side
stops and then it'll come back so when
it gets over here I want to split it so
you go up here and to edit and you come
down to split layer and the hotkey is
control shift D alright now that split
we can move this little squish thing in
between and it'll move the layers will
move watch this see it moves behind and
then it moves forward in front so that's
in D that's an easy way to to do that
without having to mask anything out and
since it's transparent the squish is
transparent you can see the tuna go
behind it even through his mouth and
everything so if you just if you if you
want them to be in front first bring
this layer up above and then bring this
other layer below so now it'll go in
front first and then go behind after
makes sense you do have the option of
telling after-effects where you want
your split layers to go so it's in your
preferences so if you come down to edit
preferences and then go to general it's
there's a something about split layers
in here somewhere
I'm just if I can find it here it is
right here
create split layers above original layer
if you uncheck that it'll create it
below the original layer so it's up to
you which way I mean to me it doesn't
matter it I'll have to move them if I
want to switch it the other way anyway
so it's up to you whatever your
preference is there that's why the call
preference is obviously the next thing I
want to talk about is ripple edits and
overlays and I'll show you what that
means real quick you come if you double
click on your video and I'll do all X
out of that if you double click on a
video it'll bring up the footage panel
you can see it says footage right there
if that's what you want to double click
it in the in the project panel over here
that way you don't have to bring it into
your layers panel and then you can edit
your in and out points if you would like
and there's two buttons right here this
one says ripple insert/edit and this one
is overlay edit now what it does is it
let me move my current time indicator or
somewhere real quick and I'll move these
layers out it's going to insert the
footage at where your current time
indicator is
the overlay will put the footage right
on top and not affect anything layers
below it but the ripple edit is going to
split layers and add it in between and
like create here I'll show you I'll show
you by hitting the ripple edit as you
can see it pushed it split the squish
layer in half and insert it in between
and since the tunas were already split
it pushed the dis tuna that was after it
pushed it further out so I'll do that
again for you so you can see now it's
got this spate this tuna has this much
space in between it now let's go back
into the footage panel up there add the
ripple insert edit and then watch the
layers it just inserts it in-between and
splits the letters below it so I mean
that's good if you want to just switch
to the next footage or whatever
now the overlay is a little different
it'll just put it right on top so I'll
click on this and it just adds it right
to the top where your current time
indicator is that way you can just throw
things in there really quick and I mean
you would want to use this if you were
if you were trimming down like your in
and out points on your footage so I mean
you hit these buttons down here to trim
the in and out points now if I just add
it in there you go it adds it in already
trimmed in everything so that's that's
going to be it for this tutorial I hope
you guys learn something and you can use
it on whatever you're doing next and
I'll see you guys in the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
