29th tutorial in in this tutorial I'm
going to be talking about the different
kinds of formulas structural formula and
molecular formula and why you can't just
use them interchangeably that you
actually need to use structural formulas
not most of the time but whenever you
want to specify really clearly what it
is you're looking for so what the heck
am I talking about well let me go ahead
and explain with an awesome example say
you were the head of some super I don't
know some awesome chemistry lab and you
were working on it really doesn't matter
what you're working on to be honest but
for the sake of this example say you
were working on the next type of biofuel
that's going to be super clean super
easy and super cheap so you say ok you
turn to your two assistants and tell
them that you need this compound c2h6o
and they say ok Bucky we'll go ahead and
we'll make that for you right away so
one of your assistants brings back this
see actually I won't go ahead I'll just
go ahead and draw it before because if I
try to talk when I'm drawing I'm going
to mess it up so remember the formula is
the same the only instructions you gave
them is c2h6o so they bring back
something like this bang bang bang bang
bang bang so you go ahead and you make
sure it's alright okay do we have six
hydrogen's yep do we have two carbons
and one oxygen okay we are good to go
so then your other assistant brings back
something like this I mean I probably
should have drew these before I started
my tutorials but I am way too lazy to
draw and then teach got a compound that
crap do both at the same time so let me
go ahead and finish her on this and you
guys can just wait and watch patiently
make sure I got all my bonds so then you
say okay let me take a look at this now
okay got two carbons and then the oxygen
and
six okay six hydrogens but what the heck
this is totally a different compound
than this actually to be honest and I'm
not just making this up this right here
is a type of alcohol that you find in
tequila and this is it's ether that they
use in like some industrial products so
this is definitely toxic if you drink
this right over here but anyways they
both followed your instructions but they
came back with two totally different
compounds so whenever you have an atom
that's bonded differently it can make
two or more completely different
compounds and whenever this has happened
or excuse me whenever this happens it's
called
an isomer so just remember that term
because it's actually pretty important
an isomer is a compound with the same
exact molecular formula but it's
basically two different structures so in
order to be 100% clear you should have
gave them the structural formula instead
of the molecular formula again these
things right here I'll call the
structural formulas pretty much how the
odd atoms are bonded together and this
right here is called the molecular
formula pretty much how much of each
atom you want in there so that's
difference between a molecular formula
which is this thing right here in the
structural formula down here and why
it's better to use structural formulas
most of the time so that is the basis
for this tutorial in the next tutorial I
don't even know actually I'm going to be
covering electronegativity I think and
it's going to be a blast
so thank you guys for watching don't
forget subscribe and I will see you guys
later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
