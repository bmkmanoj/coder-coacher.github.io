with another video tutorial for the new
Boston we're going to be looking at the
stop animation in effect in jQuery now I
guess you wouldn't really call it an
actual effect but what the stop function
does is stops an animation from you know
from currently well it will stop an
animation as it is happening so what
we're going to do is we're going to go
ahead and create an image and a button
so the button is going to toggle the
image sliding up and down but we're also
going to include another button which
will stop the animation while it's
happening so for example if the image
has slid down halfway we can use the
stop button to stop the animation so
let's go ahead and create two paragraphs
in the first one is going to be our
button so we have button value of start
we'll also give this an ID as well let's
say ID equals start we can now create
another button quite similarly but this
time it's going to be to stop the
animation so the type is button the
value is stopped and we can give this an
ID as well and that's going to be
stopped so now that we've done that
let's go ahead and preview this on our
page we have a start button and a stop
button so let's go down and include the
image that we want to toggle so image a
source and that is Tartan jpg the alt
can just be tartan and we need to give
an ID to the paragraph now in the last
tutorial when we looked at the slide
effect which I'm going to be using in
this tutorial as well we noted that we
can't actually use the slide effect for
an image itself we have to use it in
something that surrounds it and in this
case that's a paragraph so I'm going to
give this paragraph an ID of image
because we know that there's an image
inside of it so this is what it looks
like in the browser when we click start
the animation is going to take place
we're gonna toggle this using the slides
toggle the function the image is going
to slide up or down depending on where
whereabouts it is at you know at the
current state either hidden or shown and
then stop is gonna stop this animation
in his tracks so let's go ahead and
create a event handler for this start so
inside of our effects jjs file which
we've included in our page we need to go
ahead and create an event handler for
this button so start this is we're gonna
say dot click so when the user has
clicked we execute code within a block
in this function here so we've got our
function as normal and our block of code
and inside here we want to slide toggle
so we reference the image remember the
image paragraph we created and we use
the slide toggle function to do this and
I'm gonna set a time of let's just give
us a chance to click on the button so 3
seconds so when we click on this start
button you can see that the image slowly
shuts actually we'll give it five so
when we click on start it takes 5
seconds from the bottom to the top and
then when we click start again it will
open back out and slide back down so
that's the slide toggle function now
stop is going to call a stop to the
current animation path so what we want
to do is we want to create another
callback function
sorry another event handler for the stop
button so let's say hash stop click so
essentially when the stop button is
clicked remember we called the stop
button stop just here when this is
clicked we create a functional we
execute a function and this is
essentially going to reference image and
then we just say dot stop so now that
we've called dot stop on this while this
slide toggle effect is taking place we
can then click the stop button to stop
the
effect let's go back to our browser and
click start now that's loading or that's
sliding up let's slide it back down
again and this time we're gonna press
stop before it gets to the end so we
press stop and you see that the
animation has stopped and when we press
start it will toggle it because it
hasn't got to the end of the animation
with regards to resuming an animation
like I showed you earlier we start the
animation and then we can stop it at a
particular point you'll see that we have
this problem now the reason for this is
that jQuery doesn't actually have a
resume functionality however there are a
variety of plugins that will allow you
to do this so while we can't do it with
the original jQuery library we can get
extended plugins that will allow us to
do this so for now what we've looked at
is using the slider toggle function as
we did in previous tutorials but
actually using stop to stop any
animation not just this type while it's
being carried out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
