another afternoon and this one is for an
app called crush the castle you can see
right here called a ctc on your a little
emblem but I was called crush crush the
castle because when I was growing up I
called cinnamon toast crunch ctc so
anyway it's just a nice little tidbit in
case you guys want to know so here it is
right here starts out takes a little
time to load but uh it's worth it trust
me and what you can do is you can either
start a new game or continue I want to
continue my game because I mean you have
no reason to start again so go ahead and
click continue and go ahead and click
what continent you want to tech and I'm
going to go ahead and I can cleave out
these other ones so I'm going to go
ahead and click stone me whatever was
called and I already crush this castle
and it's the same all over so you know
you'll see me so go ahead and pick a
castle to crush and go have me pick
attack and the point of the game is that
pretty much kill everyone at this castle
and how you do this is first of all you
pick your weapon right here I'm going to
go with this three dark and stoner right
here what I already have because this is
a these are pretty much stones that blow
up when they hit something so they're
already loaded and what you do is you
press once to get a swing and press
another time to release it so go ahead
and right there and see how I do so not
bad so that didn't even kill anyone so
let's just do it in a mic it no that was
even worse so what you pretty much do is
just do this over and over and one more
time I'm bound and kill someone this
time and let's see there we go there's a
couple people dead and so now I'm gonna
have one guy to living right down there
he's going to be kind of hard to get to
but this is your shot count right here
and what you do is whenever you crush
your castle it depends on how many times
or how many boats you have to use or
shots and that's what kind of on the
metal you get so if I crush you in four
shots I guess over five I get browns
into i already had like four shot so i
can't get the gold now and this tells
you how many people you killed and again
since i killed four people in there that
last one standing there it says four out
of five color right there so I'm going
to go ahead and that's basically what
you do you just go to different area two
different area and as you go on with you
there we go and as you are go on and on
through the game the castle to get more
complex and more complex so that's
pretty much it and from there you can
pretty much see if you like it or not
and i'm going to go ahead and give this
game at eight out of ten first of all
because it's pretty fun and second of
all because it's only 99 cents so i
highly recommend it so that's it for
