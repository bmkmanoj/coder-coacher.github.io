well might as well start going I don't
wanna go east go check one back yep East
this is going to be the long and
treacherous but the good news is I got
lots of batteries
lots of tapes and he's cocky so uh I got
a last stuff here for at least a couple
of weeks teach him a lesson take some of
that money is that's wrong thank you and
this is gonna be awesome all right
all right well we've been walking for I
don't know hour two hours
something maybe more maybe less but it
is hot out here buggy I can't get a boy
for me
and I'm I got to be a couple miles out
here for five miles probably at least no
idea where I am just kept trying to go
east hopefully I'll be able to get out
of here when I want to leave but I don't
know yeah I think I'm gonna try and find
a spot to try and set up some sort of
shelter I don't know if I'm gonna want
to stay here because I don't know if
there's any water
I don't even seen one stream yet at all
well if there's water or anything like
that so Pryor just for the night looks
kind of late already
it looks like it might rain actually
it'd be a great first night for me but
I'll set this up and then I'll start
building the shelter and I'll turn it
back on while I'm building it probably
give you a little insight on it all
right you go find a spot that I'm gonna
try and set up looks good I mean I've
seen quite a few survival shows but when
it comes to actually picking a spot out
I'm not probably the best person but I
got coverage opah buff from most of the
rain so I don't really have to worry
about doing too much like a roofing or
anything like that and there's like a
little high spot right here which
probably where I'll set it up and I'll
put down some bedding or something so
don't get attacked by bugs and stuff and
then maybe if I have time I'll try and
start some sort of fire there's a little
spot right there where I can make one so
uh you're ready for your show
all right well I decided that I'm gonna
put like a kind of a top strut frame up
here and then tie it down to these trees
with my rope
make sure it's held in place it's not
right now but I got it here for now and
then I'm just gonna lay a bunch of
branches like this so I'm kind of
protected from that side and I have a
roof and I'll probably lay some pine
needles or whatever and then I'll have
this I'll put some bedding down right
here then maybe if I can figure it out
I'll start a fire right at the front
entrance well that will have heat and
everything and I'll have like a little
backdoor case and animal attacks me or
something like that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
