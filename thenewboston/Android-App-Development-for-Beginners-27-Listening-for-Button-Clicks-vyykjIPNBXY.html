done designing everything what we can do
is we can start adding the brains to our
program now before you get started with
any of that you guys need to follow
these rules first rule a fragment Club
fragments do not talk directly to one
another
second rule fragment Club fragments do
not talk directly to one another okay
you got that these fragments are never
going to communicate directly to one
another so what's going to happen is
since we need to take this text that the
user types in and apply it to this
fragment they need some sort of medium
someone to go through in that medium is
the main activity so what's going to
happen whenever the user types in text
and presses this button this is going to
say hey yo activity the user just
clicked my bun and the activity is going
to say okay let me get that text cool
cool got it hey yo
yeah I'm activity yeah bottom fragment
I'm going to need you to change your
text to whatever I tell you to so that's
pretty much what's going to happen this
fragment or this button rather is going
to wait to be clicked and when it gets
click it's going to tell the activity
about it and then the activity is going
to tell this fragment about it so again
remember those rules fragments are never
ever allowed to talk directly to one
another sweet so let's go ahead and
first set up the listener for this
button click so in top section fragment
right there let's go ahead and import
three more things of course we need to
import import Android dot F dot activity
and this is just so I can talk to that
main activity now the next thing we need
to do is just import enjoyed
widget dot button because remember it
has a button right there and we also
need an import package for these edit
text fields because it has edit text
fields simple stuff so import Android
widgets dot edit text alright looking
good
so of course before you actually start
adding the brain so anything we just
need to get a reference to all of this
stuff so top text input bomb text input
and the button so I'm going to make a
private variable static edit text and
that first one actually let me name my
variable is the same ISO top text input
and bottom text input so top text input
I'm just going to copy this because I am
lazy and bottom text input alright
pretty sweet very nice very nice
alright so now on crave you and the
reason that I'm going to stick it in
here is because this gets called as soon
is pretty much this view is created as
soon as this fragment is created so of
course that's what I'm going to assign
all the variables because you know it's
like the perfect time to so for this top
text input just set this equal to we're
going to cast it into edit text and we
done this like a million times by now
view fine by ID in the ID of this is our
dot I be top text input and it's
probably just faster if I just
edit text you find the ID r dot e dot
bottom takes the input where you wet
there you are in the last thing we need
to do is actually get a reference to the
button so bun I'll just name it what did
I name it I just name the button all
right so this equals of course it's
going to be typecast it into a lot in
few dots find by ID
R Teddy dhaba in both local buppa buppa
buppa in pet redundant button button
button in art so now we got a reference
to everything pretty boring nothing
really to explain there all right so
what we need to do now is we need to set
up a listener on that button so this
button is pretty much it's going to be
chilling there waiting for something to
happen
so for button me and my stupid lines
again and I actually want to give myself
a little bit more room I like when I can
like scroll around for some reason let
make sure you guys can see that source
code in case you are copying it so
button what I'm going to do is I'm going
to set on click listener and again we
did this in last couple tutorials so
what we need to do is we need to put new
view dot on click listener and the only
method that we need to have here is
public void on click pass in that view
alright so inside this method is
essentially where you write what do we
want to happen when the button gets
clicked well instead of jamming up
inside here with a bunch of code what
I'm going to do is I'm going to create a
new method called button clicked and I'm
just going to pass through that view V
so that way if we go outside this on
create view then I can make public void
button clicked and of course it takes
that view parameter that we just passed
through so essentially any code that
gets called whenever this button gets
clicked I can just type in here and it's
a little bit neater
I'm just tighten that up for now because
we're actually going to be filling this
in in just a bit</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
