thirty fourth c-sharp tutorial that I'm
making for the new Boston and in this
tutorial we're in continue working on
our button so the first thing that we're
gonna want to do is have text on our
bottom because right now this button
could do anything and it doesn't need to
pick a button anyways so in order to add
text lip on we're just going to go over
to our cotton designer and drag a label
onto our button now if we were to just
leave it like this and then the label
would always be in this location on the
button and not the center it would be in
the same point or at the same point so
on a button this size it's fine but if
we had a button much larger like this
then it's just gonna be up there in
upper left hand corner so we're gonna
have to tell the c-sharp compiler that
we always wanted to be in the middle so
what we're gonna have to do is go over
to the on paint method and tell the
c-sharp compiler where we want the label
so we're going to say the label 1 dot
equals a new point and then we're gonna
have the X location of the button to be
on the width of the entire button
divided by 2 so that would be the center
upper width so this divided by 2 and
then same thing for the heights or
inside this dot height divided by 2 and
this should draw the label approximately
in the center of the button so now I'm
bug and build the solution you can see
that it's a bit off and that's because
it is actually drawing it at the center
of the button
however the label is drawn from the
upper left hand corner of the label so
we're just have to tweak things a little
bit so it's actually drawn in the center
or it looks like it's drawn in the
center so what we're going to do is
we're going to subtract this by the the
width of the label so it's a label 1 dot
width and then we're just gonna subtract
it from whatever it gets from this and
same thing for the height so this should
just make things a little bit better
- fight okay so now let me go back here
and build the solution you see now it's
on the other side so now what we're
going to do is basically just divide
this by to define the middle of that as
well so we're going to say label one
width divided by two and same thing for
the height so now it should be drawn in
the center and now it should appear as
though it's drawing the center so it
looks just much better now go back here
and build yep perfect in the exact
center all right so right now we cannot
change the text of this there's no way
to change it so what we're gonna do is
we're gonna set up a property in our in
my button class and this will work just
like a property in any other class just
set up a property and we're gonna make
it public so that the user can change it
we're going to study or have it be a
string so it's the text so we need to be
a string and we're just going to name
this property I guess button and then
we're just gonna have it get legal ones
text all right service and have it
returned they belong to text and then
for the second we're just gonna set
legal ones text to whatever the value
that the user set the property yes it'll
stay go on text equals value all right
so now let me go over here and click
build now I'm gonna go over to the
properties panel you can see you have a
property in the property panel called
button text so we can just set it right
over here from the properties panel so
just make it a Adams button there we go
so now we need you bug here we still
have that text perfect so that's pretty
much it for this tutorial so see you
guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
