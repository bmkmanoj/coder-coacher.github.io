another Photoshop cs6 tutorial
I'm your host buddy Blackford and today
we're gonna go over managing your
presets and your libraries with the
preset manager so we're gonna be able to
manage things like brushes swatches
gradients styles patterns contours
custom shapes and preset tools and you
can find that list down up here in the
preset manager so what we're gonna do is
come over here to edit and we're gonna
go to presets and preset manager and you
can see those different things here that
I was just talking about so things will
we'll just start off with brushes
because that's pretty easy to learn
about so I'm just gonna X out of this
real quick I just wanted to show you the
different things that you could manage
and I have presets for so I'm gonna X
out of this and what you need to first
do is download some presets off the
internet or possibly if you already know
how to create your own so I have
downloaded some and I have them in one
of my folders already and I'll bring it
up over here on my other opposite screen
looking for them right now here we go
know I've got a bunch of photoshop
brushes already that I downloaded from I
actually bought these in a pack and I
downloaded like them all into like one
area called Photoshop brushes and you're
gonna be if you use Photoshop a lot
you're probably gonna have a bunch of
folders make sure you keep them in a
nice order here so I've got brushes
presets shapes and that's what I have
now and then I also have my like After
Effects stuff and opposite are in
separate folders because these are what
I used mostly right now so we're gonna
go back into my Photoshop brushes tool
and let me just open it up and show you
what a file looks like so we'll go to
a brick wall now we got a set here and
it's in an ABR format so that is the
extension for a Photoshop preset now I'm
gonna X out of here and we're gonna use
this to navigate actually gonna bring
this over here so I can just look at it
I don't know why I would want to but
let's start by checking out our brushes
and the brush tool right here so click
on this one with the paintbrush and if
it's not hold it down here it could be
the pencil tool the color replacement or
the mixer brush tool so get on the brush
tool come up here to the top and click
on this down arrow to open your preset
picker now there's already gonna be some
brushes here click on this and actually
click on any brush and you'll be able to
do something with it in your manager
here so I've got these I've got a
snowflake there they make it a little
bit bigger and that way you can like
paste snowflakes if you really wanted to
that will keep a decent size I want to
change out the color so we can see this
a little better I'll make it black now
you can actually see what the heck's
going on
we've got that they're going on now we
need to learn how to insert or install
the presets that we have loaded so let's
go to load click on this little tool
icon right here this little gear icon
it'll bring up our different presets and
everything like that our different
options for our presets come down here
to load brushes and move to your brushes
folder or wherever you have them stored
and then we'll come down here to brick
wall brushes and I'll click on this one
and hit load and it'll load them down at
the bottom so now I have my different
brick wall brushes here so that's what
then does so now we have these here at
the bottom but they're mixed up here
with a bunch of these different other
brushes that we don't want so we can go
in and we can go in and click on the
brushes that we don't want you can hold
shift to click on several of them at
once actually not in this one he can't
so well you can delete them one by one
in this area right here so if you come
up to here you can go to delete brush
and it'll get rid of it out of this area
it doesn't delete it off your computer
it just deletes it off of the area here
and if we want to delete multiple
brushes we go to edit and we're going to
go back to that preset manager so
presets preset manager and it shows the
brushes that we have currently selected
and our preset manager you can hold
shift to select a few of them and just
go to delete and we just have our pretty
much we just have our bricks brushes now
I hit done if I go back up to look up
here all I have is the brick brushes to
select from so that's kind of sweet</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
