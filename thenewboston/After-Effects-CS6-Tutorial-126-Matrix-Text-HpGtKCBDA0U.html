Blackford here within our cs6 tutorial
and today I want to show you a cool
little effect you can use the wiggly
selector for which is like kind of like
a hacking or decoding or spy movie type
effect where the text is all jumbled up
and we're trying to figure out and
decode what it is and eventually it
shows it reveals what you're talking or
what the actual text you want to show is
so I'll play a ramp review over real
quick and show you what it looks like or
whatever is going on with the ramp
review oh here we go so this kind of
effect
I should probably extend it a little
more at the end but basically the the
letters just jumbled up and then letter
by letter we figure out what's going on
and what's being revealed and it comes
out to be what we wanted to say so I'll
show you how to make that real quick
it's not that hard
and what's let's go so I'll turn this
off and we can start writing a new set
of text here spied in a movie or
something like that
well that makes any sense but we'll just
make this a little bigger so ever you
can see it better and what the first
thing we're going to do is twirl down
into our text settings we don't need
this transform open we're going to click
on the animate button here we're going
to go to character offset and what we're
going to do is we're going to change
this is the random seed for the
character offset down here we're going
to change that to anything except for
zero so it doesn't matter what it is
I'll just put 51 for anything so we've
got that change right there we're going
to also add another one we're going to
come to this Add button right here and
we're going to add selector Wiggly this
is our Wiggly selector let's twirl that
down and we've got our wiggle and
everything now so right you can see that
this is going to make this the letter
shuffle and everything like that we've
got that and you can adjust these any
way you want the there is I made a
tutorial on how to use the wiggly
selector and all these different
properties if you want to check that out
it's a probably like one or two
tutorials back so just go ahead and
check that out so we just needed to add
that let's go to our range selector and
we're going to edit the offset here so
let's go in and let it do a little
Wiggly thing here for a little while and
then set a keyframe and then at the end
here we'll set it to 100 as you go
through on your offset it's going to
reveal a number Earl letter-by-letter
what we want to get revealed now you can
also set this range selector to
based on words so that it'll go word by
word instead of a letter by letter but
that's up to you so that's how to do
that let's do a ramp review
so that's the basic of that it's really
easy actually now you may see other
people on YouTube trying to put in like
scripts and expressions and everything
like that you don't need to use that you
can just do obviously do it the way you
showed you and you don't even have to
use scripting so that's pretty much for
people who don't really know how to use
the animators correctly so thanks for
watching this quick tip and now you know
how to create one of those hacking
sequences there so I look forward to
seeing you guys in the next tutorial and
I'll try to make some cool that we can
work on so see you guys later have a
good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
