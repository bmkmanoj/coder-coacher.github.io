your second part of my starcraft 2
gameplay video and right off the bat you
can see that flying panda which was the
Zerg player aren't our team has either
been like booted or just decided to
leave go get some coffee or something
but anyways the worst possible timing
because he is about to go in for a
massive attack and now you can see that
there aren't other Army has scouted him
saw that big yellow wave just rushing
toward their teammates building so it
looks like they're not going to be able
to get there in time baby busting
through that wall these Earthlings
rushing and they see that dark templar
our enemies dark templar just slicing
through them looks like those everyone's
are going to be able to hit off a bunch
of those marines and also yeah there
looks like
be able to pick up that Dark Templar and
now Dom coming in trying to take out
that Templar building but I don't know
if he's going to be able to pick it off
oh that would be great if he was but he
is there's just too many stalkers too
many rooms and also Marauders those void
rays in those zerglings really had no
chance there but they did do a lot of
damage did look like they busted up one
of their supply depots in their barracks
so overall I'll say that was quite the
success so anyways now that their
teammates are done being offended
they're going to go back to their own
base get ready for a push or maybe just
go back for some defense anyways here is
me in the person that I'm going to be
pushing out with gesture he got a nice
mix of marines and marauders and also
looked like he had a medevac in some
Ravens or something I see one Raven
medevac and pretty much a nice mix of
marines and marauders and I am have two
Colossus right now some stalkers and
immortals so we were looking good we're
going to be moving in soon but I just
want to get everything cute up make sure
I don't waste any resources right now
pump out some more Colossus and I'll
tell you why since they have a bunch of
level 1 units whenever we go in there
usually going to be a clump together
like you see they are right there so
those Colossus now that they have that
area attack is going to be really useful
in picking all of them off and one fell
sweep so those stalkers are also in
trouble and now that I have our mortal
since immortals pretty much are the best
thing that you can have against stalkers
so we are looking pretty good right now
even though we lost those zerglings and
couple void rays earlier on and now
here's a sign to my teammate you want to
push out and he says yes of course he
wants to see some action so we are going
to be ready soon making sure that my
expansion has enough probes queued up to
keep them busy for a while so let me
group this Colossus and now you're about
to see
the biggest battle of the game so there
is their forces ready to be destroyed
and here's our forces moving in see what
they got and now here is coming off of
the ramp not the best idea probably want
to stay on higher ground but anyways
he's just like los estoy seguro of them
they are all grouped together which is
just terrible for them you don't want to
be grouped together run every face
classes and now the second wave comes in
of dark blue team and now
again all grouped together just marine
the Marauders this Colossus is work
sergeant drawing them and they really
never even have a change so there you go
in about 10 seconds all of their armies
just got wiped out just like that and
you see that all of our armies are still
very much intact and now it's pretty
much just destroyed buildings they do
however have some of those these things
which are not that great against
immortals since immortals can't take any
more than 10 damage usually those
Colossus are just they just our army is
just the sheer size of it is too much
for any seasoning to handle so as you
can see it's not pretty much destroyed
buildings and check this out while we
were doing on that Dom was building a
massive amount of Boyd right so he's
ready to go in
and we're just keeping these people busy
and so I sink through all of their
sliding cook slightly bows what the heck
slide people supply depots or refineries
pretty much taking out this entire base
while Dom moves into the top base with
all his void rays and now you see he
built up a bunch of zerglings and
banelings as well so he probably wants
to move those in first to take out any
of the ground units that might be
harmful to the forgery so let's see if
Dom dude does that in oh my look at this
day off five gateways to stargates this
guy had quite the base but it's about to
get all wiped out right now so let's go
ahead and see Dom is waiting there um
maybe he's waiting some for tomorrow boy
to raise or waiting for a circle and
push but looks like dark blue is trying
to apply their command center over but
oh it is not going to be enough let's
see those bailing just
going up the blow all those tier 1 and
the building and those certain ones are
just going to kick off pretty much all
the ground forces right there
and adoption moving as Reuters from
behind right now try to kick off that
nexus in here he comes as you can see
these probes those pros never even stood
a chance this nexus is going to get
destroyed those void rays are going to
be all charged up and let's take a look
at these voids as you see you got some
hell even when you can't even attack air
and those stalkers but and you got one
Thor which is good for them but these
water rates are fully charged there's
about eight thousand of them look how
quick this door is going to disappear in
about three seconds so that I just
discouraged as many as you can see they
all leave the game they're depressed
they're probably going to go I don't
even want to say but they're probably
going to go cry themselves to sleep
tonight so there you have it there is my
first starcraft thanks to DOM is avoid
arrays and also my teammate with his
massive Marauder so anyways there you
guys have it I know I made a bunch of
mistakes so if you guys can see anything
that I can improve on please let me know
and I'll try to improve and I try to
also be posting more of those videos in
future so I noticed thank you guys for
watching don't forget subscribe and I'll
see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
