nmap video and in this tutorial I'm
going to show you how to scan multiple
targets at once so I actually have this
app downloaded on my phone called fing f
ing and it's pretty cool app you just
click on it and it shows you all the
devices on your home network and I don't
know if they have it for iOS but I have
an Android phone so I know that a couple
devices that are already on my network
in the IP address so say that I wanted
to scan them but I didn't feel like
running through separate commands just
want to scan them all at once so what I
can do is I can write nmap and my
network is 192.168.0.0 but the first
device is 0.9 let me see if I could do
this the lazy way so let me copy that so
that's one device another device I know
the IP address is 0 to 17 and the last
one is 0.23 now again like I said since
you actually need to have permission to
scan devices these are all just devices
on my home network I think one is my
tablet and one's my iMac or something
but these can be the IP addresses of
different websites different servers
routers whatever you want so I'm just
going to hit enter and what this is
going to do is it's going to be the same
thing that we saw before look for all
pretty much look at these devices and
see what ports are open what services
are running but it's going to do it all
at once
pretty sweet and alrighty mates there
you go so after just a few minutes you
see some basic information about these
devices again nothing too exciting
because you know these are just personal
electronics and I don't have any home
servers in that list but let's say that
you actually wanted to scan the entire
range of IP addresses for all of the
devices on my network well you have a
couple different options so if you just
do nmap 192.168.0.1 then i know that all
of the vices on my network I only have
like five of them so they're going to
follow an arranged to like 1 to 30 so
what this actually means is scan all of
the devices 192.168.0.1 to 192.168
0:30 so this is just a quick little
shorthand way of doing that and that's
actually going to take a few minutes so
I don't actually want to do I just want
to show you guys the syntax of it now if
you actually want to scan an entire
subnet and by that I mean all devices
from 0 to 255 then you can either just
write 0 255 or you can just write an
asterisks so above the 8 on your
keyboard that star now again this is
going to take like 10 minutes if I do
that so I'm not going to waste your time
however that is how you do that and let
me move over to my desktop because I
want to show you guys something else now
something really useful you can do is
you can actually make a file an entirely
separate text file and you can have a
list of IP addresses in it now once you
have a list of IP addresses you can use
that list to scan instead of typing them
out all in manually so let me just make
a file called like a targets that text
and leave pad let's go ahead and then
for you so leave pad targets dot txt all
right let me minimize this so you guys
can see and let me just add two real
quick so I'm just going to add my server
which is 54 point 186 250 79 and what
was one of the ones we scan already like
one on the Quran 168 0.17 so this is my
webserver further New Boston com and
this is just one of the devices oh no
it's like a tablet or something inside
my house but this can be a list of
anything you want so I'm just going to
save that closeouts clear and just make
sure all right so I displayed it and
look at this so we have a file and the
only thing it has is two IP addresses in
here and it can have as many as you want
so once you have a file and you want to
scan it you're right nmap - lowercase I
capital L and this little flag and means
input list or it technically means input
list but I always read it as import from
just since I don't know makes more sense
to me targets that text so we're going
to scan from a file and this flag just
means import all of those IP addresses
and hit enter so now it basically does
the same thing as before so there you go
so that's it ladies and gentlemen is how
you use a separate text file of IP
addresses and also how you can scan
multiple targets at once I will see you
guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
