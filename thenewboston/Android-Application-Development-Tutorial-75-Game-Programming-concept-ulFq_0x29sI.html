tutorial for the new boss and again with
me Travis
what we're gonna do with in this
tutorial II do some simple animation to
get that ball kind of shooting in the
direction that we want and obviously if
you guys have done Java programming
before or any kind of game programming
you're probably gonna look at these net
this tutorial in the next one would be
like what is he doing this it is because
what I'm gonna do is probably terrible
programming but it's I'm trying to teach
you guys the concepts and what you guys
need to learn for this obviously I'm
probably going to create some kind of a
game development series on my on my on
my channel at my bring back so you guys
can subscribe and look forward to that
but you know for this for this new
Boston series that I'm doing probably
won't get too much into the animation I
just kind of want to show you what's up
so first thing we're going to do is
we're going to create some more floats
we're gonna call one DX and dy for
change in X and change in Y direction
then we're also going to create one
called animate X and animate or na Y and
then we're also going to create one more
called scaled X and scaled Y so a lot
more lot new very a lot a lot of
variables there and now let's set them
all up to be equal to zero at the
beginning so we're just gonna say dy
equals d I'm sorry DX equals dy equals
so as it is just clip the video save
some time but basically I just said DX
equals dy equals you know Anna x and a y
scaled X scaled Y and they all are equal
to zero it's kind of setting them all
equal to zero to start with which is
good so now what we're gonna do is we're
basically going to go into our you know
our up motion event right here and set
up our changes or DX and our dy so our
DX is going to be the change in the X
direction so what we're gonna say is our
final X
- are starting X and that will give us
the change in the X direction and then
we're also going to say dy is equal to
our final Y and our - our starting Y and
let's say you know our screens 400 or
800 pixels by 800 pixels basically this
change in X it could be up to 800 you
know up to quite a few pixels like a
thousand or something like that I don't
know the math exactly but so we don't
want it to be that big so what we're
gonna do is we're gonna kind of scale it
down so we're just gonna say our scaled
X is equal to our DX divided by like
let's just do 30 and see how that works
then we're also going to say are scaled
y is equal to our D Y divided by 30 and
there we go we kind of have our scale
variables set up now what we're gonna
want to do is we're going to go into our
actual animation and so what we're gonna
just quickly do is we're gonna copy the
one that prints the ball which was our
test is what we what is what we defined
there so we're going to copy that and
we're gonna paste it when you know our
finals don't equal anything so we're
gonna paste that above our X actually
let's do it below our X or a plus symbol
there and there we go now we're gonna
print a ball again just centered
everything is pretty much the same as
how we printed it here but now it's just
going to print when it's finalized and
what we're gonna say is we're going to
say - now our ana x which is gonna be
our skit did we set that up yet no okay
basically this is going to be our
animated X how much it's going to change
each time in each direction so we'll get
to what that actually is set to here in
a second but we're also going to set
this equal to an eye why and now we just
need to set up these variables and as
you can see it right now this is equal
to 0 because that's what we set it up to
be
create so after it runs through here
we're gonna change it a little bit after
you know this if statement and we're
going to change that value and so we're
going to say is we're going to say an
eye x equals ni x plus are scaled X so
again our skilled X is equal to you know
our displacement in the X Direction
divided by 30 so this is would be you
know that and then it's gonna every time
it loops through it's going to add more
to this x-direction which is going to
affect you know where we paint on our
canvas for a bitmap i don't know if that
made quite sense or not or if this is
making sense at all especially you know
probably isn't but hopefully you guys
kind of are picking up on some stuff
especially the new programmers this is
kind of how you do the animation not
necessarily generally you'd wanna have
some kind of framework that handles all
your animations for you but like I said
I just wanted to show you guys a quick
animation so we aren't quite done let's
just run it and see what it looks like
obviously there's going to be quite a
few things that we still need to do and
we'll finish up in the next tutorial but
we kind of got the basics down very very
basic stuff so we're gonna click and
we're gonna like let go here and there
we go our ball shoots off in that
direction
obviously we still have this printed
ball so we're gonna get rid of that and
let's try again that time it's not
shooting what's going on now those are
kind of areas that we're gonna fix in
the next tutorial so I'll catch you guys
then and have a good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
