this is buddy Blackford here with
another Photoshop tutorial and in this
one we're going to use color balance to
adjust the image and color balance is a
good tool that is quick that you can use
to quickly take out certain colors and
move the tonal range over to a different
set of colors so for example you notice
that this picture is really red because
there are a lot of neon lights like this
one that my mouse is around there are a
lot of those in this bar and it
basically turned every picture that we
took to red so let's go ahead and adjust
this so that we can take out the red and
make this look like it was a
normal-looking lighting so let's go to
image let's go to adjustments let's go
to color balance and you can see that
control B is color balance that's the
hotkey so what do we have here all right
one sec let me move this somewhere good
just move it right here so we can see
the entire picture all right now down
here we'll start here at the bottom
we've got tone balance now we can adjust
shadows mid-tones highlights and you can
tell which one you're on by if you
aren't looking at the tone balance by
accident you can you can see that the
little arrows on here the sliders they
change so highlights are going to be the
brightest mid-tones are going to be gray
and shadows are going to be black on
there now preserve luminosity you want
to keep that checked so that it keeps
the entire picture from getting darker
and lighter as you move the slides you
can usually leave the tone balance at
mid-tones to get the best results so
start with that and work from there
now we need to do is take a careful look
at your image and see what kind of stuff
needs to be changed or moved around now
obviously we can see that red needs to
be taken out of this picture but what
else alright
magenta is close to red so we'll
probably need to take out some magentas
and
then we'll decide when we get down to
the yellow and the blue if we need to do
anything there so let's go ahead and
move this top slider here we've got the
contrasting colors here the opposites
here so we'll go to move left to the
cyan here and you can already see it's
taken out some of the image and since
we're doing this this wasn't the highest
quality photo is taken from a phone but
you can still edit your phone pictures
and stuff like that in Photoshop and I'm
sure people wanna know how to do that as
well so let's start moving on so in the
magenta there now we're starting to get
real skin tones now let's move this left
and right from yellow and blue and so
what we get I think we need to move it
more to the yellow well not a lot if I
move it to the blue you can see that's
bringing way too much blue in there we
don't want that so just maybe a little
bit into the yellow 12 so I've got
negative 73 plus 33 and negative 12
that's what I did to be able to adjust
this image and I did it really quickly
and fairly easily so if I go here to
shadows I can maybe work on this a
little more actually let's go to
highlights because maybe it'll get these
a little bit better you can move this
and do some fine fine small tuning to it
I don't want to do that too much maybe
put some more yellow a little bit of
yellow in there shadows now will let you
just take a look at your shadows
actually I think I put too much yellow
in there because the the highlights are
a little starting to turn yellow all
right and then you can you might not
even need to adjust the the shadows or
the mid-to are the highlights you might
have just liked it at the normal the one
when we use mid-tones I thought it
looked fine so I could just put these
back to zero and that would reset
everything back to where it was now if
we do a preview uncheck the preview and
go back we can see the difference here
and a lot was deaf of the red was
definitely taken out to make it more
like a regular picture now you might
want to do some things like taking out
some of the noise in the image or
softening it up and stuff like that
take it out rid of all this all the
little specks and stuff like that or you
can keep it on to create like a cool
kind of noisy look so that's up to you
but we're not going over that part in
this tutorial and that's uh that's
basically it so use your color balance
to quickly take out some colors or shift
the colors to the other set so it goes
from the RGB over here on the right and
then we got the CMY and it's just
missing the KK is black so these are the
opposite spectrum colors there so thanks
for watching this one I look forward to
seeing you guys in the next tutorial see
you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
