Photoshop cs6 tutorial
I'm buddy Blackford and today we're
gonna learn how to create shape layers
out of our text and it's gonna be pretty
cool so when you convert a type layer
into a shape layer the type layer is
actually converted into a layer with a
vector mask so pretty much what happens
is Photoshop fills the layer with the
color of the text and then creates a
vector mask to define the type so it
turns it basically into a shape so it's
pretty cool and you have the ability to
manipulate the image as a vector shape
but you aren't a bit a bit you lose the
ability to edit the type sorry about
that so let's go ahead and use this so
you have like the advantages of a shape
layer but then you lose the advantage of
being able to edit the type so go ahead
and write out your shape layer or write
out your text layer and go ahead and
select your layer over here and then
we're gonna go to the type menu by
right-clicking and go to convert to
shape and you can see now that this is
converted to a shape we have a path that
has been created we can delete out this
word path that's old and we have this
Bucky's room that org shape path that
has been created now that the text is
converted into a shape layer I can edit
it with some of my vector editing tools
so if I click on my direct selection
tool here and then click on the letters
you can see that the letters R have
points and then you can edit them that
way if I go to my path selection tool I
can select my paths and you can still
see all the points as well and you can
manipulate these what letters anyway you
want with the pass and move around each
letter like that that's pretty cool and
handy and pretty handy if you want to
like make like a wacky like looking
thing there
move your letters around so let me do
this real quick and there you go now you
got some wacky like littering there and
then it's all contained into one shape
layer which is pretty nice if you ever
need to put them back you can just move
the shapes move the paths and everything
like that back to where you were or
where there were so that's all I wanted
to show you for this and that's how you
convert a shape layer to a pant and you
can see some of the advantages of that
so thanks a lot for watching this
tutorial and have a good day everybody</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
