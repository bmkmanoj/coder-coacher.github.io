this Illustrator cs6 tutorial I'm gonna
go over some of the layer basics such as
selecting deleting moving around and all
that stuff with layers and a dedicated
tutorial so that way we can pretty much
know what we're doing with the layers
panel without any any doubt so open up
your layers panel and it's this side
over here with the two squares that are
on top of each other if you don't have
that open go to window and then go to
layers and then I'll open it for you so
you definitely need to have that open so
the first thing I want to show you is
how to select the layers and that made
something easy but now everybody might
know how to select layers and that's
okay so all you need to do to select a
layer is go into your panel and just
click now there are other ways to select
layers instead of what happens if you
want to select a few layers alright
so the way you do that is you select
your first layer and then you go down
and you hold shift to wherever the next
layer is that you want to click and then
click and it will select more layers
within that layer so if I want to and
you have to be on the same level of
layers or else it's not going to work as
I just tried so you need to start on the
layer and then select more I'm gonna add
a few more layers just so we can try
things out so click your first layer
hold down shift and select a bunch of
layers in a row now if you need to
select the layers that aren't in a row
then you hold down the control key and
then that way you can select different
layers in that that aren't like right
next to each other now if you have a
bunch of layers selected and you
accidentally selected a couple that you
didn't want you can hold down control
when they're already selected and select
them and it'll deselect the layers if
you want to just deselect all the layers
you can just click off and it will
deselect them or you can go up into the
Select menu and go to deselect not on
there so don't worry about that
the next thing I need to show you is how
to delete layers you can click on a
layer and then come down to this
trashcan down here where it says delete
selection and click on it it'll delete a
layer for you you can also bring down
the layer and drag it right on top of
the trashcan and those are the ways that
you're going to be able to delete layers
now if you have an object or a layer
that has a bunch of objects in it and
you want to select some of the objects
on your on the artboard then you're
going to want to open up the layer by
clicking this arrow here it's going to
open it up and you're gonna click on
these little circles here and that's
gonna allow you to select the object if
you just select the layer it's not
actually going to select an object it's
just going to select a layer you want to
select all the objects in the layer
select the layer or hit the target
button on the layer and that pretty much
selects everything in the layer now you
can use the same principles too that we
use when selecting layers to select more
okay if I hold shift I can add more and
if I if I shift click on one that has
been selected already I can deselect it
so you're not going to use control
you're gonna use shift when you're
clicking on these ones and it's a little
weird that they decided to do it that
way and not use the original controls
that you use for just doing layers but
when you're selecting objects you want
to use shift now you don't have to
always select the same things in the
layer or everything that's in the same
layer you can select things that are in
different layers so I can shift click
this and I'll select everything that's
in that layer as you can see there so
you can see what's going on you can
select different things in different
layers using the shift button if you
want to arrange the layers around so you
got a couple layers that you don't that
are in the right place or paths that are
in the wrong place all you have to do is
click and drag and you can reorder them
or put them in other layers so if you
want layer 5 to be on top of layer 1 so
let me deselect these I'm just gonna
select a layer 5 which is this circle
here and right now it's on top of layer
1 so it's gonna be over top of this
square in when I see on the artboard
well if I drag it below layer 1 it's
gonna be behind the square now so that's
how layer ordering works if you want to
duplicate layers there's a couple of
ways that you can do that so I'm gonna
pull this one out and this is layer 5
all I gotta do is click and drag on to
the new layer button it'll create a copy
called
whatever your layer name was and then
copy hit control Z to delete that one
you can also go into the options menu
and just right here and then you can
duplicate layer right here you can also
delete the layer as well in the options
menu so now is duplicated and when you
have a layer that has artwork in it and
you're trying to delete it you'll get
this pop up you could hit yes and to get
it to not have that pop up pop-up
you're going to you can drag over top of
the trashcan and illustrator pretty much
does that in case you made a mistake and
accidentally clicked the trash can or
the delete selection button so that's it
for this tutorial
yep I went over the layer basics and
I'll go over some more things in the
next tutorial so go ahead give the video
a thumbs up if you learn something if
you really liked it and thank you
everybody for watching have a good day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
