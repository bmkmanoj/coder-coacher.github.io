tutorial for the new Boston we're going
to new in this tutorial is kind of
format our milliseconds into minutes
seconds and milliseconds for stopwatch
application now this is kind of a
rudimentary concept for Java programmers
and you want to expect to learn this at
the 88 tutorial but I know some of you
guys probably don't know how especially
if you've just been following this
series as a beginner programmer so we're
just going to quickly format or I'm
going to show you guys how to format
this this long into again minutes
seconds and milliseconds so first what
we're going to do is we're going to step
some int variables within our again
within our stop button so we're going to
say int milliseconds or mils like that
and we're going to get set this equal to
a result nothing new there again we have
our stop and our start time as give us
an error right now because it's like hey
we're trying to set up an integer and
you're trying to set it equal to long so
what we're going to do is just cast in
an int right here so it's going to be
like yeah we're working with along but
hey don't tell anybody and we'll make it
we'll make this deal work just say it's
an int and no one's going to get in
trouble so basically what you've been
seen in the past is we've used us a few
times basically it's just casting it so
we can make it work and then we're also
going to set up an int for seconds what
we're going to do here is we're going to
say our milliseconds or our result you
know it's pretty much the same thing
again we have to cast it as an nth sorry
and then we're going to say our result
divided by 60 wait no divided by a
thousand I'm sorry
because milliseconds into seconds we're
going to divide it by a thousand general
basic math right there and then we're
also going to set up a tent for minutes
we're going to set this equal to again
int and then we're going to say our
seconds actually we don't have to use
the nth for this
we're just going to say our seconds
divided by 60 makes sense right
whoops our second divided by 60 let's
make it seconds there we go
all right so now basically we have
everything set up for the most part and
now what we want to do is we want to set
our show result as those three variables
so what we're going to do is basically
delete what we have so far and we're
going to say string dot format and as
you can see it takes a string as its
first parameter and all basically
objects is its second parameter and etc
so we're going to click that and for
what we're going to say is basically we
want to have our you know our minutes
are seconds and then milliseconds all
separate by a colon so it's going to be
something like this right but now we
need to set up basically that's not
going to print anything with our
variables in there so what we're going
to do is we're going to say our
parentheses sign or I'm sorry your
percentage sign D and that's basically
going to give us kind of a reference
which I'll explain in a second and again
in parentheses D within here whereas ao2
and parentheses oops I'm sorry
parentheses o to D and then again for
the third one we're going to say
parentheses o to D so basically what
this parenthesis does and this D does it
kind of just references over here it's
like hey this is the first D you know
give me an argument to work with it's
like hey this is a this is another D
give me the second argument and the
third argument so what we're going to do
is we're going to set up our arguments
over here so we're gonna say
milliseconds seconds and oops no not
like that I'm sorry minutes is our first
e
seconds and milliseconds so that's
referring to these end variables right
here so again it's again hit this first
D it's going to look for the first
argument the second D it's going to look
for the second argument and the third D
is going to look for this third argument
but now we still are having a problem
and I'm going to show you that problem
real quickly hopefully when we run our
application so we're gonna hit start let
it run for a little bit and then
basically when we hit stop our
milliseconds is still showing all of our
milliseconds and you know our it's still
showing the five here stop again we have
the 14 here in the 14 here etc so we
want to get rid of that problem all
right so basically what we want to do is
we want to kind of just use the
remainder for each of these at least for
the seconds in milliseconds so what
we're going to do is we're in say
milliseconds is equal to milliseconds
and then we're going to use our
parentheses sign again and say divide by
100 so basically what that is going to
do is it's going to take our millisecond
so it's going to divide by 100 and
whatever is left over it's going to take
that and set it equal to so this I don't
know if that makes sense
but we're also going to do that first
seconds as well so we're going to say
seconds equals seconds divided by and
take the remainder of 60 let's say we
have a hundred and eighty-one seconds
what this is going to do is we're going
to say 181 seconds divided by 60 hey
that goes into it three times and with a
remainder of one
so it's basically going to give us the
remainder so it's going to say one so
basically that's what we're working with
and now when we run our application it
everything should work out perfectly
so let's just start stop and as you can
see it's kind of rounding everything off
and we aren't getting that overlap there
that we were getting previously so
hopefully that kind of made some sense
guys you learned about the module or the
remainder and also these D things</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
