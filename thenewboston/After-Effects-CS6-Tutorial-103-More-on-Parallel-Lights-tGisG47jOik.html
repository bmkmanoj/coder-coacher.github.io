here so that it'll catch shadows
correctly and that we can see them so
let's double click on our light here and
if you look you can see that there
actually is a shadow being cast and I'll
uncheck this and check it to show you
like that and you will want to bring the
shadow darkness down and you can see
that you aren't able to change the
shadow of the fusion with the parallel
light so you're gonna get a stronger
sharper shadow when you use a parallel
light and there's the example there so
if we go into two views here where we
can see what the light looks like
there's the symbol there and we can aim
the light using the point of interest
here and if I twirl open the light
transform properties and move around you
can see that the point of interest is
animatable as well as the position here
now you may notice that there isn't any
option to rotate this light well you
can't rotate the the the light here you
have to use the point of interest if you
want to be able to start rotating you
can even click on the rotation button
here and try to rotate on and one of the
excesses or anything it does not let you
so the parallel light has the point of
interest and position that are
animatable
now with anything that has a point of
interest you can usually auto orient
towards the point of interest so that
will end up letting you save some time
of keyframing the point of interest if
you'd like to keep it in one place and
move around the light so I'll show you
real quick and if you right-click on the
light and come to transform Auto orient
the auto orient it comes up and then you
can click on orient towards point of
interest and hit OK and then when I move
my light here actually when I move my
position I need to move my I need to
keyframe the position and now we can
move the light around
there we go and we want to have the Auto
orientation there and so when I move
this now it's gonna auto automatically
stay where that light orientation is so
after you're done keyframing your key
frames you set where the position of the
point of interest should be and it will
auto orient always to that position then
you can make like nice rotations and
things like that with your light without
having to put so many key frames down
and if you remember the spot light also
has a point of interest so you can also
do that with a spot light now if I just
change this to a spot light okay the
lair is already or Auto oriented and
already has the key frames so now we
have the lair moving on the motion path
while staying Auto oriented towards the
point of interest I'll change this back
to the parallel light real quick and I
don't have anything else to go over for
the parallel light just I mean it shoots
one way out and I'll bring up the
picture again hopefully the picture
actually made sense it shoots one way
out
so you can direct where the light is
coming from and remember that the
shadows are gonna be a little more crisp
and that's those are pretty much the
main points of the parallel light thanks
for watching this one thumbs up if you
liked it thumbs down it if you
absolutely hate parallel lights so I'm
gonna see you guys in the next tutorial
hopefully thanks for watching and have a
good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
