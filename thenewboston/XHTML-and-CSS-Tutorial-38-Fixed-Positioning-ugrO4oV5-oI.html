thirty-eight tutorial I'm going to do
this entire tutorial singing song no
actually I'm not
but anyways and this is Sora we're going
to be going over something called fixed
positioning it's the last positioning
that we have to cover in fixed
positioning is actually a lot like
absolute positioning and the idea that
you're going to have a coordinate in
your top left point on your screen and
just like absolute positioning it's
going to move the element absolutely
where it is but the one and the main
difference between fixed positioning and
absolute positioning and it's actually
the only difference is whenever you
scroll your screen if you have an
element that's absolutely positioned and
you scroll your screen down that element
is you know going to do what you expect
it to do and scroll off the screen but
with fixed positioning that element
stays in the same place on your website
and it doesn't move so it can scroll
over other texts or you know it's just
going to stay there and no matter how
hard or how fast you scroll it's not
going to move so this is kind of a weird
type of positioning but um and by the
way I just want to mention this this is
the most uncommon type of positioning
hardly anyone ever uses this I never
used it when I built a website um but I
have to tell you guys about it because I
just can't you know skip over a topic so
let's go ahead and make a bunch of
paragraph so paragraph and ending
paragraph and let's just write um I am
The Sandman let me in easy Metallica
something like that it actually says I'm
ah the same Anil me and so let's go
ahead and paste this a couple times and
let's just go ahead and copy this
paste there and hey why not a couple
more so now just go ahead and why am I
doing this well I'm just want to have a
website where we can actually scroll
down so now you can see we have some
stuff to a scroll and it's not just you
know one paragraph or something so
actually let's go ahead and change up
this first paragraph and make it
something with the ID let's name the
side the tuna and in the paragraph will
just write like to not make tuna man
mucuna they should definitely make a
McDonald's sandwich called Mik tuna I
will need it sounds disgusting but I'm
just saying they should make it so now
let's just go ahead and apply some
styles to this ID actually I already got
my style tags how convenient
so now in this tuna ID what do we want
to do first of all let's go ahead and
give it a border of like border two
pixels solid and Corrine I guess why the
heck not something that's easy to see
and now position let's go ahead and
write fixed just like that and now let's
go ahead and give it coordinates so
you're beginning to see that this is
basically the exact same is absolute
positioning the only difference is that
instead of absolute rewrite fixed so now
let's go ahead and give it left 65 or 64
pixels who the heck cares save this
refresh and see what we got now our
first paragraph is in a box that's hmm I
prep it should move this over more but
I'm not going to wait too lazy for that
that sixty pixels down from the top and
65 from the left so exactly like
absolute positioning it takes a box and
it positions it absolutely on your
webpage exactly where he told it to but
check this out the only difference is
when absolute you scroll and this could
go off the screen it would slowly move
up whenever you scroll this it stays
fixed on your webpage just like that so
no matter how hard I scroll try to get
it off it just staying there and it's
annoying so anyways like I said people
generally don't use
a whole lot when making web pages
because I mean have you ever been to a
web page and just did that in BEC yeah
there's a reason I scrolled to get you
out of my sight and you're still there
you know so anyways I just wanted to go
over it because I mean it I thought it
was appropriate so anyways that's the
difference between absolute and fixed
it's one difference but it's a big
difference so I guess if you wanted to
be a real idiot then you could do
something like this go ahead and delete
that and then just go ahead and write
fixed border and write like one pixel
solid gray and I got an idea for the top
let's put it like 55 pixels and for the
left
let's put like two hundred and ninety
pixels so I guess if you were a jerk you
can just refresh this and there'd be
they load the web page and then they
would see this dot on the screen and
like oh man my monitor scratch is it or
is it the web page and then their scroll
down and see that that dot actually
stays there and they're like oh well I
guess my monitors just scratched so
anyways if you wanted it to be you know
addy head you could do that
I'm just saying so anyways that is the
beauty of fixed again I guess that's
actually the only reason you would ever
want to use the fixed positioning if you
want to just make a fake scratch on the
monitor so yeah I know it's dumb but hey
it's all I got
so anyways thank you guys for watching
this story and the next tutorial have no
idea what I'm going to be going over but
it's going to be amazing so anyways like
I said thanks thanks for subscribing
thanks for watching my videos
and thank you for just being you so
anyways I'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
