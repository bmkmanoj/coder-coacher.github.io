well the initial effect of this when I
hover over the opacity raises to 1 and
the same with this as well however what
I want is to create some kind of effect
as I navigate my mouse between the two
the only one that's shown or a hundred
percent opacity is the one with my mouse
on so hopefully that sort of sums up why
I'm trying to do but what I'm going to
do is I'm going to do this inside the
callback function and then we're going
to make a few modifications a bit later
on so what I want to do is I want to use
a selector the same selector which is
dot fade too so this now means every
other well this means every element on
the page that has the class fade to and
then I'm gonna go ahead and say fade to
and then I want to fade that to our
speed of 100 back to not point four so
we need to make a couple of
modifications in here and then we're
gonna make a little modification with
regards to the callback function in a
minute because I'm creating this in a
way that you know doesn't quite look
right at first so let's just run through
this we've setting the opacity to all of
our fade two elements to null point four
then as we fade over a fade to element
we set the currently moused over element
to fully visible and we set all other
elements to not point four now by all
other elements I don't mean all other
elements as opposed to the one that we
have our mouse over because this
selector is not quite enough and we're
gonna be looking at something we can add
in here just a minute so at the moment
this works well it doesn't work and you
can see why as I fade over each element
the selector that we've used which is
fade too
picks up the current the currently
moused over selector as well so we need
to add something in here that's going to
stop this from happening so I'm gonna
say just dot dot not and inside here
this so essentially in plain English it
does make sense so we are fading the
current element
this element - one the one that we have
our mouse over and then every other
element but not this element ie not the
one that we've faded how we have our
mouse over fade - not 0.4 so now when we
open up our browser and we hover over
this element and then we go to this one
you can see that they interchange and
you can see that we obviously only ever
show full opacity to the element that we
have our mouse over and obviously we
could go ahead to index dot PHP we could
copy this image we could paste it there
and then we could go ahead and refresh
and we have the effect for all three
images so when I look at this I think
something like a photo gallery something
that you have you know a full focus on a
particular image only and this is faded
in now there is one more problem here in
the sense that when I hover over this
one you might not be able to notice it
at the speed it's at but let's go ahead
and just slow down the animation just
for one second
let's go ahead and set this to let us
say 700 and we'll go ahead and set this
one in fact let's set it to a second and
you'll be able to see it a lot better
now watch what happens I faded this in
fair enough but now watch what happens
when I roll over the next image now
you'll notice that it took a second
obviously for the fade in to happen but
what happens is the element that's
currently in focus fades in but the
other element doesn't fade out until
this particular animation is complete
and that's where we've gone wrong in the
sense that we've used the callback
function now this callback function
remember only actually completes what's
inside of it once that once the current
the current fade - has finished so the
current animation has finished so what
we want to do is I'm going to go ahead
and cut this line out and I'm going to
just get rid of the callback function
and what I'm going to do is I'm going to
come down a line and paste this in here
so now what's going to happen is we fade
the particular element
to an opacity of one after a sec oh
sorry yeah a second I'm going to go
ahead and reduce this back to 500 or to
500 but then instead of using a callback
function and waiting for the animation
to complete we just simply use this to
fade out the other element at the same
time so now what happens is we get a
much better effect and they this one
fades out you know each one fades out as
the other one is in view or has their
mouse over so let's go ahead and reduce
the speed even more to back to point one
of a second and this just gives a really
nice hover over effect you know much
like a gallery would so we you know when
we write code we think of it in the
sense of oh we could go ahead and use
the callback function and take advantage
of that to then run another piece of
code once the animation or once we faded
this in a rattle but in actual fact is
better that we've used this on two lines
to be able to create a sort of a more
flowing effect through each image and
obviously you can go ahead and you can
just go ahead and copy these images to
you know sort of them as many images on
a page as you like you know these could
be sort of like dynamically loaded you
know with a sword like a back-end web
development file you could just go ahead
and load in a load of images in your
gallery or just keep them static it
doesn't really matter but as long as
it's got this fade to class we take
advantage of this really nice
functionality so we've looked at setting
the CSS opacity to 0.4 we've looked at
obviously an event here we've looked at
fading this in and we've more
importantly looked at this not selector
here because without this vital piece of
code we get this really odd sort of
effect when we hover over it just
automatically fades that that particular
element out so we've just created
another condition here to say not the
particular element that has the mouse
over so this effect is really really fun
to play with and it's extremely easy to
make it like I said if you had you know
sort of tiny thumb
on a page and you wanted to fade this in
even a really large image gallery it
would look really really nice so just
this code here and just you know
appending this class or applying this
class to elements we've managed to
create this really really cool sort of
gallery fade in effect</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
