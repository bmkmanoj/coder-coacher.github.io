Blackford here with another Photoshop
cs6 tutorial and today we're finally
getting into the filters and the filters
are located up here and they're like
kind of like effects that you can add to
your Photoshop images or designs or
whatever you have going on the first
filter that we're going to learn how to
use is the add noise filter now the head
noise filter is good for giving your
images like an old-school film look or
sometimes when you are using images
different kinds of images and pictures
and clipart and stuff like that together
actually I shouldn't even really use
clipart I know I said that but if you're
using different assets together
sometimes you have like an image that
was taken maybe by like a cell phone
that some guy wants you to touch up and
add parts of like another image in that
has been taken that's like HD and
they're not going to look good together
so what you would want to do is add some
noise to the HD to get it to be a little
bit more like at the already noisy like
cell phone picture so let's get started
and we'll just go ahead and start adding
the filter so just go up here go to
filter and we'll go to noise and add
noise now we got a preview button here
that you might probably want to have
checked if you have unchecked it doesn't
show up in your image so click on that
and then you can zoom in or zoom out
using this button here and then the
amount of noise is here in the amount
tab now as you can see I'm just going to
increase this a little bit more so we
can see the noise is all different
colors and it reminds you of like an old
TV station
all that static so that's nonetheless
what it at least reminds me of so if you
if you're looking for like more of a
film grainy look an old-school film look
keep it sort of low down there now there
are a few choices that you can make when
you're adding noise down here you got
the uniform in Gaussian distribution and
then you got the monochromatic checkbox
here okay
so the distribution distribution here
you can click the uniform there to
create like a more ordered appearance or
you can click the Gaussian option to
create like a more random so let's go
that and increase this a little more so
we can kind of like see what's going on
so this is uniform and if I click
Gaussian it's a little more random back
off it I get a bit come here
so there's gosh in with it down a little
bit more and here is uniform now let's
go ahead to the monochromatic here when
you select the monochromatic checkbox
here it pretty much applies it to like
tonal elements in the image and put it
let me try to like Reese say that it
like tries to adds the noise to the like
the different tones in the image so
here's peach on the skin tones here
here's black it's not gonna have all
those different colors so let me Jack
this up more and you can see there it's
not gonna be a bunch of random colors
now that was easier than the way I first
tried to explain it but that's what
monochromatic does and it's up to you
whether or not you want to have it
checked I usually have it checked
because I think it looks nicer I don't
really like all the other extra colors
in there but that's up to you
so I'm just gonna go ahead and hit OK
and there's my new filter now you can
see that when filters are added they are
in like a destructive kind of editing it
has changed the overall image and it
doesn't have an extra layer for me to
like add it on
or anything like that so be wary of that
because you just I just changed the
entire image is now like pretty much a
completely new image from the other one
that we that I started with if I hit the
eye button here all its gonna do is take
off the entire image and I can't like
just take away the filter the only the
way you would do that is come up into
your history and just like go up over
there so that your noise is off now
that's a it's up to you which way you
want to do it so that's a pretty much a
lot about the add noise filter you want
to use it if you want to add like a film
grain effect to your image you can use
it when combining different quality
images together because you may want to
dumb down another image what because
it's quality is too high to insert into
another image or for example if you're
like restoring an old photo and you
start if you start messing around with
it you can add the noise in inside of
like a selection or your mask if you
want to to pretty much add more of like
an old-school look to it so adding noise
is pretty much for making things look
lesser in quality or more like old
school so just keep that in mind and use
it when you need to I guess so and
that's it for this one and I'm gonna
thank you again for watching give a
thumbs up if you liked the tutorial and
thumbs down if you're really really
hated it but I don't recommend that
thank you everybody for watching have a
good day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
