video and in this tutorial I'm going to
be teaching you guys about my favorite
math function of all time and that is a
R and it's the function that generates a
random number and the reason I love this
so much is because whenever I'm making
computer games this is the piece of code
that makes it fun and unpredictable Vout
random number generator and computing
every game would be like boring and
bland so let me go ahead and show you
guys how to use it and then I'm going to
show you guys how to tweak it to tune it
especially specifically to the game
you're making so I'm going to make a
loop to print out a bunch of random
numbers so for that I need a counter
variable and later on I'm going to show
you guys how to get a random number in a
custom range such as if you're making a
dice game you just don't want any random
number in the world you want specific
set of numbers in this case 1 2 6
because those are the numbers that are
on a dice not like 800 so let's just go
ahead and make that for loop right now
and the first thing I'm going to do is
set a equal to 0 and how many numbers do
1 generate doesn't really matter I'll
just put eyes lesson 24 now 20 or so
that would be good and of course I plus
plus now the first thing I want to do is
just show you guys what it looks like by
default without any customization so
prints F of course what this function
does is it generates a random integer so
just press % D and might as well bump
that to a new line if we don't it's
going to look like one big number now
the function is called Rand and if you
don't add anything in there by default
then what it's going to do is it's going
to return a random integer from zero to
somewhere above 32,000 I think it's
32,767 by default and the reason that
this sounds like a weird number and you
know kind of a random one is actually
it's a very precise number it has to
deal with how your operating system
still
or as bits and bytes on your computer
for now you just have to remember that
it's somewhere from zero to 30 mm in
something so let me print this out on
the screen and you see we get a bunch of
random numbers somewhere in that range
pretty cool but like I said we typically
just don't want a bunch of random
numbers what we want most of the time is
just on a range of numbers like I said
before you're rolling a dice
whenever you're rolling a dice you want
the numbers one to six so how can we
take this function which gives us the
range of 0 to 32,000 something and make
it only output 1 to 6
well show you guys how to do that right
now so take this dice roll and plop it
down there and the equation for this is
going to be parentheses and in those
parentheses type the function R and now
right after this hit modulus 6 now
remember what modulus does is it takes
this number on the on the left and
divides it by the number on the right
however it doesn't give you the result
it gives you the remainder of that so
whenever you divide any number by 6
you're going to get the remainder 0 and
that's if 6um fit into the number
perfectly like 36 divided by 6 gives you
zero or it's going to give you the
number 1 through 5 so this entire
function is either going to give you 0 1
2 3 4 or 5 so of course we're pretty
much off by a step of one because the
dice is not 0 to 5 but 1 to 6 so now all
we have to do is take that expression
and add 1 to it so now dice roll is
equal to the numbers 1 to 6 simple
enough so now we can just go ahead and
print that out you could actually didn't
even need to delete that earlier but
percent D get get to newline
and dice roll is what we want to print
out so again I run this bad boy and
check it out what happens now is it
prints out and actually do we have no
three in here cool oh there's a couple
how did I miss those right in the middle
well basically what this does is it
prints out somewhere in the range of one
to six so if you want to have any kind
of dice game then this little formula
would be perfect for it so again the
only other confusing thing might be this
right here because I think it was the
first time we actually used them modulus
operator in a useful function but for
now here's what I want you guys to do
since you have all the building blocks
to build a more complex program this is
your next challenge I want you to create
a game where the user rolls three dice
and it prints out their total to them on
dice a plus B plus dicey so after it
gets the sum the users going to look at
it and it's going to guess if the next
roll is going to be higher and if it is
they'll just type in H and press Enter
lower in the press L or the same they'll
press s and hit enter and then they're
going to roll the dice again and if they
got it right if they guess correctly
we'll just like print out good job if
they got it wrong print out you suck and
um well that's it so I think you guys um
can complete this challenge if you can
and post it in my forum and well I'll
congratulate you if not then post where
you're having trouble with in my forum
and I'll help you out with it or someone
else will a bunch of people there
willing to help so that's your challenge
thank you guys for watching don't forget
subscribing I look forward to seeing
your games</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
