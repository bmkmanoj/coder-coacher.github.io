thing that we usually do and define a
function within this event handler but
this time we want to make a simple
change and we want to supply a parameter
in here that we can use to access where
the mouse position is out because
obviously the mouse position is
extremely important in this circumstance
with regards to where we're going to
place this div we want it to follow the
mouse
therefore using e we can grab the client
x and y position which essentially is
the mouse position so let's go ahead and
just bring this down and I'm gonna go
ahead and just create a test so we know
that everything's working I'm gonna go
ahead and just create a div on the page
and this is going to be called just
pause for example this should just sort
of for debugging and testing purposes it
you know doesn't really have any other
use now we want to go in the head and
inside of our function here define the
top and the left of the mouse position
so I'm going to create a variable called
top and I'm gonna create a variable
called left and these are going to be
equal to e dot and then we're gonna
access the you know sort like I'm a
method inside of this object and the
first one is client Y this is
essentially the Y position which is
obviously the vertical position so we
want to know how far from the top the
mouse is which is this value here and
then with regards to the left we want to
get the X position because we want to
know how far is on the horizontal or x
axis so now what we can do is we can
feed into this div that I've created
called pause and we can apply these
values to this so we'll get a sort of
dynamically updating values so I'm gonna
say top plus and then just a space and
then left so now what's going to happen
is when we move our mouse we're gonna
grab the top and the left constantly so
every time the mouse is moved up or down
or left or right or vertically
we're gonna grab these two values and
then just apply them to this pause div
so now what you should see is these
values change you can see underneath my
cursor here and underneath the link
you see them changing so now that we
have these values here we can determine
where to place this div that we've
created or defined in here and that
we've actually applied to the document
by putting it after the the link so now
that we've just seen that in action we
can go ahead and get rid of that div and
get rid of this line as well
the only problem here is is that we want
to space this a bit further away from
the mouse cursor we don't want it to be
too close to the cursor because
obviously it's going to get in the way
and it's going to cause some problems so
I'm gonna add ten to each of these
values and that will just space it sort
of ten pixels below where the cursor is
and ten pixels across from whether from
where the cursor is okay so now what we
want to go ahead and do is okay so yeah
what we want to do is we want to go
ahead and apply the position that we've
gained here plus ten so we want to move
this div accordingly so you've seen that
we could update the values inside that
div I created just under here but now we
want to do is actually apply the
position of this here or accordingly now
this is would be the same as applying
say top as ten pixels and left as say
ten pixels it can be absolutely anything
the values could be anything but we can
use jQuery to automatically update CSS
so what we want to do is we want to go
ahead and reference the hover text div
which is hover text remember the idea of
this is hover text so we use a hash to
reference the name and then we want to
say dot CSS and in here we can set top
to a particular value here and then we
can do CSS again to set the left to a
particular value here and obviously this
this value here and this value here we
already gained dynamically depending on
where the mouse is so we can just
substitute these in so I can write top
here
and I can go ahead and right left here
and now that we've done that we have
another slight problem and that is that
we haven't actually shown this div yet
so we want to do is we want to just put
show on the end of it and that will
change the display:none to actually
display it so let's take a look at the
the code you can see now at the moment
we have another problem I mean the one
thing is that this div is now following
our cursor but we obviously haven't
applied any text to it yet so it's
pretty much useless so what we want to
go ahead and do is just before we show
it is apply some text and that text in
here could be absolutely anything but
we're substituting in a variable and
that variable is title remember the
variable that we gained from our link
earlier so now when we refresh we can
see that we have the div hovering over
you'll probably notice that the tooltip
is actually getting in the way of this
but there's a way that we can deal with
that and we'll go through that in a
moment now the first problem that we're
going to solve is when we move away from
the link the div actually remains so
it's really quite annoying and useless I
mean you wouldn't want to put that on
your site so what we do is after we've
after we've used this mousemove event
handler we want to come down here and
say dot mouse out and create a new
function so function in here is going to
be let's just pull that down the
function in here is going to be when the
mouse comes away from the particular
element and in this case all we really
want to do is just go ahead and hide the
hover text div so when the mouse comes
away from it its hidden and it doesn't
remain on the page so hide like that so
we've shown it here when the mouse goes
in and it's been moved around but when
the mouse comes out we want to hide this
so it's quite simple really if you think
about it so now when we come away you
see it just hides so we can still
flicker over it and you will show itself
and hide itself so mouse move it's being
shown and now the way it's being hidden
okay now the last problem that we sort
of have to deal with is the fact that we
get this HTML default tooltip appear now
I took the time to personally research
this and how we might be able to disable
this tooltip coming up which default
comes up when you supply a title</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
