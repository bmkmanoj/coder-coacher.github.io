defects so if I click on this layer I'm
going to unlock it real quick and go up
here to the effects and controls you can
see that I have a ramp on the background
if I toggle the effects off now you
can't see the ramp anymore so that's how
you talk about between your effects this
next one here is the frame blending
button and you have to have enable flame
or frame blending on it and the way to
do that is you have extra extra you have
adjacent footage frames and when you
have that box ticked it will add extra
frames by blending them together it's
kind of hard to explain just without
showing you so I'll have to show you in
a later tutorial because it's a little
more in depth on I'm going to undo this
box this is the enable frame blending
and then once that you turn that on
you'll be able to turn these on on
certain layers obviously none of these
layers are affected by it because we
don't have frame blending yet the next
one over where these three circles are
is the most enable motion blur column
and there is an enable motion blur
button right here and if you are
animating the position of something and
it's moving around you can enable motion
blur to give it more of a realistic look
so if you know how someone sometimes
some things run run by really fast and
they just look like a blur or something
like that so you can add a little bit of
blur to it by enabling the motion blur
there the next one over is the
adjustment layer so if you toggle the
switch an adjustment layer will affect
all the layers below it so if you add an
effect to this
so what can I add I'll try I'd like a
blurred because those are quick and
let's go fast I'll move this up to so we
can see and it's going to it's going to
affect everything so if I move it down
below the picture and the chain saw only
the squish in the tuna are going to be
blurred so that's how an adjustment
layer works and if you turn it off it
basically turns off the whole layer it's
you use these adjustment layers that are
up up here to create that effect I don't
want to untag elytte because then it
just messes up this what I want to do is
just delete this off there the next box
over is the taco 3d layer box and that
pretty much allows you to move your
layer or rotate your layer in 3d space
so if I let's go to the squish and I'll
toggle it and if I hit position now if
you see the arrows up here they there's
a Y and X and this blue one that's
ticking towards us is Z and now we can
move it on the z axis you can see that
down there and also with a if I do
rotation now you have new options and
new to cs6 you can extrude layers now
and make them 3d so when you have this
check box ticked and have the layer a 3d
layer you can extrude your layers which
is actually really awesome since you
don't have to use a 3d program for that
kind of stuff anymore it saves a lot of
a lot of time and hassle actually this
little swirl thing here that's called
the pic whip and you can use that to
parent so fi parent the chainsaw to the
tuna here f F i move the tuna
chainsaw is going to move with it and
that's how parenting works you can also
do the same exact thing with this
drop-down menu and so I'm gonna use the
drop-down menu to parent the chainsaw to
the squish this time and you can see
that it it works so the next thing I
want to go over is to come down here
down to the this button at the bottom it
says toggle switches / modes now if I
toggle that it gives us a new set of
options and close these so it's not
distracting so the new options are here
to the right and nothing to left of the
layer name changed so this is the
blending mode so there's a whole huge
drop down menu and you can use these to
blend over backgrounds and things like
that so you can see this blending mode
it was overlay and it changed how the
chainsaw blended in with the background
so I'll go to a normal this section is
the track matte and I'll have to explain
these uh these ones to you later because
they're a little more in depth and a
little harder to use and not very easy
to explain so that that's it for the
menus here and the check boxes I always
usually have it set to this first this
one and and just real quick i'll go over
these buttons again i'll just say the
names this is the composition mini
flowchart this button is the live update
draft 3d shy layers enable frame
blending enable motion blur brainstorm
auto key frame and graph editor so i'll
be going over these and a later tutorial
i already went over the auto key frame
and the graph editor so you guys know
what those are
earlier tutorials so you can check those
out if you're just starting on this
tutorial it's in an earlier like
probably about five back or something
like that that was just a number i just
randomly guest so it's probably not even
close to that so what's a end the
tutorial here that hopefully it was
pretty decent and i look forward to
seeing you guys in the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
