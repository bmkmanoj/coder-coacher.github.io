your 74th Java tutorial and in this
tutorial we're going to be going over
something called Mouse event handling
now we already went over stuff like Liz
then what happens or what we want the
program to do if the user clicks a
button or something but we didn't go
over what they would do if they like
press the mouse or click it or if they
drag the mouse and this program we can
respond to Mouse events that the user
does just like I just talked about like
they click it or if they move it and
stuff like that so let's go ahead and
get started and then well once I'm done
with this program you're understand how
to respond to users Mouse events so the
first thing we need to do is import a
bunch of stuff as you can see I got rid
of everything for my other tutorial so
let's go ahead and import java.awt dot
let's go ahead and just import all of
them and this is going to import stuff
like colors border layouts and well
stuff like that next we want to import
java.awt event in all of those and these
are pretty much our Mouse events and
lastly what we want to import is import
Java X dot swing dot all of those so now
we got all the imports we need I believe
if not we'll import them later but I'm
pretty sure that's all so after this
let's just go ahead and get rid of that
ticker and make two variables we're
going to have two things in our window
so we're going to have a private
variable jpanel
and actually that needs to be jpanel and
just name this like mouse
there we go I'll get it eventually Mouse
panel and this is gonna pretty much be
the area where you can like click and
move your cursor around so it's pretty
much just going to be a big white box
and we're going to have another variable
to hold another piece of our window and
that's J label and just set this equal
to like status bar so here's what our
window is going to look our window is
going to look like it's going to have a
big empty space and that's going to be
the called the Mouse panel and this is
where we can test out all our mouse
events like click a drag release and
we're going to have a status bar at the
bottom and when we click we want the
status bar to say you clicked when we
drag we want to say have the status bar
say you are dragging but you know we got
program all that so let's go ahead and
get to it so after we got our two
variables we can go ahead and make our
constructor which pretty much going to
construct our window so name it public
whatever you name your class
I named my GUI doesn't take any
parameters because its constructor I
mean I mean come on seriously we're not
going to pass any constructors or
parameters into it and then we did super
to of course change the title of it
because that is the constructor of the
superclass jframe changes the title um
in other words just put super and put
title whatever you want
now we pretty much got a window with a
title bar on it not very exciting so
let's go ahead and change that mouse
panel and actually make it something and
we will set this equal to nu J panel so
now we actually set it equal to
something so we can use it now so now
let's do something else with it
something a little more exciting
take that mouse panel and let's go ahead
and set the background color using the
built in method set back around and you
put note the output color and is the
arguments it takes a color so go ahead
put color white so we're going to put
this out white default but don't worry
we're going to be changing it to
something more exciting later on and the
last thing we need to do is of course
add this to the screen so go ahead and
add
mouse panel but we don't want to do that
if you can notice we didn't have a flow
layout like we did last time so for this
layout go ahead and put boarder layout
dot Center and this is just going to
make it appear in the center of the
screen and fill up all the empty space
and we'll be going over layouts later on
so you prize you guys probably don't
know what this means yet but trust me
you will in a little bit so now we have
on our window which is this we have a
title which is the title bar and we have
pretty much a background not very
exciting so let's go ahead and add that
status bar we talked about right here so
go ahead and type in status bar and we
will set this I spell that right
all these underlines it like I spelled
it wrong or something and we will set
this equal to Nu J label remember don't
get this confused J panel J label your
status bar is the J label and just set
it to um and just put default because
that's what's going to happen by default
so now we have a status bar that says
default by default how clever is that so
now let's just go ahead and add it to
the screen what we're doing we'll be
changing it later with the Mouse events
but for now we just want to add it to
the screen get done with status bar and
for this order layout south and this is
means for real simply it's going to
appear at the bottom of the screen so
it's a little more than that when you
learned about layouts but for now trust
me just means meal screen fill up on
this all the empty space appear at the
bottom the screen simple enough and if
you couldn't guess it has north south
east west and center so anyways let's
talk about something a little more
useful in order to use our mouse events
like mouseclicked mousepressed we need
to make a new handling class to handle
these events so I'm going to make um I'm
going to make a class declaration right
now even though we didn't make the class
yet so in the future we're going to make
a cat class called handler class
and I'm going to make my object called
like handler something something easy
and of course we're going to set it
equal to new handler class I'll make
sure I don't type anything around there
so now there we go make sure they're
spelled the same that's how I check if
you're using eclipse and if you like
click one thing it will highlight
everything else yeah I mean just a neat
little tip because if you're like all
right why am I getting air in here and
not here just click it once oh it's not
how I there's spell different BAM so
anyways what we want to do is we're
going to add two listeners because we're
going to be implementing from two
different classes there are two
different types of ways or there are
pretty much two different types of mouse
events the first set of mouse events is
like anything that you can do when the
mouse is still and these include press
clicked release and there are two other
ones that are kind of funky called
entered and exit which is enter the
space and exit the space but the next
class we're going to implement from is
what you can do while the mouse is
moving and you can of course move the
mouse or if you hold down the mouse is
called dragging the mouse so let's go
ahead and add two listeners or a hat
right here right here I meant sound like
a what's that guy from politics yeah
whatever he is that's why I just sounded
like so Mouse panel dot add Mouse
listener how easy is that handler so of
course add Mouse listener weights and it
takes an object as its parameter so
that's why we passed in handler and do
it again Mouse panelled add always
called Mouse motion listener and of
course this takes handler too so now
we're getting error here because we
didn't build the class yet which we're
going to do in the next tutorial but now
let me go over this real quick we
imported everything we need because we
needed some stuff we extended J frame
which allowed us to built windows we
made two things in our windows a panel
and status bar then we set title of our
window and then
then we pretty much just set the color
or the background added it to the window
we made a status bar added that to the
window at the bottom and then we made
this new handler class with the object
handler and we need to make an object
because these two built-in methods that
wait for Mouse events they take an
object as their parameters so in the
next tutorial we're actually going to be
going over some of these Mouse events
such as what happens when you click the
mouse and we're going to be adding some
functionality to it anyway if we have
time we'll probably run it but we might
not so thank you guys for watching now
cannot wait to build this next class in
the next tutorial so again thanks you
thank you don't forget to subscribe and
I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
