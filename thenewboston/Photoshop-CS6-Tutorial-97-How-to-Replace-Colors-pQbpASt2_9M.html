Blackford here with another Photoshop
cs6 tutorial on hand and this time
around we're gonna learn how to replace
colors using the replace color
adjustment now the replace color lets
you basically pick a color and it'll
change the back color and you can like
move around so that it encompasses more
colors and things like that and if I
like for example I don't want this black
section here to be black I want it to be
green you can change that so it's really
handy and cool and I'll show you some
ways that you can do it so first things
first let's go ahead go ahead and open
up an image and turn it into a layer
let's go to image and we're gonna go to
adjustments we're gonna go to replace
color now right now everything is
selected we've got a couple options here
going on and the main option we want to
do right now is click on the eyedropper
here and you're gonna go ahead and
select a color so I'll select this black
for now and that color has been selected
and you can see basically your selection
in this preview panel here and if you
lower the fuzziness it's going to just
show more of that color selection and
when you increase the fuzziness here
it's going to make a broader range of
your selection so you can use these
eyedropper tool as this plus here to add
more color so if I clicked on the plus
and just click on the color you can add
more colors that you want to add in and
this eyedropper tool subtracts colors
that you might not want to have in there
so if there's like I don't know if you
if there's like something like a light
gray or something like that in there you
want that out just use this minus
eyedropper tool to get that out of there
so and it's also it's based on color
it's not based on what you're doing so
if I wanna if I'm trying to adjust this
color right here you can see that these
spatulas and the spoon over here are
going to get
just to because they're the same color
as well as the Mickey Mouse ears up here
that Bucky as on so what I'm just gonna
click over here on the spatula and I'll
show you what's going on you can see it
took away like some of the spatula
colors and it also took away some of the
color within the image here and you can
tell that by in your selection here
whatever is black is not selected
whatever is white is selected and the
brightness of what is white is how much
of it is selected so I'll show you
what's going on here so there's also one
more thing here called localized color
clusters and you check that box if you
want to limit your color selection to a
specific area using selection using the
selection eyedroppers or just select add
or subtract colors so if you don't have
this selected then it's going to you
can't really use these as well so let's
go ahead and replace the color now this
is where you replace the color down here
so click on this color box let's replace
it with like a yellow and we'll hit OK
now you can see the hue here we need to
mess with that I'll just change the
color a lot looks like yellow probably
wasn't the best choice you can see all
this stuff that's been added within and
this brings up one of the problems when
you're trying to mess with a replace
color you get all these other things
that are colored along with it like this
dog cage I guess there were some shadows
and in between the legs here and it
didn't it's kind of blocky and
everything so it's not looking too great
mess with the fuzziness it gets even
more things and so I'm gonna show you
like a way that you can do this better
and to be really quick I'm just gonna do
it on this wall up here so I'm gonna hit
cancel or a quick so none of that - so
none of that really took place we
weren't able to change the colors really
well because everything was getting
selected so what you want to do is make
a selection and so come over here and
I've got the little lasso tool here that
I'm gonna pick and I'm just gonna follow
these right here and just make like a
selection around this area now I'm gonna
go ahead and go to my adjustments again
and go to replace color you can see now
that pretty much only well only what's
selected now shows up in our selection
thing here so you can see in the image
if I just turn on image you can see that
it's definitely the red so I'm gonna
click on and sample the red color and
that is the color now that's being
selected let's check our selection yep
pretty good now what do we want to
replace this with maybe I want to
replace it with a blue see and now the
blue is getting replaced no we might
need to add some more the color here
let's go to our image add that stuff so
you kind of just mess around with it and
kind of click around mess with the hues
so here's some saturation added to it
and it okay and now we have a blue
cupboard so that's how you use this tool
replacing the color adjustment is very
handy if you need to do it use
selections to get greater control over
the tool so if you really want if you
really wanted to take the time use the
magnetic lasso tool or the lasso tool
and just draw around the body here if
you just want to change out the like the
mid section here of the blank and I
liked it I just wanted to keep the
tutorial short and not show a lot of
this need making selections or whatever
so I just went over here and did the
cupboard and you can see how well it
works so it's pretty cool
and that's gonna be it how do you use
this image adjustment so thanks for
watching it and this will be a pretty
cool tool that you guys can use later on
when someone doesn't like a color of
something and you need to change a form
anyways have a good day everybody thanks
for watching
see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
