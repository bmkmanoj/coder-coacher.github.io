Android tutorial for the new boss in
again with me Travis and what we're
going to go what we're going to do in
this tutorials we're going to kind of
get back to the basics do some more
stuff with the the XML layouts and kind
of show you some more examples and how
to you know we're just going to create
these small little applications so you
guys can customize your app even further
I mean what we're going to do this
tutorial is basically learn about the
sliding drawer and that's basically what
this is you're like what that's just a
button but basically it's not a button
because when we click it we can slide
this up and you know we have something
within this drawer for the most part
then we can do something else and then
slide it back down and then here's our
other activity so as you can see I mean
this is the graphics aren't that great
you can create your own kind of type of
handle to make it look better but as a
graphic or something and then you can
still slide it up check some preferences
or something like that and then slide it
back down pretty simple I don't know we
might get into the animation dependent I
mean the Java how to you know use some
of the methods that this sliding drawer
can actually access but for now we're
just going to create this here pretty
simple so first I want you guys create a
class called slider extends activity
then also create a layout called sliding
all lowercase within your oncreate
method again get that setup in your
manifest in your menu class
nothing nothing new there and then so
we're going to open up that sliding
class here and the first thing that
we're going to do is we're going to put
in the contents of what we want in our
and our spinner drawer for the most part
so what we're going to just deal with
now is just a checkbox that's all we're
going to put in our actual drawer and
the reason I'm doing it this way is
because the ADT kind of is messed up
it's kind of bugged out so
as you can see when we now go over into
our composite this is where the sliding
drawer is right here when we drag this
over it's going to give us an error but
just drag it over it's going to work I
promise you guys when you run on the
emulator and see as you can see it's
given us an error it can't find the
class called sliding drawer
that's just a Android problem it's you
know it's a bug we're just going to have
to deal with it then we're going to go
back into our sliding or the actual XML
view here and that's why I had you add
that check box first we're just going to
grab this check box ctrl X and we're
going to put it within this linear
layout here so just open up that linear
layout and paste your check box here and
basically what's happening is we create
a sliding drawer and we give it an ID
that we want to reference in Java so
we're just going to call this sliding de
sliding drawer sliding D and then we
also give it a handle ID and we also
give it a Content ID again that's all
with the app plus and then whatever we
want to label our 8id as and then within
the sliding drawer as you can see it
closes here within here we have a button
and that's basically our handle just
think of a drawer like your dresser
drawer that this right here is our
handle this button so we can pull that
handle up and down that's what this
again that's what this button is and it
just says handle right there as the text
and then the ID we also establish an ID
for the handle as at plus ID handle and
then the other thing that we do is we
say a plus ID content for a linear
layout which is the actual content of
our drawer as you can see both of both
of these ID this ID for a linear layout
matches the content ID of our sliding
drawer and same with our handle
ideas the exact same right here so
that's something you guys want to keep
in mind is when you create your hand
light or your handle here in your
sliding drawer because you are going to
need this handle in this content and
then you set up your IDs as the same as
your good as your handle and it's the
same as your content so there we go we
basically have created this application
and we're just going to set this this
checkbox id'd it something like cb4
checkbox and then we're going to say
slide a bowl something like that and
we're pretty much done with this
tutorial in the next tutorial
we're actually going to program it and
make this check bark check box do
something pretty special and for those
of you that follow this series all along
you probably know it's probably not
gonna be that special but anyways hope
you guys enjoyed the tutorial and I will
catch you in the next one have a good
one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
