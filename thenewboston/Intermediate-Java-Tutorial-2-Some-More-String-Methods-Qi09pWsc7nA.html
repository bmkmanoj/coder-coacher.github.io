welcome to your second intermediate Java
programming tutorial and in this story
I'm going to show you guys how to find
characters and also sub strings and
extreme sound awesome I know it does so
let's go ahead and get started and make
a string in I'm going to name my string
s and I'm going to set it equal to like
Bucky or Roberts Bucky Roberts you don't
need to spell it right but just have a
long string like that now in order to
find characters and in a substring you
need well let's go ahead and make a
system out print line and what you need
to do is you need to write what string
you want to search on and I want to
search this string right here s and now
you need to call a method called index
of index of and is your parameter you
write what character do you want to
search for and I'm going to go ahead and
write K in there and I'm going to run
this in your is you guys are going to
see what happens as you see it gives us
the result three right here so what
exactly did index of do well it said
index of K so that's pretty much means
search for the first instance of K so
you know that this begins with zero like
everything on your computer one two
three so k is it three to begin with so
this pretty much means like I said
search for the first index of K and
return its place fit so it did but you
can also do other stuff than just put it
I didn't I don't know how to just they
didn't name like search for or something
like that but they named it index up so
that's what bid and aside from one
parameter you can also have another
parameter in this other parameter if I
put like five or something this is a
starting point so what you're telling
index of in this method is are a search
for the first index of K but ignore the
first five right here so zero one two
three four five so this isn't even going
to look at these at all it's going to
hop right to five
start here and start searching right
there so if we go ahead and run this now
instead of three or whatever it now has
15 so if you count over 15 then this is
the next K right here so you have an
optional starting point to search but
you know that isn't really used as often
and if you guys are wondering RA what
happens if I give it a parameter that is
in there at all like X now X isn't and
Bucky Roberts Bucky Roberts at all so
let's go ahead and search for this and
what happens is it gives you a negative
1 or a false result so now we know how
to use index up and another cool thing
we can do is look for sub strings in the
same way so instead of just adding one
character if you add your double
quotation marks you can add something
like Rob so Rob appears right here and
if you search this it'll give you a
starting point for this which is 5 and
we can see that in just Kirlia 0 1 2 3 4
5 that's where Rob starts now just like
before we can give it an optional
starting point of like 10 or something
and let's see what happens right there
10 run that baby ok 17 so why did we get
17
just to clarify one more time well we
found this one at 5 but then it said all
right I'm not even supposed to start
right here I'm not even supposed to
start searching to like somewhere around
here
so now that I begin here the first one I
find is at 17 so that's why it gave you
the answer 17 so finding stuff in a
string easy enough let's learn some more
stuff and I didn't think I'd have time
in this tutorial but evidently I do so
let's go ahead and make a string and
let's go ahead and make two let's go
ahead and make like a and set this equal
to bacon I said a lot of variables you
go to bacon and let's go ahead and add a
space after this and let's go ahead and
put string B
equals monster so now I have a string
that says bacon and now I have a string
that says monster now oftentimes
we have a let's go ahead and just make a
system.out.print line right here now
oftentimes we know that we can
concatenate strings using something like
this a plus B now this output would give
you obviously bacon monster right here
but what if you had a program where you
didn't know what the strings were yet or
if you didn't want to concatenate amidst
this way well I know that this is pretty
straightforward and easy catenation
but there is also another way to
concatenate strings and you do this more
often
in programming and you'll see this later
on when we actually use it it's pretty
difficult to show you an example that's
useful without building a huge program
but this is how you concatenate strings
more often not you go ahead and put the
string name which is a and put concat
which pretty much means join this with
another one and as your parameter you
write the string you want to join it to
and I'm going to write B right there and
now if I run this we get bacon monster
just like that so it does it take to
this string as a parameter and sticks it
on the end of this shirt and yes I did
remember to put a space as time so just
didn't say you know that would even work
right there if you're in that bacon
monster just one word easy enough so now
that we even cover that let's go ahead
and learn some more stuff we can keep
that right there now let me teach you
guys about something called replace now
this is you can use this to replace
let's see what can I replace well let's
go ahead and put a and that won't really
work I can't really change any of these
words easily but anyways here's what the
basic opposite is you can use method
called replace and as your parameters
for this you go ahead and write what you
want to replace in the string and I'm
going to replace like bacon
I'll make it called taken or something
so let's go ahead and replace the
capital B and we want to replace it with
a F so now if we go ahead and run this
we see bacon now turns in to fakin just
like that again I couldn't come up with
anything funny or else I would but I
mean can't really turn the bacon in
anything easily but I tried now aside
from this replace votives have got two
more methods and that's to uppercase
into lowercase so let's go ahead and
take B and put to upper case just like
that and now it takes no parameters
instead it just changes everything
to uppercase so let's go ahead and
output this and as you can see my little
monster now turn it into big monster and
this is useful when you're writing to a
database and you want everything
consistent since you know some people
type their names in all lowercase or all
capitals you usually want to change it
in the database to all capitals or all
lowercase so uh yeah that's it pretty
much or if you are like I said you can
change the first character now that you
know how to do that to the lowercase or
meaning the uppercase and the rest of
the lowercase that will add some
consistency if they're like filling out
a form or something and the last thing I
want to come over or excuse me go over
is this trim method right here now if a
user enters a bunch of spaces and you
don't want that to happen let's go ahead
and see what happens when we output it
outputs that bunch of spaces too since
it's part of the string but oftentimes
you want to get rid of that bunch of
spaces or those bunch of spaces whatever
not grammatically correct but who the
heck cares and all you have to do is
write trim in this trim method as you
can see it removes any white space or
space that's pretty much so let's go
ahead and mop and save this as you can
see my monster with a bunch of spaces
right here now turn into a monster with
no spaces at all so that's pretty much
all the string methods I'm going to be
going
right there's more but I mean you guys
don't really want to sit here and watch
me go over all these string methods or
you'll grow old so in the next tutorial
I'm probably going to be going over
recursion now everyone thinks recursion
is so confusing but I'm going to make it
really easy for you guys give the quick
one too and you guys are going to love
me so thank you guys for watching don't
forget subscribe and I'll see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
