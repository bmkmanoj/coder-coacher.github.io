going to and this is a game of a certain
destroy on Skid Row and we are music
silence to ump with no a UMP with
silencer marathon cold blooded and ninja
pro there's Oh missed the first blood by
about tenth of a second right there okay
in this video I'm going to talk
primarily about Skid Row like the actual
map just basically that justice map in
general this map is actually one of my
favorites just for the fact that there
are a lot of places to hide and there
are a lot of places there's a lot of
open places and there are a lot of not
open solutions like you see where this
guy is this guy is and as you probably
saw not as much of an open place or just
in general it's just missed a very
enclosed area it's probably where he is
right now is the most enclosed on the
entire map but it's not that he got 94
vertical for a loss and okay um Skid Row
especially on Search and Destroy um you
might have very different tactics like
certain distance get room is actually
one of my favorite map is not just
because it's a very good lab layout in
general
but the map you can do many things on it
like you can you can't use an assault
rifle you can the ump you can use a
sniper on this map and it's very useful
to know those things like you see where
I am right now where I'm about to go up
here you can snipe from you see where I
just are about to go in here you can
snipe from this point and if you're if
you're smart about it you can get kills
you can't and so what you can do who
that guy stole my kill from a throwing
knife um as I was saying I wouldn't
recommend it in search destroy but if it
was like domination or demolition
demolition actually I would because if
you're on the defensive side you pretty
much have that to care if you've got a
couple people there you probably you
most likely you're going to have that
place mostly just secure and defended
very well or if you've got like somebody
see where I am right now and I could
have died the next round wow that was
another kill steal and another epic fail
probably my team's far considering there
were two guys right there anyway back to
what I was saying I'm just doing um ah
ok I'm going to talk about this side of
the map even though I'm not going to be
on this side of the map for very long
that the offensive side of the map from
a search destroy standpoint or the a
side of domination what you do what you
should do if you're gonna use a UMP or
mp5k or something like that um i would
recommend just rushing out like crazy if
you're playing domination just try and
go straight to be get a bunch of bills
if you're on who got a little lucky
there if you're playing Search and
Destroy um I would never recommend
rushing up the middle because even I
have spawned tonight people from doing
that if you're going to if you are going
to rush out which I still would
recommend down the middle I'd recommend
rushing out to where I just was or where
I am go into this go into the room I
just was about a second ago and then
take a right in the triangle upstairs
something on you and here this is a Last
Man situation which is a one-on-one I
think for two on one and I think I go
clutch right here ok back to will just
note just wanted to say that real quick
back to what I was saying if you wanted
to know do not rush out through the
middle if I'm going to get through
anybody's head it should be this do not
rush out to the middle because you're
going to get you the response night or
killed by like a spaz 12 or something
like that thing looks like something
retarded or UAV and something you're
probably not going to like in this game
I just want to say first tactics for
search and destroy let's see I so one
it's a 1v1 situation I can tell that the
guys over there and I have time to plant
the bomb if you ever can do that and you
know it's a 1v1 and you know and you
know exactly where the person is you
couldn't even go and plant the bomb if
your next do it why not just why not
this is there's no point not to you get
extra points and it makes it even harder
if you get killed for the other person
to try and win so okay switching sides
I'm sorry if I just uh just randomly
stop talking about my last
said about my last all the way subject I
forgot what I was saying so I'm going to
continue on to what i was saying now
when i'm going to say now on this side
you say i have a care package you to
jail care packages sometimes can be very
good sometimes they can be very bad in
search and destroy like if you just get
a watch this watch the double kill for
lunch and then ooh I that was not fair I
brought up the scoreboard so that was
not fair okay um as I was saying what
was I saying lost my train of thought
again sorry about this I'm just like I'm
going in and out of telling what's in
the game and trying to talk about
tactics for the game oh that's right
care packages um care packages can be
very useful or can be very bad like
everybody's probably knows what the care
package glitch is and then pissed
everybody off the care package glitch
was personally I personally did and did
not like it I did like it because I was
able to use it or I did use it every now
and then like if I was just in its a
brand of domination game or something
like that somebody on my team started
using it if I had to merge the airdrop
why not I'm not don't say i'm a noob or
anything because i've only done that
like twice so just putting that out
there oh and um actually now i'm gonna
stop talking right here because that's
the end of the game and watch it this
actually looks pretty cool just watch
this through the smoke
sit down and yes and no I'm not copy
nobody's me lately we're going on just
wanted to say that anyway nine and three
Search and Destroy with a bomb plant a
pretty good game Kyle out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
