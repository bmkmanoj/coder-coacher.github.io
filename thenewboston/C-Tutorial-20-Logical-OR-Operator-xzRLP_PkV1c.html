in this tutorial we're gonna be going
over a logical or operator and just like
the or says in English it's gonna give
you a option and as long as one of those
options is true then it's gonna run the
code for example if you tell your mom
alright mom I want cookies or a grilled
cheese sandwich she can either bring you
cookies or a grilled cheese sandwich or
she can bring you cookies and a grilled
cheese sandwich and I bet you'll still
be happy so that's what's pretty much
gonna go on right now and that's what
I'm gonna teach you guys how to do but
in this tutorial we're gonna be making a
simple program that's well let's just do
it by ear so the first thing you need to
know before you even start is what the
or operator is and instead of the word
or it's the two parallel lines and those
are those it's above your Enter key and
your your return key on your keyboard if
you hold down shift so for example you
can put if five is greater than eight
which is false or if 2 is less than four
which is true the code is going to run
so instead of typing or you have to type
your or operator right there so let's go
ahead and create a simple program the
first thing that we're gonna want to do
is ask the user question so let's just
say do you do you think Hannah Montana
is hot
and then let's end the line so now we
have a question do you think Hannah
Montana is hot and then we have a new
line and after this line we want to make
an answer for it so since it's not a
number we have to use char and this
stands for a character I believe and
let's make our variable car call to
answer next we want the user to input
whatever they think it is so whatever
you use your inputs it's going to be
stored in the variable answer next we
have to give the user all the choices
actually let's do this Y or n since
that's what we want to use your to enter
Y or n in this of course stands for yes
or no so let's go ahead and say if your
answer let's say is equal to oops is
equal to Y or answer is equal to capital
Y then what do we want to output so if
you press yes oops let's change those a
single strings I don't know if I taught
you guys that yet well if you said yes
that Hannah Montana is hot then let's
output on the screen you effin perv I
hope my mom doesn't see this tutorial
but it's gonna teach you guys how to do
it so if they enter yes Hannah Montana
is hot we have to tell them that they
are effin perv um let's say else if
and let's just go ahead and copy this
and change these to knows else if your
answer is a lowercase n or an uppercase
and then remember this gives you two
choices right here else if you say no
but let's uh output on the screen copy
will output okay you're fine as I says
alright you're good to go
else and this is only in the case if you
don't output on the screen either
yes or no then we want to tell you
answer the question right idiot
since they're if they were too stupid
that press yes or no either upper case
or lower case then we lost all hope so
we're gonna go ahead and end our line
and that should be it with our program
so now to recap but oh well let's go
ahead and run this program before I
start recapping cuz I want to waste time
if I messed anything up so compile and
it's gonna ask do you think Hannah
Montana is hot let's go ahead and press
lowercase n it's gonna say ok you're
fine press any key to exit execute let's
compile and run this again and just to
show you guys the else statement do you
think Hannah Montana is hot let's say
being sausage what being sausage so then
it says answer the question right idiot
so again what we did here is we use the
logical operator or which is the two
parallel lines to give our user two
different options when answering and
this is useful in many cases this is
just one of the main cases that when you
want a user to input data but they can
input a bunch of ways say if you ask
them who was the first president they
can either say Washington
or George Washington or George
Washington with a couple capital W or
things like that so that's how programs
in C++ do that so you can practice this
code I'm gonna be copying all this code
to my website the new Boston comm so if
you want it you can check it out there
but uh copy this program and play around
with it and this is how you make a
simple program using the logical or
operator so again it's going to be in my
site than New Boston comm I hope you
enjoyed watching I hope you learned how
to make a simple do you think hannah
montana's ha program so again thanks for
watching and i'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
