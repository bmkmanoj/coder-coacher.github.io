pretty freaking sweet awesome you can
move around up-down left-right on the
keyboard I mean the monsters are moving
at the proper speed and he also if you
pay attention wherever our mouse is his
gun points at the proper angle so now we
have these monsters and we have this
dude right here with a gun so I think
the only logical thing to do right now
is allow him to actually shoot the
monsters I mean what's the point of his
life if he cannot go around shooting
monsters pretty pointless so let's give
his leg some meaning and allowed to do
just that so I think that it would be
good if we allowed a bullet to come from
this gun every time we clicked with a
mouse because our keyboard is actually
kind of busy with the up-down left-right
movement so this will give the player
you know make it a little more playable
so what we need to do is we need to add
an event now this event is going to
consist of two things first it's going
to have the condition whenever the user
clicks the mouse and the event is going
to be shoot a bullet pretty easy so um
I'll show you guys it's kind of a tricky
way not that intuitive so I'm going to
show you guys how to do this now we want
to add an event or going to double-click
whatever you want to do and it's a mouse
event because this is pretty much the
thing that you're checking for the thing
you're waiting to happen so double click
Mouse and for this choose on click so
click next and it says what button do
you want to use well the left one is the
you know default one that's the one that
people always click and the click type
we can just leave that as click the
default and click done so now our game
is going to check when the user clicks
on their mouse and we didn't have
anything happen yet so that's why we
need to add the action the thing that's
going to happen so what's going to
happen when they click their mouse will
click action and press this oh I got a
frog in my throat so you may be thinking
ok we want something happen to the
bullet but what we actually want to do
in this player in the student I kind of
just give it away
and this is
I shouldn't say instance that's another
thing in this occasion is we want
something to happen to the player and
I'll show you what or I'll explain it
whenever they click we want a bullet to
be generated right on that players gun
that's where we want to create the
bullet so in order to do that you don't
look at the bullet you look at where the
player is I know this isn't that
intuitive but you guys are going to see
what I'm doing in just a second so we
want something to happen to that user
so click player and now what we want to
do is we want to scroll down and look
for a word called spawn so what we want
to do is we want to spawn another object
so double click that and now what's
going to happen is every time we click
on the mouse some object is going to
appear where that player was so that's
all we're saying
so that way wherever the player is
that's where the bullets appear because
he has the gun obviously so what object
do we want to appear well we want the
bullet to appear that's when we click
bullet and now this layer we can just go
ahead and press 1 because as you can see
over here we want it to appear in the
main layer that's where all of our
sprites are the monsters the main
character so on and so forth the
background we don't want to appear there
and for the image point we can just go
ahead and leave at 0 right now and I'm
going to be showing you guys the problem
with this and how to fix it in the next
tutorial
so click done and now basically what
this is saying is whenever the user
clicks on the mouse what's going to
happen is a bullet is going to appear
right where the player is and remember
the the nature of a bullet if we click
on this right here as soon as a bullet
is created it comes out with a speed of
600 in it and it also has bullet
behavior which mean it goes in one
direction so we don't need to program
that at all that's just the nature of a
bullet whenever one gets created it
starts acting like a bullet how awesome
is that
so now once you go ahead and run this
you see that was the original one that
first came out
on the screen and now whenever I click
with the mouse a bullet gets spawned
right where this player is and whatever
angle he's pointing the puller travels
they say pull it the bullet travels in a
straight line 600 pixels per second and
it doesn't have return but I'm going to
go ahead and click this a bunch of times
and look carefully at my player if you
can since we have that origin point or
the image point as you guys saw it at
zero what that means is it's going to
spawn right in the middle of our player
which means it's going to come right
from the top of the head which looks
kind of weird because he doesn't have a
gun taped to his head
the guns in front of his hands so how do
we have the bullets originate from his
gun rather than the top of his head well
in the next tutorial that's what I'm
going to teach you guys it's actually
pretty easy so uh for now just remember
that whenever you're making bullets come
from a gun the action that you want to
add is actually a player action and it
spawns and creates a bullet like that so
a little you know not that intuitive but
now that we're done with that we can go
move on to something out so thank you
guys for watching don't forget subscribe
