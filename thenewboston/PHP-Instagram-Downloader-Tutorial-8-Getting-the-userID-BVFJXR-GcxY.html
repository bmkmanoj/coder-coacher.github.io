couple tutorials we learned how to
connect with Instagram and we also learn
how to get the users name but I got a
little bad news for you
you really can't do much with a username
with an Instagram API and the reason for
that is because whenever that Instagram
database identifies user it doesn't use
the user's name it actually use a user
ID and the user ID is associated with
the username but you need this user idea
to pretty much use everything in the
database or the API so how do we get
this user ID well let me go ahead and
show you so make a comment I'll plug in
Instagram user ID and we'll just make a
simple function called get user ID and
also from here on out this user ID is
what we're going to be using to get all
the pictures and everything from the
database not the user name so of course
since we have the username already
that's the information we want pass in
username so we're going to be giving it
the username which is in my case the New
Boston and it's gonna be returning my
user ID which is I don't know what it is
yet and I have an itch in my ear but oh
whoa so the very first thing that we
need is a URL not this one but I'm gonna
steal it for right now and the URL is
API Instagram comm /v 1 slash and the
parameter for whenever we want to get
users is of course users I'm just gonna
type out the query like I did last time
and what we wanted to do is we want to
search for users and the where's the
can't even find a freaking queue on my
keyboard the Q parameter which I'm just
gonna set equal to X access for now this
is the user name why they named it queue
I don't know maybe for a query or
something and the next thing we need is
of course the client
ID to verify that we are who we say we
are and I'm just going to set this equal
to X X X as well so of course now what
we can do is since we've passed in this
user name and remember this is pretty
much equal to the New Boston right now
just close up this and I'm mixing double
quotes with single quotes which is never
a good idea so basically right now are
you are actually I'll do this client ID
real quick let me give you guys some
breathing room all right
actually I wasn't playing that up but
that's what she said
so basically now our UI URL is user
search Q is equal to the new Boston and
we can append that with our client ID
which is this and that just lets um the
Instagram API know in the database know
that we are registered developers we do
have access to your database boot mode
roasted and give us what we want so now
that we have that URL all we need to do
now is connect to Instagram using this
and check out how easy this is
first let's store everything in variable
and just name this it's the gram info so
any of our results that we get which is
in this case the user ID is going to be
stored in this Instagram info variable
and now if we just set this equal to
connect to Instagram basically connect
give us this information which is the
username store an Instagram info but
remember the results are encrypted so we
need to decode them or encode it should
I say results equal see if I could steal
this from somewhere there so that line
it looks pretty down there alright sir
the results are equal to JSON decode
but this is our variable so now our nice
pretty results that we can work with are
in this variable right here results so
what we can do is actually just return
this result in how to pull the actual
user ID from it is is actually stored in
data by the way did did you guys ever
see out of the movie her there's a joke
and it uses the word data and that's
what I was thinking about right now if
anyone is interested anyway so I'll shut
up now in ID so basically what we said
is hey we have the the user's username
and we want the ID so this is the URL
that I get it from I want to connect
with you okay you gave it to me okay
this is how I display it so right now
it's just returning it but if we want to
we can actually print that out so
instead of echoing the username what we
can do is actually let's just echo this
instead of returning it just for testing
purposes we'll just print it out on the
screen and I guess we can just go ahead
and I don't want to echo too much stuff
here
so echo
I definitely could have played this like
a thousand times faster all right so I
guarantee I just like copy and paste of
like a thousand things incorrectly but
we'll see how this goes see if I missed
something done up alone yet Hoss
all right so first let's start here 63
right yeah at 63 okay I miss the
semicolon anything else all right so I'm
logging in logged in it converted my
user name to a user ID boom there it is
apparently my user ID on Instagram is
184 to 89 to 91 if anyone was wondering
and I'm sure you were so now that we
have that user ID we can do things like
get images finally it's gonna be awesome
and actually in the very next tutorial
I'm gonna be showing you guys how to
print and pretty much get images from
Instagram and print them out right on
your web page
so you know it's definitely gonna be a
lot more interesting than that so thank
