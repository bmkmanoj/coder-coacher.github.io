the dashboard so my wiring kit came
pretty much really simple all you have
to do is clip everything into the proper
place but before I start doing that let
me go ahead and talk you guys through
what everything is this right here is
nothing if you want to add something
else then I you can right there
but we start right here this is the gear
indicator so when you shift you know
what gear you're going to be in it says
like our fervor so on and so forth this
is the horn honk honk these are your
turn signals whenever you click it to
the right
you click it to the left and if you you
have to like kind of feel to get it back
in the middle it's like a half click
almost to get it back without turning
left or right right here is where our
ignition is going to go put your key in
there turn it these are of course your
lights fog lights and headlights in this
last button is your four ways or your
what did some people call them the
hazard lights so now with that being
said right here it's basically a chunk
of plastic it does nothing right now
what we need to make it work is all of
this wiring right here I'm saying ok I
know nothing about electronics I am
going to have no idea what's going on
well whenever you buy a wiring kit what
it's going to do is it's going to tell
you which each piece goes to already so
it's pretty much going to look like a
bunch of wires colored wires in
depending on the color from the wire
that's how you know where to plug it in
so let's go ahead and I guess we might
as well work left to right and we'll go
ahead and start with the lights which
are white yellow and blue so the white
goes at the top so plug this into your
lights if I can in hopefully you should
hear snap if I can get my big old
fingers in there okay lights come on
there we go all right so now our lights
are hooked up now what we got to do is I
mean our fog lights that's what these
are now what I'm going to do is hook up
the head
it's now the top one goes yellow and
candy cane colored and I say candy cane
because it's half red FY reminds me of a
candy cane so plug that in there I felt
a little snap now the bottom one is
candy cane and brown which is this one
right here so plug this in and now your
headlights are ready to go now the next
one right here this is where your
ignition goes where you turned in the
key but you put this in a little bit
different than just to put the ignition
if you guys are like ok where do I bolt
this thing on I just stick it through no
it's not Finn what you need to do is you
actually need to unscrew the area around
the tip of the ignition or key hole now
just go ahead and put it through and on
the other side I know if you guys auntie
yep you can go ahead and this is always
a pain to do these threads see if I can
get it come on baby alright there we go
now I guess technically it doesn't need
to be directly up and down but I'm kind
of OCD about that I like it to have up
and down so now that it's tight you can
now stick the key in and turn it it's
going to kick off your starter now the
only other things that we have to
install are the horn which goes right
there first and hold it so you guys can
see in the turn signals now the horn is
this red and purple wire and where is it
right well I guess it's a candy cane
color I called it red and purple but
candy cane purple and again these aren't
the industry standards for these wires
whenever you get your wire you can look
at the diagram to see what your colors
are and the last thing which would be
these turn signals right here the turn
signals are I guess it's kind of a tan
blue and grey so go ahead and stick this
in and actually it needs to go this way
got it
runway and that's another thing you see
how these are three wires gray blue and
tan how do you know to stick it with the
gray on the left or the tan on the left
and the cool thing is about these clips
that whenever you click them in they're
only going to go a certain way if you
try to clip it in in the opposite way
then it's not going to fit so now the
only other things that we have to do is
put in our gear indicator and also our
relays but what we said that later so go
ahead and start with your gear indicator
and this is such a pain okay because let
me go ahead and show you guys I have no
one else to complain to so might as well
complain to you guys see these little
tiny screws that's like less than seven
millimeter so those are always a pain to
work with but I'm going to go ahead try
to screw it in right now I will use a
eyeglass repair kit to turn these
frickin screws okay oh holy crap finally
now that we got all of the main
electronics taken care of the only other
thing that we need to do is we need to
install these relays now without going
into you know how electronics work a
relay is basically uncle oh really is
basically a little electronic that the
most common use is whenever you have a
circuit that doesn't use a lot of
electricity and you want it to control a
circuit that uses a lot of electricity
for example sometimes people have
electronic switches just so you can turn
something on and off now of course the
switch itself doesn't use a lot of
electricity hardly any at all but if you
wanted it to control something that
didn't use a lot of electricity like for
example on this go-cart the thing that
uses the most electricity is probably
whenever you're trying to start the
engine and before it gets a kicked off
and can run
bi-fuel it need to start from the
battery the starter sucks a lot of
electricity as soon as you're starting
this baby oh so like I said that's what
relays are for just go ahead and look on
your electronic diagram to see when you
need them if you're not very familiar
with electronics basically a circuit
that uses a little electricity to
control one that uses a lot of
electricity alright guys so that's it
your wiring of your dashboard is now
complete but before you can go ahead and
pat yourself on the back and move on to
the next step what we need to do is
actually mount this dashboard on the
frame so go ahead and remove all of the
bolts to mount it on so there you have
it a perfectly wired dashboard now your
go kart has a shift indicator which
tells you what gear you're in a horn
turn signals it has the electronic
starter which is always nice lights and
your four ways or hazard lights whatever
you want to call them so how awesome is
that in the next video we're going to be
doing is probably hooking up the rest of
this wiring which consists of a little
crappie brake little indicator right
there and then who knows but I'm excited
I'm getting excited I'm ready to drive
this thing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
