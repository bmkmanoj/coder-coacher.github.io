show you how to get up and running with
scene builder and this is scene builder
right here and what it is is a visual
editor for F XML files so now that we
know how to work with F XML files
through code what Oracle did is they
actually built this visual editor and
just by looking at it you can already
see exactly what it is basically a
little visual editor where you can drag
and drop items and edit all of their
properties and settings manually it's
really useful so first thing I should
probably do is tell you guys how to
download it and to download it the link
is actually a little bit tricky to find
you go to this link right here not going
to read it out because it's kind of
weird 139 to 102 HTML or whatever and if
you scroll down they have a bunch of
stuff you can download the last link is
JavaFX
scene builder so click on that and you
can see all the different versions you
probably want the latest one 2.0 and of
course pick whatever system you have I
am using it for Windows so I would have
clicked that but I already have it
installed I'm not going to take you
through the installation process because
is incredibly simple this is just a
wizard you click next next next next you
have on your system so what you can do
is you can just like put an icon on your
system so you can double click it and
this opens up and this is basically arm
one of the templates so what I did to
open this is I just choose file new from
template and I think this one is just
one of the basic applications or if you
want a brand new project that's
completely brick blank you can just
choose file new and it will give you a
blank one but I want to choose a little
template so I can actually show you guys
a couple different things about it and
in the next tutorial what I'm going to
do is I'm going to be building a sample
interface for ona we'll say we're making
a program about like I don't know we'll
just make something up but before I get
to all that actually want to go over
some terminology real quick so this of
course at the top is the menu bar you
already know that is I'm not going to
know explain how to like arm cut things
because
you already know that's this right here
this is called the path selection and
message bar now remember whenever we
make an interface in F XML it's not like
making it through Java code we're
actually making it in a hierarchy that's
what XML is it's a hierarchy of elements
so that's the useful thing about this
you can actually look at the parent and
all of their children or grandchildren
and you can select them really easily
now also in this little section in the
bottom left this is called the document
panel this gives you another visual
visualization it's kind of a goofy word
of your element so our overall layout is
a VBox things are going to be arranged
vertically and then inside there we have
a menu bar and an anchor pane which is
this little area right here now of
course you can see this is pretty cool
because you can actually drag these
things to resize them if you want so in
this top left area this is called the
library panel basically any control or
layout that you want to add you can
actually add by dragging it and dropping
it and actually let me show you guys
this I'm going to select a view box
which is my entire layout and hit delete
so now we just have a blank window
that's what this is simulating so the
first thing we always want to add to it
is some kind of layout so I might as
well just add view box like before so
you can take it and drag it right there
and now we have a V box so of course we
can just do something like if you want
to add the actual controls like buttons
and text fields there under the control
section let me just drag one of those
out and drop it right like that so you
know I don't really need to explain how
to drag-and-drop this is all very
intuitive which is really awesome and by
the way this section right here is
called the content panel all of your
layout in visual elements that are going
to go with your interface they go in the
content panel right here now one other
thing I want to point out is this
whenever you select an item this area
this is called the inspector panel it
changes depending on what you have
selected
so we have a button selected right now
so these are going to give us all of the
properties for your button the layout
the code and the layout well of course
you know it's just like the spacing the
padding the properties are the color the
text on it and the code is remember we
talked about IDs and controllers and
stuff like that whenever I show you guys
in actual example in the next video I'll
talk to you guys about this stuff and
you know if you want to give it an ID or
whatever but there you go that's the
real quick basic you know overview of
how do you seem builder and in the next
story I'm going to show you guys how to
build a really awesome
on layout and it's everything is going
to make a lot more sense
so think guys for watching I'll see you
then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
