buddy Blackford here with another After
Effects cs6 tutorial and last tutorial I
use displacement map to move around the
layers and it was a compound effect
where you had to use a another layer to
drive how the effect worked and in this
tutorial I'm gonna show you how to use
another effect that After Effects is
created well we don't really have to use
that layer to drive what's going on it's
gonna be less custom but it's gonna be
easier and quicker to use so it all
depends on what you want to do and how
you want your look to look so this
effect is going to be called turbulent
displace so let's go on I'll show you
what I have going on here we'll start
from scratch but this is what we're
gonna make now if you can see I'll zoom
in the text is actually just basic text
and I threw on this turbulent displace
and it moves so we can create like a
jello effect I guess and movement effect
there so let's start from scratch and
see what's going on let's delete this so
I just have text and I'm going to throw
on turbulent displace with its default
settings which brings it out to
something cool like this so we've got a
lot of amount on here we've got
different types of displacements so
there's bulge twist smoother I mean all
this the the amount is up pretty high so
some of these are going to be moved
around a decent amount so if I move the
amount down maybe I won't they won't be
so like crazy looking and everything
like that but we'll keep it at 50 for
now so we can go through the rest
we've got vertical displacement which is
just gonna do the up-and-down not the
left and right kind of like kind of
reminds me of uh like a Microsoft
Publisher kind of looking thing it's
horizontal
so you can see I like that and the last
one cross saw see that so I like
turbulent and let's bring the amount
down with chai 20 and see what that
looks like I mean that's fine and the
size will also have an effect here you
can see how that affects it it affects
how much the evolution affects what's
going on here and like the size will
affect the like the middle of the if
it's a higher size it'll affect the
middle of the text more and displace it
even farther out and everything like
that so size and amount are 1 and 1
together like spaghetti and meatball all
right so I'll stop that and we've got
the offset here on which we can use to
show I don't know just kind of like move
around it's not really too much it's
just like almost like a random seat
generator it depends on what you want
where you want to put it you could
animate this around and get this kind of
effect if you would like to kind of like
a liquify looking effect but that's a
that's why that's because of our size
and amount here now if I move this size
up and then move this around it's gonna
be more let me try moving the size up
even more and our amount even more and
you can see how this will affect it even
more like that just get these back to
where we want them now that's just the
evolution is the pretty much how to make
this move so we can start at anything
that we want to get on different random
seeds and if I start this at something
like 3 and a keyframe it will come out
to here you could even start at 0 if you
want and go to 3.5
Oh point five is good for seven seconds
we've got the complexity here which'll I
mean just it'll change how much it
affects the edges there so right now
it's got like a different it's like a
rough edges look like a like a just like
rusting apart or something like that and
then down here it'll be more like a
liquidy on a lesser complexity so I'll
put it back to one
evolution options we've got just a bunch
of different evolution different just a
just a change what it looks like and all
that stuff so you don't really need to
work worry too much about this and then
I mean best quality of course you can
try that or to put on the anti-aliasing
if you want it's just gonna make the
render time a little longer but that's
fine it's this isn't a hugely hugely
intensive effect so I guess that's how
you use the turbulent displace and it's
I'm pretty cool in my effect so or in my
opinion so that's pretty awesome let's
head on to another tutorial I guess and
I'm King remember what I was just gonna
say cuz some girl sent me a picture and
I'm distracted now so thanks for
watching this tutorial everybody I look
forward to seeing you at the next one
have a good one everybody</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
