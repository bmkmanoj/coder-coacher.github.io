grouping and when you're grouping things
together it's a good way to put related
information in one section so I mean but
you want to do it correctly in a way
that looks professional and is easy to
read so if you are looking to have a
garage sale and you're putting out
flyers and you put this one out up here
on the top it's gonna look pretty crappy
so you want to keep the relevant
information together like huge sale and
everything price to sell is information
that's relevant to the sale and then the
phone number the time and the address is
relevant to where the how the person is
able to get to the sale the last rule I
want to go over with you is called
kerning and I need to type that in here
and what kerning is is the individual
space between characters so in between
letters pretty much so a lot of times
when you're typing in and you put a
capital letter in and then a lowercase
letter
sometimes the spacing is off in between
and you'll have like bad looking lines
or whatever so I demonstrated a bad
kerning up here if you look in between
the H in the you there is a larger space
there than in between the U and a G and
the G and the e now you want to use this
right here so if you put your if you put
your text tool in between and move this
in
to where it looks like it's about
correct and then in between s and a you
can see a little bit more subtly how the
spacing is incorrect so then you would
want to move this back in once again and
then if you put your cursor in between
some letters here you can see how much
space you should probably have let me
get back in there
in between your your to your two letters
so it looks like I went in way too far
between the s and a so let me go in
there and remember how much spacing I
had between the a and the s and make it
a little a little bit more out now if
you look in here there's another area
where the kerning is a terrible and if
you guessed it it's over here on this s
so we would want to bring that in also
and now when everything has the same
spacing it looks way more professional
yeah another rule that I want to go over
is the use of quotes and a lot of time
when you see people make things on
Facebook they'll use quotes so like
those little pictures I have
inspirational sayings and stuff that the
girls like to post all the time on their
Facebook pages so here is the correct
way to use quotes and you want to use
the curly looking quotes here and you
don't really want to use these straight
quotes and when you're typing you want
to make sure that they're facing the
correct way also you don't want them
both to go straight down so the way to
make that happen is to come into the
character panel make sure you have you
smart quotes selected if you don't then
it's just going to put quotes in the
wrong position and it's going to look
like crap the second-to-last
one that I want to rule that I'm gonna
go over you guys is the use of drop
shadow now as of five 23 2014 drop
shadow is pretty much outdated and
you'll only really see it in old text
books and it's pretty much something
from the year 2000 and around that time
so drop shadow is outdated don't use it
right now with your professional text
after this there's only one more to go
and and that'll be it for the typography
things that I want you to know and on
the last one here I wanted to let you
guys know to avoid dated fonts the two
most dated fonts that everybody used to
use and in professional looking
companies still use sometimes is comic
sans and papyrus those are the two most
I don't know they're just the worst fun
so you can use don't use those I mean
you'll see papyrus and a bunch of like
spa and you can see already the kerning
when I type it it's already terrible on
papyrus Comic Sans is just like goofy
looking and looks like a little kid
wrote it doesn't look professional so
avoid outdated fonts I don't really see
too many people using Times New Roman
anymore we've switched to Arial and I
wanted to show you a correct the correct
way now I found this website that is
pretty good and it has a hundred percent
free fonts and it also has fonts that
you can buy which are in a whole
different section but here we go
it's called font squirrel and if you
read this it's it's a good font for a
graphic design and all these look
professional as you can see and they're
pretty easy to read I mean this one
might be used for not as much as all
these other ones but they've got some
pretty nice-looking fonts here and
they're all free so there's a whole
bunch of different tags here what you
can look for and then you can also buy
fonts if you want to have more of a
unique font that something not
everybody's gonna use but that's a
that's it I'm not trying to I wasn't
trying to promote that website I was
just giving you guys a website to use
instead of like the the ones that
everybody uses that has all their like
the goofy fancy fonts on it that are
like used for maybe like one thing so
make sure your font library is nice and
then in another tutorial I'll show you
how to install these fonts it's a really
really easy and you don't even need to
have to do anything in after-effects
it's all outside of it but if you want
new fonts what you always probably will
then I'll show you that later on so
thanks for watching about the different
rules those are some of the more
important ones that I like to show you
go onto google and search for typography
rules or anything like that to see what
what is used now and keep you up to date
on what's going on you don't want to be
out of date because that's when you
start looking unprofessional so thanks
for watching and I'll see you guys in
the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
