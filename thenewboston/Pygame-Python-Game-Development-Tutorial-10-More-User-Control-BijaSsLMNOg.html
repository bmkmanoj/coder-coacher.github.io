10th PI game tutorial video in the last
video we were talking about how we can
make movement occur frames per second
all of that in this video I almost
forgot but I wanted to show you guys how
you can do a more typical movement so in
our case as soon as we hit an arrow key
we want the character in this case a
snake to continue its movement but in
most cases you actually only want to
continue the movement while users
holding the key and as soon as they let
up the key you stop the movement now
initially we saw that our first idea was
to do just that modifying the variable
here but then we saw well actually the
holding of a key down does not actually
it's not an event right the holding of a
key only the pressing of a key and the
releasing of a key those two things are
events everything in between is not an
event so the question is how can we
handle that kind of event or at least
make it feel to the user like that's
what we're doing is we're saying okay
you're still holding the key down well
we basically have to ask is the user
still holding the key down so to handle
something like now we'll come down here
and we would say now we're asking here
if event type equals PI game key down
well in this case we're asking if it was
a key down and we saw that we can change
directions no problem so what we'll do
and this modifies the lead X change
right but what we can do instead is then
at the bottom here we can say if event
dot type double equals PI game dot and
instead of key down we're going to say a
key up so if it's a key up now what do
we want to do well we could make this
really simple and just a lead X equal
exchange equals zero but we don't
actually do that because um because then
it could be any key like what if they
accidentally hit Q or something so then
we need to ask um if event dot key
equals PI game dot and then we say K
underscore left's and then we also we're
going to throw in an or here let me move
this
so does it run in a month my pretty face
or event dot key equals PI game dot K
underscore right so if that was a left
or right arrow key that we released what
do we want to do well we would say lead
X change equals what that's right zero
uh like a children's show anyway and
that's it that's all we would have to do
hopefully let me go ahead and run that
and that should be it so we get our
thing up here we start at zero now when
you pull the arrow key but then we
release the arrow key and you see how it
stopped and then we can go the other way
and release zero key and stop so that's
how we can handle a more typical use of
like you want to press the arrow key to
let the character move and then when
they release it the character stops
moving but for a snake we actually want
to continue moving you know you only
really change your direction with a poke
of the arrow key and that's it but if
the state doesn't continue moving that
means a game is just too easy so we
don't really want it to be too easy for
the user so let's go ahead and X out of
this this and then so obviously to
revert back all we have to do is just
delete this here and then we can run
this now obviously there are a few
problems here we still can't move up and
down yet so we're going to have to cover
that and then after we cover that so
we're back to it reading the typicals
name after we cover that the next thing
we have to cover is well what happens
here we just go right off the screen so
I'm off this monitor I'm probably on
this monitor now and then I'm probably
like way over here now and it's so we
need to bring it back so I brought I
just hit the arrow key to bring it back
so hopefully it will come back but you
can see that we're really we don't need
boundaries here there it is and now he's
going to go off the other screen so we
have to add some sort of boundaries and
again the PI game does not just know
when you've hit a boundary of the window
like there's no it doesn't know that and
then same thing to when you like draw
objects PI game isn't going to just
automatically know you know
just because your picture is um a car
and you run that car into a wall picture
pygame doesn't know that's a crash you
know no but the user knows that that
should have been a crash so we kind of
like make it gaming is really just one
big illusion for the human to play so um
and that's what we have to do so we need
to add boundaries to this and then later
on we'll add you know like the Apple and
stuff like that and then crashing into
ourselves that's obviously a you know
game over and all of that so we'll be
adding boundaries in a little bit here
but first let's get up and down working
then we'll add boundaries and then a pro
at will add the Apple and all that stuff
so anyway stay tuned for that
oh that was helpful for you guys I know
not everybody aspires just to make a
snake game so I did just want to show
you guys how you can make the arrow keys
kind of act like it's continuing to move
because you're holding the clip so
that's it for that video stay tuned the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
