my 12th Python tutorial and in this
story when you're talking to you guys
about some more functions that you can
do with lists now the first function I
want to talk about is the length
function and what this is is pretty much
it gets the length of anything or all
the elements in your list or sequence so
let me make a list real quick and I'll
put this to use
let's have let me think let's say we
have a list called numbers in let's just
type a couple of numbers a 1 4 17 let me
think randomly 28 165 and lastly 7
booyah
now actually I want to name this numbers
plural and now we have a list or
sequence call numbers now as I said we
can get the length of all the elements
in this list by typing us function
called length or le n and this is short
for length so nu MBRs what you have to
do is type the function and then type
whatever you want to get the length of
and press Enter and as you can see it
says 7 and what this means is there are
7 elements in here 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 so this
is a function a very simple one that you
can use to get the length or number of
elements in your list or sequence
another thing that you can do is get
instead of le n you can type max right
there and that will give you the maximum
number in your list so tag max numbers
and then it says 165 is the biggest
number in your list and of course since
they made a max function they also made
a mint function numbers the minimum
number right there is 1 and that's right
here are 1 so again length returns the
number of elements max returns the
biggest value minimum returns a smallest
value and another thing I want to talk
to
as about another function is called a
list function and what a list function
does is take any string of text such as
Bucky and it converts it to a list and
this is because there's a lot of
different things that you can do to list
that you can't just do to a string
function or excuse me touch string so
this once you convert it to a list it
allows you to perform all list functions
on it and some of those list functions
I'm going to talk to you guys about
right now some things that you could do
to the list but you couldn't do to a
string of text and this involves using
index notation to add a new value to the
list so remember we have this list
numbers that was eight one four
seventeen twenty eight one sixty five
and seven what we can do if we want to
change an element in that list is we can
simply type numbers again make it equals
and type a 1 we can do all that and give
it a whole new kind of order or elements
or we can do something a little easier
and by a little easier I mean a lot
easier so kind of confused you there but
what we can do is this any element we
want to change just reference the
element right there and remember three
remember it starts with zero so zero one
two three so we're saying alright that
third element which is actually the
fourth seventeen we want to change you
to 77 so now put number three which is
actually the fourth number in your list
equals 77 then press ENTER and we're
getting an error and I know why because
I put number instead of numbers this is
so embarrassing numbers had to think
about that for a second three equals 77
guarantee it works same what I tell you
now instead when you actually type the
right name
what you do is when we output this on
our screen it now has changed that value
of 17 to 77 so that is how you use to
reference it in index notation and then
just assign a new value and that allows
you to type just one specific value
instead of having to retype your whole
entire list so that is how you do that
and since you can change values in your
list you can also delete elements in
your list and this is even easier say
that number we just changed 77 what if
we are looking at our list but yeah we
don't want that anymore what we can do
is put de el and this is another
built-in function to delete elements of
your list
so de ou deletes an element or takes it
away from the list so let's go ahead and
type numbers I'm going to type in
numbers at this time and not number and
we want to delete the third element from
the list so go ahead and hit enter and
it just deleted that element from the
list don't believe me numbers there we
go
look at this our last list was eight one
four seventy seven seventy seven twenty
eight one six two five seven now our
list is eight one four where the 77 go
BAM we deleted it using this little
function right here and now instead of
selling seven elements our list only has
six elements so that's how you can take
away elements out of the list so again I
showed you guys how to use the length
function I showed you guys had to use
Max and min to get the biggest and
smallest values I showed you guys how to
change a string of text to list and how
to perform some simple changing elements
in the list and also deleting elements
from list so learning that um it's going
to come in useful later on if not right
now so thank you guys for watching don't
forget to subscribe check out all my
other tutorials and contests and I'll
see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
