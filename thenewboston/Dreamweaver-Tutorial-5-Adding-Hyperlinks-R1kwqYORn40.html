Dreamweaver tutorial last time we talked
about lists and how to format a
paragraph and this time I'm gonna be
talking you guys about basic links and
how to create them and what a link is if
you don't know it's something that you
click and it takes you to another
webpage or website now there are two
types of links to help you navigate
around the web one is called absolute
link and one is called a relative link
these are links we're going to be making
on our website anytime we want to go to
an entirely different website we're
gonna be using an absolute link and
anytime we just want to go to another
page on our our own website we're gonna
be using a relative link now first let
me show you guys how to create an
absolute link select any text that you
want to turn into a link I've added this
word link and I'm gonna be making this a
hyperlink scroll down here to your
properties panel till you see the word
link and select your cursor inside the
text box and this is where you add the
address of any website that you want so
we will use YouTube and anytime you use
absolute link you need to type HTTP the
full address so type
http:www.youtube.com/watch
now if we click out of it we can see
that the word link is now blue and
underlined this is telling us that our
hyperlink worked and that is now a link
so let's save this and go ahead and view
it in a web browser and see if it worked
as you can see if you click the word
link and now takes us to the YouTube
home site
so let's X out of that in the next link
I'm gonna be showing you how to make
it's called a relative link this is the
link one or more pages of your own
website together so first the first
thing we need if we want to link to more
web pages is another web page so let's
go ahead and click file and create a new
web page again and first we need to save
this as I'll save this as web page two
and safe and under the same place you
saved your first web page for example
don't save one on your desktop and one
on a pendrive
so now that we have our second web site
let's just type this is website two
just so we can help distinguish website
one and a website too so I'm gonna save
that and go back to the main website our
homepage the next thing we want to do is
type some text so let's say website -
this is going to become a link it's a
website number - it's a same webpage but
it's on our same website so now that we
highlighted that scroll over to the link
box where you typed your absolute link
for YouTube but don't type anything in
it
anytime you're linking a same webpage
from your website just click on the
folder and find that website under
wherever you saved it and double click
it as you can see now in the link box it
automatically saved the website in your
link box and now automatically
referenced it to your hyperlink as you
can see we now have a blue underline
saying that website to our text is now a
hyperlink so let's go ahead and save
that and take a look at what it looks
like
as you can see in our web browser if we
click the link for website - it now
takes us to our second website that we
created and this is how you create links
between one page in your website to
another page but let's say you want it
to be able to click an object such as an
image and have that also take you to a
website to do this you do the exact same
thing is text so let's say I wanted to
make this banner a link to Google so I
click the banner and you'll see a black
outline around it and that's let you
know that you selected it then down here
in this link box you have to type the
full name for Google so type HTTP WWE
google.com now save it and let's take a
look at what it looks like in the
browser as you can see when we click our
banner and now takes us the Google
and again with images you can use both
absolute and relative links most people
click their banner image and have it go
back to the homepage so if you want to
do that it's a pretty useful technique
the next link I want to talk to you guys
about is the mail to link this is the
link where you click and automatically
opens up a person's mail program so
let's say whenever you clicked omit oops
email me then we wanted it to open up a
web program so they can email us so in
the link box type in this mail too with
a colon and type whatever email address
you want them to use the email you so
I'll type staff at the New Boston comm
and now you can see that is created a
hyperlink now whenever the viewer clicks
this it's going to open up whatever
email program they have and it's going
to automatically start to email you now
that's all the time we have for right
now but in the next topic we're going to
be discussing how to change the links
remove a link style your link and also
be learning about images and if you need
to and if you need help with anything we
went over today you can just go to my
