to do is I want to talk to you about
some problems that we have with string
lengths and some things that you
definitely want to look out for if you
don't want your program to crash so
let's go ahead and create a simple array
and we'll say that we're going to store
the name of a movie it doesn't really
matter what and so we have that and then
we'll put char make a pointer to it all
the stuff we learned the last couple
videos and remember whenever you are set
a pointer equal to an array do not use
that ampersand because the name of your
array is already a memory address so
don't do it twice or you're going to
mess them crap up but anyways we already
know what those lines do no need for
explanation the point of this tutorial
is this right now we have an array that
holds 20 characters 20 items but what if
we're making a program where we let the
user enter the name of a movie and their
title has more than 20 characters well
then you're going to have a really bad
time because some really messed up stuff
is going to happen what's going to
happen is it's going to try to store
that title that long title and in the
process it can overwrite some of your
data that's already in your memory
because it's storing stuff that you did
a reserved space for in your memory so
what we need to do is we need to allow
kind of check and balance just in case
the user doesn't follow directions or
accidentally enter something longer than
20 characters and that is this little
function right here it's F gets now I'll
explain exactly what this does but
basically the job of the function is to
take input from the user from the
keyboard and if they enter more than a
certain amount it just cuts it off for
example put P movie 20 then put STD in
and out explain you guys what this means
right now so just like gets it pretty
much gets input from the keyboard in
this standard n right here that just
means standard input in other words the
standard input from your computer
is your keyboard other types of input
could be like from a file or on you from
the internet if yours in like another
program language but anyways that's what
that means right here now what these
parameters mean is pretty much store it
and right here so store the data in P
movie and also this xx means this is the
maximum amount of characters that we're
going to store in P movie if they enter
a really long title then take what's
ever at the end and just cut it off so
you only get the first 20 characters no
matter what so now we can just do
something to display that like puts P
movie you know whenever I do check this
out
I'm going to run this and we don't have
any prompts but pretty much is saying
okay give me the title of a movie I'll
put something right where along like
Bucky is awesome
at programming and he likes dumplings
you know probably a movie that I would
definitely see in theaters but hit enter
and it's going to print it out and it's
going to say Bucky is awesome app and
that's it I told you you had 20
characters so dude you can't store any
more than that or you're going to mess
up the program so again whenever you're
allowing the user to enter titles and
stuff like that make sure that you use
this F gets function if you don't your
program is going to crash your computer
is going to be ruined and you're going
to go to jail for the rest of your life
but anyways I thank you guys for
watching don't forget subscribe and in
the next video we're going to be talking
about the heap I'll see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
