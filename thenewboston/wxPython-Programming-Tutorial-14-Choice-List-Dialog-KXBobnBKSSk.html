tutorial and in this tutorial we'll be
teaching you guys a little more about
modal's or models whatever they're
called and also I'm me teaching guys how
to make a simple list of actually well
someone actually google mo let's get
type M oh come on
mo da o and figure out if that's modal
or model I don't know how to say it
because I was just learning at all
reading so someone please figure out how
to say it and leave a comment and I will
thank you so as you can see I've got a
new Python file open because we're going
to be doing something a little bit
different this time so let's start new
import WX instead of putting all this in
our init constructor function we're
actually just going to be putting it in
our main if statement since it's going
to be um a lot easier so let's go ahead
and put if underscore underscore name
underscore underscore equals main
underscore underscore main underscore
underscore what do we want to do well
the first thing that we would there we
go first thing that we need to do oh got
whooping cough from eating crackers is
make our application object and set this
equal to WX pi simple app there we go
and over your empty parameters so now
this is pretty much our main if
statement and now we can get good stuff
for the beef of the tutorial what I'm
going to tell you now I'm going to be
showing you how to make a box with a
list as choices so first we need a list
so let's say we want the user to pick
from a list of names or something let's
make a list and call it names and put a
couple names in there
Bucky probably against about all these
around lucky Sara and how about Dustin
and look good mink and after you have
your list you can go ahead and make your
dialog box and this is going to be the
keyword for this a single choice dialog
so I'll just name it modal or model I
don't know how to say it but I will
after someone finds out for me
WX single choice there we go
dialog and make sure you type that right
you can name it whatever you want but
make sure you type that part right now
this takes a couple of funky parameters
so listen the first is this parent and
unlike the last one where head panel
this is going to be none since this is
going to sit right in the main modal so
after this our next parameter is it's
like the caption over top so it tells
them what to do so let's put what's your
name now the next parameter the third
parameter after this it's called the
caption but it's pretty much the title
when you're working with modal's anytime
um well pretty much caption and title
mean the same thing so the third one is
the title never mind all that stuff I
just said so let's put title here and
your last parameter they absolutely need
are the choices that you want is pretty
much your list so I'm going to put names
because whatever you name your list
because you can have many of these but
you got to give this so it knows what
one to work with so now we have pretty
much a single choice dialog but it
doesn't do a whole lot so let's give a
little bit of functionality let's make a
simple if statement but if modal um I
can't type and talk at the same time
show modal empty parameters and this is
just going to mean if you click the okay
button so WX ID okay so this means
alright if you click the okay button
what do we want to do well let's bring
out a simple statement and let's just
put your name
is then put a string variable in the
line and then for that variable we want
whatever they picked in their choice is
going to be equal to get string
selection right there with empty
parameters and modal there we go don't
forget to destroy it when you're done
with it sounds violent but just make
sure you don't have any memory leaks or
anything I think it does automatically
I'm not sure but just to be safe do that
now let me run it see how many errors I
got and then I will show you how it
works get this out of the way uh what's
your name and now we get to pick from
list of names so let's go ahead and pick
Buckley right there click OK
and when we click OK it prints out your
name is Buckley and let me show you guys
one more time why this worked and let me
get my box up again that's what she said
and here you go again this is just
housekeeping don't mind that your name's
that's just a list we created just as
regular Python not W X at all
now our W X is we made a modal variable
and we set it equal to the single choice
dialogue and again it has no parent
what's your name right here that's the
caption you can see here the title goes
at the top and the less names is
whatever you want inside it and then we
just added some functionality to say all
right when we clicked ok if this equals
okay then we just want to print out on
our main program whatever this is and
this would be your string whatever you
pick but you could probably figure that
out from just playing around it so
that's that for this tutorial on the
next tutorial I'm probably going to be
going over something awesome so don't
forget to watch it and once you master
this you're ready to move on to that so
again thank you for watching and I will
see you next time
