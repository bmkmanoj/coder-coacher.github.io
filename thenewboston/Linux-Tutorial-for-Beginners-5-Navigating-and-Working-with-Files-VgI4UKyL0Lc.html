teach you the basics of navigating
around your computer using the terminal
and I thought it would be pretty cool if
I give you guys a little visual
demonstration of what's going on as well
so open your terminal and also open up
this right here this little file drawer
so this is a boon to z' visual navigator
and whenever you open both of these they
put you in the same location so I logged
in as Bucky this is Bucky's home so
let's say that I wanted to I don't know
navigate to the desktop well we can
easily see that for the visual navigator
I'm just going to double click desktop
and here are all the files on my desktop
now if you're in the terminal and you
ever want to go into a directory just
like I just did make sure to press LS
and then this shows you all of the
places you can move into so it's pretty
much showing you this and instead of
double-clicking because you can't double
click in here right CD and this is the
command that stands for change directory
and I want to go into my desktop so desk
top so change directory go into the
desktop so now if I do LS list all the
files in my desktop I only have one and
that is story story so you're pretty
much did the same thing so how do we go
back into um you know our home directory
well with a visual Navigator it's easy
just click this big old back button
however um CLS there's no back command
so in order to go back or up into your
parent directory type CD dot dot and
this means move up or go back one
directory so now if i PWD it says you're
back in your home now another cool
little short command let me just move
back into my desktop right now so right
now I'm in my desktop if you're ever
somewhere weird and you just want to go
back home just right CD with no
additional information and it's going to
put you back home no man
matter where you are on your computer so
what I want to show you guys now is how
to create and delete folders and we can
actually get rid of this demo is over
alright so right now I'm in my home and
I want to move back into my desktop so
I'm going to write CD desktop now if I
hit clear this just wipes all the extra
crap on the screen away but it doesn't
um you know it's not like opening a
brand new terminal you're still in the
desktop whenever you hit clear so right
now we're in the desktop we're pretty
much right here and I want to create a
new folder or directory and I'll just
say I'll just name it other so anytime
you want to create a folder called MK
dir and this stands for make directory
so now you need to give it a name of
your folder and I'm just going to name
it other so check it out I just created
it in the shell and look it pops up
right there on the desktop so let's go
ahead and make another one because that
was pretty fun make another directory so
whenever you make a directory it makes
it wherever you currently are so I'm on
the desktop it's going to make a folder
called tuna on the desktop so I actually
want to get rid of one of these so let's
just go ahead and delete um tuna right
there so anytime you want to delete a
folder from the show hit RM dirt this
means remove directory what folder do
you want to delete
well how about tuna so hit enter and it
deletes tuna check it out
so that's how you make in delete
directories what about files well
anytime you want to create a file you
can use the key word touch actually I'm
not really sure why they named a touch
but they did and there's it's actually
kind of tricky not tricky but something
you need to remember this touch command
is going to take the name of your file
that you want to create now since this
story file already exists whenever I hit
enter it's not going to make any changes
so this touch command it only creates a
file if it doesn't already exist so
nothing
changed in that little example but let's
say I want to create a file called bacon
well I don't have any bacon file right
here so whenever I run this it's going
to create a new file called bacon so
pretty cool and if you ever want to
delete a file hit RM and this root means
remove bacon so pretty easy that's how
you delete files so all right we can
create in delete folders we can also
create and delete files what if we want
to do something like copy a file so here
is a file called story and I want to
make a copy of it called Story 2 how
creative right well just write CP and
this means copy the file story now since
you're making a copy of it you need to
give the new file or the copy of it a
new name so for mine I'm just going to
call Story 2 and check it out it takes
story makes a copy of it and names it
Story 2 and if I click this you can see
that it is an exact copy all the
contents boom roasted alright well
that's great but actually I want to take
this story too and I want to move it
inside my other directory right here
well any time you want to move a file
what you do is you type the command M V
so first well this takes two pieces of
information the first one is what file
are we trying to move and the second
piece of information is where do you
want to move it so I'm trying to move
the file story - all right where do you
want to move it well I'm just going to
move it in the other directory and it's
going to be named Story 2 still so hit
enter and it takes that and it moves it
inside the other directory with the same
name Story 2 now you can also rename a
file using the same move command because
what move does is basically takes this
moves it somewhere else and then deletes
the original so it's kind of weird but
that's essentially how moving files work
so let's say that I wanted to rename
this story to tuna why not well what I
can do is just hit mV
so I'm going to move the file story and
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
move it into the same directory but I'm
going to give a new name of tuna so I'm
going to hit enter and check it out so
what it did is it moved it into the same
directory and the new file that it moved
which is essentially just the same file
it called it tuna and it deleted story
so that's the basics of how to navigate
around and for the next tutorial I want
to make sure I'm back in my home
directory so go back home and hit clear
and give me a blank slate so now you
know how to navigate around you know how
to make directories delete directories
you know how to create files delete
files how to copy and move you learn a
bunch of stuff and we're only getting
started I am pumped up but for now got
to go eat some pizza see you guys next
