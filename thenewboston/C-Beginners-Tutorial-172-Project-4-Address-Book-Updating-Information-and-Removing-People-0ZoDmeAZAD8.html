c-sharp tutorial that I'm making for the
new Boston and in this tutorial all
we're going to continue working in our
address book project and basically what
we're going to be doing is have all of
the users information update whenever
they select a different person and we're
also going to make it so that you can
remove people from your book alright so
the first thing that we're just going to
want to do right here is select our list
view and go down to the selected index
change event and this will basically
occur whenever the user selects a
different item in the list view and then
we just want all this information right
here to update so we want this textbox
to hold the person's name so we're just
going to say text box once text equals
the person's name you have selected so
luckily we have all the people stored
inside of this person list right here so
we can say people or a person list and
the index of the frontal access is the
same index of the item you have selected
in the list view so we can just say list
view one dot selected items and then we
just want to get the index of the item
that you have selected so we're just
going to put 0 inside of these brackets
right here since we're only making it so
that you can select one item at a time
and like I said we just want the index
of this item so we're going to use the
index property to get that alright and
then we want text box ones tax to be the
person whose name so we're going to do
dot name right here alright so not only
debug let's just make sure that this
works so we add a person add-on we add
on their person Bob and if we select add
them right here Adam should show up in
this text box yep if we select Bob Bob
should show up in this text box all
right perfect
alright now we just want to do that for
all the other pieces of information so
we're going to say text box twos text
equals the person's email address so
we're just going to copy this and do
email
and textbox three stacks to the person
street address so we can just do street
address and text box 4 will be for the
additional notes or additional
information so we can just do dot
additional notes alright and the last
thing we have to change is this date
time picker ones value which is the
person's birthday so we're just going to
say date time picker one dot value equal
the person's birthday so dot birthday
all right now let's just go ahead and
make sure that this works
so if we add atom right here email
address whatever it gmail.com street
address and the main street any birthday
and additional nodes add that now if we
had another person called Bob their
email address is whatever - street
address anything additional nodes
all right so analysis make sure that
this works if we select atom all my
information should show up right here
yep and if we select Bob all his
information should show up right there
perfect all right so the last thing that
we have to do here is basically just
remove the person you have selected so
we're just going to go ahead and double
click on this remove button and since we
wanted to be able to remove people when
you click on this button and when you
select the remove option from the
context menu we're going to create a
method so we don't have to copy and
paste code so we're just going to say
void remove and we're just going to
basically want to remove the person from
this list view and from this person list
up here this people list so we're going
to say list view one items dot remove
and then just remove the item you have
selected so let's v1 selected items and
0 since you can only have one item
selected at a time and now we just want
to remove the person from this people
list or this person list right here so
we're going to say people remove at
and now we just want to put the index of
the item that we want to remove and that
would be the index of the item that you
have selected in the list view so let's
see one selected items and any since you
can only have one item selected we're
just going to put 0 in there and then
the index of that item all right and
we're just going to want to put a try
and catch around this because sometimes
you may have no items selected in the
list view and then the index would be
negative 1 and that's not a valid index
so throw an air so just going to put a
try and catch around this and we're just
going to make the catch do nothing so
that you will never know if you don't
have an item selected all right and now
we're just going to want to call this
remove method when you click on the
button and when you select that item
from the context menu strip so it's
double click on this item in your
context menu strip right here and call
the remove method all right so let's
just go ahead and make sure that this
works we add a person atom another
person Bob and third person 0 now should
just be able to right click and click
remove and if we select Joe and click
remove or remove sin as well all right
so that's pretty much it for this
tutorial so see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
