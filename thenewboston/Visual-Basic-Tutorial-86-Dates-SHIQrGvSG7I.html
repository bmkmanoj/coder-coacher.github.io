slash on live gamer for the New Boston
and in this tutorial we're going to be
taking a look at dates so in Visual
Basic there is a class called date and
you can create objects with that and use
that to get the current date you can
also format this in several different
ways so we're just going to make a
little demo application that will show
us what we can do with some of the date
functions so we'll select windows forms
application and we'll set the name to
dates and once that's loaded we'll come
over here to our toolbox and we will add
a button
so we'll just resize this a little bit
and also the text of button one to show
date and we will set the name to button
show date okay so now we're going to do
is we're going to go ahead and double
click on show date so what we can do is
zoom in here a little bit first so what
we can do is create an object of the
date class so we'll go ahead and type
dim current date as anyway type date if
you read the description it says
represents an instant in time typically
expressed as date and time of day so it
will go ahead and get the time that the
current date the year of the month the
minutes the hours the seconds every part
of the time it's going to get that so go
ahead and set that equal to a value so
current date equals now so you can see
it says public read-only property now as
date returns the data value containing
the current date and time according to
your system so it's going to go ahead
and get the date and time on the user
system so whatever machine it's running
on is going to get their time and it's
not going to use a
pacified time now you so let's go ahead
and output the the current date in a
message box so we'll type message box
dot show and we will just take our date
and convert it to a string so current
date dot two string and let's go ahead
set the title to date application now
let's go ahead and run this and see what
happens
so here's our form and when we click
show date it gives us May 9th 2011 at
7:01 p.m. and 8 seconds so if we keep
clicking this you can see that updates
according to the current time because
every time we click it it creates a new
date and sets it to now so if we click
it it's got 28 seconds wait a couple
seconds click it again and it's got 31
now what we can also do is we can
convert the current date to another
format so let's say you don't want the
month the day the year and everything in
there so we can do is we type current
date dot 2 short time string so while
this is going to do is going to convert
it to a short time string and what that
means is that it's just going to show
the time 701 p.m. now there are many
other things that you can do with this
you can do dot to long time string let's
go ahead and run this we'll click show
date and we get the seconds as well as
the hour and minute and you can see that
it does not update in real time so I'm
going to close out of that and we can go
ahead and look at some of the other
stuffs that we can do so if you just
type a dot you can see that we've got
two short time string two short date
string two zero eight date two long time
string and two long date string they
string so you can go ahead and play
around with those see what those do see
what happens when you type those in and
once you've practiced a little bit with
date and date objects go ahead and move
on to the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
