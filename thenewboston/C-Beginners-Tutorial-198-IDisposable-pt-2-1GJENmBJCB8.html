tutorial that I'm making for the new
Boston and in this tutorial we're going
to finish looking at the eye disposable
interface so all you're going to need
for this tutorial is button and clasp
and inside of your clasp just make sure
you have an image and inside of your
classes constructor just make sure you
set that image equal to something I just
study equal to a random image alright so
before we actually look at Haring from
the IEEE disposable interface I'm going
to show you another way of disposing of
class so we were if we were to just type
right here using and then we're just
basically create a new instance of
whatever class we wanted to inside of
these two parentheses right here so for
you to say my class MC equals a new line
class and then we just put a block of
code underneath that basically what it
will do is whenever it's done executing
this code inside of these two brackets
it'll just dispose of your class and the
reason that we're getting an error right
here is because we're not inheriting
from the eye disposable interface
because basically what it does when it's
done executing this code is it looks for
a dispose method inside of your class
and you don't have that because we're
not inheriting from the eye disposable
interface all right so let's just go
ahead and do that we're going to say
right here handing from my disposable
interface all right and that's not all
we have to do we still have to provide
implementation for a few methods so the
first method that we have to provide
implementation for is a protected oops
good virtual void and name of this
method is just simply called dispose but
this isn't actually what is called
that's a public method if you're going
to create in a minute and through this
method you have to pass through a rule
and absolute equality alright so
basically what we're going to do right
here is say if this rule right here and
it's called B is true then you're just
going to dispose of everything that is
inside of our class that we're using and
really all that we're using right here
is an image but if you were to have a
class that's using
like I don't know a binary reader or
something like that then you want to
make sure that you dispose of it inside
of here so everything that you're using
you want to dispose of inside of here so
we're just going to say I dispose and
that's really all that we have to do
alright and the next method that we have
to provide implementation for is also
called dispose but this one's public
this is the actual method that this
looks for and that users can call so
we're just going to say public void and
this is just called dispose and you
don't really have to provide any
information such a call method all right
and we're just going to want to call
this dispose method right here so that
it will actually dispose of this image
so we're just going to say dispose and
now we're just going to pass through
true so that it will actually delete
this all right and right after this we
have to actually call another method
called suppress finalize inside of the
GC class and GC just stands for garbage
collector so we're just going to say GC
suppress finalize and then it just calls
for an object and we're just going to
want to pass through this and basically
what suppress finalize does is it makes
it so the d constructor or whatever
object you pass through right here won't
be called so we were to just go ahead
right here and create a Deconstructor so
my class and we just have like a message
box showing our Deconstructor this code
will never be called on because when
this method is or when this class is
disposed of we do GC dots press finalize
and that just prevents the Deconstructor
from being called so power just stare
here Adam will never get to this code
right here alright so once again this
using statement right here basically
just says that whenever the code inside
appears done executing it will just
dispose of this object right here that
we create so dispose of MC and is call
this method and since it calls this
method it will call this GC suppress
finalize making it so this D constructor
will not be called alright so when I
click this button right here on our form
shouldn't get any message boxes and when
I exit the application
nope we don't get any message boxes and
that's remember because this
Deconstructor will never be called
alright so that's pretty much it for
this tutorial on using the I disposable
interface so see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
