welcome to another episode of don't try
this at home in this video we're going
to be making plasma with a grape so
these are the supplies that we're going
to be using for this experiment the
first thing that we need is a glass and
I say glass instead of cup because some
cups are plastic and we're actually
going to be putting this in the
microwave and if you put a plastic cup
in the microwave it can of course melt
another thing that you need is a
seedless grape now any old seedless
grape from the grocery store is going to
work fine it doesn't matter what color
they are or anything like that in the
last thing that you need is a knife now
we're going to be using the knife to cut
the grapes and I actually recommend a
plastic butter knife because whenever we
cut these grapes as you're going to see
we don't want to go all the way through
the grape we want to leave a little bit
of skin attached so if you use a really
sharp steak knife or anything like that
you might accidentally cut all the way
through it so I recommend a butter knife
or just a regular plastic knife now let
me go ahead and show you guys how to
prepare the grape now the first thing we
want to do is we want to cut the bottom
half off and the bottom half is of
course the half with a stem so go ahead
and cut that completely off so we can
get rid of this you can go ahead and eat
it whatever you want to do now for the
top half what you want to do is you want
to kind of butterfly it I guess that's
the proper name for the technique in
this part is the part writers talking
about you don't want to cut up all the
way through you want to leave a little
bit of skin attaching the two halves so
go ahead and actually probably a little
bit less so it's just connected by a
thin piece of skin so the first thing I
want to do is I just want to take the
great by itself and set it in the
microwave just like that so the flat
part is facing up and again make sure
that you don't rip it make sure the
halves are still connected by a thin
piece of skin now go ahead and close it
now let me go ahead and start this for
about 30 seconds it'll see what happens
now as you can see that's the plasma
coming from the grape so what I want to
try to do now is I actually want to try
and capture that with a glass so now
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
take a new grape and put it right in the
middle and I'm also going to take a
glass and put it right on top kind of
like a dome so basically I want to make
sure that this glass right here isn't
touching the sides of the grape so let
me go ahead and close this started for a
minute see what happens so now what I
did is I actually took three grapes and
put them in there together because you
know why not if one was cool three
should be awesome now we're going to go
ahead and take that glass and put it
right on top kind of like a dome and I
want to make sure that I capture some of
the plasma and it's important not to
touch the side of the grapes with your
glass so go ahead and set it up just
like that now put this on for about a
minute let's see what happens now even
though this probably isn't a good idea
in this one I'm going to go ahead and do
the same thing but I'm going to be using
a smaller plastic cup I think it'll make
the effects work a little bit better so
go ahead and close your door and we'll
see how this one works
ah so that's probably enough of that
before I you know burn down my house or
anything so let me go ahead and open
this up and I better air this out all
right guys now let me go ahead and get a
little bit scientific because I want to
explain you guys exactly what you saw so
basically a grape is full of
electrolytes now an electrolyte is
pretty much a liquid that contains a lot
of charged particles or ions now since
these particles in grapes have a charge
that makes the grape itself very good at
conducting electricity now of course as
you saw the grapes are connected by a
thin piece of skin in the skin pretty
much X is a path between the ion filled
halves of the group now the energy from
the microbe is going to move the ions
back and forth between the two halves
now eventually what's going to happen is
the path between the grapes is going to
burn up and that's going to cause the
ions to have traveled through the air
across the gap now this process of
course ionizes the air and that's what
creates the awesome-looking plasma so
that's what plasma is it's like gas but
it has a lot of free electrons and
positively charged ions floating around
now in normal situations what would
happen is these two particles would
combine and form a nice stable particle
but the reason that doesn't happen in
this situation is because basically the
electrons absorb so much energy from the
microwave they get ripped off the
particle and this of course causes the
electrons to separate from the
positively charged ion and basically
whenever you have the two moving around
freely it creates an awesome-looking
plasma so that's a more detailed or
scientific explanation of exactly what
we saw now before I let you guys go I
want to mention this even though I'm
telling you guys not to try this at home
I got a feeling some people are not
going to take my advice they're going to
get the sudden urge they have to try it
now for those people even though that's
probably a bad idea please at least do
this do not breathe the gas that gets
created whenever you do this do it in a
well ventilated area because this
creates a very harmful and toxic gas so
again
my recommendation is of course no one
try this at home but if you do please do
not breathe the gas that gets created so
anyways thank you guys for watching and
I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
