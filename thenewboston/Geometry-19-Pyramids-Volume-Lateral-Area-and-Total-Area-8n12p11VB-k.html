talking about right circular cylinders
to talking about a pyramid and the
volume lateral area in total area of a
pyramid so the volume of a pyramid is
equal to one-third the area of the base
times height
so if you remember the area of a base of
a pyramid is equal to length times width
times height so for this pyramid we have
one-third our length of the base which
is four our width of the base which is
also four times the height now remember
this height is really important that you
remember it's the height perpendicular
to the center of the base it's the one
that goes it goes up from this point to
the point on the base so our height for
this is six so one-third four times four
is 16 times six 16 times six is 96
so 1/3 times 96 and that actually goes
in perfectly and you get B is equal to
32 and pretend the set inches it would
be 32 inches cubed because remember
we're in we're talking about volume and
volume is always a three-dimensional
measurement so okay so now we're going
to talk about lateral area now our
lateral area is equal to 1/2 the
perimeter of the base times the slant
height because when we find our lateral
area we're finding everything but the
area of the base so each one of these
triangles right here we're finding the
area of
so there are four triangles we're
finding the area of so we're going to
take 1/2 the perimeter of the base which
is 3 plus 3 plus 3 plus 3 plus 3 plus 3
plus 3 times the slant height now
remember this slant height is not the
same as the height we used to sell
volume our slant height is the height
that is goes from the top of the pyramid
down one of the triangles and is
perpendicular to one side of the square
so we're told that our slant height is 7
so times 7 so our lateral area is equal
to 1/2 3 plus 3 is 6 plus 3 is 9 plus 3
is 12 12 times 7
well 1/2 of 12 is equal to 6 so 6 times
7 is equal to 42 so if they said
centimeters this would be 42 centimeters
squared because when we talk about area
we're always in a two dimensional
measure and last we have our total area
now when we found our lateral area we
just found the area of each one of these
triangles now this time we're finding
our area of this entire shape so we're
going to take our lateral area which is
1/2 the perimeter of the base times the
slant height plus our base area which is
equal to length times width so total
area this is 1/2 the perimeter of the
base which is 6 plus 6 plus 6 plus 6
so 1/2 24 times our slant height which I
don't know if you can see it or not but
it's right here it's already been drawn
in for us and they tell us is 4 so times
4 plus length times width 6 times 6
so our total area is equal to 1/2 of 24
which is 12 times 4 plus 6 times 6 so 12
times 24 is 48 plus 6 times 6 is 36 and
if we add those together we'll get 84
pretend I said centimeters centimeters
squared because area is always a
two-dimensional measurement so that's
actually all we're gonna do for pyramids
today let make sure you come back and
watch your next video where we're gonna
talk about the right circular cone and
we actually didn't get into a lot of
this into intro to geometry so be ready
to learn a lot</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
