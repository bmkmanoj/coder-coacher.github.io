tutorial and in this story I'm going to
show you guys how to import modules now
before I tell you guys you and what that
means um when you're working in Idol
like right here any time you quit Idol
all of your variables and functions that
you made and Idol get lost so in it
would also be useful instead of just
losing all your variables and functions
to save them and it's also useful in
case you like write a function and you
want to use it in a lot of programs and
you don't want to have to rewrite
rewrite it a bunch of times you can make
something called a module and it'll save
all your variables and functions for you
and you can just import it anytime
you're using another program or Idol
such as this so to do this go ahead and
in your Idol go ahead and put File new
window and this new window is going to
pop up right here now in this window
we're going to create some modules and
these modules are going to hold things
that we want to keep but you need to do
this a specific way so pay attention the
first thing that we're going to want to
do is go ahead and create a quick module
call test mod you can name yours
anything you want just have empty
parameters this is just going to be a
simple one and let's just print out on
this baby words and now once you have a
test module just I'll put anything in
there we just need something to test it
a simple print sim will work fine what
you need to do is save it put save as
and in your directory which is Python 26
or whatever version you're working with
make sure you don't save her anywhere
else because when python looks for these
modules it's only gonna lurk look in
specific locations and this is one of
the locations that looks at go ahead and
save it and remember this name i'm going
to save mine is swine flu because that's
what's in the news today dot py and
again this name and the py extension are
both very important but more so you have
to remember the name more than anything
and I'll show you why later
so go ahead as save it is some name than
py then press save
now we have a module named swine-flu py
you can see the name over my cursor
right here and now we can import this
module into whatever program we're
working with so go ahead and open idle
right here let me make it so you both
can see right there good enough actually
there we go now in your idle you can now
import that swine flu module and you do
it like this import and then you put
whatever name of the module you just
created and that's why the name was
important but make sure not to put that
py extension that's just so Python can
find it so go ahead and import whatever
the name of the file and again the file
name is the py actually the module name
is actually the file name minus py so
that's how you can remember now go ahead
and press ENTER and you just imported
all of your modules in your swine-flu
file now let's go ahead and see if it
worked now once you want to call a
module you need an object to call and
the object is actually the name of
whatever the file you imported so
instead of having to create an object
and set it equal to your module all you
have to do is write the name of the file
which was swine flu and then write
whatever module you want to call so mine
was named what was my name actually test
mod so you put swine flu test Mon I'm
just forgot it already and go ahead and
press ENTER and that's how you use or
more so however you store modules in the
outside file and you can just import
them in column whenever you want and as
you can see if you may like a bunch of
functions and variables and you want to
use it over and over again it'll be a
pain but just keep typing it over and
again in every program you wrote so this
is how you can import different modules
and how to create it from a file now one
last thing I want to stress once you
import so I flew one time you can't
import it again since well it would just
be stupid and it would just confuse play
thought so let me show you guys
something say we find out we wanted this
to actually say this baby is fat or
something so what will you do is go
ahead and you would think that what you
do is go ahead this baby is fat now go
ahead and press save we save this module
now once we imported it again import
swine swine flu and then go ahead swine
flu the test mod it still says this baby
worked that's because you can only
import your module one time now if you
wanted this to actually show up that
this baby is fat like it was before what
you would need to do is close this all
together go open up a new Idol and go
ahead and push import swine flu and then
now once you imported this again this
imports the new file then you can do
swine flu the test mod and again it
would say this baby is fat so just as
stress you can own the import a module
once per program and even though you can
change your module even if you change it
and then import it again it's not going
to import again it's just going to
import once so that's your quick
tutorial on how to import modules and
again this is useful if you write a
bunch of functions and a bunch of
variables that you want to save
somewhere else but you want to use over
and over again so practice doing that
and make sure that you use the py
extension make sure you save it where it
tells you to save it or else it's not
going to be able to find it
so in the next story I'm going to be
going over other things that you can do
with import modules and also be clearing
up this a little bit more so you
understand a little better but for now
thank you guys for watching I hope to
see you next tutorial
don't forget to subscribe and I will see
you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
