the other room commander shepard
illusive man i thought we'd be meeting
face-to-face unnecessary precaution not
unusual for people who know what you and
i know you might be the reason I'm still
alive but that doesn't mean I trust you
you need to put your personal feelings
aside humanity is up against the
greatest threat of our brief existence
the Reapers good to see your memories
still intact how are you feeling cut to
the chase what did the Reapers doing
that made you decide to bring me back
we're at war no one wants to admit it
but humanity is under attack while
you've been sleeping entire colonies
have been disappearing human colonies we
believe it's someone working for the
Reapers justice Aaron and death Aidan
sovereign you've seen it yourself you
bested all of them that's just one
reason we chose you
nothing you say is going to convince me
to trust you I need more than words I'd
be disappointed if I could persuade you
that easily go and see for yourself I
have a shuttle ready to take you to
freedoms progress the latest commonly to
be abducted Miranda and Jacob will brief
you I'll get what you're looking for and
be back before you know it good to hear
it find any clues you can who's
abducting Collins do they have any
connection to the Reapers I brought you
back it's up to you to do the rest
the Illusive man is very impressed with
you I'm eager to see if you can live up
to his expectations on this mission I
never got a chance to say how much I
appreciate it what the Lazarus project
did for me I just hope it was worth it a
lot of people lost their lives on that
station we have to work together here
your attitude isn't helping anything I
have the utmost respect for your
abilities Shepherd it's your motivations
that concern me I believe in what
service stands for only time will tell
if you prove to be an asset or a
liability to our cause it's obvious
you're not interested in talking we've
got an assignment we can talk about it
or we can do it we should be there
shortly Shepherd the Illusive man put us
under your command do you have any
orders her first priority is to look for
survivors that's unlikely commander no
one was left at the other colonies they
were completely deserted be nice to find
somebody anything's better than another
ghost town
