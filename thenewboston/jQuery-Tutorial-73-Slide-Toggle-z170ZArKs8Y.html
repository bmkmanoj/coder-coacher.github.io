and this is a video tutorial for the new
Boston now we've looked at in previous
videos at using the slide down and the
slide up functionality in jQuery however
we also have a slide toggle function
this works the same as toggle on its own
but in actual fact slides instead of
just shows and hides an element so we're
going to use an example of an image
again I'm going to create an an image
tag and I'm using this image called
Tartan jpg I'm going to give it an alt
attribute of just Tartan and I'm also
going to give it an ID and let's do this
just start here so I'm going to say ID
is equal to image I'm going to have a
button just up here so an input type and
that's going to be button the value is
going to be we'll just a toggle that
makes certain that makes sense and I'm
going to give this an ID as well this is
just going to be toggle okay so I'll
just finally surround this in paragraph
tags and to make everything a bit more
separate and then let's go over to our
browser and preview it okay so we've got
this image here and we've got toggle so
what we want to happen is we want this
to slide up and slide down every time we
press this toggle button so we've
already included jQuery and already
included our effects j/s file now what
we want to is to do is listen out for an
event when this button is clicked then
what we want to do is toggle this image
accordingly so over in FX jes let's go
ahead and create an event handler for
this button which I have called toggle
I'm going to say dot click so we're
listening out for a click and inside we
create a function that's going to be run
when we have that click take place so
everything inside the curly brackets is
our code let's just bring that down to
make it look a bit neater and let's go
ahead and use the toggle function the
slides toggle function
so we are sliding the image so we need
to reference the image with a hash image
again using the standard notation to
reference an element then we want to use
the slide toggle function so the slide
toggle function does take additional
parameters I'll explain those in just a
moment however let's return to our page
and see what we have let's click on
toggle you can see that that has slid up
into the corner
when we click toggle again it will slide
back now you'll notice that as the image
slid it actually slid into the corner
and what the well the effect that we
were actually looking for is sliding
upwards and downwards and the problem
with this is because we're using an
image the effect doesn't have the same
output therefore what we need to do is
we need to include our image inside of
somewhere and instead of actually
sliding the image itself slide what is
containing it so instead of the ID being
inside of the image we're going to give
it to this paragraph just here so the
page is displayed in exactly the same
way however all we've done is we've
actually called the paragraph ID image
story rather than the image itself now
what's going to happen is we're going to
get the same thing happen with this with
referencing image which is now a
paragraph and we're using slide toggle
as we would normally but this time we'll
actually retrieve or or display and a
real sliding effect so you can see now
that it's lit up and slid back down
again so that's the problem with using
some elements some elements won't
display properly when you try and use
animation effects on them however just
by creating a paragraph with this image
inside we've retrieved a perfect sliding
effect now we do have other options for
this slide toggle function for example
the speed again it can be a texture or
numerical representation of a speed for
example we could do 2000 you also can
change the animation type so for example
at the moment it sort of bounces almost
it swings it's hard to see when it
slides fast however if we were to
now you can see that it slows down just
before it reaches the end here we can
use Linea in this case to slide exactly
so it maintain the same speed as its
slides so if you watch now it maintains
exactly the same speed as it slides up
and down so it depends on what kind of
effect you're looking for but by default
this is swing and the other option and
the only other option is linear we can
also have a callback function which
we've discussed in other parts of other
tutorials which I won't be demonstrating
in this case however for now that's T
how to use the slide toggle function in
jQuery</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
