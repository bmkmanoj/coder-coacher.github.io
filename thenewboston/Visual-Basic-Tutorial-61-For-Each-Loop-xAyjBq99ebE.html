slash on live gamer for the new Boston
and in this tutorial we're going to be
taking a look at the for each loop now
if you remember from the previous
tutorials we created an application that
printed out all the elements in an array
now we're going to go ahead and open up
that same project so we'll go ahead and
find arrays right here and wait for it
to open okay so here is our project we
have our button at array and what it
does is it uses a normal for loop to go
through and add all the items to the
array and each one of those items is has
been set a value in our array has been
declared private and up outside of all
the subs so that we can use it in every
single sub in here and we've got a clear
list and we got a sorted array which
will sort our string classes and then
add it using a normal for loop and then
we've got a reverse so let's go ahead
and create a for each loop now using a
for each loop you don't have to know how
long your array is or whatever you're
using and it will automatically go
through every single item in it so we'll
go ahead and delete this right here and
we're going to type for to say that
we're going to do a for loop but instead
of a normal for loop we're going to do
for each and now what we're going to do
is we're going to type item which is
going to be the name so let's say for
num1 equals one item is going to be the
equivalent of our num1 now we're going
to specify a datatype for this and now
since string classes holds a bunch of
strings we're going to have to use a
string so for each item as string so for
each one of these strings in here in
string classes go ahead and do whatever
is inside this for each loop so it's
going to go web-design Spanish chemistry
English history and calculus
and item is going to be equal to that
for each iteration of the loop so the
first one is equal to web design the
next one is equal to Spanish now if you
remember from the previous four loop we
use the index and not the actual string
so now what we can do is we can type
list arrays items dot add and we're
going to add item so now if we go ahead
and run this you can see that here's our
form with our list arrays our add array
elements sort array and reverse array
we'll go ahead and click on that and you
can see that adds each one of those in
there now we can go ahead and do this
for the rest of our subs so we can go
ahead and type for each we can do a
different name we can name this whatever
I want whatever we want so we can even
do X for each X as string in string
classes go ahead and do list arrays dot
atoms dot add and for our arguments
we're just going to add X now we can do
this one more time for this for loop
right here
so for each and let's just do string
class as string in string classes go
ahead and do list arrays items dot add
and we'll go ahead and add string class
so if we run this everything should work
fine we shouldn't get any errors we can
add a write elements we can sort the
array we can reverse the array and we
can go ahead and add them again and then
reverse that so I'm go ahead play around
for each loops I'm you can use it for
more than arrays so once you've got
those down and you know how to do them
and you can make them in you're not
going to forget go ahead and move on to
the next tutorial and thanks for
