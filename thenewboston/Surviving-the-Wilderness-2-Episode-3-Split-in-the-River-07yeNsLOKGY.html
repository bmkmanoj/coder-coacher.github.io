talking about freaking flies ticked me
off already well that might be my last
view of civilization so here's the
bridge and let's see what we got here
said to follow this I don't know how far
no idea how far I'm supposed to follow
this or if it ends or if it keeps going
or if it makes it loop you didn't give
me too many details so
actually
what I'm going to do is since I don't
want to drop my camera in the water I'm
probably going to walk along this for a
little bit and then once I find a good
spot to get an update I'll update you
guys but I'm going to walk along here
and yeah these rocks are moving already
all right
how update you guys soon well guys I've
been walking for about over half an hour
probably 45 minutes and first of all it
was a pain there are bugs biting me
every half a second and a second of all
it just occurred to me that Joby is
either in a complete idiot or the worst
planner ever because he told me to
follow this river and I have however now
I'm to a split the river either goes
this way which is kind of the main one
I've been following or this one which is
a creek and this one looks like it leads
into the woods more when this one looks
like I don't know it's more open and
bigger but I'm not really sure which way
to go and here's my compass you said
something about going north and north is
pointing in this direction but this
river is a freaking pain to walk on look
at these rocks every half a second at
the freakin step on these and I'm about
to lose my balance and even if you try
to walk on the side which sucks because
the grass is so tall
there are huge rocks in the grass as
well so yeah I think even though the
creek right there looks a little bit
easier to walk I think I'm going to go
and walk a little bit more north
probably for another hour - and um I
don't know hopefully that's the right
way if not then I don't know whatever
all right guys
after about
and hour and a half of more walking I
didn't think it was possible but the
river is actually getting worse I don't
know if you can see behind me but
instead of just small little rocks that
you can follow now now I have huge
freaking boulders that I have to climb
over walking in the woods is not a
option because then you have boulders
and trees and thorn bushes and whatever
else and it's also getting much more
rapid so I don't know if I made the
right decision at that split they're
going north instead of that nice calm
Creek I really know what I was thinking
it's kind of too late to turn back now
but uh yeah that's it let me pick up the
camera and show you guys around all
right so that's where I came from and as
you can see the walls are all so it's
like a little V sliding everything in
and possible to walk on that try walking
on that and let me know how that works
out for you so the walls right here
pretty much is straight up so that's
pretty cool and there's all my camera
stuff that's where I just made that
video down there and just some terrible
Rapids and some more deadly raxil
freaking climb over and if you look
ahead I don't want to get too far over
the ledge because yeah I want to fall in
there and by the way if you're thinking
ah this is a nice place to stay because
maybe you can fish in there you see this
no fish I didn't even see a fricking
minnow yet so up ahead it just looks
like more you know unbearable rocks so I
really don't know what I'm supposed to
do now I guess I'm just going to keep
walking and hope it gets better I mean I
don't really have a lot of choices right
now so yeah give me a guy's update soon
so after about a day's worth a walk in
in like the most terrible conditions I
could possibly imagine I finally found
something that put a smile on my face
it's a little mini waterfall behind me
and as you can see right after the
waterfall the water is actually really
calm so you know enough of those freakin
rapid
so let me give you guys a little
panorama and I actually could walk in
the woods up there it was a smooth
enough or I could so there's a little
waterfall I guess it technically isn't a
waterfall but you know it's the closest
thing to it that I've seen so far and
just calm water still no fish or
anything so not sure what I'm going to
do about food so I'm probably going to
spend the night here tonight since you
know this is the first habitable place
habitable place I came across and I
don't think that it's a good idea to
keep walking along this river because I
don't know it just hasn't been the best
idea so far and to be honest I'm
beginning to think that this entire
decision probably wasn't the best idea
of my life I thought it was going to be
super fun at first but right now I'm
just sweating my balls off and I am
super thirsty and I don't even have a
fire and I don't want to drink this
water because it has a bunch of
parasites and bacteria into it so I know
I have to boil it before I drink it and
I don't know it's just being a pain but
anyways I smell really bad even to
myself
so I'm probably going to change into my
swimsuit and go for a little swim and
then I'll unpacked my gear and show you
guys what all I have with me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
