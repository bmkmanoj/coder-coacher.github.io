photoshop project and in this project
I'm going to be going over how to take a
regular image and convert it into a
comic book looking image now before you
go on any further make sure you're
watching these projects and high def
I'll put a link on the right hand side
of the screen under the description so
once you have your image and you guys
might want to pick a more comic book a
theme image but I just put the first
image I got itself to my friends you're
going to want to go up the image at the
top gata adjustments and go to levels
and you're going to want to go ahead and
use this to lighten the image and you do
this to give it more of a comic book
feel you're also going to want to bring
up the contrast so move these around
until you have a high contrast and a
lighter image and go ahead and click OK
and those settings will be different
with every image so just play around
with it the next thing you're going to
want to do is duplicate this background
because when we're applying filters to
it we're not going to be able to change
the background so go ahead and grab it
and drag it over here and you want to be
working on your background copy from now
on now from here go up to filter go to
artistic and go to film grain now go
ahead and as you can see what this does
is kind of make your image a more grainy
it looks more like a painting than image
and that's what we want so go ahead and
adjust it and I'm going to adjust mine
so migraine is about to my highlighted
area is about to as well and I want my
intensity right about nine now as you
see we have more painting looking rather
than an image click OK now for the comic
book look now that we have an image that
looks more like a painting
go ahead and imply the printing pixels
that you see on comic books go to filter
pixelate and you're from here you want
to go to color halftone go ahead and
click for or whatever suits your image
I'm going to click OK and as you see get
all these printing dots over your image
now these are these resembles the
printing dots that they use when they're
on a printing press but we don't want
the dots right like that we want them to
blend in with the image more so to do
this make sure you got your background
copy and go ahead and select darken and
as you see our dots now blend in with
our image now we have a kind of comic
book look and feel to it so now let's
add some comic book text for this I'm
going to go over the shape and get a
custom shape and at the top you can see
all the shapes let me find let's uh get
all the shapes here so go ahead and
click all and I want a kind of comic
booky looking shape so what I want to
choose ah here we go here's a good one
all right I'm choosing this a little
splatter and I'm just going to put a
splatter right there and I'm going to
change it to dark red so let me go click
that and change it to dark red and now
we have this big comic book looking
splatter now um let's go to layer layer
style stroke and what this is going to
do if we click this in turn change it to
black it's going to give us that nice
thick black outline liking comic books
now let's go ahead and once we have that
go ahead and create a text layer just go
ahead and click text and once you start
typing you can see it automatically
makes a new layer you don't have to make
anything so let's uh type some text
actually let's go ahead and select some
text
um let's see that looks like a nice
comic book looking thing for now and
i'll type sleep since uh that's what my
friend tim's doing sleeping right now
now i can go ahead and change that to a
yellow let's go to the yellow make it a
little bigger and let's go ad a stroke
to this so again make sure you're on
layer number one go to layer layer style
stroke change it to nice black okay okay
now you can see it says sleep with a
little blast over it and to move this
around go up to make sure you're on your
sleep later once again or whatever your
says go down to edit free transform now
let's move this over let's rotate it a
tidbit and there you have it go press
ENTER and now you have a nice comic book
looking image and again make sure your
image is a little better than mine this
is kind of actually this is a terrible
image I picked for a comic book but if
you got an image of someone's face or
something that looks much better so that
is the basics of how you make a comic
book looking image with comic book text
so I hope you enjoyed my tutorial I hope
you learned something and i'll see you
next time thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
