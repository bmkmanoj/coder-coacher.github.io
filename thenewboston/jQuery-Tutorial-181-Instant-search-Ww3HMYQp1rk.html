actually create some kind of suffix
because if we for example returned one
result we want this to say one result if
we were to return two results we want
this to say two results so we need to
create a suffix variable in order to set
this to either an S or nothing so
hopefully this makes sense it's just
something I always do to maintain some
kind of structure to a sentence so
suffix is going to be equal to we're
using a short if statement so if result
count we're gonna say doesn't equal 1
then we want suffix to equal s otherwise
we want it to equal nothing so for
example if the result count is 1 we want
to show an S sorry now if the result
count is equal to 1 or is equal to say 2
we want to create suffix or put the
value s into suffix otherwise we don't
need an S so that's just a little bit of
logic there to think about
so now we want to just echo out how many
results have been returned so I'm going
to go ahead and say your search for and
then in here we're going to place the
search term returned an amount of
results and it's not results because we
need to just go ahead and apply the
suffix there so this will pick up the s
or not and apply it just onto the end of
result so your search for let's go ahead
and append on a value here and this is
search term and returned something
results will be the result count so now
this is going to return or echo your
search for and the search that's
currently in or the value that's
currently inside of the input field
returned and we're going to dynamically
obviously update this every time the
user type something and then we've
already spoken about the suffix so I'm
just going to go ahead and
wrap this in paragraph tags so we can go
ahead and test this and this line will
work it will return an amount of results
so I'm gonna go and test this with CH
and that's contained within Manchester
and Chorley so we should receive two
results let's go ahead and test this CH
we don't get a value back so why is that
let's just go and have a look and it
stick out here there we go so we're
place like not places the field name is
placed as we've seen here so just a
small error there that's made our
application useless let's go ahead and
refresh and just test this so CH you can
see now it says your search for CH
return to results if I go ahead and type
something like London that's now return
one result and notice that the S has
disappeared if I go ahead and search for
just L it returns six results so we've
got that suffix s on there so now that
we've got that working let's just go
ahead and make the search term bold as
well as the result count as well
and that will just make that look a bit
nicer so let's search for London you can
see that we now have this updated value
and the result can't return to us so now
all that's left to do is actually return
the results themselves let's go down and
create a while loop and inside this we
want to create a variable that's going
to hold the row data so this is going to
be result or results row and that's
going to be equal to MySQL fetch
associative array and this will take an
array from the search field here and
then we can output some more some
information based on each result so I'm
not going to go ahead and explain this
too much because it's irrelevant but
we'll go ahead and return these results
anyway okay so we want to go ahead and
echo out and we're gonna have each
result inside paragraph tags so for
example if we just typed in a result
here this will create a result text for
each result we have so for example
London we've got one result CH we've got
two results and L we have six results so
now what we all we need to do is fill in
the unique data here based on each
results value so inside of our paragraph
tags we want to first of all return the
place the name of the place so inside
strong tags in here we want to go ahead
and replace this with results row and
remember results row is now an array
because MySQL fetch a sock returns an
array so inside square brackets we want
to put the field name that we want to
take from the database which is place so
we can write place so this will be
working as it is we just need to go and
test this now so we're going to type in
London you can see your search for
London returned one result and we have
the field name there or the field the
row data that corresponds to the place
field let's go ahead and type L you see
that returns all of them that have an L
in them and then we can go ahead and
type CH and we've got that Manchester
and Chorley results just there so now
what we can do is just break down not an
S there
we can break down and go ahead and
output the description as well so let's
just output using exactly the same
results row description so let's go back
and refresh type in London and you can
see the description has been appended to
that as well again which we type l we
get a list of results so in actual fact
we've now completed the application we
have a limited amount of jQuery code
that we actually need to focus on
however it's extremely important to note
that combining things like key upper
then grabbing a value and submitting it
allows you to return some data to a
particular area on your page so it makes
it extremely easy to create something as
dynamic as this the web nowadays is is
going on to you know faster searching
Google now uses I believe jQuery to
actually go ahead and display results as
you type them so implementing something
like this in your website is extremely
effective and easy especially in jQuery
to return code that you might exist in a
wall that you might have already on your
website so just by using this and this
jQuery code and just creating a small
div here we're able to return results as
we search for them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
