to do is download Android studio now the
website is most likely going to change
because they always do however if you
just type in download Android studio
it's always going to be the first thing
that pops up so click this and of course
this is the program that allows you to
write Android applications now the cool
thing about this is that unlike the old
program that you used to use this was
made just for writing Android apps and
it has everything you need built in so
this is the program where we actually
write the code and this is the program
where all these little emulators which
are pretty much like virtual phones that
you can test on those are built into the
entire like layout designer and I'll
teach you guys how to use that later on
but it's basically a graphical arm way
to layout your Android apps that's built
in as well it's incredibly awesome
incredibly cool so let's go ahead and
get started so of course click that
agree to whatever let me read this real
quick little bit oh pretty cool alright
download this and it's actually probably
going to take a little bit to download
because it's almost a gigabyte it might
be a gigabyte by time you download it
but anyways umm I'll come back to you
guys when this is done alright so it
took a while but I finally have it
download this executable file right here
and I want to mention this real quick
before I move on if anyone was lazy and
decide to skip my last tutorial what we
did is we set up the JDK to be
compatible with Android studio so if you
did do that and skip everything then
follow this direction right here but for
those of you guys who stuck with me then
you guys are good to go because we
already did that step so anyways
actually I'm going to close out of that
we don't need this browser anymore
however if we go to our downloaded files
then we see that we now have this
Android studio bundle so this of course
is the Installer so double-click that
alright so anything that pops up just
say yes
we trust them we trust Google
next and leave pretty much you're going
to leave all of these as the defaults
agree agree on do I want to stall in the
default location yes recommended it
looks good that looks good as well don't
it Internet indented eternity all right
so it says it is complete installation
please setup was completed successfully
sweet go ahead and click next and
actually don't want to start this up
right yet because what I want to do is
I'm going to go to my Start menu right
here and I'm going to go to all programs
and now we can see after we have
everything downloaded and installed
we're going to have a folder called
Android studio so if I click that I'm
going to see this Android studio program
I'm going to right-click it and send it
to desktop so that way I have a Android
studio icon on my desktop because we're
going to be using it a lot now so the
first time I open this I'm going to
right click and we're going to choose
run as administrator now the very first
time you open it this thing is going to
pop up right here and it's going to
download all the extra components that
needs but don't worry this is only a
one-time thing the very first time to
set everything up alright so all those
additional components look like
everything is good to go so click finish
alright so this is the welcome screen to
Android studio from here what we can do
is we can actually start a brand new
project however before we get started
there is one last thing that we need to
do this isn't absolutely necessary but
it's going to save you guys a ton of
headaches in the future if you go down
to configure right here you're going to
see something called SDK manager and if
this is grayed out or you can't select
it for some reason make sure that you
close out of this and right click and
run as administrator and then it's going
to be be available so anyways click this
right here and what's going to happen is
you're going to have a new pop-up window
that appears now
this basically allows you to download
additional packages or additional code
that you're going to use whenever you're
developing apps as you can see it says
install nine packages and the ones that
are checked are actually the ones that
we're going to want to install so if you
click this button right here and of
course we need to accept the license and
install then what it's going to do is
it's going to install these additional
packages alright guys so once you have
all the optional packages installed what
you can do is just close out of Android
SDK manager and it's also a better idea
to close the Android studio all together
and now right-click it and run it as
administrator to open it again and the
reason that you want to do this is
because whenever you open it this time
you want to make sure that Android
studio is aware of all the updated
packages so that's why we close that and
open it again so it doesn't have
anything weird stored in its cache or
memory or anything so now we are finally
done installing everything and setting
everything up we are ready to start
making our first Android project</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
