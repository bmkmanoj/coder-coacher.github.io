committing it is basically a two-step
process the first thing that we need to
do is get add in the last time I type
that little a period which pretty much
means all but there's a kind of easier
more self-explanatory way to do this in
type ii dot text now whenever you hit
enter what kit is going to do is it's
going to add this or pretty much get it
ready to commit it's actually called
adding it to the staging area and I just
call it the purgatory because it's in
between you're working copy
let me type this out this is in the
command I'm just explaining something
working copy staging area and someone's
sex to me right now and this is your
repository as well type the whole word
out so basically right now we have our
third whenever we create a file it's on
our working copy it's on a local
computer and then on this last command
right here get add whenever we add it it
goes to the staging area
now the staging area is just pretty much
saying okay these are the files that are
ready to get committed and whenever you
want to commit it or whenever you do
commit it goes to the repository now
everything in the repository is pretty
much your end goal to get the files to
here because whenever they're there get
keeps track of those files and that's
pretty much I don't know why get what's
created I guess so anyways that isn't a
command like I said that's just my way
of explaining this three-step process so
basically this second text file right
now since we added it we added it to the
staging area so now if we go ahead and
type get status and hit enter it says
okay you have one file in the staging
area second text in this third text file
you didn't do anything to it it's just
on your working copy it's just on your
computer you didn't add it to the
staging area yet
so let's just go ahead and press get
commit and now what this is going to do
is it's going to take all the files from
your staging area which is this second
text right here and it's going to push
them to the repository so get commit
message
adding the second file to the repository
and hit enter and it says Allah Allah
gives you a bunch of messages and you
know that's kind of hard to see so let's
just go ahead and press git log and once
we hit enter we see that we now have two
complete commits so this was our first
one right here this is our first commit
and our second one was adding the second
file to the repository pretty frickin
cool but as you can see if we tell you
get status we still have that third file
that we didn't add to the repository
it's just sitting there all alone you
know nobody likes it so let's go ahead
and have it join its friends so the
first thing that we need to do is we
need to get add third text and hit enter
and now as you can see this is now in
the staging area so now from a staging
area we can go ahead and get commit put
a message and say the third file is now
um
joining its friends and hit enter and
what that does is it commits the third
file and of course we can just do git
log and verify all that so this is our
first commit which I have the first file
this come and added the second one and
this added the third file so now all of
our files are in the repository they're
all pretty much keeping track of all the
changes to all of these files now pretty
frickin sweet hopefully now you guys
understand the difference between the
working copy which is the very beginning
stage just making a file or editing it
on your computer the staging area which
is the second stage which is pretty much
getting it ready for the repository and
the third process which is committing
files or finally pushing it to the
repository and once they're in the
repository it can keep track of all the
changes and you're good to go so thank
you guys for watching don't forget to
subscribe and I'll see you guys in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
