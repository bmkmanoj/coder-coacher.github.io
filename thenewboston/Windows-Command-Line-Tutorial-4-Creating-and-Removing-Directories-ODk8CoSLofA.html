video I'm going to show you how to
create and delete directories and it's
pretty straightforward but there are a
couple weird things I have to look out
for so let's just go ahead and look at
my desktop right now I got what is it
seven directories but I actually want to
make a new folder called bacon so I can
store all of my awesome pictures about
bacon so I'm going to go ahead and clear
the screen and in order to make a new
directory just right MK dir stands for
make directory and then write whatever
the name of the folder you want to be so
I want to make a new directory called
bacon and boom look at that so now if I
do dir we got a new directory called
bacon and if I show you you now have
this directory that popped up right
there now if I ever want to delete a
directory then what I do is RM dir this
means remove directory and I'm just
going to remove bacon so now if I write
dir you see that that deleted the bacon
directory so pretty straightforward so
far but here is the tricky thing I was
talking about so let's go ahead and make
the bacon directory again we now got a
directory called bacon let's go ahead
and move into it so let me clear the
screen and we can see that right now
there's nothing inside bacon so let's
just go ahead and make a couple more
directories on inside bacon so I'll just
say test 1 and test 2 test 1 if I write
up tests to check it out all right so
now bacon has two directories inside it
test 1 and test 2 and again there are
any files or anything inside here but
not important so I'm going to go back to
my desktop that's where I'm at right now
and now I'm going to go ahead and try to
delete that bacon directory so RM dir
bacon and it says hmm actually we didn't
delete that and if you look right here
it didn't delete bacon and give you a
little indicator it says the directory
is not empty
so one thing that you have to look out
for is this RM dir command this is only
going to delete a directory if there's
nothing inside it well what if there is
stuff inside it and we just want to
delete everything inside it as well well
what we need to do in that instance is
after the rmdir keyword gifter 8 /s so
what this is going to do is is pretty
much going to delete the folder bacon
just like before
but it's also going to go through and
delete all of the contents of it as well
so again that's /s and look what happens
whenever I run this and by the way
another cool thing actually I'll talk to
you guys about later so let me go ahead
hit enter are you sure you want to
delete it and ask you this because there
is stuff inside it so I'm just going to
hit capital Y enter and we can see that
it's gone right there in different dir
no more bacon so clear screen and what I
was going to say is this so you see that
I have some big long command I mean it
really isn't that long but I just want
to pull up some command for demo if you
ever want to go to the beginning of this
line right here then what you can do is
you can hit left a bunch of times or we
can do is on your keyboard you can
actually just hit home so whenever you
hit home it's going to bring you to the
beginning of that command so that way if
you want to you know add some text there
it's faster also if you hit end then
that brings you to the end of your line
so home and end is a quick way to jump
to the beginning into the end now
another thing that's kind of useful is
if you hold down control and hit left
then this is going to hop you one word
at a time
so again just the left arrow is going to
move one character at a time your cursor
holding down control is going to bump
you one word at a time
so those are some helpful tips or tricks
to move around your command line a
little bit more efficiently but anyways
that is how you create and remove
directories and also when you have a
directory with stuff inside it make sure
to use the slash s to delete all the
contents of your directory as well thank
you for watching I will smell you next
