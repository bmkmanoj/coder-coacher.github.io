edit functionality and remove
functionality working correctly the last
thing I want to do is I would just want
to add a quick button to add a new
comment so let me go ahead and in my
board I just go ahead and add it right
above the board so since we're going to
add a button and still have this board
we actually need to wrap those both
inside one parent div so let me stick my
board back in there and let me just put
fun alright so on the button I'll just
write add new so we'll have a button
right at the top and whenever the user
clicks it it'll just give them um like a
blank one or maybe we'll add some
default text in there who knows and I
already have some styling built in so
I'll say class name I'm going to make a
purple so that's button info again this
isn't any react stuff it's just to make
it a look kind of fancy and great so
again this just makes a purple button
and I can actually render this out right
now alright so there you go when you
click it nothing happens
plain old dumb button so what else do I
want to do what I'm going to do is I'm
actually going to remove all of these by
default so at first we're actually not
even going to have any comments
whatsoever so whenever the user wants a
new one they're going to have to click
this button alright so what might be a
good idea to right now is that make a
function to add a new comment why not
name it ad so function boom roasted now
actually whenever I do this I'm going to
add some default text in there so we
just don't have blank comments or else
they'll look kind of weird and yeah so
this is going to be the text that we're
going to set essentially to this array
item so just like before what we're
going to be doing is pretty much taking
a string of text and adding it to this
array so we need a reference to this
array we're going to make a copy of it
and then for that copy we're just going
to add a new item
so push is how you add a new item to an
array in JavaScript and what text we
want to use just this right here so the
very first time we call this it's going
to have a string of text in here that
says like I love Bucky or I love ice
cream sandwiches whatever and just like
before since we need to update the state
then we're going to update the comment
state using the new array boom roasted
how easy was that so now the last bit of
code we have to write is we have this
function right here now we actually just
have to hook it up to this button so how
do we do that well over an hour button
what we do is we just write on click hey
how it does that on click just like that
and set it equal to this dot add now one
other thing I want to mention is this
whenever you call in this kind of way
since JavaScript can't really figure out
scope yet you need to call bind so this
is actually how you pass some values or
text in right here so what we're going
to bind is just a no object in the
default text is pretty much the text
that's going to appear on the button so
I'll write I'll write something that's
like baking food and I'll spell it wrong
why not so basically whatever you type
here is going to be the default text and
of course the user can edit that later
so let me refresh this and new and there
you go there's our default text I just
didn't want to write default text
because I want to show you guys that you
can like customize this default text
let's do it properly now all right so
you add it we now have a new array item
aka a new comment and the user can edit
this bacon they can add a few more tuna
fish
and you know what I actually didn't even
want this one so I can go ahead and
remove that
boom roasted there you go so that ladies
or gentlemen is probably all I'm going
to do for this little note program
there's a lot more react to toriel's
that I'm going to cover but they're
going to be set up a little bit
differently and for example
you guys probably notice already that is
getting kind of cluttered having all
this code inside one file so later on
I'm going to show you guys how you can
actually take each component break it up
into a single file and then whenever you
run your final build to build your
entire program it kind of bundles
everything up automatically and makes it
run super fast so that's what we'll do
in the next couple tutorials it's going
to be awesome so I'll see you guys then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
