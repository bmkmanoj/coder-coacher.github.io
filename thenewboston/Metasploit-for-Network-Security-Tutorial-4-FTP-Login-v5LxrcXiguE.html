going to take a look at a practical
example of a really common vulnerability
that people have on their servers and
that's how to crack an ftp password so
in the last tutorial we saw whenever we
scan that server that they had FTP by
the way you should never use FTP but on
this server
they have that poor open now since it's
open that means that if they can log
into it then we can log into it so let
me clear out there and check this out so
what I'm going to do here is I'm just
going to search FTP and you can just
search that keyword right there and it's
going to give you a bunch of exploits
related to FTP but I actually know that
I'm looking for FTP login so this is
going to pull up this exploit right here
and it's FTP authentication scanner so
let me copy this and I just want some
more info about it
and are right so what is this module it
lets you this is what I'm reading by the
way this module will test FTP logins on
a range of machine but we're only going
to be testing one not a big deal and
we're basically going to be giving it a
bunch of different passwords and we're
just going to run through them all and
whenever it one works then it's going to
say daunted on there you go those are
the credentials so let me clear out it
there and all right that exploit I'm
just going to use FTP login and all
right so what info do you need to work
so show options hit enter and holy holy
sweet tamale what's going on here
so it gives us a bunch of information
that it arm you know it doesn't need all
of these but this is the other stuff
that you can put in now this is what I
was talking about in the last tutorial
you see how it says that a lot of these
parameters they aren't required but
they're optional so for example if you
were testing one of these things then
you could add it if not then you don't
need to I'll show you guys the
information that you actually do need so
the first thing that you need to do is
you need to set our host and that's just
the IP address of the server that you
want to test now remember mine was 40
5.50 5.2 48 208 all right now another
thing that you want to do is you just
want to set the threads so this is
pretty much up to you how fast or how
many multiple processes do you want
running at a time I'm just going to bump
it up to 30 I don't even know what the
default was I think it was like 25 or
something but uh yeah it just runs a
little bit faster the more you have and
another thing that you can do is you can
actually set the username to root now
what you can do is if you don't know the
user name or you think that they have a
different user name then you can add um
you can actually scan through a list of
files let me show you guys some so if I
go to user names you can like scan
through a bunch of different user names
like I'm going to try root then admin
and test and guess then info yada yada
all those ones but I'm just going to try
one user name in this case and what I'm
going to do is I'm going to run through
a list of passwords so I'm going to look
for root I assume that that's the user
name and I'm gonna try every one of
these passwords so that password list
that I have right here you can get on my
github page link below or there's a
bunch of different password list that
you can find online but ya pastoralists
are definitely a handy thing to have
whenever you're penetration testing but
for right now I'm just going to set the
username is root hit enter and the next
thing I want to do is I want to set that
pass underscore file
fire boom roasted alright so hopefully I
can remember the path of that desktop
security list passwords top 1000 out
text look at that so now let me clear
out of here and now let me show options
again and alright so by the way this
usually doesn't look as jumbled as it
does right now I just had to like I said
bump up the text a lot so it displays so
you guys can actually read it on YouTube
but choosey a little bit neater if you
guys couldn't tell so now that we have
everything set all we need to do is
write exploit enhancer so what this does
is it's going to go through and it's
going to start trying to login so the
password is going to be root for
everyone and I was trying I would excuse
me the username is going to be root and
then it's going to try this password one
two three four five six what about the
password password what about the
password this what about the password
QWERTY boom boom boom there you go now I
don't feel like sitting here and waiting
and I'm sure you guys don't so if you
ever want to stop it you can hold down
ctrl C but if you're actually running
this attack then you will you know of
course want to let it run but there you
go and whenever it hits one that's
correct then it's going to pop up is
green I believe and it's going to say
correct and then the tool is going to
stop for you so what you could do is
just let this run before you go to bed
and wake up in the morning and boom you
got you got the password but let me
clear out of there and that's all there
is to that so again make sure you have a
nice long password list sometimes it
takes a little bit time so you may want
to do it before you go out to eat or go
out or go to bed whatever but that is
that tool of how to find the FTP login
for a server if they have FTP port open
so in the next tutorial I'll show you
guys an example of something else cool
that you can do what it is I don't know
don't really plan these things out there
your thing guys for watching I will
smell you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
