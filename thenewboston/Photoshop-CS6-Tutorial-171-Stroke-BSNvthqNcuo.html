buddy Blackford here another Photoshop
cs6 tutorial and today we're going to be
learning about using the stroke layer
style and a stroke basically applies an
outline around an object around the
edges and it's a really nice tool that
is used a lot in design and other things
like that so let's go ahead and get
started
put out an object or some text or
something and then let's go to stroke
and you can see already that there is an
outline around this here is stroke right
here and then we've got our different
properties we've got size which
increases the size of the stroke the
outline so basically stroke stands for
outline our position here inside so now
it's on the inside and if I make this a
little smaller you'll see what it means
so now we've got a stroke on the inside
so here was outside inside so what it's
doing is the actual blue part of the of
the image here is actually where the
stroke is and it's just coming from the
inside from the edge and going inside
instead of starting from the edge of
going outside so it kind of cuts into
the blue and then we've got Center here
which leaves a space in between so it's
going from the inside and the outside so
most of the time everybody uses outside
and we've got our blending modes here
you don't have to I mean if you need to
know a blending modes are check out the
tutorial about blending modes I did a
four part series there we've got our
opacity to lower the transparency as you
can see there and then we've got our
fill type we've got a color gradient
pattern so here's where you change your
color so I could change this to what I
want anything I want there whatever
green and then we've got gradient we can
change it to any kind of gradient than
we want to use
like that and we've got our angle of our
gradient it could change that around to
randomize it a little more we got a
couple different styles to use for our
gradients and pretty much you just mess
with the styles and see if you can find
something that you like aligned with
lair which aligns it from this part of
the layer to this part from it uses the
layer as a guide if you turn it off it
uses like the whole thing as a guide
they're not really doing too much here
with the dither because it's such a
small stroke
and then we've got our scale to increase
the scale of our gradient so it's just
only being applied to from here to here
and then just the outsides aren't even
being used so let's go to the next one
which is pattern and then that way you
can select an image pattern to put onto
it here and now we've got our little
hippie sign here so that's basically all
there is for a stroke most of the time
you're not going to use pattern or
gradient you're probably going to just
use a solid color normally black or
another complementary color to this and
that's it so thanks for watching this
one you guys are now pros on using the
stroke so go ahead and put it on your
projects and it'll be awesome looking
see you guys later and have a good day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
