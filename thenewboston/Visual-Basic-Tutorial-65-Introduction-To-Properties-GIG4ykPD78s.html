slash on live gamer for the new Boston
and in this tutorial we're going to be
learning about properties now what
properties do is it's a way of
encapsulating data within a class now
let's say you have a variable that's
declared private and in another class
and you cannot access it what you can do
is you can use a property to get that
variable and see what it is without
directly accessing the data now what
this does is let's say you make a
property you've got a variable you don't
want to change that variable but you
want to access it indirectly and have it
stored in that property you can create a
property get the variable and then if
you want to you can set the variable
using that same property so here is the
program that we worked on in the last
tutorial now I you can see I've changed
it a bit here I'm go ahead and open your
toolbox and add a date/time picker right
here drag that over there and drag a
label set the label text to state not
initialize and set the name to label
State as you can see right here set the
day time bigger name to day time picker
hour or DTP hour and set the format to
time and you can go ahead and resize it
some if you want and here is that
enumeration that we created last time I
added some stuff to it we've got asleep
waking up school lunch home and
programming so we'll go ahead and just
create a variable of the data type day
action so private state as day action
okay now what we're going to do is we're
going to create our property so we're
going to do this by using either the
public or private keyword at first we're
going to use private so we'll type
private and then the keyword property
and then we have to have a name for it
so we'll just call it our and you use
empty parameters and you're going to
have to specify a data type for it so
we'll just make it an integer and you'll
go ahead and press enter and type end
property okay so now what we need to you
do is use what's called a a get
statement so the way we do this is we
start by typing get an exam we press
ENTER we get an in get and you can see
it adds a set function for us now
properties are similar to classes even
though I haven't talked to you those yet
but they're a lot more efficient you
can't do as much but they're more
efficient and when you want when you can
use them use those instead of classes
you'll understand more when we get into
classes okay but with a get what we're
going to do is we're going to get a
variable so we're just going to get the
current hour that is displayed on this
date time picker so what we do is we
type return DTP hour the new type dot
and then you type value and it says get
to set the date time value assigned to
the control dot hour so what this is
going to do is just going to get the
current hour that is displayed on the
date/time picker now we could use when
we use return it sets property hour
equal to the hour that is on selected on
DTV hour we could also type instead of
return we can type our equals DTP our
value our
so we'll just go ahead and put return
and now what we're going to do is we
have to create a set function you can
see it's already created for us and
we've got five al value as integer so
whenever somebody calls set they're
going to have to give it a value so what
we're going to do is we're going to set
the date using the hour pass to this
property so if they give us an hour
we're going to set that hour so let's go
ahead and type DTP our dot value so this
is going to do is going to set the value
of DTP hour and we're just going to set
that equal to and this is a little
introduction to date and time functions
that are left individual basic we'll go
more into depth more in depth with those
later but for now we're just going to go
ahead and create a couple little things
with it so I'll type new date you can
see it says represents an instant in
time typically expressed as a date and
time of day so date is going to take
several arguments so first we're going
to set the year so to get the current
year we're just going to go ahead and
type now and what now is is its return
to day value containing the current date
and time according to your system so
whatever their system says it's going to
get the year for that so now dot year so
now what we can do is we can get the
month so we'll type now dot month and
you can see right here that is giving us
a new date and we have three arguments
for this year month and day and we're
going to be using a little bit more than
that so now we can set the day so we'll
type now dot day which will give us the
the day of the week or not the day of
the week the day in the month so now
what we're going to do is we're going to
set the current hour and you remember
that they
value to the set function so we're just
going to go ahead and put value here
which is the hour as an integer and
we'll set the minute equal to zero and
the second equal to zero also so we
created a property we got the current
hour that is being displayed on the
date/time picker then we have a set
function that will set the daytime
picker hour to the specific value that
we pass to it so properties are a lot
more confusing than enumerations as I
said enumerations might be a little
confusing to you in the last tutorial
but we'll talk more about these in the
next tutorial and so if you don't
understand this don't practice it yet
you will understand gradually as we go
along so thanks for watching and stay
tuned for the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
