34th chemistry tutorial and in this
story we're gonna be talking about
single displacement reactions or some
people like to call them substitution
reactions why you'll probably figure
that out later on but first I want to
show you guys this I thought this was
pretty funny I was looking at reddit the
other day and if you don't know what
reddit is it's pretty much a website
where people can post like funny
pictures and videos and articles and I
don't know it's just like a funny
website so anyway someone posted a
picture in another guy comments he goes
this picture is perfect may use it for
future purposes the other dude goes no
in the original commenter goes I'll take
that as a yes regards and I just
sometimes the comments are funnier than
the post themselves so that was the case
actually made me lol kind of
embarrassing but I did it so now ok guys
focus focus let's get back to chemistry
here single displacement reactions what
is it why do we need them a single
displacement reaction is often called a
substitution or acting because like I
said before it's basically when one
element replaces another so let's go
ahead and take a take a look at a real
easy example say you have something like
lithium now lithium can combine with na
which is sodium and Cl which is chlorine
and what can happen is this lithium can
basically replace the sodium and that's
because the lithium is more active so
you end up with Li CL plus some sodium
so if we take a look one more time
basically this sodium right here got
replaced and that's all that happened it
got replaced by the lithium and that is
because remember they say lithium is the
more active element so that's why it
basically replaces it and bonds with a
chlorine instead and we don't even need
to balance this because we just have one
of each so there you go there's your
balancing right there so let's go ahead
and take a look at a little not harder
but a little more complex equation so
say we have a element of zinc so zinc
and it's going to go ahead and combine
with some hydrochloric acid
two molecules of it so hydrochloric acid
is actually H my twos and Z's look
really close huh I might want to find a
way to fix that anyways this is it -
this is a Z so anyways we have two
molecules of hydrochloric acid which is
HCl and whenever they react what happens
is this zinc is going to go ahead and
replace the hydrogen so we have zinc
bonded with chlorine and we also have
two left over hydrogen atoms so if we go
ahead and balance this because it's a
little bit different we have one zinc on
the left-hand side and we have two
hydrogen's and we have two chlorines now
of course we want to make sure we
started with the same amount of stuff
that we ended up with so let's go ahead
and count our sinks one zinc our
hydrogen's we go ahead and we have two
of those still and our chlorine - those
simple enough so basically remember the
concept of a single displacement
reaction is when you have a compound and
remember two or more elements bonded
together and another element comes in
and replaces one of them so in this case
we had hydrogen bonded with chlorine and
we end up with zinc bonded with chlorine
simple enough okay you got it so now if
you guys are like this crap is easy let
me go ahead and throw something a little
bit more difficult at you let's say that
we have and this is your homework
assignment so pay attention you have two
lithium atoms and you go ahead and what
can i bon this with two hydrogen
molecules so h2o what you're going to
end up with is two hydrogen and also how
am I gonna write this okay you end up
with some amount of lithium bonded with
oxygen and hydrogen your job for the
evening is to find out how many
molecules of lithium oxygen in hydrogen
you have so you need a balance the
sign right here and you need to balance
this side right here
and you're gonna find out the
coefficient from this so there's your
little tip first person to find out the
answer gets the donate I'll say I don't
know
you can donate $15 to me if you want so
that's your prize you get to send me
some money so anyways thank you guys for
watching I'm gonna go onto Reddit and uh
member first person come up with the
answer wins I'll see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
