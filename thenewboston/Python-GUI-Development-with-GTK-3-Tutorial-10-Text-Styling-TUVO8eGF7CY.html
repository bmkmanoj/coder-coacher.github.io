this video I want to talk to you about
typography in other words how to style
your labels and I'll show you guys a
bunch of cool things you can do with
them like if you have a bunch of text
and you want to left line it right align
it make it big make it bold italics you
can actually even have links like you
would find on a web page inside your
program and then whenever the user
clicks on those links it opens up their
default browser and takes them to that
web page a bunch of awesome stuff you
can do and on top of that what I'm going
to do is I'm going to show you guys
another awesome type of layout and I
don't even know the name of this you
know kind of layout I just call it box
ception
it's basically and don't never call it
box action or like try to look it up
online no one calls it that but me but I
call it that because it's essentially
sticking boxes inside other boxes and I
love this because what we're gonna be
doing is we're gonna be creating one
horizontal box left and right and then
each box we stick inside is a column and
I'll show you guys an example of when
this would be useful so look at this
piece of software I'm working with right
now just just the pie chart you see how
we have a section on the left the slope
project section and then my main area in
the middle and then this little area on
the right well what we're going to be
doing is we're gonna be kind of
resembling this where we have one kind
of big row and that's a horizontal box
and each box we add to it is gonna be a
vertical box or a column so then in
those columns we can put whatever we can
put more boxes we can just stack things
on top of each other it's gonna be
pretty cool but that's you know the
overview of what we're gonna be doing so
I'll just make all my boxes first
alright so let me make that horizontal
box verse and again this is just gonna
be the main row that we're gonna stick
everything in size so gtk box
give it a spacing of 20 and now let me
set this to homogenous and I'll set this
equal to false and by the way
homogeneous whenever this method is set
to true it means that all children the
equal space so depending on if you want
everything inside to be equally spaced
out or just the fit to you know pretty
much adapt to the contents of it it's
either true or false
so whatever looks better for your layout
you know that's how you can manage that
now another thing after this we're going
to do is once we have our H box we're
gonna start adding those columns now if
you have multiple columns then you
probably want to call them like column a
column B column C or one two three but
I'm only gonna have two in this example
so I'm just gonna say left and right so
V box just say blue box left equals okay
box and for my columns I actually want
to change the orientation of this so
orientation equals vertical actually
Aereo that's why I wasn't popping them
vertical and I'll give this spacing of
22 not 20 to 20 as well alright so
there's my left in she might as well do
this geez art so boom roasted I'm gonna
do the same thing for right all right so
now this is my entire row and I have a
column on the left and a column on the
right so now the only thing I have to do
is actually organize everything what can
I say Oh pack the two vowels just so it
knows I have three columns created and
it's like alright what do you want to do
you just want to stick them all on there
or do you want to put some inside the
other what's going on here and this is
where I say that so pack start D box
left
Treacher zero and the same thing with v
boxer right alright so there is our
layout and again all we did is we
created three invisible boxes and then
we're saying hey we're actually going to
stick this one in this one inside this
one so now whenever we create our items
we just add them to either V box left
for V box right and everything is gonna
be freaking golden it's gonna be awesome
so just at first I'm just gonna create a
default label and I'm gonna do this
because I'm gonna pull all the source
code on github and not only do I want to
give you guys a reference of what just
plain text looks like but anytime you
want to get a specific label instead of
having to beg o have to look this up
and/or watch this tutorial again just go
to my github page copy it and plop it in
your program so just the K label and
again no styling whatsoever I'll just
write this is a plain label now I'll add
things to my left column for so V bucks
left pack starts label true true zero
and let me holy sweet or ever yoli's
alright now let me say up okay let's say
normal a little bit better if I comment
those a alright so we've got our normal
label looking good and now let me show
you how to make it left justified and
right justified actually let me write it
left the line so you can also align text
left and right you really never align
text to the right that often when do you
ever see it if anyone knows let me know
a newspaper not even in the newspaper
just like I don't know maybe a flyer
whatever but this is how you do it label
equals
gtk label and instead of just writing
your text into the constructor you can
also set it this way so set text and
let's go ahead and add a couple lines
and I'll just write like god this is
left-aligned text and anytime you want
to add a new line or like kind of a
break then you just write backslash N
and that's the kind of universal symbol
for hey this is pretty much resembles
pressing enter on my keyboard and I'll
say oh wow
multiple lines so cool oh man another
quality program from the New Boston
alright so we have a label we set the
text all right so that that and the
justify is justification left all right
looking good now of course you got to
pack it in and look at that I'll just
copy this so that's the benefit of
naming your variables all the same
things so this text is gonna be left
aligned and I'll just copy this and make
this right on line or a quick and I she
do it this way so if I copy this and
plop it right in there I'll show you
guys that you can either use the setter
method or the constructor alright and of
course I want to align that to the right
and let me add some more words so it
doesn't look identical is the first one
all right that's good so this is gonna
appear just as normal this is gonna be
left aligned that's gonna be right as
line and actually we don't even need to
we just test this right now so add each
box to the main window and let's make
sure everything's working at first
all right so check this out so this is
our plane label we didn't do anything
special to it now this text right here
this is left-aligned and it could might
be a little bit hard to see actually let
me I'll have enough content on there to
really demonstrate it alright so now we
can easier easily see that art so this
text is left-aligned this text is right
aligned looking good but you know
aligning text that isn't really that
impressive at all so let's look at
something a little bit more interesting
and that's enough for the left column so
in the right column I'll show you guys
have a line wrap and this is something
that annoys a lot of people so usually
they're making a program in there like
pulling text from a database and they
try to print it out you know on their
piece of software and it's just going
off the screen it's not wrapping like
you would think like an in a normal
browser you actually need to set the
liner app whenever you have a bunch of
text so I'll just write label okay and
let me just write like I my name is
lucky I love him and let me just paste
this a bunch of times so you can
actually see that we are going to wrap
something alright so this is a lot of
text and well first let me just display
on the screen now and show you guys the
wrong way to do it so if you just write
like something like label okay let's not
even do anything I'm sure you guys have
done this looks
so VBox right true-true boom roasted
alright so we've got a bunch of text in
holy sweet tamale look at this
alright so our text is clearly not
behaving like we will like it too I mean
this column looks pretty good but this
column is going away off the screen so
unless you want to make a piece of
software that is like 8000 miles wide
then what we need to do is we actually
need to change one line of code or add
one line of code and that is for the
label we want to set the line wrap equal
to true so now when you run this check
it out oh I don't want to do that either
art so now instead of just going off the
screen it actually wraps like we expect
it to so now the user can resize the
window and adjust perfectly a much
better design and actually let me let me
delete this because I don't have a bunch
of mumbo-jumbo text and I'm trying to
teach the rest of these that's right
lucky I love ham looking good art now
another cool thing I want to show you
guys is this instead of just wrapping
lines we can kind of go for that
newspaper effect so you know whenever
you're reading a newspaper the text
isn't left aligned or right aligned its
kind of justified in a way where it
fills up the entire column in the sense
that all of your columns are equal sizes
and it looks really neat and the way
that they do this is instead of just
picking the exact number of words for
each line they actually add spaces
between some words so some words may
have one space between some words may
have three spaces between but if fills
it all in automatically so you have nice
equal columns so I'll just write um fill
newspaper right here and let me just
copy this like three more times
all right so in order to get the
newspaper effect what you do is you of
course set the line wrap equal to true
because if you don't then this is gonna
plow off the screen and the other thing
you do is you set the justify and you
just copy this now instead of right or
left you actually set this equal to fill
just like that so now whenever you're on
this bad boy check it out
you see that I can shrink it or stretch
it and instead of having text that has
spaces like this is right line and it
has a big gap right here and this is
left line and has big gap right here
look what happens to this so it changes
in this column or the text is always the
same width and this is really good if
you have a type of layout where you have
like a magazine and you have text in
this column and tested in this column it
makes it a lot easier to read for the
user and the last thing that I'm going
to show you guys is actually that markup
that I was talking to you guys about
so markup is kind of like its own flavor
of HTML in the sense that you can
surround text with tags and it displays
differently for example you can have
small big bold italics and show you guys
that right now so let me just make a
label I'll just set this equal to a
blank label at first and for the label
I'm actually gonna set
Margeaux alright so in here instead of
just writing basic text I'm actually
gonna write a bunch of stuff so the
first one is small and I'll just write
like a small text so just like HTML in
order to make a tag you write less than
and then the keyword and then greater
then and then at the end of it do you
write the same thing but you have that
forward slash right there and now let me
actually put each of these on a new line
so actually stick this on a new line to
my look I've seen that's not what's the
easiest way to do this probably if we
just do it incredibly lazy so we can
have small we can have big and we can
have what's another one anytime you want
to make it bold you just write the
letter B sorry I am bold text and I'll
write all of them because I know that's
a lot of you guys are probably just
gonna alright I want one there we go
copy it from my github so anytime you
want italics
italics is cool too and right and I
right there and now another cool thing
you can do is you can actually add
hyperlinks as well so in your suffer you
can link to what's a website you would
always want to link to probably the New
Boston com
so you hurt your limp like normal and
inside the eight tags are what text is
gonna display to the user I'll just
write learn cool stuff
that's right learn stuff now of course
what website you want to link to you add
the href attribute now check this out
usually your href attribute is you write
the name or excuse me the URL in between
these double quotes but the problem is
the text is surrounded by double quotes
so in order to escape those before any
double quote inside you write a
backslash before it and that says you
know don't treat this as the end of the
string treat it as a special character
and you can also add an optional title
to it now a title um I'll just write
like um over text you guys are going to
see that there's gonna be a link and
whenever you hover your mouse over it
this is what's gonna appear the title
right there and let me also make sure
that label set liner up equal to true so
it doesn't pop off the screen and
everything
should be good to go so let me run this
and we got an error markup error and
that is because you can't make an
italics with two different letters so
all right so italics RI and then of
course you have to close it with the
same tag and now check it out it looks a
little bit better so again this is small
this is big this is bold and I forgot to
add a new line but you get the point and
check this out this is what I was
talking about with the title actually
let me add a new line that's bugging me
all right so this is what I was talking
about with the hover so this is a link
of course and whenever you hover it that
text appears over it's kind of like a
tooltip and if you were to click this
then the users default browser opens and
it takes them to that page so pretty
sweet that is your quick little tutorial
on you know typography labels styling
whatever you want to call it and again
I'm gonna put all this on my github page
so anytime you want to you know change
the styling of your text you don't have
to watch this video again just go copy
whatever little chunk you need plop it
in there and you guys are golden
so anyways think as Russian I'll see you
guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
