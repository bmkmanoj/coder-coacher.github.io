in in this video we are finally going to
start running Bucky Instant Messenger
the greatest Java instant messenger ever
created so the first thing we need to do
is we need to run the server program
because go ahead and run server test
Java and once you do this this is the
program that sits on your server and it
waits for someone to connect to it so as
you can see right now if you try to type
something in text box it won't let you
because we disabled that functionality
but what it does say is waiting for
someone to connect so again I want to
recap one more time what we did is we're
running this program and I'm running it
on my computer just so you know you guys
on YouTube can see but typically this is
the program that's going to sit on a
public server and wait for people to
connect with it so let's go ahead and
with that being said let's hop over to
client test Java and run this program
which is an entirely different program
so now you can see a bunch of things
changed but guys this program right here
client mofo is the program that's going
to sit on the clients computer so even
though you guys are watching this on
YouTube and you see on pretty much two
different windows and looks like the
same program these are actually two
completely different programs you run
this one on the server and you run this
one on the client and once they're both
running both programs are set up where
they can successfully have a you know
conversation with each other so let me
go ahead and show you guys that right
now so the server whenever the server
sends a message it says server and then
it sends their message so now the client
whenever you connect to the server it
would be like hey man what's up and it
says client said hey man what's up and
now the server would be like not much
bro you and send that and now on both of
their screens it says not much bro you
and then the client would be like um
where are you from
hit enter says where are you from and
then you know the server would be like
Vienna doctor thought sausage even
though that doesn't make sense you know
maybe the servers
said that who knows so as you can see
two people can now have a conversation
with each other using Java Buckey
Instant Messenger pretty freaking cool
now whenever anyone wants to end the
conversation for example the client all
they have to type is capital e and D hit
enter in both of these windows say
closing connections waiting for someone
to connect that's what it's going to say
on the server side and the client is
going to say closing crap down they can
now exit in the server if you try typing
something since you're not connected to
anyone you can so remember that
functionality that we added right here
that says run this loop or have a
conversation while message is not equal
to server end or client end that's why
whenever you wrote e and D then it
closed the program because it broke out
of the loop now remember we already
closed out of the client side program
but whenever another client joins
watches you can't type anything if you
have a server right now but whenever you
open client test again and another
client joins then it says now connected
to localhost 127.0.0.1 say hey I'm new
bro sup or something stupid like that
but anyways guys like I said probably
the coolest program that I made yet an
instant messenger program completely
made in Java where you can have it on
two different computers and they can
connect using streams and sockets and
have an actual instant messaging
conversation with each other so don't
forget whenever you would put this on an
actual server again you typically want
to run this on the same computer this
would be on either a dedicated server or
a virtual private server and you would
need to take note of the IP address in
the port number so whenever you were
programming the client side of this
program then you would know what to
input right here and also the port
number which goes right here
so those are
only two things that you guys need to
change whenever you add this to your own
server and guys one last time if you
have any questions about anything on the
instant messenger or you want any of the
source code for free go to my forum T&amp;amp;B
forum comm and you can ask your
questions or get all the source code for
free there so one last time thank you
guys for watching don't forget to
subscribe and in the upcoming videos
what I'm going to be teaching guys had
to do is take this networking even
further and show you guys how to develop
games that you in another person that
live an entirely different state or
country can play the same games together
an MMO it's going to be awesome so thank
you guys for watching don't forget
subscribe and I'll see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
