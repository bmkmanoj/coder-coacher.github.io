first tutorial and in this story I'm
going to be introducing something called
structures so what a structure is is
kind of a variable that lets you store a
bunch of similar information
now while array can hold a bunch of
similar items all of the items in turn
array have to be the same data type such
as char and flow stuff like that but
with structures you can store a bunch of
related information and it doesn't have
to be the same data type so say you
wanted the store information about a
bunch of people like their name and how
old they are first you have a char
variable for their name and integer
variable for how old they are you
couldn't do this with an array so what
C++ did is it made something called a
structure and lets you hold items of
more than one data type and in this
tutorial I'm going to be teaching you
how to do that so the first thing that
we're going to need to do is declare a
structure and to do this you need to use
the syntax STR UCT struct and then after
this is the syntax for structure struct
so this is going to stay the same when
you're declaring all your structures and
next you want to give a name or a tag
when you're declaring your structure and
I'm going to name my new person since we
are going to be talking about people
today now after this press Enter and add
two curly braces and add a semicolon at
the end now in your curly braces you're
going to add something called members
and a member is pretty much all of the
bits of information that you're going to
want to use in your structure so the
first type of variable we're going to
want to use is something called let's
store the person's name so in all of
these structures we're going to want to
store the person's name and age so let's
go ahead and make a char name 20 and if
you don't know what all this means then
it's in my
lacet Orioles so now we're in the name
variable we're going to store the
person's name and another piece of
information we're probably going to want
to store is an int and we'll name that
variable age so integer age is an
integer you guys all know that so again
just to recap the struct is the keyword
for declaring instructor structure the
new person is called the tag when
declaring your structure and all of
these things new person has two members
that has your name and the age of
variable and again these are just the
types of variables so now that we
declared our structure we're going to
want to know how to use our structure in
an actual program so here's your program
int main right here and anytime you want
to use a structure this is what you need
to do the first thing that you're going
to need to do is first get your
structures declaration by saying new
person and yours might be different but
that's the one I'm going to use so new
person and we'll say Greg because or
let's just say Bucky because that's what
I'm talking about now now that we have
the person's Bucky we're going to want
to say some information about them so we
got to tell what the the name and the
age of Bucky is so go ahead and add your
curly braces in semicolon just as always
in the syntax for doing this is of
course we have a char variable so the
first thing we're going to want to do is
add the name now we use this and set it
equal to the first variable in your
structure and since we're using the new
person structure the first variable is a
name so give me my name it's Bucky the
in just add a regular
, in the and on the next line the next
piece of information that our structure
asked for is its age so go ahead and add
21 and you don't need a comma after that
since that is the last part of declaring
our structure and now we have the
information from Bucky
my name is Bucky in my age is 21 so in
case you're wondering RA now we have all
this how can we actually use this as a
variable anytime you want to use this as
a variable let me just show you guys
output on the screen the first thing
when you're calling your variable the
first thing you need to do is find the
tag and the tag is Bucky so go ahead and
write Bucky and the next thing you're
going to want to write is whatever
member you want to use and these are the
members name age so let's say Bucky age
or the age of Bucky that's what we want
to use so go ahead and I'm just going to
end my line so again whenever you want
to use a structure you need to UM first
make the tag and then you want to name
your structure and then you insert the
pieces of information that go along with
your structure and again whenever you
want to call it you name your tag first
and then you name whatever member of it
and that's how you call it so let's
execute compile and run and hopefully if
I didn't get any errors I should have
the number 21 and there you go and that
is how you use structures for when you
are using armed structures and C++ so
again let's just recap this one more
time so let's stick in your head because
I know it's really confusing the first
thing you want to do when you want to
use structures in your program is the
first thing is to put the tag new person
of your structure that you already
declared the next thing that you're
going to want to do is make the name
that you're going to be using when you
use your tag so I'm going to name mine
Hoss you have a person named Hoss and
again add your two curly braces and a
posh free and in your curly braces you
add the structure members so the first
thing it asks for is the name and the
name for this person is going to be
tossed Jones and the next thing as for
is the age and he's going to be 45 so
those are the two things that it has for
name and age and again to output on the
screen you first need its tag which is
pause and then name or actually we will
do age this time you need its tag and
then its member which is pretty much who
you're talking about
and what property you're talking about
so let's go ahead and execute compile
and run and hopefully if nothing goes
wrong which it did new person Hoss oh we
forgot to add an equal sign and since
you're declaring variables
remember that equal sign anytime you
declare variable you have to have equal
sign execute compile and run and it will
work this time trust me we get the age
of haast Jones 45 so on this is
something you guys need to watch
probably a couple times learn this until
it sticks in your head the most
confusing part of this is a syntax so
once you learn it you'll be fine so on
again thank you for watching and the
next tutorial we're probably going to be
going over how to work with text files
it's going to be real interesting so
again thanks for watching make sure you
subscribe my channel all of this
information I'm going to have posted on
my web
like the new boston.com so if you want
to just copy it you can go right to my
site and get it there so thanks for
watching make sure you subscribe and
I'll see you next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
