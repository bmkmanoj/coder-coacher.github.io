name is buddy Blackford and today we're
gonna be learning how to apply graphic
styles and a graphic style is a
collection of attributes that can be
applied to a layer or it's sub layer or
an entire group so you put these
basically on there pretty much like
presets and you apply them to a layer
and it applies the different styles to
your layer so the first thing we need to
do is open the graphic Styles panel and
that is over here on the right we've got
the graphic styles which is this box
with another small like diamond box
panel or you can go into a window and
just click on graphic styles and there
you go now these are kind of like
filters almost in Photoshop if you're
familiar with those then you should
catch onto these pretty quickly so I've
got a background here and I've got this
black monster looking dude and then I've
got his two eyeballs and those are the
different paths that I have actually in
this and let's apply a graphic style to
them so let's apply a graphic style to
this black section here and what you're
gonna do is go down to this library icon
and these are the different libraries
here that you can use that are shipped
with illustrator and I'm gonna go to
something like artistic effects and if I
click on one of these if I right click
on it I can see how the artistic effect
would work on the actual object make
sure you have it selected so that you
can actually see the preview so this
preview is like a charred paper look and
now he looks like a charred paper kind
of dude here's like a stained glass kind
of look and as you can see these kind of
reminds you of some Photoshop filters
that you if you messed around with them
like that well that one's kind of
crazy-looking and then you can keep on
going you've got textures so maybe you
want him to be made out of all bricks
there you go and then we've got these
style patterns which are really cool
actually and they give you these
cool-looking styles that somebody
created so there you go you can do the
same thing with the with the eyes going
on here so maybe I want to add this one
or this one so we've got our different
textures are different styles down here
and then we've got our main graphic
Styles panel here and every time you
click on one it'll come up here into the
graphic Styles panel and you can click
on either one of these to apply that new
graphic so I added those in and then
they match perfectly with it and as you
can see the patterns they match
perfectly if you have them perfect if
you have the object perfectly aligned
now if you have just like one picture
and it's just like a photo
it might sums a lot of the graphic
styles aren't gonna really work on it so
for example I'll show you what I mean
I'm just gonna open this photo and let's
go ahead and apply some graphic styles
to it let's go to artistic effects if I
click on it you can see that this this
isn't really applying the scribble
effect to it it's not really working the
way I want so we're gonna apply these to
our you're gonna apply these to certain
images and that way what I meant was
actually is that certain effects will
only apply to certain images you can't
use you're not gonna be able to use
everything on one image but pretty much
all of the artistic effects actually
work on vectors so you don't really have
to worry about that too much so if I
went into something like these patterns
that I had here before and if I try to
add the pattern it's not it's not gonna
work it's not gonna actually add the
pattern to it
it's all we've got is the one layer with
the image here and even when I select
that that way it still does not work so
just that just giving you a heads up
there
not all of the Styles work on all the
pay all the different kinds of images
that you've got going on there so that's
all I wanted to show you about this
thanks a lot for watching and learning
about graphic styles hopefully you guys
can use it in your next project or
whatever else you're doing working on so
thanks a lot for watching be sure to
subscribe for more videos and give the
video a thumbs up if you learn something
thanks a lot have a good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
