XHTML and CSS tutorial in this tutorial
we're going to be finishing up talking
about links now we need to cover two
last things one is how to make a link to
an email address and the second is how
to make something called a tooltip which
is pretty much when you hover over the
link a box pops up showing what you know
it can say anything you want you'll see
when we get there but first let's learn
how to create a link to someone's email
address and these may be useful on the
contact us page or you know um well
you'll see so let's go ahead and make a
link that says email Bucky so that's
going to be the text on the screen so
now what you need to do is for that href
let's just go ahead and set that equal
to someone's email so you might think
that it's just as easy is writing an
email in here like Bucky at yahoo.com
but it's not what you need to do is
before you write their email address you
need to write the key word male 2 with
the colon oops
not mailed TP not mail toilet paper male
2 there you go so let's go ahead and
save this and see what happens
refresh and go ahead and if you click
this then your default you know whatever
your email program is pops up and I
didn't set mine up yet but if it was set
up
then it'll you know get ready to email
Bucky so that brings me to another point
this is why I don't like or recommend
linking to people's email if you want to
give someone your email on a website
just go ahead and write it in plain text
then they can copy it and paste it into
their email editor or what's the email
program whatever because I use like
yahoo.com you probably use like Gmail or
something so whenever I click this link
I don't want Outlook to pop up ever
because I hate Outlook so anyways just
keep that in know keep your users in
mind whenever you're designing a web
page but anyways
recapping one last time whenever you
want to create a link to an email which
I don't recommend but anyways you need
to write a href and as the address write
male 2 and then their email address if
you go ahead and just write their email
address it won't work let's watch what
happens
refresh and click and it gives us a
bunch of errors so that's why you need
that little mail to thing in front of it
so that is how you create a link to
someone's email address
simple enough even though I hate it so
the last thing I want to cover is how to
create one of those tooltips
in that's this let's go ahead and create
a basic link to Google first so a and
let's go ahead and end it the text is
going to be Google and the destination
is going to H ref equals HTTP google.com
so this is a link to Google let's go
ahead and check it out run launch in
Chrome when you click it it links to
Google easy enough but what I think
would be a good idea is when you hover
over it a box pops up telling you you
know maybe giving you some more
information about Google so let's just
go ahead and learn how to do that right
now
you know how I said that sometimes tags
need something called attributes which
give them more information about that
tag well not only does the a tag have a
href attribute but it also has a title
attribute so if you take the title and
set it equal to you know awesome search
engine whenever we save this and refresh
it now look what happens when we hover
over Google it says awesome search
engine as the tooltip so that is how you
create a basic tooltip on again you can
put more than one attribute inside a tag
just make sure that they're not touching
each other and it's the same format as
before the attributes name and set it
equal to whatever you want so that is
how you create a link to Google with its
tooltip to to to to
tip I didn't uh you know your videos not
skipping I actually was just stuttering
so that is how you do that now you guys
know basically everything you need to
know about links so anyways thank you
guys for watching don't forget to you
know watch the next story because that
isn't all there is to web design there's
a ton more stuff we have to cover so
anyways one last time thank you guys for
watching don't forget subscribe and I'll
see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
