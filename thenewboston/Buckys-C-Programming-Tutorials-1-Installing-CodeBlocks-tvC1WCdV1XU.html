Bucky Roberts and welcome to your very
first C++ tutorial now my guess is that
if you're watching this video you
probably already have a basic
understanding of what C++ is but for
those of you guys who don't C++ is a
computer programming language it's how
you make computer programs computer
games so if you're interested in making
any of those then congratulations you're
in the right spot so before we just
start opening any program and trying to
write C++ code I want to let you guys
know that you need to download and
install a few programs first now good
news all these programs are entirely
free but before we just go ahead and
start installing them let me tell you
guys what they are and what they do the
first program that you're going to need
is called an i d-- II this is pretty
much the program that allows us to write
the code and run it aside from that we
need something called a compiler now ago
piler is basically the thing that
translates the code that something that
computer program is going to understand
to something computers can understand so
we're going to be typing code and it's
going to be easy for us to read and
understand what's going on but in order
to transfer it to or excuse me translate
it to a bunch of ones and zeros that the
computer can understand we need that
compiler so that being said a lot of
people download these separately they
download IDE and then they download a
compiler but what I'm going to be doing
is I'm going to be showing you guys a
program that is going to allow you to
download and install it all in one big
shebang so let's go ahead and open
Google and like I said don't worry about
paying for anything because this program
is entirely free so anyways like I said
go ahead and open google and type in
code blocks and go ahead and press Enter
now the first link that's going to pop
up is probably going to be four code
blocks org so go ahead and click that
and this is the program that we're going
to be downloading so of course we need
to find the download link you can either
click on this one on the left or this
one on top doesn't matter
go ahead and click on one of those and
we see a couple options here download
the binary release download the source
code or retrieve source code from SVN
we're going to want to download the
binary release it's the easiest and most
simple way to download this program code
blocks so go ahead and click download
binary release and check it out it gives
us all these options now depending on
what platform you're running most of you
guys will all be running Windows you're
going to want to choose one of these
options but for those of you running
Linux and they also have a Mac version
down here you might want to choose these
but for most of us we're going to be
running this on a Windows machine sorry
saying all right now we have it narrowed
down to two choices code blocks 1005
setup or code blocks 10:05 a.m. ing W
setup what we want to do is we want to
download this second one the one that
says mi n GW now this version 1005 may
be different depending on when you're
watching this tutorial and if they
updated code blocks but make sure you
get the one that says mi n GW the first
one is the IDE the second one M mi ng W
that mi ng W means the compiler to so
when we download this it's going to give
us the IDE and remember that's where we
write the code at the compiler as well
remember the compiler is the program we
need so the computer can understand what
we're doing so go ahead and you can
either download it from barely OS or so
excuse me SourceForge I already have it
downloaded so I'm not going to click
this but go excuse me I guess I'm phlegm
in my throat I just drink a fruity stuff
freeze from Taco Bell and I ate a taco
and that is not a good idea because they
should call these things brain freezes
brain freezes because that's all that
does to you just freezes your brain in
your throw and
and it puts a bunch of phlegm in your
throat but I can't stop drinking it it's
a dick thing so anyways go ahead and
click this link from sourceforge.net and
go ahead and save the file and whenever
you save it and open it a wizard is
going to pop up and you just have to
click Next like 80 different times and
then you have code blocks installed so I
already installed it so I'm not going to
walk you guys through how to do that
because it's really simple and I'm not
going to act like you guys are dumb and
you don't know how to install things on
your computer so anyways once you have
it installed you have this program
called code blocks right here now you
probably have it on your all programs
you might have it under code blocks what
I like to do is right-click it and just
send it to desktop and what that's going
to do is going to give you a nice little
icon on your desktop
but anyways once you have it installed
just go ahead and double click it and
we're going to run a really simple
program just to make sure it's working
correctly so go ahead it gives you these
tips close them out what we're going to
want to do is create a new project and
you can either do that by creating this
new project right here but what I like
to do is I like to go up to the file
menu and click a new project now it's
going to give you a list of a bunch of
different projects you're going to want
to create what we're going to want to
choose is console application this is
what you're going to be choosing most of
the time this pretty much means a basic
program for the computer so just go
ahead and select this and press GO and
make sure you're working in C++ sees a
totally different language we don't want
that so C++ go ahead and click Next and
now name your project anything you want
I'm going to name mine YouTube why not
and you can save it wherever you want I
might as well just save mine right on
desktop it looks good but it really
doesn't matter where you save it or even
what your name your project just name is
something that's easy to remember
so go ahead and give your project site
we'll go ahead and click Next
and make sure you're using the GNU GCC
compiler basically everything should be
set up by default make sure your
settings look the same as mine as long
as you didn't hit anything by accident
you should be good to go so go ahead and
click finish and you see that nothing
pops up by default you're saying alright
I thought we just created something so
how do we see what we just created
actually if you click this little plus
sign next to sources it shows you that
all the files it created for you
automatically so go ahead and double
click this main and CPP and it shows you
or in other words it brings up the file
that it created automatically so this is
actually the core basics of a very
simple C++ program we don't understand
what anything means right now but trust
me it's a very simple computer program
that the only thing it does is it prints
out hello world on the screen so to make
sure that everything is set up and
running smoothly let's go ahead and we
need to do something called build and
run this now I'm going to be talking
about this later but for now I just want
to make sure that your computer is set
up you installed it and downloaded it
properly so go ahead and click this
build and run icon right here it's with
the little gear and the little green
triangle so go ahead and click that and
it should you know maybe flash a couple
boxes but basically a box should pop up
that says hello world and this is all
that that program is basically it prints
out hello world on your screen so if you
build and run this and you get hello
world it means that you downloaded it
installed it and set up your project
successfully so we are good to go
so again I know you guys don't know what
any of this means or even know how to
code one line of code yet I'm going to
be going over that in the future
tutorials but for now that's all I have
for you guys so thank you very much for
watching don't forget to subscribe and
I'll see you next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
