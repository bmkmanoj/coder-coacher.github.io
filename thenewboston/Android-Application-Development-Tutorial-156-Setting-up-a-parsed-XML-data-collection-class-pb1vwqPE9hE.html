Android tutorial for the new boss in
what we're gonna do before we actually
start working with the XML parser is get
our data collected class set up which we
called the XML data collected all we
want this class to do is have our
variables for a city and our temperature
so our temperature is gonna be int and
we're gonna call this temp and you know
something like that and we're just gonna
issue set this equal to be 0 just in
case if we can't parse the data from XML
we're gonna return it as 0 or an error
message of some sort haven't figured
that out yet what we're gonna do we're
also going to return a string which is
gonna be our city so we're just gonna
say string and we're gonna call this
city set this equal to null so now what
we want this class to do is be able to
set these variables according to
whatever are handling XML stuff class is
going to send to us so we're going to
set up some methods within this class to
kind of set up these variables to be
what they're supposed to be and we're
just going to use three methods one is
going to be public void set city and
what we're gonna pass in to this is
again a string because that's what we're
working with we're gonna call this
string C or whatever we're getting
passed in C and then what we're gonna do
is we're gonna set up our city variable
that we have defined for this class and
we're gonna just set that equal to BB
whatever is passed in now when we use
the handling XML stuff class we can pass
in some information using this method
called set city and pass in the actual
you know string reference and we're
going to set up our city pretty simple
concept but we haven't really I don't
know if we've created a class exactly
like this yet but also we're gonna say
public void set temp and again it's
going to be the same concept we're gonna
get passed in an int we're gonna call
this tea
and all we're gonna do is set our temp
equal to be whatever is being passed in
is T so now again we have a method that
we can pass in an integer and we're
gonna set up our variable to be whatever
that integer is being passed in we're
gonna just set one method up so we can
retrieve both of our city and/or
temperature so what we're gonna do is
we're just gonna say public whoa sorry
I'm not angry at you guys public lower
case and then we're gonna say a string
reference because again we're setting
our textview so it needs to be a string
we're just gonna say data to string
something like that and it's not going
to take anything within its parameters
because this can revert it's gonna refer
to the variables it already has set up
for this class so we're just gonna hit
enter and all we're gonna do is again we
need to return something so we're gonna
say return and we're gonna say like in
you know like that and then we're gonna
say or actually we might want to put a
space and then our quotation then we're
gonna say plus our city again the
variable that we're getting pass in plus
you know maybe a space and then the
current temperature and Fahrenheit is
and then space and then we can just do
you know another space or another plus
and we're gonna give it the temperature
that we're referring to it again in this
class and then just say plus degrees or
space degrees actually so I just thought
I'd show you guys this before we get any
further again we have three methods
within this class set city set
temperature and a method that will
return a string when we call this data
to string and it's whoops two strings
like that sorry and that's just going to
return all of our data or whatever we
want to set that textview to according
to whatever the city is and the
temperature so pretty simple just
thought I'd show you guys that
and I'll catch you guys in the next
tutorial because we really didn't cover
too much in this one but again it's kind
of nice to go through things slowly
sometimes so that's what we're doing and
I'll catch you guys later have a good
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
