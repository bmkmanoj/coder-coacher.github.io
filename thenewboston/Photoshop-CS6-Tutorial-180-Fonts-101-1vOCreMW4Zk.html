Photoshop cs6 tutorial
I'm your host buddy Blackford and today
I want to go over different aspects of
fonts and a little course I'm gonna call
files 101 and what I'm gonna teach you
about is the different types of fonts
and the different names and terminology
that are used in what's called
typography and typography is just
basically when you're using text to type
out things and that's basically that
covers all of the stuff that I'm gonna
try to go over with you
so when you're typing and everything
there is what's known as a fun and a fun
is a specific set of styles and
different parts of type that come
together and just make one specific
looking fine so if we have this right
here we have Arial regular now that is a
specific fun
Arial regular bold italic if I make it
that if I make it that Arial bold italic
that is a different font than Arial
regular but they are all part of
something called a typeface or yeah a
typeface a typeface is basically what we
call a client the name of a font so
we've got Arial and that is the typeface
Arial regular is a fun Arial italic is a
fun and Arial bold italic narrow if we
added all those together that's still a
different font from Arial italic or
whatever
so hopefully that made sense to you
there are a couple different types of
fonts and it's important to know them
because some are used utilized better in
web or Televi
or things and you can't use certain ones
in certain programs so what's go over
that now we've got what are called serif
typefaces and sans-serif typefaces and
then there's also script so what we've
got is a sans-serif typeface is this
right here like Arial here notice that
the the letters are crisp at the ends
they don't have any toralei's at the
ends of them or anything like that if we
come down here and look at a serif font
which is right here below and this font
is called sil sil thing you can see like
these little things on the edges that
come down and at the bottom these little
lines these are called serifs and this
is called a serif font so the little
lines at the bottom of everything those
are called serifs and they come down on
the ass and they come up on the answer
right there so those are the two main
categories of typefaces serif and
sans-serif so a lot of times when you're
reading something with a lot of text in
it you're going to be seeing that a
serif font like this one right here is
going to be used because studies have
found that the seraphs on the fonts are
make them easier to read when you're
watching like a television commercial or
something like that and some fonts pop
up you're probably going to see them as
sans serif fonts that's because they
look more modern and nicer there look
they feel like a little more clean and
then the other font that I wanted to go
over with you is a script font so let me
see if I can find one of those real
quick and the script fonts basically
look like cursive here's one Vivaldi
and the script fonts pretty much
basically just look like cursive letters
they're fancy so if I can find another
one that's a pretty let's see here's
another this one looks good this one's
called Calais script MT and once and
yeah they're pretty fancy and everything
like that and sometimes they're hard to
read so they're only really used on
things like wedding invitations or I
don't know other things that you want to
look like really fancy and people don't
use a lot of them because they get hard
to read now if all this doesn't sound
confusing it gets even more confusing
there's two basic types of fonts after
this one is called scalable and the
other is called bitmapped and most of
the time you're going to see scalable
fonts scalable fonts are also known as
outline font if you ever hear someone
say that but most of the time people say
scalable and what they are they're based
on a mathematical equation kind of like
vectors and it creates an outline to
form the letters and then it fills them
in with a color and this allows the font
to be altered so that it has any size or
any font size or anything like that
that you want so if we look at our fonts
and I just click on like a phone or
something like that
we get the right oh I gotta have my font
and I bring down our different fun
typefaces here you can see that there's
these little symbols next to them we've
got always we've got T's and then some
of these won't even have anything next
to them and I'll tell you what those are
so we've got these ones
tt and those are called true types or
there's the next one below it with the
O's those are called open types these
are both scalable funds and doesn't
really matter too much what you have if
you which ones you pick they're both
fine just you just know that they're
scalable funds and then you've got what
I call the bitmap fonts and they consist
of a set of dot patterns for each letter
and or a number for that matter so if I
pick something like this
let's change it up and I just lost it
let me see if I can find another one
we've got this quarry right here and you
can see how these are it like picks up
pretty pixelated and these ones are like
a bitmap fonts got six of these you can
see how those are and I saw some other
ones here we go but you can see how
these are and what they look like
they're blocky and everything like that
so pretty much used depending on what
you want to use both are fine you can
use both of them either way and if
you're going for like a retro look or
maybe like a digital kind of look go
ahead and use these kind of fonts that
look like this
so I'm gonna go ahead and stop here with
what I've been going over in the fonts I
don't want to go too crazy and confuse
everybody because there's a whole
there's actually a bunch of other font
terminology that you can learn about
which some of it is by all means it's
just basically useless to know and it
wouldn't be worth confusing everybody
but if you really want to check it out
go into Wikipedia and type up typeface
and look at that and you can read about
the different typefaces you can read
about the history and stuff like that
and knowing about like the history and
the different typefaces and what goes
with what and everything like that will
help you to being a better designer and
knowing what to use correctly so that
the readers or your viewers can feel
their eyes can feel like the best I
guess you can say to read and then doing
stuff like that making them feel good
making their eyes feel settled and
everything like that keeps then reading
longer so they'll stay on your like
website longer or they'll look at your
design longer and get more information
off of it so those are just like that's
just like some science and stuff like
that but I'm gonna end the tutorial now
so hopefully you guys learn something
about the fonts go ahead and rewatch the
video at the you got confused and just
keep in mind some of the points that I
was lettin you know so I'd like to thank
you guys for watching the tutorial be
sure to check out Bucky's room down org
for some more tutorials that I have and
we have the whole Photoshop series on
there and be sure to subscribe and like
the videos to get some more videos in
the future so thanks a lot for watching
everybody and you all have a good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
