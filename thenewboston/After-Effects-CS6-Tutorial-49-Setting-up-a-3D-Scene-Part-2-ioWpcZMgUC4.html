you can tell which ones selected because
it has these little triangles in the
corner now we can change this to like a
top view where we're looking from the
top down now if I click on the camera
here you can see where the camera is and
where it's what its field of view is so
this is how far the camera can see side
to side at this point right here gives
you a little cone of view there so if I
click on my text here I need to make the
layer a 3d layer or else isn't going to
be able to move in 3d space so the way
you do that is click on this checkbox
right here that's in line with the cube
and now it has created a 3d layer you
can see now on your top view right there
that line that is your text you know
that because you click here on the text
and it highlights it now if you look at
the cursors or the cursor now you can
see that there is a position here it's a
word you can move your text in the X Y
and if this blue one right here is a Z
so now we can move in z space so I'm
gonna zoom out here and I'll just show
you what that looks like real quick
that's the Z I mean this is X this is y
all right that's all that's all sweet
and everything like that we can't really
tell it's in 3d by just moving the
position so you want to do either you
can move rotation to make it look like
it's 3d so if I press R here we can now
move our move in the z-axis Y X and then
orientation is all has all of them in
there so let's move on the y axis to
like
to like make this spin in 3d so here's
what I wanted to do now you can see how
it's moving in 3d space now there's some
tricks here like if we make if we line
it up just right I think it's uh let's
see what this is at negative one hundred
maybe was that no you can still see it
there now you know if I don't if I don't
click on it you can you can't see what
it's doing so you can hide things in 3d
and then maybe I maybe later if I
keyframe it come out like two seconds
and bring it back to zero it looks like
it's coming out like that popping out of
nowhere into 3d space if you look on the
top view click the button by accident if
you look in the top view up there you
can see how it's moving and this in this
one we're getting a top-down view angle
maybe if I change to another another
view here like left I mean it's not too
helpful in that view but you can see how
there's different views so I like to go
to top if you go to like a custom view
here you can change how the camera looks
with your camera tools over here and I
mean you can see your camera and
everything like that so I'm going to
click off my camera tool and I'm just
gonna go back to the top view and
sometimes maybe you don't want to rotate
at all but you need to show that there
is 3d in your scene I'm gonna delete
these and I'm just gonna add let's make
sure this is rotating let's put this at
zero
now you can either do you can move your
camera to show that there's 3d in your
scene and it works the best when you
have another image or something else in
the scene to use as a visual cue so I'm
just gonna add the squish guy in there
and now if I if I move my camera he's
not gonna be in 3d because I didn't
change I didn't click this tick box so I
click if I click it now he's in 3d this
layer right here is this line right here
is is the squish guy now you can tell
what's what
by using these colors here on the that
are on the what is this panel called you
can figure out what is what by using
these colors here in the layer panel so
the squish has a blue color because of
this color right here and the text has a
red color so maybe if I want to change
this to purple it's gonna change the
purple up here and now that's a good way
to keep track of what things are so now
that the squish is in 3d I'm gonna move
it down below the camera keep things
organized I'm gonna move him back
and we'll move this 3d a suite maybe
like down here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
