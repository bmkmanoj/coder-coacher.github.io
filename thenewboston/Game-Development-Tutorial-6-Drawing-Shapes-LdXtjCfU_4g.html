and pygame and in this story I'm gonna
be teaching you guys how to draw shapes
now this is gonna be incredibly simple
tutorial so if you finally made it here
through suffering for last couple
tutorials you're in for a real treat so
the only thing all this is this is just
from the last tutorial I pretty much did
Lee did everything except the screen
object right here all this is just a
housekeeping stuff so let me show you
guys what I got already and what the
screen is is pretty much basic a black
screen that we got so now let's go ahead
and draw some shapes to it so let me go
give you guys a little tip of
information before you draw shapes
before you draw a shape on the screen
what you need to do is do something
called lock the screen so as you see our
display we store it in a variable called
screen and now what we need to do is
lock it so here's what you'd need to do
to lock it put screen or whatever you
name yours dot lock and what this does
is lock your screen and what locking
your screen means is nothing can happen
on the screen until your shape finishes
drunk and this is so when you start
drawing your shape then nothing else can
interfere with you until you're done and
when you're done you probably want to
unlock your screen so other stuff can
happen so let's go ahead and well we can
go ahead and unlock it now screen dot
unlock in the middle and now in the
middle of this between lock and unlock
we want to begin drawing our shape I
move that up so here's how you draw a
shape the draw module in PI game has a
bunch of built in different shapes that
you can draw the most basic one is a
rectangle so in your PI game module
there's a sub module called draw and in
that there's built-in function called
rectangle or R ect it's not rectangle I
guess is direct and in this built-in
function all you have to do is give it a
bunch of parameters
and it draws a rectangle on the screen
for you the first parameter it takes is
what you want to draw your rectangle on
and of course we want to draw it right
on our display since there's the only
thing we got so let's go ahead and write
screen so screen the next parameter it
takes is what color do you want your
rectangle to be and let's just pick
random color and again this is an RGB
value so let's give it a red value of
like 140 a green value of 240 and a blue
value of like I don't know 130 or
something don't use any decimal points
for this and if you this again with a
boo this is an RGB value so all the
values have to be between 0 and 255 if
you write these all 0 it's gonna be
black 255 4 oh it's gonna be ye anything
in between it's gonna be a cool color
umm if you want a specific color go look
it up on like a table in Google or
something now the last parameter it
takes is what object you want to drop
input rect for this and now inside your
rect put two parameters the first one is
the position of your rectangle so where
do we want the top left of our rectangle
to be let's just put it at a hundred a
hundred and this means it's gonna be a
hundred down and a hundred across so
that's what the position is gonna be the
next parameter it takes in rect is what
size do you want it to be well let's say
we want our rectangle to be how why do
we want it to be um let's see
130 wide by how tall uh let's see you
like 170 tall so let me go ahead and run
this and make sure I don't have any
errors and then I'll describe one last
time what we just did we drew a
rectangle on our screen that was green
evidently and this is a hundred across
and a hundred down in the size is
I don't know I forgot what it is already
um the size is 130 by 170 so again let
me try - there we go the first thing we
did is lock the screen and this means
all right lock the screen because we're
about to draw something and we don't
want anyone else messing with us while
we do this
and next we're gonna dry draw a
rectangle using this built-in rect
function we want to draw it to the
screen we want it to be this color and
we want to draw a rectangle object
that's going to be positioned at 100 100
and it's gonna be this big and then when
you're done with all that you can go
ahead and unlock it for us so we can do
the rest of our game so that is your
basics on how to draw a rectangle um
again not much to it really simple a lot
easier than our other tutorials so um in
our next tour around we're showing you
how to draw other cool shapes using
different techniques so uh don't forget
to watch it's gonna be awesome so again
thank you for watching make sure to
subscribe and I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
