how to use Dreamweaver to insert
JavaScript the first thing you're gonna
do is go to insert HTML script objects
and then click on script you're gonna
see the type is already selected as text
slash JavaScript there's some other
types that we're not going to go through
in this tutorial as you can see right
here we have the source option if you
have some external javascript that has
already been written then you click on
this folder right here and you give it a
pointer to the file for this tutorial we
are going to write our own simple
JavaScript to display some text inside
of the page so click inside the content
text input box and say document dot
write parenthesis quote I am inserting
text with JavaScript and then quote
close the quote close the parenthesis
and insert a semicolon and down here in
the nose script we are going to say your
browser does not support and JavaScript
this no script right here is used for
the browser to tell the user that they
do not support JavaScript today it's
very rare that you find a browser that
doesn't support JavaScript but they are
still there are still some out there so
we're gonna say ok and we can see that
Dreamweaver has added the script tags
for us and these nose scripts
tax for us so that is how you insert
JavaScript using Dreamweaver and I'm
gonna run this just to show you guys
what it looks like inside of a browser
and we see that it did exactly what we
thought it was going to do it wrote
JavaScript inside of our body so thanks
for watching and make sure you guys
