on live gamer here for the New Boston in
this tutorial we're going to be taking a
look at simple math operators so let's
go ahead and get started we're going to
come up here into our code and we're
going to start off by declaring a
variable now we're going to want to make
an integer so I'll do num1 as integer
then we'll go ahead and set that equal
to 5
or here let's not that set that equal to
anything yet so the number 1 equals 5
plus 5 so now if we come down here and
print out num1 on the console it's going
to give us the output of 10 what we can
also do is use the parameters of
writeline to add numbers to num1 so what
I mean by this is let's say we have num1
we want to print out num1 plus 5 so when
we run this we should get 15 now if we
come up here we can also subtract 5 so
num 1 equals 5 minus 5 that's going to
give us the value of 0 and now if we
print that out let's go ahead and take
this out if we print that out here we
get 0 we can also do division so 2
divided in Visual Basic and this is the
same throughout mostly all languages
you're going to use the forward slash so
if we divide 5 by 5 we're going to get
the value 1 and to multiply you just use
the asterisk so 5 times 5 is equal to 25
right there and now we can also do the
power so 5 to the power of 2 is going to
equal 25 and if we do 5 to the power of
3 we're going to get what is it 125 so
here we go 125 right there
now what we can also do is what's called
modulus now this is a little tricky for
some people to understand but I'll try
to explain it the best I can
what modulus does is it will divide two
integers for you and then give you the
remainder so if we knew 5 mod 2 so so
what happens when you divide 5 by 2
you're going to get 2 with a remainder
of 1 and since we're using integers we
can't get decimals so we're going to get
a remainder so now if we run this you
can see that it prints out 1 we can also
add variables to each other so if we
declare num1 as an integer and we set it
equal to 4 we can declare a second
variable let's call this 1 num2 and
we'll create an integer and we'll set it
equal to 8 and now if we print out num1
plus num2 it's going to give us the
value of 12 this also works for all of
the other operators that we've seen we
can multiply them together which will
give us the value of 32 and what we can
do is we can create a third variable
here let's just do that create a third
variable and we'll call it answer and
we'll make it an integer and we'll set
it equal to or first off we'll set it
equal to nothing now basically what
nothing is is if you've learned any
other languages it's equivalent to no so
answer instead of not assigning answer a
value we're just going to set it equal
to nothing and you can see that it won't
give us a warning here so if we take
this out we get a warning but since we
assign it to nothing which is equivalent
to no we don't get a warning here and
that will prevent errors from possibly
happening in the future
so then down here we'll just type answer
equals num1 divided by
- now in our case in this program we
didn't have to set this equal to nothing
but I just wanted to throw that in there
so you guys would know what it is and be
able to use it later on in your programs
so answer equals num1 divided by num2 so
if we write out answer we are going to
get zero so if you do 4 divided by 8 you
get a decimal number and since integers
can't can't they can't implicitly
convert themselves to decimals it's just
going to give you zero so let's go ahead
and change this to multiply and we're
going to get 32 now since before we got
zero by dividing them by each other
we're going to show you how to fix this
what we're going to do is instead of
making them integers we're going to make
them doubles over here we don't have to
make those doubles we can make the
answer a double so now since our answer
can have decimal numbers if we divide
num1 by num2 we will get 0.5 so take a
look at some of these math operators
play around with them with doubles
integers you can use a byte you can use
a long you can use anything just play
around with these math operators get
used to them and then once you've got
that down go ahead and move on to the
next tutorial and thanks for watching
