tutorial and this tutorial I'm gonna be
teaching you guys a very useful tool
when working with objects and that's the
index of and what this does is when you
have a long string it finds the first
occurrence of whatever it is you're
looking for so I'm gonna go ahead and
make this string a little longer I'm
gonna go hello Bob my name is Susie and
what you do is instead of changing the
value what we're gonna do is look for
the first occurrence of whatever we want
to look for in a string so let's say we
want to look for when the word Bob
starts so instead of putting your
whatever you're gonna change and right
here such as font color you want to type
in the word index of and in these
parameters you're gonna want to find
whatever it is you're looking for so
right now let's look for Bob so it's
gonna go ahead and type in Bob let's go
ahead and save this and I'll show you
guys what it does right now it gives you
the number 6 and you're thinking alright
what does this mean well what this does
is we say that Bob starts on the sixth
letter
of the string and remember we start in
the computer language we start counting
at zero so it goes 0 1 2 3 4 space
counts as a character 5 6 that's when it
starts now let's say we want to do
something else let's type in Susy now if
we saved it and went and looked C 21 why
I won't counting out this time for you
it'll take too long because if you count
all these Susy starts with the 21st
character and remember to count your
spaces his characters and start with 0
but let's say we had something that
wasn't even in string like my key so
what would happen if we save that and as
you can see my key isn't in the string
anywhere so if we say that and refreshed
it would give you a negative one and
what this does is this is JavaScript way
of telling you that this is false and
there is no value of my key in here so
this can be useful whenever you're
programming and you want to make sure
that you have a string of text so you
want to make sure that someone's name or
something is included and if it gives
you a negative one then you can tell it
not to run the program and then it's
just a pretty useful way of verifying
stuff what yeah we're gonna know later
let's study this and again this is
called the index of and it's a useful
way for searching
out things and finding where placements
begin in shrinks so thanks for watching
and go to my website Auto lanchette comm
enjoying it Thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
