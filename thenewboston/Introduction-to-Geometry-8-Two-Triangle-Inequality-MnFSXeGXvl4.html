triangle inequality and first I'm going
to give you the property of triangle
inequality and then I'm going to show
you what it means because it is kind of
confusing so given that two sides of one
triangle are congruent to two sides of a
second triangle and the included angle
of the first triangle is smaller than
the included angle of the second
triangle and the third side of the first
triangle is smaller than the third side
of the second triangle so now that you
have that definition I'm going to show
you what it means with this picture
right here so we know that this side is
congruent to this side and this side is
congruent to this side so first thing I
have to have is two sides congruent
which I do right here's one pair here's
another pair second thing I need to know
is that this included angle is smaller
than this included angle so the included
angle is just this angle right here
which is caught in between the two
congruent sides so right now we're going
to be talking about angle K and for this
one we're going to be talking about
angle J so since we know we need to know
that one of these is smaller then
the other so I know that the measure of
angle K is less than the measure of
angle J because 80 degrees is less than
110 degrees so since I have that I can
therefore say that a is less than B
because this angle is less than this
angle so this side is less than this
side that's all that that property tells
us so now that we know what it is we're
going to do an example that we're gonna
do an example to make sure you
completely understand what we're doing
so for these two triangles I know that
this side is congruent to this side and
this side is congruent to this side and
I know that this angle is equal to 110
degrees so I need to find out what the
measure of this angle right here is so
we're going to go back and use those
that property of the interior angles of
triangles to find out what the measure
of angle X is so we're going to add them
up and set it equal to 180 degrees and
we're going to subtract this over and we
know that x equals 90 degrees so that
means that X is a right angle so we're
going to mark that with one of these
symbols right here and we know that just
means 90 degrees well since the measure
of angle X is equal to 90 degrees and 90
is less than 110 that means that this
angle is less than this angle so using
our two triangle inequalities we can say
that a
this side opposite this angle is less
than B which is this side opposite this
included angle we're going to do one
more example we have these two side by
side triangles we know this side is
congruent to this side and since they
share this side right here we can say
that that it is congruent with itself
and I once again I need to find out what
this angle equals so we're gonna set
each one of the interior angles we're
going to add them together and set it
equal to 180 so x equals 110 degrees
this angle is 110 degrees so since this
included angle is 110 degrees the other
included angle is 60 degrees since 110
is greater than 60 degrees we can say
that this side a which is opposite the
110 degrees is greater than this side B
which is opposite the 60 degrees so now
that you understand two triangle
inequality be sure to come back and
watch our next video which is going to
deal with square roots and how we can
use those to solve triangle problems</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
