awesome video and in this video we're
actually going to start pretty much
gathering user information so let's
recap before you jump in any of that
basically what we did is created this
very simple website and it allows a user
to login with their Instagram account
and says do you want to allow buckey's
room or whatever your website is to use
your information the user authorizes it
and then it redirects us to the same
website but it gives us this little bit
of code right here so why do we need
this code well the cool thing is is once
we have this code this allows us to
access that users information now
another cool thing is the user is done
they do nothing else they don't click
any more buttons that that is all they
had to do to have all of their photos
downloaded from Instagram and saved to
Bucky's room or whatever website so how
freaking awesome is that so let's go
ahead and actually let me show you guys
how to use that code to access that
information now the first thing I want
to do is this you see whenever we when
we were redirected to this website the
login link still appears well that's
kind of confusing for the user because
it's like alright I just logged in and
you were supposed to get all my photos
so should I log in again what's going on
so the first first thing I wanted to do
is fix that so what we can actually do
is we can say something like this yes
and we can test the reason that we know
that they're logged in is if this
appears this code right here so what we
want to do is we want to test for that
code and if it's there that must mean
that they're logged in so in an if
statement just put if get and the
parameter that we're looking for is code
so this must mean logged in and else
must mean logged out so whenever we have
else what we want to do is we actually
want to display the website or the link
however since this isn't PHP we need to
solve that problem by doing this pretty
much stopping the PHP code before it
gets to the website and starting it up
again whenever it gets to the website
now actually if we save this I'll show
you guys what I just did if you guys
can't visualize it so basically whenever
the user goes to the script they see
that login link right there
so they click it login and now it
redirects them to the same website but
that login link doesn't appear anymore
because what our script did is it tested
it and said all right you have the code
that must mean you're logged in I'll
take it from here so now that we got
that set up in the user experience is
taken care of let's go ahead and
actually do something useful with this
code other than test if your login or
not so I'm gonna make a variable called
code just because it's easier to work
with and with this code variable what
we're gonna be doing is actually before
I get started with that you know how we
went to UM this URL to pretty much
authenticate the user information well
now we may need to make another URL that
says okay now we want to be getting some
of their data so the URL for this is
actually a lot of this oh you off or is
it to authorize so copy that and copy it
to this um oh off which means something
authorized and after this rate access
underscore token now this is the URL
that we're going to be pulling from so
before we can actually pull
we need to set up a CE URL array so
let's go ahead and set up our array and
we'll just call it access token settings
all right looks good enough now the
array actually might as well just coat
it like this there was actually a couple
of different ways that you can set this
up I'll just do it on a really easy way
and that's this I'll show you guys the
basics so we're pretty much gonna say
what's setting um do we want to set on
the left and what do we want to have it
equal on the right with a comma so we
can go to the next element so the first
setting is the client ID now if you
don't know um what all this means this
is actually if you look in the
documentation you don't need to because
I'm gonna explain everything but these
can be found in the Instagram developer
API so the first thing I asked for is
what's your client ID
well ours of course is client ID
now the next setting it asked for is the
client secret and ours of course is
client secret</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
