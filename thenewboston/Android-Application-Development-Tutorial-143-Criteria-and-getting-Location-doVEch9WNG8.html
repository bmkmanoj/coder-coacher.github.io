Android tutorial for the new boss in
what we're gonna do in this tutorial
we're basically going to set up this
location manner manager to get the last
known location of basically our towers
right in reference to you know
triangulating in those towers so first
thing we need to do is set up a criteria
and we're gonna just solve a call the C
or crit maybe and we're just going to
set this equal to new criteria just kind
of the standard default criteria and
then we're just criteria and then we're
gonna just import that and now what
we're gonna do is we're gonna set up
this string called towers based off kind
of our location manager and the criteria
what kind of criteria we're looking for
so we're going to do is say towers we're
going to set this equal to our location
manager called LM and then we're gonna
say dot get best provider and as you can
see it takes criteria and also a boolean
value so we're gonna set the criteria to
crit and enabled only to false and as
you guys can see if we hover over
basically what this method is doing is
returning the name or the provider that
best fits the given criteria so we're
basically getting best you know the best
reception or whatever you guys want to
think of that as and also we can kind of
use different things like power
requirement speed accuracy altitude some
of the things that we can check for but
again we're just basically getting the
best provider given our criteria and
since our criteria is just kind of a
default criteria you know it's gonna
kind of give us the default best
provider for this application since
we're just kind of getting a location we
don't really need to specify our
criteria that much and now what we're
going to do is we're going to set up a
location we're gonna call this location
L or location maybe like this and then
we're going to set this equal to again
our location manager and then we're
going to use a method called get last
known location and it takes a string so
that's why we set up the string called
towers because that's what we're gonna
refer to and again all we're doing is
the towers is getting the best criteria
and then we're going to try and access a
location through the location manager
getting the last-known location called
towers and then what we're going to do
is as long as our location is not equal
to be null as long as we you know got
some sort of location that's where we're
going to set up basically what we have
here so we're going to say if location
is not null then you know we're gonna
set up our in tell you again we can cut
this actually we're just gonna say lat
is equal to and then we're gonna cast it
in as an INT because this isn't gonna
return an end value and what we're gonna
do is we're going to say location dot
get latitude and we're also going to say
Longy is equal to again casting in an
INT and again our location dot get
longitude so that's just going to return
our latitude and longitude values it's
giving us an error because we define
those variables down here I working to
actually do is cut these and paste them
above her class I know it kind of jump
around when I do these tutorials so
sorry if yes I get kind of lost
sometimes but again make sure you define
these variables lat and long above or
class so we can refer to them later such
as right here now that's going to get
our Latin long and then what we're going
to do is we're gonna do our geo point
and basically add our overlay to our
list within again this if statement so
we're just going to print and we're good
to go
else we can just make it text or
something we're just going to say
toast dot toe stop make text contacts
main dot this or base contacts get base
contacts whatever you guys want to type
we're going to say kind of couldn't get
provider and duration toast dot length
short and then we're just gonna say dot
show so we don't even setup toast
variable we're just gonna again show it
and create it so there we go we kind of
have that working but the problem that
we may be having is again this is all
created within the oncreate method so
you know it might not work but that
we're gonna finish up this you know this
whole google map stuff in the next
tutorial we're gonna use some of those
methods that we implemented and get
everything working right so i'll catch
you guys then and have a good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
