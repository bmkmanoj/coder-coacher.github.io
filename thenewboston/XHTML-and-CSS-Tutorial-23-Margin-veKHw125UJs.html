tutorial on the CSS box model and the
last element that we have to cover is
the margin now the margin is the area
outside the border and outside the
padding it's the area basically that
surrounds the entire element so let's go
ahead and let's go ahead and actually
make some paragraphs I'll probably the
easiest to see
so paragraphs actually have margin by
default one of the few elements so this
is a paragraph make sure you spell that
Wow I was pretty close actually so
anyways let's go ahead and paste that
and actually we probably should add a
background color so P background color
and just make it orange or something
nothing too light nothing too dark just
right and I'm talking about Warren J and
check it out this is a perco afta and
this is a craft ax so as you can see by
default it has probably I don't know how
how tall is my mouse cursor probably
like 10 or 15 pixels or something so by
default paragraphs have a margin between
them but whatever saying all right I
wrote this sweet article and I hate I
made it into a couple paragraphs but I
either think it's too much or I want to
tighten the paragraphs up so they're
closer together well in order to do this
you need to play with the property
called margin now the margin like I said
is a space around each of these
paragraphs so let's go ahead and do that
right now
just like the the padding that's what I
was trying to think of you can either
play with margin in one of two ways you
can either change your overall or you
can change it individually so let's go
ahead and the first thing I want to do
is show you guys how to tighten up your
paragraph so if you want to tighten it
up to like one pixel just like that if
you set margin a one pixel on your
paragraphs it goes from the default
which is I'm going to say it's like 10
pixels by default and it refreshes it
you now have a one pixel of space in
between
your paragraphs so that is a way to
tighten up you can even even set it to
zero if you want but then it wouldn't
even be a paragraph at all it would just
be like a line break so anyways um that
is how you would do that now if you want
to space it out even more I think it's
like ten or fifteen by default so let's
really stretch it out to like forty
pixels and you can either do that and
now when you press refresh each of your
paragraphs has 40 pixels surrounding it
so I mean if you're going for that
effect then that is what you do and what
I want you to take notice of is that the
padding does not change the padding and
the border are staying the same
it's the margin around it that is
changing so that's the difference
between the padding and the margin a lot
of people get this confused
just remember padding is inside the
boarder margin is outside the border and
you'll be fine you'll be way ahead of
everyone else they'll be lost in the
dark because they read books instead of
watching my tutorials those idiots so
like I said way before you can change
margin in one of two ways you can either
change your overall or I'm not even
going to go through this you can change
it one sided time like margin top spell
that run top margin bottom margin right
and margin left so I don't want to go
through each one and show you because
it's obvious just like padding what it
does but anyways that is the difference
between margins and padding and borders
and overall that's called the CSS box
model how you can play with different
areas of an element basically so anyways
now you understand the CSS box model
we're ready to move on to another topic
so anyways thank you guys for watching
