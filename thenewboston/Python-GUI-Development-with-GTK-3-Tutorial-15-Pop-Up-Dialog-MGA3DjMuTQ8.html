video I am gonna show you how to create
a simple pop-up window now there are a
bunch of different kinds of pop-up
windows that you can have you can have
kind of like a question where a pop-up
window appears and the user has to
select yes or no or you just have a
pop-up saying some alert and the user
just closes it and doesn't do anything
and later on I'm actually going to show
you how to have a file dialog pop-up so
whenever you hit file open then a dialog
like this pops up and the user can
select either a file or directory but
that's in probably the next tutorial for
right now I'm just going to show you
guys how to create a simple plain pop-up
and we'll put some buttons on it too so
with that being said the first thing
that we need is a button now this button
is gonna go on our main window
so whenever our program first starts our
main window is gonna pop up and then the
user will click a button and then the
pop-up will appear so our entire program
is really gonna consist of two windows
but one of them is gonna be a pop-up and
our a GTK button now on this button I'll
just write open alright so at the
functionality to actually open it and
create it all later on but right now we
need to add button connect and the event
we're gonna or the signal is clicked so
whenever they click it what do you want
to happen well we'll just make a
function in a second called button
clicked and this is gonna be a function
responsible for essentially opening the
pop-up so before we do that we actually
need to add this bun to the screen so
self add button and now we have a button
that appears on our main window looking
good
so now from here we're gonna do is
create this button clicked in check it
out so def button clicked and we pass
itself and which it like always now from
here what I can do is I'm gonna make a
variable called dialogue
and this is gonna be equal to a class
that we're gonna make call a pop up so
check this out
you see up until this point we just been
working with this main class this main
window now this entire class essentially
represents that main window since we
only made a simple program up to this
point one window that's it but now what
we're doing is we're making another
window and that's gonna be the pop-up so
what we're gonna do is we're gonna make
a whole another class I say a whole
nother one what's gonna take like two
seconds and we're gonna name that the
pop-up class so this is still going to
be your main window in this pop-up class
we're gonna create is for the new pop-up
window so now that I have a reference to
that what I can do is this response
equal to dialog dot run all right
so whenever you make that other class
what we're going to do is we're going to
call the run method on it which is
essentially a way to call your
initialization method which pretty much
just starts the window now what's gonna
happen is the popups gonna appear and
it's gonna wait it's gonna wait for the
users to do something and once they do
something and close the window the
pop-up window it's going to store the
response in response
now if the pop-up window is like
something like a question like are you
sure you want to delete that yes or no
then that's what it's gonna return yes
or no maybe they have to choose a value
so the response is going to be some
number but essentially they open a
window do something you get a response
and then after this you can do whatever
you want with the response like submit
their information to a website or
whatever so we're just gonna do this
if response is equal to equal to gtk
response type okay
and you can have customer sponsors but
there are also some responses that are
built-in so like built-in to gck is like
an OK button and a cancel button and
this is just I don't know really simple
to explain and
these tutorials whenever alluring so if
the user click the ok button what do you
want to do well let's just print out you
click me okay button
so in this little demo the pop will just
have an OK button in a cancel button and
will add a little prompt like I don't
know like are you sure you want to look
at pop-ups or something
alright so Elif response is equal to
equal to g TK response type cancel so
this is pretty much saying did they
click OK or click cancel and if they
click cancel not cancel a that is
actually how you spell in French
actually I'm pretty sure that's not true
actually I'm almost positive because I
just made that up off the top of my head
can't
okay clearly not the French word for all
right now after this what I'm gonna do
is just destroy the dialogue and this
pretty much just closes the pop-up
window so now we have the main window
taken care of whenever the fruit user
first starts our program so now all we
have to do is make a separate class and
we'll just stick this in the same file
and I'll just call it class what I call
it pop up there we go now just like
before it needs to inherit but instead
of inheriting from window we're actually
going to inherit from gtk dialogue so
gtk already has a bunch of functionality
built in for pop-up windows or dialogues
so make sure we grab all that and
inherit it into our fancy new class
alright so i'm gonna frickin alright so
after here what we need to do is create
that init method and if i just copy this
make it a little bit easier now we're
also gonna call self parents so parent
is a reference to that main window so a
pop up window it isn't just like a
regular program it's acts
kind of inside another program so the
parent again like I said is a reference
to that's now in here in order to it's
kind of a common way you make a dialogue
called gtk dialogue dunder init dunder
so double underscore in it double
underscore and then the parameters
furthest ourself title and I'll just
name this like a pop-up title so this is
gonna be the title that appears on the
pop-up window not your main window and
now it needs a reference to the parent
so just always type parent there and now
we can do is you can pass in some value
now this I'll show you this one right
here so this is essentially a constant
and not model modal it's a ALM not
yelled so I don't know that throw you up
what this is is essentially a way that
you can say this is a modal pop-up or
modal window so what that means is
whenever this pop-up appears the user
isn't going to be able to do anything
with the main program until they do
something with the pop-up so I'll show
you so whenever I open this dialog right
here in this program you see I don't
know if you guys can hear me but I'm
trying to click on the main window I
mean I'm trying to close this tab I
can't do anything so that's the
functionality we're going for and this
is the behavior that this gives us
basically hey we're blocking the main
window until you take care of this
pop-up and that's it so from here what
we can do you think of the easiest way
all right
so add I'll show you guys two more
parentheses and we're just gonna add our
buttons right now
so we have to add two buttons but it
takes two parts to add each button the
first one is what text you want to
appear on each fund and also whenever
the user clicks that what response is it
going to give so you can just do
something like this oh right
we'll make our cancel button first
some canceled text so that's gonna
appear on the cancel button and now
separated with a comma the next thing is
what response do you want to give so if
we just copy this whenever the user
clicks the cancel button it's gonna give
the cancel response
easy-cheesy so you can also have
built-in so I don't know if you don't
want to add your custom text there's
also a bunch of weird go in so stock
okay probably could just find it easier
but hey now you guys can see all right
wow that took way too long just alright
so this is pretty much an incredibly
lazy way of just writing okay on your
button but I mean I might as well show
you that too alrighty so whenever the
user clicks that what happens is it
sends the okay response now another cool
thing I want to point out is just like a
regular window you can also add
attributes like this so so set default
size and I'll keep that to 200 102 and
for the border with what I put this one
I'll put this one at 10 and for the
pop-up I'll have it at 30 why not and
there you go so this is actually gonna
work if we just um
run one other thing but right now we
have a pop-up and it just has two
buttons in it pretty boring and aside
from that what the heck is the user
supposed to think when just the buttons
ok and cancel pop-up I mean what am i
agreeing to what am I trying to cancel
out if I have no indicator so to get the
area that appears above the buttons that
you can actually give them a prompt or
some text about what the heck this
pop-up is all about you actually need to
do this make a variable called area or
whatever you set a equal to self get
content area so again this is pretty
much this space above the buns and let's
just go ahead and add a simple label to
it so area
and you can make another variable as
your label box can do it all in one big
shebang
so gtk label and I'll just right Wow
this pop-up is so amazing so usually you
would want to do something kind of
useful here about whatevs alright so
last thing we need to do is rage self
show all and that's just going to
display everything and boom roasted
there you go and by the way just to
mention this real quick
I usually just add the label right as a
parameter whenever I have a label that
I'm only using once just because it
makes your code a little bit more
condensed whenever I have a label that
I'm going to use multiple times
throughout the program then you usually
want to set it equal to another variable
because it's a lot easier to reuse that
way so anyways let's go ahead and run
this and see what I missed though
alright so here's our main window and we
added one button to the main window and
it says open a pop-up like that it says
wow this pop-up is so amazing very cool
and let's just click OK and click cancel
and you see whenever we do then it
prints out this so one last time now
that we got kind of a overview of
everything what we did in our main
window is we created a reference to
another class which was the pop-up class
and then we kicked it off or initiated
it so our program is sitting there
whenever that pop-up pops up and it's
waiting and as soon as the user clicks
something then it completes and it
returns a response and then you can
handle the response however the heck you
want so there you go hopefully you guys
enjoyed if not then well I guess I guess
I just wasted your time but uh anyways
thank you for watching I will see you
