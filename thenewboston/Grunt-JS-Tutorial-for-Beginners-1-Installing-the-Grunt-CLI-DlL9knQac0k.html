roberts and welcome to your very first
grunt tutorial now in this video i'm
going to be showing you guys how to
download and install set up and use
grunt but before we get to that you guys
may be wondering what the heck is grunt
I never heard of it before well to put
it simply grunt is a tool that you can
use to automate a bunch of things that
you would usually have to do whenever
you're making a website so for example
if you ever work with less files and you
use a tool to compile manually
well grunt can automate that for you if
you ever make website in each side I
want to menifee all my CSS or JavaScript
files
well grunt can automate that for you so
it's kind of hard to explain because
it's not just one thing and actually if
I open this plugins you can see that
this is the plugins page and these are
all the things that grunt can do so it
makes that a lot easier than going
online finding a tool for each specific
task and you know doing everything else
like separately one by one so grunt is
definitely a must-have if you're a web
developer and well that's it that's a
little introduction so now let's just
jump into setting it up now in order to
install grunt and download it we
actually first need to have node J s
installed on our computer so in this
tutorial I'm not going to talk you
through installing and setting up node
because first of all it's really easy
essentially all you do is you press this
big green install button right on nodejs
org home page and you just click Next a
bunch of times
again like I don't know if you ever
downloaded and installed anything in
your life it's going to be pretty simple
but the reason that we need to have no
js' is because whenever we download node
it gives us this thing called a node
package manager it's essentially a tool
that comes with node and allows us to
download things from the internet what
are we looking to download
well grunt now if you actually want to
be walked through installing node then
if you hop over to my nodejs tutorials
in the very first video
you how to install node on Windows and
in the second one I'll show you how to
install it on a Mac so if you already
have on your computer you're good to go
if not hop over to that video watch it
then come back here so once you have
node then the next thing we need to do
is we need to open up the command line
in Windows so if you go to your start
and open CMD I'm guessing that you guys
already know how to open this but
anyways we're going to be using this to
install the grunt CLI now again the
command for this is npm install - g
grunt - CLI so whenever we downloaded
nodejs that node package manager that
tool that allows us to download things
that i was talking to you guys about
like a minute ago that's what this MPA
is n PM stands for right here so we're
saying hey node install grunt CLI now
this is the grunt command-line interface
it's just a program that allows us to
use grunts from the command line simple
enough
now this little dash G this means
globally so whenever we have this is
going to install the grunt CLI on our
entire computer so we can type grunt
commands anywhere you know we don't just
have to be in our specific project or
anything so hit enter and it's going to
go find out on the internet download it
and boom it's now installed on our
computer so how easy was that that's why
we made the download node node first
because this NPM tool it makes
everything super simple now after this
we're ready to start setting up grunt
for our project so let's say we're
making a website or something now what
you can do if you don't have any cool
ide is you can actually just navigate to
your project so i have a folder right
here show you guys and all of my project
files are in here that i'm going to be
playing around with in this video so
this is on my desktop in demo so if you
want to do this you can navigate the CD
which means change directory desktop
demo and once you're in here what I'm
going to be teaching you guys is a bunch
of cool commands
run commands that you can use however
move this out of the way in the IDE that
I use I actually have a command line
built right in so I like using this one
because then we can clearly see all in
one screen and it's really easy to teach
but if you guys don't have an IDE
again this is IntelliJ from JetBrains
then you can just use the command line
by navigating to your projects folder so
once you download it install node and
then once you use the node package
manager to setup grunt CLI and moved
into your directory whether you know
whatever project you want to use ground
then you're ready to move on so yeah now
we're ready see you guys next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
