buddy Blackford here and today we're
going to go over how to use the
selective color adjustment and what that
is is when you're in CMYK color mode it
gives you the ability to add or subtract
specific amounts of cyan magenta yellow
and black inks and you can go through
your different colors you have and take
out or add those kind of inks now it's
good for when you're collaborating with
like your printer that you're going to
be using and you can adjust the amount
of like the different inks in the
Photoshop image so that your printer
works correctly or so it shows up well
on your printer and it's basically a
tool that interacts with your printer
pretty much so first thing we want to do
is pull up your image and then go to
mode and you want to make sure you're in
CMYK color if you're going to be
printing stuff you should already be in
CMYK color the next thing we're going to
do is go to image and then we're going
to go to adjustments and we're going to
come down here we're going to go to
selective color select that and you see
we have the ability to pick our
different colors here with our RGB and
CMYK colors along with whites and
neutrals now we're able to add these in
with our add a certain amount of percent
to these if we would like and if I hold
down all I can click on reset here now I
can add in more magenta to the sky if I
want to make it one of those cool lookin
skies a certain type of the day
you can add like more yellow to to the
Reds and stuff like that so that's what
it does we can come down to our blacks
we can make them we can make our blacks
darker and more blacks or we can dole
them out so pretty much up to you what
you want to do here we've got our method
down here we've got absolute which
changes of the colors using a value of 1
to 100 percent and then we have relative
here which
is on the percentage of the colors total
ink so if I select relative you're not
going to see as much of an adjustment
when I'm moving stuff around you can see
that you can see that these skies are
turning different colors but not as much
as if I use the absolute so if I change
to absolute you can see that there's
more and that depends on your image go
to reset same thing with the blacks here
this is a relative 100% this is a
absolute 100% so you can see that that
type of change so keep that in mind it's
up to you what you want to use we've got
our presets and there are no presets
that come in the box with selective
color so if you wanted to go through and
take out like 25% magenta out of every
single one of these and then save it as
a preset you could so you go to this
little button here and once you get done
setting everything hit save preset and
then it'll save it within here so if I
just move back say preset jente make
sure it's in your selective color folder
and now you can see there is my preset
down here which will move my magenta
back 15 percent so that's all I wanted
to go over with the selective color
adjustment and not a whole lot to go
over with it remember you use it for um
Eddy and subtracting certain amounts of
CMYK and in relative to like what your
printer at home or at the studio or
wherever you're going to use your
printer uses so if you don't know what's
if you don't know what to use you can
always call up the printing company or
send them an email and they can give you
some specifications on things to help so
you can get this get this information
from them so that's it thank you for
watching the video if be sure to check

tutorials on photoshop and a whole bunch
of other stuff you got programming
