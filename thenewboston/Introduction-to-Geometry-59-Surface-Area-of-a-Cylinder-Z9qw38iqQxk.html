area of a cylinder so first of all a
cylinder is a three-dimensional shape
with the bases parallel and congruent to
this circle right here is parallel and
congruent to this circle right here
which means that this height right here
has to be perpendicular to both of these
circles so to find the surface area of a
cylinder we take circumference times
height plus 2 times the base area of
these circles so we're going to write
this a little different way by filling
in some things first circumference is
equal to 2 PI R so 2 pi r times age
would be 2 pi r h plus 2 times the area
of one circle well the area of one
circle is PI R squared so for our final
formula for surface area is 2 pi rh + 2
pi r squared so now we're going to find
the surface area of this cylinder so the
surface area is equal to 2 pi r our
radius for this is
is five right here so 2 pi five times
the height is 12 plus 2 PI R squared so
for the surface area we get 2 times 5
which is 10 times 12 is 120 PI plus 5
squared is 25 2 times 25 is 50-50 pie so
when we add those together we get 170
pie for our service area so when we take
a surface area of a cylinder it's like
we take like pretend we have a soup can
and there's a top lid and a bottom lid
and we find the area of that if we
unwrap that label on a soup can if you
unwrap it and hold it open it's a
rectangle so right here this part of our
formula is finding the area of that
rectangle which would be if we if i were
to unwrap this cylinder i'd get this
rectangle and this top of the rectangle
would be their circumference which is 2
PI R times the height which is 12 so
that's where this part of the formula
comes from and then to find the top of
the top and bottom of the soup cans we
do two PI R squared so find the surface
area so we if you remember it's two pi r
h plus 2 PI R squared so now let's plug
things in 2 pi the radius is 4
times the height which is 10 plus 2 pi
radius squared so the surface area is
equal to x 4 is 8 times 10 is 8080 pi
plus 4 squared is 16 times 2 is 32 so 32
pie so our surface area is equal to 112
pi so we're going to do one more example
find the surface area of the cylinder so
surface area is equal to 2 pi r h plus 2
pi r squared now you don't have to write
the formula every time you do a problem
but when you're learning the formula it
helps to write it down because then
you'll remember it and then you won't
have to write it down anymore you'll
just know it so 2 pi r right here which
is three times the height now remember
when we when we say height we want the
thus the edge that is pair that is
perpendicular to both of these bases so
that's that height right hair if we were
to take this height it would be
perpendicular to the rectangle that goes
around the cylinder but we need this
height which is perpendicular to both
bases so our height for this is 12 plus
2 pi r which is 3 squared surface area
is equal to 2 times 3 which is six times
2 which is 72 so 72 pi plus 3 squared is
9
times nine is eighteen 18 pi so surface
area is equal to 90 pi feet squared
because remember when we find surface
area we're finding a two-dimensional
area so if I was if I had in my suit can
or if I had a cylinder container and I
was wrapping it up for a present I want
to find how much wrapping paper goes
around it and that would be a one-day
two dimensional measure so that's all
for surface area but next video we're
going to talk about volume of a cylinder
because it's a little bit different than
volume of a prism</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
