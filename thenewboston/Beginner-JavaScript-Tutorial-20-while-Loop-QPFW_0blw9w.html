welcome to 20th I believe JavaScript
tutorial and in this tutorial I'm going
to be talking about a while loop but
before I begin I just want to say guys
if my voice squeaks or if I stop talking
like if I'm in the middle of sentence I
just suddenly stop talking that's
because like my voice is like given out
like I can be in the middle of sense and
my lips will still be moving but
nothing's coming out so I got this lucky
mucus phlegm in my throat and it's no
predicting what it does so it's not my
microphone it's not your speakers it's
just my annoying raspy voice oh you guys
just got to deal with it I guess I
apologize but anyways let's go ahead and
learn about this stupid thing called a
while loop go ahead and well let me say
this first of all a while loop is
basically the same as a for loop all
loops are pretty much the same they do a
certain bit of code over and over and
over again until you tell it to stop so
why use a while loop and while you use a
for loop well they're just set up a
little bit different the syntax is a
little bit different I think a while
loop is a little bit easier to
understand some people like for loops
and they're going to come across
different situations where you can only
use one or the other but anyways that's
my little introduction you know the
history of the while loop so let's go
ahead and the first thing that we need
is a counter variable to keep track of
how many times this loop actually loops
so x equals 1 will start at 1 just like
you know we did with a for loop so now
the syntax for a while loop is pretty
simple it's a while and then you have in
here how long do you want to loop the
last blue so let's go ahead and put X is
less than 10 so this is pretty much
going to loop this bit of code so long
as X stays less than 10 so now we can
either increment it by like 1 2 or 3 or
4 5 6 7 8 9 or 10 so now let's just give
a go ahead and give it some simple code
right out so document dot
right and actually what we can do is we
can print out the value of the variable
I guess the counter variable right there
so we can actually see it that might be
a little easier to understand and now
let's go ahead and add some text like
how do you like them apples first person
who can tell me what movie is that from
gets gets my respect there you know I'm
not really giving you anything worth of
value just my worthless respect so
anyways so the basics is this we start
at one and we're going to loop as long
as it's less than ten but you're saying
all right Bucky
well our variable is just going to be
stuck at one the whole time so this is
going to keep repeating forever well if
we ran it like this then yes it would
keep repeating forever that's why we
need to increment X slowly so let's go
ahead and add one X each time by using
that shortcut we learned X plus plus and
now let's go ahead and save it run it
and see what happens actually let me add
a space right there and there we go
so it says how do you like them apples
nine different times so check it out we
started at one so that's why our loop
started at one if we started at six it
was 36 but we didn't we started at one
so the first time X was equal to one it
ran the bit of code the next time X was
equal to ran the bit of code and it did
this all the way down until it got to
nine x equals nine I'm going to run this
bit of code now the next time after this
X actually changed to ten so then this
while loop took a look at it and says
all right it's ten less than ten no 10
is not less than 10 10 is equal than 10
is equal to 10 so therefore I'm not
going to run this bit of code because
you only told me to run it when it's
less than 10 so that is why you don't
see 10 how do you like them apples 11 12
13 or anything like that
that's why I stopped at 9 so anyways
that's the basics of the while loop
again it's pretty much the same as the
for loop in these examples the only
difference is instead of having this and
this and this all in the parentheses
right here there
kind of spaced out and I kind of like it
this way it makes it easier to see keep
track of your variables and keep track
where you're incrementing so anyways
that's all I have for you guys for this
tutorial um yeah sorry wish I had some
more valuable information but I'm
probably going to go take a mucinex and
cough up guys let me say this for those
of you guys who want to be grossed out
listen to the rest of the story but for
those of you guys who are just here for
JavaScript education and for the
information I'm not going to say any
information so you can move on to next
tutorial but so that's your warning but
for you guys who stuck around let me
tell you this all right this morning
this morning I was like coughing and
coughing and I like nothing was coming
out you know how like the phlegm is just
stuck in your throat and it's annoying
that you can't get it out no matter how
hard he cough so I took him using XDM
because that kind of loosens stuff up
and then about thirty minutes later I
like sucked in like and I coughed like
as hard as I can in this huge glob I was
like the size to grapes of it look it
looked like oatmeal and I don't know
where in my body it came from but it was
the most disgusting looking thing
coughed up in my sink so I mean I
shouldn't have even told you guys but
hey I warned it so anyways anyways thank
you guys for watching and listening my
story of Anna yeah I guess I'll see you
guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
