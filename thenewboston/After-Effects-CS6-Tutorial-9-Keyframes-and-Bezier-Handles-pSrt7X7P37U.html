Blackford and we're going to keep
continuing the animation process here
this is the second part of the basic
animation tutorials and this time we're
going to go over the Bezier handles and
editing your motion path so what I'm
talking about is at each keyframe and
these are the keyframes down here or on
your motion path these these square
boxes here
those are your keyframes also they're at
the same point as you can see when I
click on one on the end one it
highlights the end one I click on the
middle one that highlights the middle
keyframe right here so we're going to be
learning how to edit those and add more
points so right now the arrow tool up
here which is V which is also called the
selection tool and the pen tool here
which is G are very useful and you use
those the most when you're editing your
motion paths to quickly switch if you're
on the arrow tool to quickly switch to
the pen tool its G and if you hit V it
switches back to the selection tool now
to do like a temporary switch hold down
G and if you let go it'll go back to the
arrow tool it's really quick and now you
can see what I'm talking about by
knowing those hotkeys how that stuff is
helpful so right now when you create a
keyframe it creates it default ly as an
auto bezzie a keyframe and when you when
you mess with the handles and everything
like that which I'll show you those real
quick you clip if you click on them to
have these handles right here
when you touch the handles it changes
the type of keyframe that you have so
you start out with the Auto bezzie a
which is I'll type that for you real
quick
I'll show you how it's spelled because
it's felt weird nice white font all
right change that so you can see it
there you go that's how that's how it's
spelled
it's called sounds like desire but it's
not and people you will hear people say
it like that and it's funny but don't
ever say desire always say bezzie a else
you'll get made fun of probably that's
kind of like a little joke in the
industry so click back on your layer
there and let's see it's on the auto
bezzie now now if you select a point and
rotate the handles you'll go to its
what's called a continuous busy a and
that's just what it's called when you
move the handles you can move them in
and out or you can twirl them like this
if you hold alt you can move one of them
independently like this now this is just
called a Bezier it's not that's all that
it is a bezzie a and you can hold alt to
move it like that and get comes back to
the regular one hold out again and it
moves it like broken so go back to the
regular also if you hit the pen tool and
you mouse over top of the Bezier handle
it changes to the convert vertex tool
which you can see if you hold up here on
the pen tool convert vertex tool same
thing that also if you have that
selected that'll also break too busy a
handle there is also another type of
handle this is it's called linear so if
you have the convert vertex tool on and
you click right here on the actual
keyframe point it makes hard straight
lines and angles now this is good if you
need to like there'll be times when you
need to use this and just so just
knowing how to do it is very handy so if
you click on it again it'll go back to
what you had previously so those are the
different types of keyframes remember
that if you hold down G it you're going
to have the arrow selected if you hold
down G it'll temporarily go to the pen
tool make sure that the pen tool is
selected and then if you hold down G
there you go it will change to the pen
tool it was changing to the convert
vertex tool when I had it on there
before so I'm holding down G and you
can't see it changing but if I'm still
holding down G right now
and I mas over it goes to the cover
vertex tool so that's a quick overview
of the types of keyframes
remember that keyframes are down here so
we can move on to maybe editing these
keyframes here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
