video I want to talk to you about
strokes now what the heck is a struct in
Python well a struct is a way that you
can actually take any type of data in
python whether it's numbers letter
strings whatever and you can convert it
to bytes format so first question is why
would we ever want to do this I mean it
might be interesting to know how your
computer stores memory or how it
transfers data over the network but you
really don't care about those ones zeros
most of the time so why are we learning
this well I'm actually going to be
making a new tutorial series about some
network applications in Python and
whenever you work with network
applications you actually need to read
the bytes value so you're on a network
and you see all these one zeroes coming
across and you need to actually
interpret it because humans can't read
ones and zeros so we need to figure out
a way to take all of that data that raw
data and turn it into something that's
readable for humans so that's why I'm
going to be showing you how to use strux
basically to turn ones and zeros into
something that humans can read so the
first thing that you need to do is go
from struct imports all and I'll show
you guys how to pack and unpack and what
all that means so the first thing I'm
going to do is just we're going to have
some data and I'll just have like three
numbers like 6 whatever 19 and some
float and we'll store his bytes so store
as bytes data and someone is texting me
actually that's male and it was an
update for my Facebook page all right so
how do we take data in actually convert
it to bytes why would we want to do this
well say we're preparing to send some
data across the network well let's go
ahead and make a variable and I'll just
name it pack that up and what you need
to do is you need to call a function
called a pack now as you can see before
I hit enter this is going to take two
parameters the first one is the format
and the second one is going to be a list
of values and it can either be just one
value like a number or
or it can be you know a list like you
know ten different numbers
so remember format and values alright so
if you go to the Python documentation
they'll say that what you store and
they'll give you the the letter for what
it is but say that we wanted to distort
two integers and a float some decimal
point
well the key letter for integers is I so
if we wanted to store two of them just
type I twice and then I'm also going to
store a decimal point or float so I'm
just going to write that now if I just
wanted to store five integers then I'll
just write I five times but let's go
ahead and start two integers in a float
so now with the comma separated this we
just need to give it two integers in
flow so I'll say like six oh 19 and
float like four point seven three
whatever and of course if you're using
like strings or characters or anything
like that then this is going to be
different but basically whenever you
have data such as this and you want to
convert it to a byte format just write
what type of data you're storing and
then the data itself simple enough now
if you actually just want to see this
right now we can print it out and
remember whenever I print this out is
going to print it out in byte format so
this B right here
it signifies bytes and now you see all
of that stuff so /xo 6 /x double-o all
of that crap so again whenever you
transfer data over the network that's
what's actually being sent so that's why
when a lot of people try to build like
password sniffers and they start see you
know that they're like what the heck so
now we know what's going on behind the
scenes now I want to show you guys some
other cool things before I show you guys
how to take that byte data and actually
convert it back it's a huge human
readable form so this is going to come
in handy later whenever we're learning
about why we need to get a certain
amount of bytes so check this out this
calc size
this is Bo and function that
tells you how many bytes are needed to
store some value so let me just type I
right there
and let me just type something like f
and IIF IIF re so check this out
so we're printing out the byte data we
already saw that before and now I'm
going to print out the size needed to
store an integer a float and our data
which was two integers and a float
all right so it says 4 4 12 so whenever
you're sending data across the network
and you're sending an integer it takes
up 4 bytes that's how much space or
memory takes up same thing with a flow
very same size 4 bytes each and whenever
we try to calculate the size needed to
store two integers in a float it was 12
and that makes sense 4 plus 4 plus 4
equals 12
so later on what we're going to be doing
is we're going to say get the first 12
bytes of this packet or something and
now you guys are like oh so that's why
because you know that's how much space
it takes up so easy breezy beautiful
covergirl already now we need to figure
out how to get this data all this byte
data and convert it back into human
readable form well if PAC was the
function to make it byte data unpack is
the function to get it back to normal so
I'll say to kids I don't know data back
to normal say to get byte data all right
so I'll just name it original data and
what we need to do is we need to unpack
it now whenever you unpack it you also
need to give it the format so it's going
to be looking at a bunch of bytes which
is actually this thing and it's going to
say ok arm what do you want me to do
like are there integers in here are
there characters or there strings are
there floats how do you want me to
unpack it and we said that there's
actually two integers and a float in
here now is the second parameter you
just give it that pack data
right like that and this is all your
bytes that up so now whenever you run
this and we need to actually print it
out then check it out all right so all
this was from before and now we unpacked
it and we got 619 and our float which is
four point seven three and some numbers
on the end because computers are awesome
it's storing decimal points but we got a
little extra values right there so there
you go so another thing that I'll
actually want to show you guys is this
if I just copy all of this byte data
right here remember this is basically
six nineteen and four point seven three
stored as bytes you can actually just do
this print unpack iif and put all your
byte data right there so this may be a
little bit easier to visually see
whenever you first start learning about
this so let me go ahead and run this and
we get the same results right there
because of course this variable is equal
to this right there but basically
whenever you have to work with bytes or
you need to have byte data and transfer
it back into human readable form then
you can use pack and unpack from struck
so pretty easy stuff there you go I'll
see you guys next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
