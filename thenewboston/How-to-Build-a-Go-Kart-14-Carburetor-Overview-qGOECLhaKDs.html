carburetor now before we install it I
just want to give you guys a quick
overview of how everything works where
everything goes and there's actually a
lot to talk about
concerning just the carburetor so for
this video I'm just going to be giving
you guys like I said a real quick
overview but in probably when I'm
finished voting the entire go-kart I'll
probably do a separate video of every
little thing detailed on the carburetor
what every little piece is and also how
to adjust it for now let me go ahead and
give you guys the basics so you know how
you have always heard that your engine
runs on gasoline well that's only
partially true your engine actually runs
on a perfect mixture of gasoline and air
now in order to get that ratio exactly
how your engine wants it you use
something called the carburetor that is
the job of the carburetor to create that
perfect ratio of gas to air mixture now
let me go ahead to show you guys where
everything is going to be hooked up in
hopefully once I do that you guys will
understand a little bit more on how the
carburetor actually works
so of course before this thing can mix
it perfectly it needs both of those
things so your air intake is going to
come and it's going to go into a tube
that's connected right here that's where
that big air hose is going to go so
whenever we hook up our air unit
remember it goes right here now for the
fuel line this is going to be the fuel
line in the gas tank is actually going
to be hooked up right here it's going to
go through this fuel filter which cleans
any crud out of gas and it's going to go
into your carburetor as well so now your
carburetor has that perfect balance of
air and fuel and it can mix it and I'm
not going to show you guys how it mixes
it perfectly but just remember that this
is what it does it mixes the perfect
ratio of air to gas using some of those
pieces in there you see that I don't
even know if you guys can see and that's
one of the mechanisms this one actually
controls the air flow as you can see but
anyways like I said I'll talk about that
later on the only other things I want to
talk about in this video before I
actually install this is the
rattle the throttle valve wreck right
here this is going to be hooked up to
pretty much well let me go ahead and
give you guys a real quick explanation
this is going to be hooked up to a
throttle cable and that throttle cable
is hooked up to the gas pedal now the
more you press on your gas pedal the
more this throttle valve is going to
spin now what this throttle valve does
is it allows more fuel ever mixture into
your engine so how does it do that it
does that by controlling this door right
here so all of your air &amp;amp; fuel mixture
is going to be inside here inside the
chamber in the carburetor now the more
you spend this the more this door is
going to open and allow more of that
fuel air mixture into your engine and of
course the more fuel is going into your
engine the faster your go-kart is going
to go so just remember real quick
overview the air comes in through here
here on the air intake the fuel or gas
from the gas tank comes in through here
right in there
inside it controls it makes the perfect
ratio and depending on how hard you're
pressing down on the gas on the gas
pedal the wider this door is going to
open and the more gasoline is going to
get into your engine so now that we
understand what the carburetor is in a
real basic overview of how it works in
the next video I'm going to show you
guys how to install this on your go-kart</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
