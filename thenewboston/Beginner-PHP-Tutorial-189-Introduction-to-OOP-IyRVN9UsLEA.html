back with another PHP video tutorial now
in this tutorial I'm going to be briefly
introducing you to what object-oriented
programming is and also why it's more
useful to use in our case we're going to
be programming in object-oriented
programming in PHP so object-oriented
programming also noted as Hopey you
probably see them more commonly written
as IOP is a different way to program
with in many languages not just PHP
we've got PHP in languages such as C
sharp Java and just to name a couple so
why do we use or in object-oriented
programming now usually in a PHP script
you would use a procedural way of coding
so you would write your code maybe
include a couple of functions from top
to bottom
now object-oriented programming takes
use of objects in your program so you
will have different objects and inside
of your program which will allow you to
access them in different ways so if you
think about object-oriented programming
if you think of your whole application
or your your code if you like as a whole
object you have smaller objects inside
that you can deal with for example you
may have a bank account we may have a
class what will go into classes later so
if you don't know what a class is just
follow along the example you may have a
class called bank account and inside
this bank account this will be relative
to say a specific user you might have a
balance and some more information now
what happens if you want to
automatically update this balance by
calling
the subject and telling it what to do
now inside of this object you will have
you will have or this class if you like
you will have different methods so the
methods will update things so we could
have a method called update balance or
more realistically deposit funds and
then we can have say withdraw funds say
the deposit funds will take in a
parameter let's say 10 and we'll add 10
to our balance so this is a bit of a bad
way of representing it but when you get
into your object-oriented approach of
your object-oriented programming and you
start to write the code you'll
understand durst and how actually easier
is once you've got around the basics so
why do we learn an object-oriented
programming well for the reasons I've
already described your code is a lot
better organized object-oriented program
has been part of PHP since PHP 5 was
released I'm not sure when that was I
think it was a good good sort of 5 odd
years ago and not a lot of people do
actually use it they still use the same
procedural code which I do I mean I do a
lot of the time as well however it's a
good practice to get into learn
object-oriented PHP and start to get
into this practice because you're going
to reap the many benefits from this as
you can so like I said object-oriented
programming is a better way to program
in general you have just part of the
structure that you like I said you have
classes
you'll then have properties of each
class so this could be say like said
with the bank account example earlier
the property could be the balance and
then you have methods so the methods of
things that do things so methods are
essentially functions properties are
essentially variables so that you would
store data and however we have lots of
other aspects of object orientated
program
oriented programming sorry that we can
look at in order to work out how it's
useful for example we have things like
the extend keyword you can see that my
text editor has highlighted it blue
extends creates a new class but adapts
and create and takes properties and
methods from another class so we can
have a main top-level class but then we
can have classes underneath it that
extend data from that class so we can
take things like that bank account
example and we can extend another class
with different information but still
using the balance from there so you'll
find that lots of complex and code
written properly will use
object-oriented programming I've just
shown you a few examples
however we're going to crack on in next
examples of creating the code rather
than talking about it so I'm not going
to spend too much time talking about it
but we're going to get straight in and
do everything by example so you can
understand where and when our P is
useful</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
