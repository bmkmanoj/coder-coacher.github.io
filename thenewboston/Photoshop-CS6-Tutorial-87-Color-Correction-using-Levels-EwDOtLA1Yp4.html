Blackford here another Photoshop cs6
tutorial and in this tutorial I'm going
to show you how to adjust the eternal
range on your images so we have this
image here that I have that someone took
of us and and we were at a bar and you
can see that all the neon lights in the
background or that were around changed
it to like so lots of very red so I'm
gonna teach you how to use the levels
adjustment layer to adjust everything
and bring it out it to an image that
doesn't look all red and looks somewhat
decent so this is what we're gonna
change it to start looking too like this
so this is what we're gonna use try to
get to in our tutorial so I'm gonna go
ahead and just turn this off and we're
gonna start with a whole new adjustment
layer and we're gonna use the levels so
levels is this one here with the kind of
looks like Soundwave on a like those
visualizers or whatever so just click on
here and add a levels adjustment layer
or you can come down here and add levels
if you want so the main thing we see
here is that there's a lot of red in the
image and we got to take that away and
the first way we can do that is coming
down to where it says RGB here and we're
gonna come to the red Channel now you're
just gonna basically mess with this
these sliders here to take out some of
the red and add other color in this dark
slider here is for the shadows the
middle slider that's great here is for
the mid-tones and the light slider here
is for the highlights and then you've
got your total output levels here at the
bottom this will make it a add more red
and this will make it add less red so
when we're in the RGB here you can see
how this affects it by making it more
light lighter as you pull out the blacks
that are pulling the shadows there and
this will make it darker if you go this
way so that's how this level works here
let's go into the red and see what we
can do here now if I move the slider to
the right it's gonna take out some of
the color as you can see it's also
making it darker so I might want to move
my darkness over a little bit or make it
lighter by going this way let's let's
stay in this area right now and then we
can come back and adjust as we go
through let's go ahead to our greens
maybe we can add some color and by
moving the mid-tones to the left a
little and so far it looks like we've
taken out a decent amount out let's come
down to our blue here and then don't
want to add too much there that makes it
too green as I go that way that come
this way it's making a little blue here
we go take out some of the dark as I'm
sliding it slowly so I can I don't want
to go too much and this is a it's got a
little bit of green in there but it's
better than the entirely red that we had
before so you adjust your tonal ranges
like that and then we can if you need to
fine-tune it even more
that's not looking any good if I use
these yeah let's go to our RGB and see
what we can do that way so it's
darkening it I don't want it that dark
and as to it's blue it's blasting it
when I use the output levels here so I'm
not gonna mess with those let's check
out our other ones here too dark this is
a brighten it up a little but when you
want when you brighten it up and start
adding more stuff you can see that more
noise is being added so I'm just
bringing it up only a little bit maybe
I'll just use the mid-tones brighten
those up a little bit so now we've got a
decent looking image if you have a bunch
of these images that that you took at
like the bar
they're all red you can save this if you
go click on the options up here on the
corner you can go to save levels preset
and then save it into your levels folder
here as automatically goes their name it
whatever you want
um reduce redness I'll save that and
then if I come down to here I can come
down into my preset and just click on
reduce redness and it'll already be
there so if I turn this off
add another one in there come down to
reduce redness it's gonna automatically
apply it and then we can do things
really quickly and don't have to you
don't have to adjust each thing
individually so it won't take a lot of
time you can use the levels to lighten
up in images you can use the levels to
darken images if they're too bright and
just remember that as you do this it
does increase noise in in the image if
like you can see how there's more noise
and then you can maybe use you go to
your noise and try to get rid of some of
the noise using the reduced noise
filters and stuff like that but that's
that's forward and I already covered
that and another tutorial so check out
that tutorial do you want to go ahead
and start decreasing noise and
everything like that so that's about it
for this tutorial this is about
controlling tonal range using levels so
