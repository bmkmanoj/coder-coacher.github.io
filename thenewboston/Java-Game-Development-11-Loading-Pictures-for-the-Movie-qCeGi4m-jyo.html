eleventh java game development tutorial
and before we get started in this I need
to change something I messed up in my
last tutorial in our animation class
that we made we actually set our
constructor to private embarrassing we
need to make that public or else it's
going to be virtually useless to us so
now let's go ahead and begin our
tutorial and don't forget the change
that it's pretty important so in my
Bucky main class and I say main class
because it holds my main method and I'm
not going to be going over anything in
my main method because I told you guys
before go outside your main method and
this is where we're going to start our
tutorial again you should know all this
stuff from your last oreal now what
we're going to need in this tutorial to
start out is three different variables
we need a screen variable to access our
screen class an animation variable to
access this animation class right here
and also a background variable store the
image of our background so let's go
ahead and make them all private screen
and I'll just name it screen simplicity
and private a image I'll name my
background BG and this is going to hold
in my background image and private
animation and I'll just name the a
because I'm lazy and I don't feel like
typing animation out so this is going to
be my screen object my background
variable in my a is going to have access
to the animation class so the first
thing that we're going to want to do is
probably build a method to load the
pictures from our computer to local
variables so we can use them in our game
so let's go ahead and put public void
load tix and it's not going to take any
parameters awesome and the first thing
we're going to want to do is probably
load our background so set the
background equal to new image icon and
as a parameter remember it takes a
string come on cursor of where the
images or the file path pretty much so
this is C dot backslash backslash I had
mine enough
were called tests and I named it back
dot JPEG and now once you got your file
path just get that image using the
built-in method get image so now we need
to do this for our two animation images
and remember I've two pictures in my
animation one with my eyes closed and
one with my eyes open so we'll give the
parents that like I'm blinking I guess
so image I'm going to name the first one
face one and this is me with my eyes
open and we'll just copy this because
we're lazy and copy that crap right
there and paste it right over there
and it's in the same folder but this one
is called face one dot ping and now for
my other one oh you just copy that whole
thing right there this is a little too
easy
phase two and of course change the file
so now we got our background loaded in
this variable and our two images of my
face loaded in this variable so now we
need to make our animation object so a
equals new animation right there
constructor doesn't take any parameters
so now we have access to all the methods
in our animation class through the a
object so let's go ahead and the first
thing we want to do is add these new
faces and convert these pictures to a
scene so remember in our animation class
we had this method called add scene
right here and what it did is it takes a
picture aka face one or phase two and it
adds it to our ArrayList and also sets
the time it wants to play it so let's go
ahead and do that right now
a dot add scene and it tells us our
parameters first what image do we want
to add face one and how long do we want
it to play 250 milliseconds and this is
a quarter of a second so now that we
added this scene or added the image to
our ArrayList we want to add the other
image as well so we want that image to
play for a quarter of a second we also
want face to
to play for a quarter of a second so now
let me just take this extra spacing out
there and let me add a little comment
loads pictures from computer to Java and
add C so that's what this method load
picks those and now let's go ahead and
build our run method and this method is
going to be the main engine to run and
it's what's going to be called from the
very first main method right here so we
better not mess it up I'll name it
public void run and again a display mode
and which is named and diem is going to
be passed in and you guys should know
what the display mode just like the
settings pretty much and let's go ahead
and make our screen object equal the new
screen so now we have access to all that
stuff in our screen class so now we can
try to do a couple things in our try
block the first thing we're going to
want to do is take that screen and
remember we made a method called set
fullscreen in there and it's going to
take the display mode we're going to
pass it in and new j-frame as a
parameter which is the window pretty
much and what else do we want to try
right off to begin with well the first
thing we want to do is load those
pictures like we just built right up
here load pics and right after that we
want to do something called movie loop
and what this method is going to do and
I know we didn't vote it yet but it's
going to be the main movie loop and it's
pretty much going to loop through and
play your movie so after we try that
what do you want to finally do well
since we're in full screen what we want
to do is get out a full screen so after
we're done playing our movie just
restore screen just like that so in
essence here's what we did in this
tutorial we loaded all the pictures from
our computer to use them we added those
pictures as scenes in our movie and then
after that we just put it in our run
method so now that we have that method
we can finally use this run method and
all this does is pretty much set up your
screen right here
loads the pictures obviously and plays
your movie so that's all this program is
going to do arm pretty much the load
pictures and play a movie and now of
course we need to build a couple other
methods called
movie loop and also another draw method
but probably one more tutorial and we
will be animating our first animation
and it will be amazing will be a huge
stepping stone because this is one of
the most important things in games
animation but enough with me rambling on
I'm sure you're ready to get the next
tutorial so thank you guys for watching
don't forget to subscribe and I'll see
you next story</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
