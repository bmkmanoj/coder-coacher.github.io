tutorial for the new boss in and what
we're going to do in this tutorial we're
going to learn about the progress bar
but before we start I just want to point
out a quick err that it made in the last
tutorial which I'm sorry for but a good
thing we decide are I decided to do the
progress tutorial because I would have
missed missed this completely so we have
this third method called on progress
updated and it's actually supposed to
just be on progress update and I'll show
you what that does a little bit more in
this tutorial since we're going to get a
little bit more familiar with this async
task mm-hmm
so the first thing we need to do is we
need to set up our progress dialog is
what it calls it so within this class
what we're going to do is we're going to
say progress dialog something like
dialog like that we're going to set it
up to equal anything we're going to do
now is within this on pre execute we're
just going to delete what we had and
delete this string because we don't
really care it's still going to be
called this way or it's still going to
be called here again before it calls
this string here are this doing
background type method so we're just
going to delete what it takes within its
parameters we're going to set up our
dialog so what we're going to do is say
dialog equals new progress dialog and it
takes a context so we're going to refer
to our main class up here called
internal data and we're going to say
internal data chicken is our main class
name and then we're going to say dot
this so we're getting the context of our
main class and that's where we're going
to want our dialog to display now we can
add some stuff this dialog source saying
dot like set progress style and there's
some defaults that we can refer to from
the progress dialog class so we're just
going to refer to like a horizontal
style one so we're going to say style
horizontal finish that dialogue
set maximum and we could like get like
how much bite are you know how much data
we're working with but for the most part
we're just going to set up a dubious
type of dialogue so we want the max to
be a hundred just for this example and
then what we're going to do is we're
just going to say dialog dot show so we
set it up and then we show it again
pretty simple for the most part you guys
should be kind of familiar with you know
creating something actually I'm not sure
how much stuff we've created in Java but
basically this is just creating a dialog
for us with the maximum of 100 and we
display it and again this is only going
to be created and displayed when we call
this on pre execute so again when our on
click method we had that load button
it's going to call this first before it
actually tries to load the data so now
what we want to do is we want to go into
this doing background and we're going to
say is we're going to create a for loop
before it actually tries to load data
again we're just kind of making a
dubious type of type of dialog here so
we're going to say is for and we're
going to set up an int called I and
we're going to set it equal to B 0 then
we're going to put a semicolon then
we're going to say as long as I is less
than let's say 20 whoops
I is less than 20 and we're going to
increment by 1 now I'm not sure if we've
done for loops yet or not it's kind of a
java thing all we're saying is while
we're initially starting our variable to
be 0 and while that variable is less
than 20 loop through again and then it's
going to increment that number by 1 so
it's going to loop through this 20 times
for the most part now what we need to do
is we need to kind of reference this on
progress update here and we do that by a
command and the command is called
publish progress
and what we're gonna do is we're gonna
pass in oops
and then within parentheses we pass in
what we want for the most part so we're
going to pass in five so now what we're
going to do is it's going to loop
through 20 times and send five each time
to this on progress update so now what
we're going to do is we're going to set
up our dialog again that we created
we're going to say increment progress by
and we're going to kind of access
whatever we publish progress up here and
our do do in background so since we're
passing five in it's going to update by
five if we refer to that again we
created or we're passing in an array and
you're like what we aren't we're just
passing in one number how is that a
integer array well it still is
classifying it as an array at the
position zero so what we're going to say
is our integer array we called progress
here we're just going to say progress
and since it is array we have to have
the boxes and we're going to refer to
position zero which again is going to be
that five so we're just going to update
our dialog you know by five each time it
gets called each time this published
progress gets called and then after all
that's done we need to still close our
dialog box so it's going to be you know
going through this loop for actually
that's going to go really quick so let's
add a sleep within here so again this
kind of review thread dot sleep and
we're going to sleep for 288
milliseconds for some reason I don't
know we're just going to do that and
then we have to surround this with a try
and catch so now it's going to sleep for
88 milliseconds each time before it you
know call updates or increments
increments by one and then each time
again it's going to pass five and down
here we update our progress bar by five
and then once it's complete or once you
know those for loops done we've reached
a hundred for the most part
what we're going to do now is we're
going to refer to our dialogue and just
close it so we're going to say a
dialogue dismiss and that's just to get
rid of it because you know it's going to
be caught up in this loop for however
long 88 milliseconds times 20 is and
then after it's done doing that we're
going to dismiss our dialogue so let's
run it make sure everything works I know
we went through a lot of stuff in this
tutorial but again if you guys think you
felt follow along you're getting
problems make sure this isn't updated
like this I'm like I said in the last
tutorial delete that D it's progress on
progress update so that's kind of a key
point and then also you know we just set
up our dialogue and nothing too to
complicate it there so hopefully this
works and again if you guys need the
source code if this is one of your first
tutorials you haven't been following in
the series just go to my bring back comm
go to the tutorial section and under the
Android section of that there should be
the New Boston there should be the whole
package source code you can download all
that stuff so let's just hit our load
data creates progress bar up States by 5
for each time it goes through that for
loop then when it's done or want it with
a four in the four loops done it's going
to dismiss the dialog and then it's
going to call you know our our file
input output stream so again we can just
say test save load data and then it
loads so I mean that progress bar has
nothing to do with that the actual
loading of data is something completely
different dubious for the most part but
I'll catch you guys in the next tutorial
we're going to learn about external
storage so have a good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
