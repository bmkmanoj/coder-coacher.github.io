c-sharp tutorial then I'm making for her
New Boston and in this tutorial we're
going to be basically adding our
contacts to both our list view and an
internal list so the first thing that
we're just going to want to do here you
double click on this add contact button
alright so then we're going to want to
go up here and create a list that will
hold on all of our contacts I'm just
going to stay list and it'll be a list
of people so you can use this person
class right here so person and I'm just
going to call it people instead of equal
to a new list of persons or people
alright so we're just going to want to
create a new person right here I'm just
going to call it key instead of useful
to a new person and then we're going to
want to set all these properties in here
and they will be whatever that the user
sets so we're going to say P dot name
equals and then the person's name will
be in this text box of text box 1 we're
going to say a text box 1 text right
there and then we can say that their
street address will be equal to text box
threes text so text box
threes text and then we can say their
email address will be equal to text box
twos text which is this text box so text
box to text and then we can say that
their birth or their baseline is this
date time Pickers value so we say T
birthday equals date time picker 1 dot
value and date time picker 1 is just
this right here next to the birthday
label and then additional notes we will
store in the additional notes property
so you can just say P dot additional
note equals text box fors text so text
box or
tax alright so now we're just going to
want to add this person to this people
list right here so we're going to say
people dot add and then this person that
we just created and we're also going to
want to create a new list view item and
add it to this list view right here so
we're going to say list view one items
groups items dot add and since we're
only going to be having one column right
here I'm going to have columns this is
going to be basically a list of people's
names we can just put a string in here
so P dot name
alright so now when we debug here and
type in someone's name Adam email
address gmail.com through the address
mains you know put a number down Main
Street's birthday alley with that and
additional notes blah blah blah and just
click Add Contact and then I'll add that
person right there and the last thing
that we're going to want to do is just
clear out everything all the information
in here so we're going to say text box
one text pulls nothing
text box twos text equals nothing text
box threes text each page nothing text
box for is text because nothing and
we're also going to want to reset the
date/time picker to the current time so
it's going to say date time picker dot
value equals date time date/time dot now
all right so now when you go ahead and
add a person to this list box and to our
list for our people list up there
it should just clear everything out of
here so just like Adam
random nodes and book add contact you
just clear everything out perfect
alright so that's pretty much it for
this tutorial so see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
