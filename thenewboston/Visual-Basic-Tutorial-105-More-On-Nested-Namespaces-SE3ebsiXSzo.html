youtube.com slash on live gamer for the
new Boston and in this tutorial we're
gonna be taking a look at nests and
namespaces again but instead of doing
them like we did in the last tutorial
we're gonna look at a better and easier
to understand way so we'll go ahead and
just delete this code right here and
we'll delete this too now let's come
back into our people dot VB file you can
see that we have namespace all people
other people and friends all nested
inside of all people now there is an
easier way to do this so what we can do
is let's go ahead and take out this
right here and we'll come back up to the
top and here is our namespace people
okay so now I have names tastes people
and other people and friends now what we
can do is we could take functions or we
could take classes I mean and put them
inside of all people and allow all of
the other classes inside of other people
and friends doing what's called inherit
those classes from the all people now
we'll be talking about inheritance and
probably a couple of tutorials from now
so let's go ahead and make some changes
to this code so you guys know what I'm
talking about about nesting the the
namespaces so you see here we have name
States all people and other people know
what we want to do to nest this is type
namespace all people dot other people
and then we'll go ahead and do it again
right here so now this namespace right
here is pretty much part of the all
people namespace so whatever classes are
put inside of this these classes can
inherit from those too and now this
probably confuses you the tournament
heritance but we'll be talking about
that soon and after we've done that you
can come back to this and use
inheritance to make this code a little
bit easier to work with and understand
okay so now we have all people without
friends and all people to other people
so we can come in here and let's just
create an other people object so private
my person as new and then we're gonna
type all people dot other people dot
people so we've created an object of the
people class from other people which is
right here and it has nothing to do with
this people class down here in friends
so let's come in here and we will access
the button one click so we'll type my
person dot first-name equals
texe first name dot txt my person dot
last name equals text last name dot text
and they'll go ahead show that out so
message box my person dot - string and
we'll go ahead and run this so we can
type the first name tomm last name let's
just say let's just do Harris again okay
so we'll go ahead and click show person
and you can see that we get Tom Harris
right here in the title is name spaces
so we'll just go ahead and click OK
so go ahead and practice a little bit
more with nesting namespaces so that you
can organize your classes better and I
would recommend using this type of
nesting namespaces over just putting
them inside of each other because that
could get a little confusing and when
you use this it makes it a lot easier to
understand so go ahead and practice that
a bit and then once we've got that down
move on to the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
