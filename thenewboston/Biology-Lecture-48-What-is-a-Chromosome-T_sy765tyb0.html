biology tutorial in in this video I want
to talk to you guys about chromosomes
and also something called chromatid now
I want to do this because in the
upcoming videos I'm going to be using
this terminology a lot so it's better if
I give you guys a real basic
understanding now so if you guys are
unfamiliar with chromosomes or chromatid
again like I said let me give you guys a
real quick overview and I say quick
overview because just like everything
else in biology there there's basically
a lot of material to cover just on
chromosomes and we're going to be
talking about them in detail later on
but for now I'm just going to give you
guys a real quick overview I'll shut up
now and start teaching so during
interphase actually let me go ahead and
draw two cells the first one right here
will be interphase and we already know
that interphase means when the cell's
going about its daily routine not
dividing so let me go ahead and label
these interface on the left and we'll
say getting ready to divide to divide on
right all right now I drew these because
we already know during interphase the
blue thing is of course the nuclear
membrane and of course the nuclear
membrane is in this big but for my you
know example that I'm about to do I want
to zoom in on the nucleus a little bit
the DNA and we already know that DNA of
course is in the nucleus it's all spread
out so it looks a little bit something
like this a bunch of tiny strands in
there loose and they're spread out all
around the nucleus so the reason that
your DNA whenever you know yourselves
experiencing interface or just working
its daily routine or its daily job is
spread out is because we already know
the function of DNA now in order for DNA
to work quickly and efficiently is
better if it has more surface area and
it's spread out again like I said just
so it can work more efficiently however
whenever the cell is getting ready to
divide it's easier for your cell to
divide your DNA if it's packed up into
these tight little packages so instead
of you know all spread out like it was
an interface whenever your cells getting
ready to divide it condenses its DNA
packs it together into these little
things in these well let me go ahead and
change my brush size these things right
here I'll call are called
chromosomes so a real quick you know
definition is of a chromosome is packed
up DNA so one more time during
interphase or during the cells daily
routine it's better if the DNA is spread
out just because it's more efficient
that way
and whenever your selves getting ready
to divide it's easier we'll see later on
if it packs it up into these tight
little packages and tight little
packages of DNA are called chromosomes
so now let me go ahead and open up a new
slide and talk to you guys about the
different kinds of well I don't want to
say different kinds of chromosomes but a
little bit more about chromosomes so
before I start talking let me go ahead
and actually draw a couple chromosomes
and I'll draw these a little bit thicker
all right so the green things will of
course be chromosomes and I'll tie
talked to you guys about why I'm drawing
different ones later on so these green
things are your chromosomes and I'm
going to draw something else in a
different color and I'll just draw this
right here all right
so what color did what color am I going
to write with yellow looks pretty good
so as you can see I drew the chromosomes
in green but I also drew this pink thing
in the middle of each one now the pink
thing where the chromosome is kind of
pinched in is called a centromere now I
said that I drew in the middle but it
actually doesn't have to be in the
middle vertically on each one so this
one is basically right in the dead
middle but this one is kind of you know
to the top and this one's at the very
top so they can either be in the dead
middle or off-centered or at the very
top but nonetheless the centromere is
the portion where the chromosome is
pinched in now another thing on one
point is that you see how you can
basically take each chromosome and split
them like this
and let me split this one there we go so
it has a left and a right strand to it
well these little strands are called
chromatid so there's a chromatid on the
left a chromatid on the right on each
one no matter where the centromere is it
has two chromatid so basically if you
were talking about this you know
technically you would say that each
chromosome which is the entire thing is
made up of two sister chromatid one on
the left one on the right and they are
joined together by a centromere and the
centromere would of course be this
purple pinkish thing I drew so another
thing we want to point out is that
sister chromatid are 100% identical to
each other so this chromatid right here
is identical 100% to this chromatid and
we can do that for everyone this
chromatid is identical to that one this
one is identical to that one so later on
you know I don't want to talk about you
know cell division too much in depth but
basically one of these chromatid are
going to go to one cell and one of them
are going to go to the other cell so we
end up with the exact same copy in two
different cells that's where the cell is
going to split in half so basically what
happens during the S phase of interphase
remember that I told you guys that each
cell do places DNA for informing to
sister chromatid is this I'll go ahead
and show you guys a real quick example
it starts with one chromosome and what
you end up with after the S phase is a
chromosome separated with a centromere
but basically you have two sister
chromatid now you know how I said that
this was a chromosome and I'm also
saying that this entire thing is a
chromosome well that's one of the things
in biology they call it each of those
things chromosomes no matter if it's
made up of one chromatid or two but just
remember for this tutorial that whenever
I'm talking about chromosomes I'm going
to be talking about this entire
structure right here and whenever I say
that each chromosome is made up of two
sister chromatid of course
I mean this one on the left is a sister
and this one on the right is a sister
chromatid and they are sent separated by
this thing in the middle called
a centromere now as we're going to see
later on after mitosis one of these
sister chromatid is going to go to one
cell the other one is going to go to the
other cell and even though the splits in
half each daughter cell is going to be
identical why is that well it's because
each chromatid is the exact same so
hopefully you guys understand a little
bit more about chromosomes which are
basically DNA packed together and also
the different basically the different
pieces of a chromosome chromatid joined
together with the centromere and well
that's pretty much it so thank you guys
for watching don't forget subscribe and
in the next tutorial we're going to
start covering mitosis</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
