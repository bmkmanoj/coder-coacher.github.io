your twenty second tutorial and in this
tutorial we're going to be beginning to
talk about something called event
handlers now invent handler is basically
our first step towards creating a more
interactive and dynamic webpage an event
handler is basically running a bit of
JavaScript code in response to a user
action for example whenever they roll
over a button or whenever they click a
mouse this is when we can set the
JavaScript code to run instead of just
running everything right as the web page
alone so as you can see instead of just
making everything happen when the web
page loads we wait for the user's action
and it creates the feel of or like an
interaction so let's go ahead and enough
of me talking it's a lot easier if you
just see what's going on so let me go
ahead and mention a few things first
first of all when you're working with
event handlers you don't always need to
place the JavaScript inside those two
special scripting tags event handlers
are it's kind of special you can it's
possible to make it outside those
scripting tags and for the first example
that's what I'm going to show you guys
how to do so aside from that I better
mention this event handlers can be
placed in many locations on a web page
they kind of look like just basic XHTML
attributes but instead of like writing
um color equals blue and separating a
value like blue this is where you insert
the JavaScript so let's go ahead and I
guess it would be easiest for me to just
make one so one place you can insert
event handlers are in form elements
specifically um form buttons so let's go
ahead and make a form and we'll go ahead
and insert some event handlers in here
so go ahead and make your basic form and
then go ahead and make a one input we
don't need one input just a basic button
on the screen in case you forgot from
XHTML tutorials how to do this you just
go ahead and write inputs type equals
button and for the value the value is
basically what is your button going to
say and we'll just write touch me so
let's go ahead and end this right now
and we'll see what we got we got a basic
plain old button on the screen doesn't
do anything you just click it a bunch of
times and nothing happens pretty boring
huh so let's go ahead and use event
handlers to spice this up a bit now
event handlers are pretty much built in
keywords that your computer recognizes
and knows that it's JavaScript you don't
have to tell it in another function that
it's JavaScript your browser
automatically knows the event handler so
whoever created your browser
they already typed them in there for you
so the only thing you have to remember
is these different keywords for event
handlers and the most oh I don't want to
say commonly used because I never did a
survey on it but one of the most
commonly used event handlers is called
on click and make sure the C is
capitalized and this is a keyword that
says whenever the user clicks this
element and in this case a button right
here then I want to run the bit of
JavaScript code in here so anything you
type in between these quotation marks it
has to be JavaScript code and that's
what's going to be ran whenever the user
clicks is fun so go ahead and I'm just
going to make a basic alert box so go
ahead and type alert and add your
parameters but check this out you know
however we make an alert that we usually
type some text into it and we put it in
double quotation marks like hey now or
something like that well since we're
working inside of XHTML attribute right
now and we have all these double
quotation marks these quotation marks
right here tell JavaScript excuse me
tell your browser that we're working
with attributes so we can't use those
same quotation marks in here so instead
of double quotation marks
we need to use single quotation mark so
we don't confuse it so it doesn't really
have an effect on your program at all it
just differentiates between the double
ones for your attributes and the single
ones for your JavaScript so go ahead put
single quotation marks in your parameter
and go ahead and write something like
ah or write something stupid and now
just like in JavaScript with every
statement we have to end up with a
semicolon this lets our browser know
that we're done running this bit of
javascript code so go ahead and save
that refresh it and our webpage looks
the same right now but in fact it's not
the same because whenever we touch this
button check it out an alert box pops up
that says ah pretty cool so let's go
ahead and press ok and that's the basic
of an event handler so as you can see
before whenever we were working with
JavaScript our web page loaded and all
the JavaScript ran and it did whatever
it did and that was basically it but now
we can wait for the user input and
whenever they do something such as click
button then the JavaScript code runs in
it's just a way to make the web page
more interactive and more dynamic so
aside from that I guess I have time to
mention one more thing you know how I
added one statement in there on the on
click attribute and whenever we touched
it a bit of JavaScript code ran well
since we added a semicolon we can add
more than one statement in here so for
example let's go ahead and add one alert
box that says ah and let's go ahead and
add another one right after that so
alert and of course remember use your
single quotes right in here and just go
ahead and write like two times or
something different from your first so
you can tell that it's different so now
we have two different statements
whenever we click it using this on click
event handler first it says alert ah and
then it says alert two times pretty
stupid but hey it works so I just click
the button and it wasn't even in the
screen so check it out touch it ah press
okay and then it says
oh I didn't refresh it there we go touch
it
ah and check it out two times and you
might have this happening if your code
isn't running exactly how you want in
some browsers in order to prevent a
bunch of ads from popping up or if you
have any like an Tia ants I add what's
called an anti-virus or anti spyware
bill in your computer only one pop-up
will pop up and it's not because your
code is wrong it's because your browser
has thinks that you're trying to post a
whole bunch of ads so will only pop up
one in time so if that's happening then
that's your browser not your code but
anyways what I want to show you guys
here is you're not limited to only one
statement you can add more than one
statement you can add 500 if you want
but you see how I added two statements
right in here whenever you have like
three or more statements it's probably
easier just to add a function and then
whenever you make your function before
you can just add all your statements in
there but for now this is just a quick
example so there you go so anyways
that's the basics of an event handler I
showed you on click in this tutorial but
in the next tutorial we're going to be
going over different types of event
handlers and you'll begin to see why
they're useful and what we can do them
so that's what you got to look forward
to if you have any questions check out
my website or ask me on my forum and
I'll be happy to answer for you so thank
