it means that their corresponding angles
are congruent and their corresponding
sides are proportional
so if triangle ABC is similar to
triangle d EF angle a is congruent to
angle the angle B is congruent to angle
a angle C is congruent to angle F and
their sides are proportional so a over D
is equal to B over E is equal to C over
s F so we know that triangle ABC is
similar to triangle d EF if we know that
side a equals five C equals nine and F
equals 18 we want to find out what side
d equals so since they're similar that
means that their sides are proportional
so a which is right here five over D
which is what we're trying to find out
is equal to C over F because they're
similar and proportional triangles so
just like we would solve a normal
proportion we're gonna cross multiply
and we're gonna get 9 D is equal to 5
times 18 so 9 D equals 90 divide both
sides by 9 you get D equals 10 so if E
is equal to 24 5 B so E is equal to 24
and we want to find side B so B over 24
is equal to we're gonna set it equal to
9 over 18 so then we're gonna cross
multiply we get 18 B is equal to 9 times
24 18 B equals to 16 divide both sides
by 18 and we get B equals 12 okay so the
thing to remember when we're setting up
these proportions to find the lengths of
these sides we want to keep the
proportions consistent so in the first
one I started with 5 which is this side
of this big triangle so I'm going to put
that over this side of a little triangle
and I'm going to go back to the big
triangle and put this side over this
side of the little triangle now we could
do the opposite and have the little
triangle over the big triangle
it doesn't matter as long as we keep it
consistent so we still have these two
triangles but now we know that the
measure of angle a is 35 the measure of
angle C is 65 and we have to find the
measure of all the other angles so the
first thing we're gonna do is we're
gonna find the measure of angle B and we
can do that using our rules of the
interior angles of triangles so 35 plus
65 plus X is equal to 180 because all
the angles in a triangle always add up
to 180 so 35 plus 65 is equal to a
hundred plus X is equal to 180 so X is
equal if we subtract 100 over X is equal
to 80 so that means B is equal to 80 so
now in order to find out the angles of
the little triangle we need to remember
what similar triangles have in common
since we know that these two triangles
are similar that means that their
corresponding angles are congruent so
the measure of angle D has to equal the
measure of angle a same angle a is 35
measure of angle D is also 35 same thing
goes for the measure of angle F this
angle corresponds to angle C so since a
angle C is 65 degrees the measure of
angle F is also 65 degrees and last
measure of angle a is congruent to the
measure of angle B since we find found
the measure of angle B to be 80 degrees
we know the measure of angle E also has
to be 80 degrees so now that we know
what similar triangles are in our next
lesson we're going to talk about how we
can identify similar triangles so make
sure you come back and want</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
