ninth fo studio tutorial and in this
video I want to talk to you guys about
something called the piano roll now the
piano roll the best way I can describe
it is it's a really advanced keyboard
editor now why do we need a really
advanced keyboard editor well if we
think about it
whenever we were making these notes
right here we really don't have a lot of
control over them the only thing that we
really had control over is what tone
they played but if we look at this like
a regular playing piano you notice that
there are a couple things that you can't
do first of all if you play this pattern
rock me baby rock me baby we notice that
first of all we can't control how long
each note is held for so for example if
we want this note to play only one
quarter note it doesn't it plays until
this note hits right here so that's the
first thing we don't have control of how
long each note is held for another thing
that we can't do which is huge whenever
you're playing an instrument is you
can't play multiple notes at once for
example if we want it to play C E and G
all on this then we couldn't because
it's kind of like right now we're only
playing the piano with one finger but of
course we know that's not how
instruments really work so in order to
have full control over every single note
we need to open something called the
piano roll now in order to access this
just go ahead and right click this and
press send to piano roll now what the
piano roll is is basically it gives you
like full control like I said it's
basically a very powerful keyboard
editor and it allows you to visually see
each note so the first thing I want to
do is I want to talk to you guys just
about the interface if I play the
pattern right now rock me baby rock me
baby you can see visually that the only
part we're concerned about right now is
between the first and second measure all
this crap over here it doesn't really
matter right now because our pattern
isn't that long
so of course you it's pretty much like a
window and you know your operating
system in order
to scroll left and right just use this
up here in order to scroll up and down
use this over here but since we aren't
really using the space to the right I
want to show you guys how to zoom in
just between 1 &amp;amp; 2 on this scroll bar on
the you know left and right horizontal
axis if you hover over your mouse on the
right hand side you see that it turns to
a left and right arrow now if we drag
that to the left this allows us to
either zoom in or zoom out so I'm going
to put it right around here put it you
know wherever you feel comfortable at so
that basically allows you to zoom in on
the first measure because that's really
the only measure we're concerned about
another thing I want to do is make sure
you snap to quarter beads so you know
this grid right here how it has for
pretty much a fourth beat or your grid
size if you don't see that for example
if you're at a six to be well we really
don't want that because well it's going
to make this tutorial kind of confusing
so in order to follow along with me make
sure that each beat has four grid spaces
on it so again if you want to change
your grid this is how you do it this
little drop down menu up here I'm going
to be working with quarter beads for
this tutorial Oh gross got a bunch of
friggin phlegm in my throat all right so
just like everything in FL studio
whenever you want to add a note you
left-click poop on the space and
whenever you want to delete it you
right-click it so that's simple enough
that is how you add new notes and you
can also delete them by right-clicking
them easy enough rock me baby alright
but you know what we could add in delete
notes with you know the keyboard editor
so why is this so special well first of
all it gives you control to move notes
around so for example if you want to
move this M on top of the C and also
let's just go ahead and add an e right
there now whenever we play it rock me
baby they're all playing at the same
time now let me go ahead and expand that
and that will bring me to another one
well first of all whenever you want to
move them as you just saw hover over it
and you can see you got that up-down
left-right this allows you to move the
note around and whenever you want to
resize it go on the right and you can
drag it out now of course the longer
note is visually the longer it plays so
I'm going to drag these all together and
I'm going to delete this and what's
going to happen now is this plays as a
chord right now just like you have three
fingers hitting the keyboard so let's
play this rock baby rock baby alright so
that's pretty cool now we have control
that we can draw move resize and delete
each note pretty freakin sweet now
another thing I want to mention is this
whenever you add a new note this is one
entire beat long or one quarter note
long and if you're like alright I
actually want to make I'm going to be
working with a lot of you know fourth
beats so how do I change that well
whenever you resize a note for example
again they're one beat long and let's go
ahead and resize this so it's only a
quarter beat long now every no I add is
a quarter beat long so FL studio'
basically remembers the last size of the
beat you made and it makes every note
after that that size so if you're going
to be working with half beats change the
note to half beat and now I'm drawing
half beats simple enough and that's a
you know if you're like alright every
time I draw know it's a different
freakin length why is it doing that well
that's why so of course we learned how
to overlap notes to make chords we also
learn that we can make single beats by
not overlapping them and the last thing
that I want to talk to you guys about is
this thing down here so this down here
is the velocity a ka the intensity so
that's another thing that we have
control over in the piano roll that we
didn't when we were just working with
the keyboard editor just like playing a
real piano you can hit your notes at
different amounts of intensity intense
for example you can hit it softly or you
can hit the keyboard hard to make it
louder so this is what you visually are
seeing down here so if we wanted to play
this chord softly let me get rid of
these they'll be easier to demonstrate
rock me baby rock me baby all right
and I'm like you know I like this beep
but this chord is too loud it's too
intense what I can do is just drag this
down and that's probably too much but
you guys can see rock me baby
good louder rock me baby Oh
so as you can see this allows you to
control the intensity right here and
actually if you have notes that overlap
with let's go ahead and play this rock
baby rock baby you can actually still
change the intention intensity of each
single note so I'm gonna just go and go
ahead and say we want to step this up
actually probably something like this so
this gonna set it out rock rock so again
like I said this is the piano roll and
it gives you a ton of control over your
notes basically anything that you can do
on the piano in real life you can do in
this piano row and it's very intuitive
very simple you can draw move resize
nose change the velocity put notes on
top of each other make chords and boom
how freakin sweet is that but if you're
saying you know what this is cool but I
play the piano on real life or maybe you
have a MIDI keyboard and you want to use
that in the program in the next video
I'm going to show you guys how to set
that up and how to use it in conjunction
with this to make some sweet beats so
thank you guys for watching I'm going to
shut up now and I'll see you guys in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
