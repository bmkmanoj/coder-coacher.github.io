welcome to another fantastic story and
this is actually the eighth intermediate
Java tutorial and in this story we're
going to be learning how to convert
lists to arrays and arrays the list and
a bunch of other good stuff like that so
the first thing you're probably
wondering is alright why would I want to
convert an array to a list or a list to
an array
well Java has different methods um
Colombia my microphone there we go
Java has certain methods that you can
only do two arrays and certain methods
that you can only do two lists so
sometimes you need to convert them back
and forth depending on what you need to
do the dead so let's go ahead and
actually that's the name let's go ahead
and start out by making an array string
I'll name it stuff and just put a bunch
of stuff in here I'll put like babies
watermelon and make sure you spell like
water them along and let's see what else
regular melons you definitely need that
in there and fudge so that's good not
the Oh make sure it's like more and
three or something for a good
demonstration so now we need to build a
list that contains all of the stuff in
the array so let's go ahead and build a
linked list and of course this was
imported and drop a utility is why we're
able to use this and we're going to cast
string because that's what type of data
we're going to be working with and we're
going to name it the list so we won't
get confused and it's going to be new
linked list and just go ahead and type
string in and for a parameter go ahead
and put arrays dot as list and as list
is a built in method and for the
parameter it takes what am array you
want to treat as a list and this is that
stuff one that we just made so what this
line of code did right here is it pretty
much we created a list containing the
stuff array so we pretty much just
changed this to a list using the AZ list
method
and we did this because whenever we
change an array to a list you can now
treat it you can now use list methods on
it so if you try to use the list methods
or collection methods on this array you
can't because it's not a collection so
that's why we had to change the tool
list and why did we have to do this
right here because there's a linked list
constructor
it only takes a collection or list as
argument so we had to change this to a
list and we can just pass it an array in
here so now that we use AZ list it
should pretty much looks at it as a list
and then we're able to pass it in as an
argument so if you got that down then
you should be good for the next part of
tutorial that's probably the most
confusing thing pretty much change it to
an list or actually make it view it as a
list then pass in is argument simple
enough and now what we can do is we can
use list methods on this new list so now
we got a list in an array which is
pretty much the same exact thing so
let's put the list dot add pumpkin there
we go
make sure you spell it totally wrong
because we don't care and now what we
can do is we can add other list methods
so we can put like the list dot add
first and of course you know this is a
list method not an array method so
that's why we're able to use this and
let's put like first thing so whenever
you do regular add it automatically adds
it to the end of the list and you can do
other cool methods that you can only do
lists and not raise like add it to the
beginning of list and of course this
wouldn't be possible if we only treat it
as array so that's why we need to
convert it over to a list to do these
cool methods so now that we got it to a
list you're saying alright well the
thing Bucky is that I actually need that
array to do other stuff such as enhanced
forward loops and stuff like that well
the cool thing about this is once you're
done treating it as a list and doing all
the stuff you want to do you can
actually convert it back to an array so
let's go convert back
to an array little comment right there
and now go ahead and type the array that
you already made stuff stuff and now we
want to set equal to the list and in
order to convert a list to array we use
two array method right there and what
this does is it takes on the list
that you're working with right here and
converts it to an array so parameters go
play new string and put the list dot
size and this is going to be the size of
your rate is equal to the size of your
list
obviously you probably want to do is
every single time so now you converted
your list back to an array so here we
have an array here we converted it to a
list then we did some cool stuff to the
list now with our new and improved list
we converted it back into an array
called stuff don't believe me I'll print
it up so let's go ahead and put four
string x as stuff and this is pretty
much just looping through the array
system out I hate that little insert
thing print F and for our parameters
let's go ahead and just put something
real easy string and X so this is going
to do is pretty much just print out a so
okay and it says first thing babies
water Malan melons fudge pumpkin so
again it took this original one babies
watermelons melons fudge which is here
baby watermelon melons fudge and it
added a first thing to the beginning and
a pumpkin at the end and again it did
that while it is a list and then it
converted it back to an array so that is
how you can convert erase to list and
list back to an array depending on how
you want to treat it what methods you
want to use on it and by using this
technique you can take a collection of
data and you can use both array methods
and list methods on it so I mean with
this information the whole the
world of lists and array is in your
hands feel the power feel the burn thank
