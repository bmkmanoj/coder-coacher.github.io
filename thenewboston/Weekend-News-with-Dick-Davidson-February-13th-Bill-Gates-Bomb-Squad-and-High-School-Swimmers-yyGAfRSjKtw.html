more this week with me your host Dick
davison high school swim coach Kevin
quill was fire last week when it was
learned that he approved the slogan
wetter the better for his girls swim
teams t-shirts the girls were also
forced to wear the shirts inside out by
the school board because they did him
sexually inappropriate and also because
the Chilean used the same slogan last
year important a bomb squad destroyed a
school science project when I got a
report of a suspicious package what's
the science project you might ask a box
containing wires and screws hanging
outside of it with the words marked do
not open on the outside my question is
for the kid could you seriously not
think of anything else better to use I
mean what about which runs faster a bear
or a cheetah and my second question is
to the bomb squad what part of do not
touch do you not understand in a recent
study the average teenager spends up to
one hour and 40 minutes a week looking
at pornographic material this adds up to
be 87 hours a year come on kids that's
weak I look at that much in a day wait
that's right last week and one night
stay went bad but Dominic Fisher decided
to call her name into Wayne realms his
arm with a Stanley knife wait as quoted
as saying I cannot believe she did this
to me and I hate her I went to her house
for sex not to be tattooed I look like
something out of show prison break well
my question way it is how much did you
have the drink tonight and I still don't
understand how the car I guess love
really is skin deep Microsoft founder
Bill Gates at least the jar full
mosquito is last week at a technology
conference to make a point against
malaria you know thank bills releases

neighbors houses in other news a South
