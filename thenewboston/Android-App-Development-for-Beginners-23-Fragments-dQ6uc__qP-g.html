tutorial and in this tutorial what I'm
going to be doing is I want to start
talking to you guys about something
called fragments now a fragment is
actually one of the most important parts
of Android app development because what
it is is essentially it's part of your
activity that you can reuse over and
over and over again really easily so say
that you have this app and it has I
don't know maybe 20 different activities
20 different screens and you want to
create a menu for each one so the user
can navigate around a little bit easier
well if you want to do that then what
you can do is go in each class and
create all the code for the menu home mg
this is going to take forever or what
you can do is you can create this thing
called a fragment which is pretty much
this bit of code that is reusable so
that way once you have the fragment
created you can just stick it inside
every class and you're good to go and
also the benefit of that is say that I
don't know maybe you wanted to change
the color of that menu well if you just
did it the old-fashioned way then you
would say ok let me go back to every
class and change the color of it however
whenever you design a fragment then what
you can do is you can only change the
color in one location and then it's
going to automatically update across all
activities that you use it on pretty
stinking sweet so again an activity or
excuse me a fragment is pretty much part
of your activity that's reusable you can
also have multiple fragments on the same
activity so for example if you want to
have a menu on every screen and I don't
know maybe you're making like a social
networking app and you want to allow the
user to upload an image from a bunch of
different activities then you can have
that fragment on there too so just
remember that you can have multiple
fragments on any activity and actually
in this tutorial what we're going to be
doing is I'm going to be showing you
guys how to make a really simple meme
generator
so you know I know I myself really hate
memes because they're kind of annoying
and you're all over the place but for
this
example it's really easy to demonstrate
because I'm going to be having a single
activity one screen and it's going to
have two fragments on it the top
fragment is going to be where you type
in the text and then click the button
and the bottom fragment is pretty much
going to be the meme so it's going to be
a picture and then it's going to have
the white text on it so again the top
fragment is where you type it in the
bottom fragment is going to be the
picture or the meme so okay that was a
lot of explaining so now let's go ahead
and get started so the very first thing
we need for a meme generator is of
course some picture to meme fi so in
order to be able to add pictures to your
application go over here to Android and
choose project view right here now
expand this oh by the way a purpose you
mentioned I created a brand new project
and I just chose blank activity so
that's where I'm at right here so this
is a brand new project as you guys could
see I named it meme creator but name or
whatever you want so once you're here
again go to project view and expand this
and expand app now inside source right
here you're going to see a folder called
main so expand that and also expand this
re s folder so show you guys alright so
inside here we're going to see a bunch
of different folders in the one we're
just worried about right here is
drawable so for now I know I didn't
really talk to you guys about adding
images to your app but we can add an
image in here and that way we can use
images in our app so again I'll talk
about this all in detail later on again
this is a fragment tutorial I just want
to you know have a picture in there real
quick and someone's texting me for some
reason I think people like wait outside
my house and they look in my windows to
see when I make them at this Oriole and
then everyone just starts texting me
that's what it seems like but of course
for your image what you can do is you
can actually just go online and get any
square picture that you want but I'm
using one from my website it's my
profile picture I'll show you guys what
it is so there it is if you want this
actually if you click the link below it
says my profile then it has a link to it
in the YouTube description then you can
just download this as well but anyways
once you have any square image then take
it and drag it in to that drawable
folder Medscape say okay do you want to
move this file into your project okay I
indeed do and it says okay these files
do not belong to the project the heck
they don't well they do now sucka okay
and check it out so I now have that
Bucky image or square image in my
drawable folder so once I have that
taken care of I can switch back to
Android and of course check it out so
let me just position this a little bit
better alright there we go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
