tutorial and in this lesson what I'm
going to be doing is I'm going to be
going over a few main pieces of the user
interface and also if we have time I'm
going to be giving you guys a detailed
explanation of a cute program and it's
going to give you guys a little more
understanding of what all the pieces
mean so the first thing I want to do is
I want to go over all of these little
icons on the left hand side now what
these things are are called modes and
they're pretty much the different modes
obviously that's why they're called them
that you can go to whenever you're in
the queue creator so the first thing is
of course this queue icon that says
welcome now this is the first thing that
pops up whenever you open the program
and it's pretty much just the homescreen
it gives all you know a couple examples
on the news like the latest news on the
right hand side um let's see you can
open projects create projects it's
pretty much a typical home home screen
nothing really that important here we're
not going to be spending a lot of time
here
now under that we have this little kind
of looks like a piece of paper the Edit
icon now the Edit icon is pretty much a
text editor and it's where we're going
to be spending most of the time writing
the C++ code now you can also if you go
ahead and click edit with another file
selected not C++ file you can also edit
um XML files but what we're going to be
concerned with is mostly the C++ so
whenever we need a hard code and edit
the crap this is where we're going to be
spending most of our time in here now if
you ever click on a UI file that means
user interface and that's going to take
you to this mode right here which is the
design mode now obviously this is a you
know there's a lot of stuff in here all
the widgets on the left hand side pretty
much this is where you can see visually
what your GUI is going to look like and
it gives you a little more um I don't
know it's just that whenever you're
coding everything and laying everything
out it's sometimes hard to picture in
your head so it's a lot easier just you
know drag the widgets on the screen but
anyways the design is where you can
visually see what's going on with your
and the rest of these are kind of
self-explanatory the debug mode is where
you go whenever you want to of course
fix some bugs hopefully we won't be
spending too much time in here the
projects is all of your project settings
and aside from that aside from like your
main project settings like I don't know
what version of queue and I don't know
stuff about your compiler you can also
change your editor settings if you want
to so in order to do that just go ahead
to editor settings and go to custom and
you can you know if you don't like the
way your editor looks you can do that
but I like mine at the default so I'm
not going to mess with that now under
this you have analyze and whenever you
want to kind of um take a look at the
memory how how things are being utilized
it just helps optimize your program
maybe make it run a little faster and
more efficiently we can go over to here
and last but not least we have the help
section now queue actually has really
awesome help section and basically you
guys already know help is it has all the
documentation I think it has some
frequently asked questions somewhere yep
right there you know all the glossary
and all the technical stuff as well mine
anyway so that's what all of the modes
on the left-hand side means so hopefully
you're a little more familiar with them
now however I want to mention couple
more things about this edit mode now
whenever you're in the edit mode like I
said it's a text editor but aside from
that we have this well right now it's
pretty much your list of project files
folders everything that's in your
project now this is the default view
this little projects right here but you
can also switch it - I don't know file
system if you just want to view all your
files but I like keeping projects open
but another cool thing that you can do
is if you're like oh I I can't decide if
I want to view it like this or you know
maybe view the file system what you can
do is you can actually click this icon
called split and whenever you do that it
gives you two of them pretty much splits
the screen so you can have the top one
as this little hierarchy of folders and
files and
bottom-1 of all your individual files so
you know that's just a neat little tip
and well that's it in again this is
probably a pretty self-explanatory but
if you ever want to get rid of this then
you can just go ahead and close one and
then close the other but I am probably
just going to keep this one open because
it's easy for you guys to see when
watching these tutorials the hierarchy
of where all my files are in
relationship to my folders so um
everything else actually about the user
interface we're just actually going to
cover that as we need them because if I
go ahead and talk about all the
different pieces about the different
modes we aren't even there yet learning
it so I think it's better to cover it as
we get to it it'll make more sense that
way so in the next tutorial we are
finally you know going to be done
covering the user interface and we're
going to start typing some code I
thought I was going to have time in this
tutorial but I don't so that's what
we're going to be doing in the next
tutorial thank you guys for watching
