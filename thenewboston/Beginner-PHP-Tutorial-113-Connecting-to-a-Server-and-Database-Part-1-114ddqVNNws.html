and this is a PHP video tutorial for the
new Boston now in this tutorial I'm
going to be demonstrating to you how
we're going to connect to a MySQL
database in some of my previous
tutorials we've gone through creating
our database which we've named a
underscore database we've also looked at
privileges with insight so we've i've
explained that we've got our user names
here and everything if we just go back
to home in general and we click
privileged privileges sorry we can add a
new user but for now i'm using root on
localhost with no password so i'm going
to show you how we can connect to our
database first of all and then select
this database that we've named a
underscore database so this is our page
that we're going to preview everything
on now the first thing to do is to call
the MySQL connect function and this is
written like this MySQL underscore
Connect and because it's a function
obviously we've got parentheses in there
now this takes three and typically three
arguments we're looking at one two three
here so I'll set this up the first
argument is the host name so this is
going to be localhost the second is the
username so we've already established
this is Alex and I don't actually have a
password so I'm going to leave this
blank but I'm still specifying it there
okay so how can we make this a bit
better and a bit more easier to specify
everything I'm actually going to use
variables so I'm going to say a MySQL
host equals localhost MySQL user equals
Alex and MySQL Paz equals nothing so I'm
going to substitute these values in
so it's taking the values that I've
specified up there and then just popping
them into this function okay so let's
run this script to see what happens okay
so um right okay sorry yeah the the
username is not Alex
it is root let's just pop back to my PHP
myadmin and have a look at that you can
see that it we've got the username of
root there so I suppose this is a good
example now to look at what error we've
returned so we've got warning MySQL
Connect
access denied for user Alex obviously
because there's no user called Alex
using password now so let's refresh
again this time we've got nothing up so
we can assume that everything has
connected properly so what happens if we
don't correct from connect properly now
let's just change this back to Alex
again so no no user called Alex exists
and we refresh the page we've got this
error up here now let's say we were
running a live website and this this
some error was returned to the user this
isn't the kind of error that we want to
show to a user and if we've incorrectly
specified a username or password
inside of our code so what I'm going to
do is at the end of this I'm going to
use a logical operator or and remember
this can be written like that with two
horizontal lines but I'm going to say or
and after that I'm going to say die
so this either connects and doesn't
return an error or if it does return an
error we died and we can print our own
error message out to the user so could
not connect to database so um or could
not connect in general
now we're going to be introducing other
functions and the other function to
connect to the database itself so we've
connected to the server like this then
we want to select a database so I'm
going to take this out here and put a
general error and I'm going to call that
con underscore error and above here I'm
going to write con error equals could
all could not connect just in general so
or die con error now let's have a look
at the preview of that so we remember
we've got the user name here as Alex and
that's wrong so if we refresh we get
this could not connect now you can also
see that we've got this warning come up
here as well so we can either result we
can resolve this in two ways we can use
error reporting or we can simply pop an
app symbol before that then when we
refresh you can see it just shows could
not connect
so the app symbol will will basically
take away the default error reporting
from PHP just on this line so we've
connected to our database successfully
well we haven't at the moment but let's
just type in root and down here I'm
going to say echo connected up a bit
more and we can refresh so now we're
saying connected because we're not
killing the page at this point because
we've connected so we are going to run
this line we're going to change this a
bit later on so it's a bit more with
structured a bit better so the next
thing we want to is select our database
now remember the database is called a
underscore database so let's go back to
our let's go back to PHP writing our
code and I'm going to say MySQL select
dB so we're using underscores to
separate this and then we just take one
argument here and we are taking a
underscore database so again we can make
this a bit better and under here we can
say it more SQL DB
equals a underscore database and we can
just substitute that variable in there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
