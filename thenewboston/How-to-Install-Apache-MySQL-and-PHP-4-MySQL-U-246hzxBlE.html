tutorial and now that we have a patchy
in PHP setup the last thing that we need
to do is download my SQL and get that
baby up and running so if you go to this
website dev my SQL comm / downloads this
is where you get all the crap that you
need and what we are looking for is this
link MySQL community server so click
that and if you scroll all the way to
the bottom you can see it says Windows
and mess ql installer MSI click download
and if you have a couple options of
course we want the bigger one because we
want all the crap download this one
windows x86 32-bit MSI installer should
be around 235 megabytes and actually
have it downloaded already so I don't
want to download it again and another
thing is you can't download this without
having a Oracle account or maybe it's
called a MySQL account I don't even know
but they're free to make so if you click
this it's going to take you to an
account page just created an account
real quick and then you can download my
SQL installer so I can actually close
out of this and once you have that
downloaded it's going to be in your
downloads file it's going to be an MSF
MSI file so just double click that and
it's going to get things up and running
so run close out of that and let me talk
you guys through all the settings that
you need
doo-doo-doo-doo ok yes I will allow it
hurry the frig up you stupid son of a
laptop one second it's better remaining
one second for at least 10 seconds now
Holi tomahto
finally alright so go through all that
crap in on your welcome screen of course
you want to choose install MySQL
products and let me read through this
one okay I read all those I agree next
and right here you don't need to check
anything you can just execute it in
oh sorry you got freaking black along
and what this is going to do is just
check to make sure you have the most
recent recent recent version of
everything that's what I'm trying to say
so just click next after that and oh
right here what we want to do is we want
to select full now all these other ones
if you don't if this is your first time
then just choose full the other crap is
you know lets you tweak some other stuff
and also includes crap that you don't
need but fulle is what we want sweet
spot right in the middle so select full
click next and of course just execute
all that and let it do its thing and of
course yeah yeah I read that yeah I
freaking hit it alright so finish next
execute its gonna you know you guys
probably could figure it all this out
but bubble bubble bubble pop bubble
bubble pop pop alright is this freaking
thing re so once all those are finally
done and this one failed but you know
what are we going to do just go ahead
and click next next and for this
selection right here server
configuration type just go ahead and
make sure you have development machine
selected and that just means that we're
developing applications on our local
computer we're not using it for anything
else right now
so next and now for a password just
choose a simple password that you can
remember
and my pastor is weak I'll show you weak
my SQL and just go ahead and click Next
and alright everything is looking good
to go next and Wow
more crap really hmm don't maybe we'll
go ahead and watch bubble pop again next
next and it's Oh make sure that you have
this little checkbox start MySQL
workbench after setup so when you
collect finish it pretty much opens up
and this is your MySQL workbench
now that get things started you can just
go ahead and click this little box right
here and this is your local instance and
whatever password you entered 26 okay
and check this out it is started it
kicked off and it's running as a service
now if you want to go ahead and manage
everything then you can go to your
control panel
and if you type services and hit enter
you can click this little link under
administrator to tools and it will allow
you to view your local services and
these are all of the services that are
running on your computer right now so if
you go down to lalala right here MySQL
56 you can verify that it is indeed
running and if you ever want to stop it
or it is stopped and you want to start
it again
then remember control panel control
panel services and view local services
this is where you can manage that you
can also tweak it um well I won't go get
in all that but this is where you can
manage it to start stop pause do
whatever you want so close out of that
and oh guys congratulations you just
setup Apache PHP in MySQL they say SQL
SQL cannot talk today so uh yeah I mean
congratulations if you have any
questions about anything then you can
ask me on my forum and I'll also put a
link below arm so you know if you guys

browser bar
