really fun node.js stuff I want to
explain one more concept that seems to
confuse a lot of people and that is the
idea of prototyping now you guys are
going to come across this a lot in
nodejs so I figured I might as well take
a tutorial and explain the pretty much
the bare-bones basics of what
prototyping is so essentially what
prototyping gives you the ability to do
is you can add cool methods or
properties to your objects and classes
so say that we're making a game and the
first thing we need in the game is a
couple users so I don't know what's
every user have will say a like a name
and a life will say that they can like
fight each other whatever so this name
which is set equal to blank by default
and again remember that this keyword
refers to whatever object is calling it
whatever thing is calling this so now we
can actually have a bunch of different
instances of user each one can have
their own name so we can have a Bucky a
Wendy a tuna McGee a bunch of different
users so yeah there you go simple enough
and we'll just give them each a life to
start out of like 100 points or 100 life
or whatever so by default we thought it
was a good idea if users could give each
other life I don't know maybe they're
hurt or something so we'll say that this
give life equals a new function called
give life and of course you need a
target player so for example if my
friend Wendy was hurt I could give her a
life and I don't know if she had like
ten life now she would have eleven if
she had 17 she would have a teen
whatever so how do we do that pretty
easy target player life plus equal one
and might as well just print something
out console.log I'll say uh like after I
give a life to Wendy I'll say Bucky gave
one life to Wendy so of course
this name which would be whatever called
this function which would be in this
case lucky gave one life to not game one
life gave one life to target player dots
name all right
so whenever I give a life to Wendy it's
going to say Bucky since I called give
life gave one life to the target player
and of course it would increase her life
by one nothing that revolutionary right
there so now that we got our basic user
class out of the way let's actually go
ahead and start making some users so
Bucky equals new user and var1 d equals
new user all right we have two years but
remember whenever we create a new user
they don't have any name they have a
default life of 100 but their name is
blank so let's set their name right now
and that is Bucky dot name set equals
Bucky and Wendy dot name set this equal
to Wendy all right so now we have two
users and they both have names let me
tighten that up a titbit and check it
out so we start playing the game or
whatever and I decide right off the bat
that I want to give a life to Wendy
might as well she's my friend nothing
else to do in this game
so Bucky dot give life to Wendy all
right looking pretty cool and just to
verify um you know just to look at our
different lives right after what I'm
going to do is I'm going to print out
our life so we'll say that like a
bucky I'll print out my life and then
hers Wendy and Wendy life all right so
we start playing and check it out right
off the bat I give one life to Wendy my
life is still 100 in her life is 101
easy enough simple enough to understand
what the heck is a prototype I still
don't quite get that concept so I give
this game to my boss who wants the
greatest game ever and he's like you
know what Bucky this is a pretty cool
game however wouldn't it be cool if
instead of just giving life to your
friends because that's kind of boring
wouldn't be cool if users could actually
start hurting each other because hurting
people is always fun right so I'm like
you know what that would be kind of cool
so I'm going to make a new function
called uppercut and whenever you
uppercut someone it takes three points
away from them so what you can do
through prototypes is this if you call
user prototype right there you can
actually put something called uppercut
of course I make an uppercut up you can
put whatever variable name you want you
can set this equal to a new uppercuts
function so now target player is going
to pretty much work the same so actually
let me just copy all this all right
so instead of giving one to them let's
take away I make it upper cutting
someone I think takes away three lives
of them and then we'll say gave one life
to will change that to just uppercut at
heart so what we can do is we can pretty
much use prototypes to add additional
methods or functions onto this user
object or this user class so now every
instant
of this user class has access to this
new cool uppercut function don't believe
me we'll check this out I gave a life to
wendy before she for some reason hates
when i give life to her maybe she just
hates me I don't know so she decides to
uppercut me so Wendy dot uppercut
Bucky alright that was a very cool now
let's just print out their lives again
so check this out I'm gonna run this bad
boy
I gave one life to Wendy she got ticked
off for some reason she uppercutted me
it took three points away from me and
she still has the life I gave her so you
know she's kind of a little turd nugget
but whatever so again that's one concept
of prototyping what we can do is we can
add special methods or properties to
objects in classes in other words our
user class so this was an example of
adding a function by the way if I ever
say method or function arm they're
pretty much the same thing in this
tutorial
although they technically are different
I know so don't you know leave a
thousand comments art so I give this to
my boss and he's like this is awesome I
love hurting people uppercutting is
always you know humorous however I think
we got a spice this game up a little bit
more we actually want to add magic to
every user so in addition to adding
functions like I said you can also take
that user class and through prototyping
you can call if I type Google got the
hiccups now great you can add a new
property called magic and we'll set
every user's magic to like 60 by default
so now let me just console.log this out
Bucky dot magic
this is gonna log out 60 for every user
I just want to demonstrate that and
console.log Wendy dot magic so let me
add a comment real quick I'll say um in
at properties the objects and I also say
you can add functions all right so I'm
print this out to show you guys what it
works all right so this was before and
now we see whenever we print out
Bucky's magic and Wendy's magic they
both have 60 so there you go that is
pretty much what prototyping is now the
last thing you may be wondering is this
alright so I know that with prototyping
what you can do is you can add functions
and properties to objects but why the
heck would you do it this way when you
can just build everything right inside
here it seems like it would be a much
better option does it really make sense
right now however in the future that's
what I'm going to explain because this
tutorials are already 10 minutes long
and I'm worried about when the
uppercutting me again so anyways for now
now they understand the basics of it
then guys for watching don't forget
