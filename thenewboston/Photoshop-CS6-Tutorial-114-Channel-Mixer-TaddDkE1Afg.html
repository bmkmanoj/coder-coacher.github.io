buddy Blackford here with the new Boston
YouTube channel and we're going to go
over channel mixer adjustment in
Photoshop cs6 so the channel mixer
adjustment is a great way to adjust
individual color channels for making an
image or I mean or making an image
conversion to black and white and it's
better than just going to image mode
grayscale where it just makes it grey
and you don't have any other adjustment
to it so let's go back I just hit
control Z let's go to image adjustments
and then a channel mixer the first thing
I want to show you is the greyscale
conversion and how it's more advanced
and just going change it into a black
and white bit photo let's go click on
here down to monochrome that's going to
change it to grayscale now you can see
when you click on that the preset goes
to custom and the output channel goes to
grey before it was on red but now it's
on grey and that's the only one that you
can pick now we can adjust the different
color channels on here because pretty
much color channels are different shades
of grey and we can darken or lighten up
specific parts of the of the area since
since the sky was pretty much blue and
the water was blue when I start
adjusting that the sky is going to get
really bright if I increase the blue etc
like that now keep an eye on your total
down here when you go past a hundred
percent you're going to get a little
exclamation point that lets you know
that you're past a hundred percent so I
can start messing with these and get a
more advanced looking I have more
control over my monochrome image my
grayscale image so that's one thing that
I wanted to show you we can hold down
all and this will change to reset click
on that in my phone's below novel
Chisholm I need to turn that off
sometime and let's go over our different
output channels here so we I picked this
image because I thought it would be good
to make like a Sun setting kind of fee
because what looks more cool than pretty
much a sunset on the beach so let's go
ahead and keep our I'm going to keep my
output channel to red and I'm going to
move up the red a little bit and it
looks starting to look like more like a
sunset going on there now I can try this
with my other channels as well to see if
there is a better looking effect let me
reset the red let's go to our blue
Channel move the Reds up a little bit
and you can see that when I add the blue
add red to the blue channel it turns
more of like purpley and that's not what
I wanted I'll reset go to the green
we'll try it in the green and you can
see it didn't work there either
so what I wanted to stick with is the
Reds and this gives me a nice sunset
looking effect now keep an eye down here
to your totals again when you go over a
hundred percent the little marker will
show that reset and there are a couple
presets here that help us out we've got
our different filters and these all get
changed to black and white and one of
the main things that the channel mixer
is used for is creating black and white
images so if I change this to green
filter I mean you obviously don't see
any green because it's a grayscale image
now but it has added a hundred percent
error kept a hundred percent of the
green in there if I put this to zero you
can see the difference well obviously
you can definitely see the difference
there so let's check the other ones so
this is you would have to put another
one up to 100% so if I put this up to
100% and then this one to zero this is
the red filter so you can see that this
part is darker so let's just go through
and look at some of them here's a blue
you can see how the the grayscale image
is different different from each other
so that's green here's orange but you
can go through these presets and get
these different grayscale images and
pick from which one you like the best to
put on
to whatever you're using so that's the
channel mixer it's good for making
advanced grayscale images and just
adding or subtracting some of the
individual color channels so that's it
