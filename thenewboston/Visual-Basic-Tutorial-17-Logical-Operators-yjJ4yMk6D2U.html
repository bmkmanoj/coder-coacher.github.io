slash online gamer for the new boston
and in this tutorial we're going to be
taking a look at logical operators now
basically what logical operators are is
let's say you're using an if statement
so you want to do if this number is
equal to a certain value or this number
is equal to a different value then go
ahead and do whatever is in the if
statement now the or in that would be
considered a logical operator you can
also use the and operator so let's say
if this number is less than a certain
value and another number is less than a
certain value then go ahead and do
whatever is in that code so let's go
ahead and make a little demo program for
this it's going to be similar to the
login ones that I've done before so
let's go and get started we're going to
go ahead and declare our username and
password so dim username as string now
we'll set it equal to nothing and now
we're going to make our password so dim
password as a string and we're going to
set that equal to nothing too so just in
case they don't type anything okay so
now what we're going to do is we're
going to prompt our user to enter in
their username console.writeline what is
your name and now what we want to do is
we want to store their name of course
so username equals console dot readline
now we're just going to ask them for
their password so we'll do console dot
write line what is your password
and we'll do password equals console
getline or dot readline sorry okay so
now that we've prompted the user to
enter their name and password and we
have stored both their name and the
password in variables we want to test
those to see if we're going to let the
user in so we're going to start off by
creating an if statement you're going to
type if username equals Sam then go
ahead and do this so now what we're
going to do is we're going to add an or
operator to this now to add an or
operator you're going to go ahead and
just type the keyword or capital o
lowercase R so if username equals Sam or
username equals Tim not time Tim then go
ahead and do this so let's just go ahead
and print that out so we can see what
happens
so console dot write line hello and then
we'll just add their username and then
we'll go ahead and console dot read line
so we have time to read the line before
it closes ok it'll say what is your name
and if I type in Sam it'll say what is
your password I can type in whatever I
want to here it'll say hello Sam now if
I had typed Tim it will say hello Tim
but if I type anything else then nothing
will show up so now what we want to do
is we want to test to see if their
username is correct or the password name
i mean if their username is correct and
that password is correct so to do this
let's just go ahead and close this in
parenthesis so this is going to be its
own separate part of the the if
statement now this may be a little
confusing to you but if you just go
ahead and practice this after this
you'll understand it so if username
equals sam or username equals Tim and
then the and operator is just capital a
and D and you will see that highlights
blue now this is very simple in other
languages you got some
symbols for the and and or operator like
the or operator and C++ for example will
be that right there
but in Visual Basic since it's such a
high-level language it's a very close to
English it's very easy to write code and
learn fast
so if username equals Sam or username
equals Tim and password equals the new
Boston then we're going to go ahead and
tell them that they have access by just
saying hello and their username so
basically what this does is if anything
in here is true so if this part is true
and password equals the new Boston is
true so if username equals Sam is true
or username equals Tim is true then this
whole part right here is going to be
equal to true and then and password
equals the new Boston so this whole part
has to equal true and password equals
the new Boston has to equal true now
this might be a little confusing to you
but um just just try to figure it out
the best you can if you have any
questions leave them in the comments so
if these to stay if these two conditions
are true then go ahead and let them in
and now let's go ahead and type in else
and we'll say console dot write line
access not granted so if we run this
program type what is your name I'll say
I'll just say Sam and then I'll type the
New Boston it'll say hello Sam
now let's go ahead and run this again
and you can see that I'll work with Tim
to so name is Tim password is the new
Boston and it will say hello Tim we've
been granted access
but if anything is not true so let's say
we don't type either Sam or Tim so we
type Joe and then we type the password
the new Boston even though the password
is correct it's going to say access not
granted because the name has to be
correct it has to be either Sam or Joe
and the password has to be equal to the
New Boston
so I go ahead and practice and make some
programs yourself with some logical
operators and once you've got logical
operators nailed down go ahead and move
on to the next tutorials and thanks for
