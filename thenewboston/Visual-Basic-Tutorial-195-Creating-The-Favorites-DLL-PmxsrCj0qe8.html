slash online gamer from the new boston
and in this tutorial we're going to
create a class library based on our
favorite saw BB web favorite BB and web
favorite collection now before we get
started I just want to give full credit
to the writers of beginning Microsoft
Visual Basic 2008 they did a great job
of making this program it is written by
Kieran Willis and Brian Newsome so let's
go ahead and get started so what we need
to do to create a class library is we'll
come over here to file and we need to
add a new project so we're going to
select a class library and we'll just
name it
internet favorites and then we'll go
ahead and click OK so you can see here
over in our solution Explorer we have
favorites viewer you do and then we have
our internet favorites class library so
let's just go ahead and right click on
this and set it as the start up project
now here you can see it generated a
class 1 dot VB for us and we're gonna be
getting rid of rid of that soon so we'll
take a web favorite collection we'll
right-click it and we'll copy it and
we'll just come down here and we need to
paste it under internet favorites so
we'll select paste now you can't see
that but if you right click there will
be an option to paste it so now that we
have one in there let's go ahead and
delete class 1 dot V B so now we have
width favorite web favorite collection
VB so we'll copy over web favorite so
copy it select internet favorites and
then paste it and now we'll copy
favorites so copy favorites select
internet favorites and then just go
ahead and paste it
okay so now we pasted favor saw BB web
favorite dot VB and web favorite
collection down in our internet
favorites class library project so we'll
right click on internet favorites and we
will click build so it's gonna run
through the process and let's see here
we have an error message box is not
declared so what we need to do is we
need to use an import statement so let's
find out where this is we'll double
click on this error and you can see here
that it is in the favorites class so
what we need to do is we need to import
windows dot or system dot Windows or C
so it looks like that we cannot import
system that windows soft forms so what
we need to do is select internet
favorites we will come up here to
project and we will add a reference so
we'll go to dotnet and we'll find system
dot windows dot forms we'll go ahead and
click OK and now if we go ahead and use
imports system dot windows forms it will
let us use our message box top so now
let's find the other occurrence of this
error so we'll need to import system not
windows dot forms so in order for us to
use a message box in a class library
we're going to have to import we're
gonna have to reference a deal a DLL for
system dot windows off forms and we'll
have to import it so now we'll go ahead
and try to build it again and you can
see that says build succeeded so let's
go into our internet favorites we'll go
to bin and then release you can see here
is our internet they
it's dll now yours will probably have a
different icon because my icon is set to
open with ILS il spy so here's our
internet favorites DLL and we can use
this in creating new applications now
whenever we want to be able to access
our internet favorites and get the names
and the URLs and store them in a
collection</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
