triangles in general and how their sides
relate to one another but today we're
just going to talk about special kinds
of right triangles that have a different
association so on the sauce alize right
triangle and remember an isosceles
triangle has two congruent sides which
would be this one in this one so that
they have the same length so we're just
going to call that length a well they're
hypotenuse which is a cross from the
right angle is equal to that side times
the square root of two so that means
that this length is square root of two
so let's do an example we have this
triangle and this angle is 45 degrees so
that means that using our Pythagorean
theorem 45 plus 90 plus x equals 180
that x has to equal 45 notnot side x
just this at angle X so that means that
this and we know that this is anas also
use right triangle that this is
congruent to this so that means that
side x is equal to 4 and we're trying to
find what y is equal to and why is the
hypotenuse so we follow our rule and we
take 4 and multiply it by the square
root of two to get the length of Y so y
equals 4 square roots of 2
so now we're going to talk about another
kind of triangle that has its own
special rules as well it's called a 30
60 90 triangle and these numbers right
here are the measures of the angles so
it's a right triangle so it has to have
a 90 degree angle which is right here
and this angle thirty degrees in this
angle 60 degrees so this length right
here is just a this hypotenuse is two
times this side this side is a times the
square root of three and we're going to
use those to find out what the length of
each side of the right triangle so we
know that this side is equal to five so
that means so that means that this angle
is equal to 30 degrees so the side
opposite the 30-degree angle is five the
side of opposite the 60-degree angle
which is y is equal to a square roots of
3 so right now a is equal to 5 because
this side is equal to 5 so we're going
to take five and multiply it by the
square root of three to find out what y
equals so y equals 5 square roots of 3
and then we know that this side is equal
to two times a which is
so we just take 2 times 5 which is 10 so
that means X is equal to 10 and those
are the two special kinds of right
triangles make sure to watch the next
video where we're going to take all this
information and use it to do right
triangle trigonometry</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
