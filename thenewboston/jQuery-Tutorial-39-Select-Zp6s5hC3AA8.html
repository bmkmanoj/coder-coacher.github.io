with a video tutorial for the new Boston
in this tutorial we're going to look at
the select jQuery event handler and
we're going to be creating a text area
which allows us to type and select text
once we've selected text jQuery is going
to catch this event and it's going to
alert something back to us inside of a
div okay so the first thing we're going
to do is create the text area then we're
going to create our external javascript
file that's going to handle this event
okay so I'm creating a text with a type
of an input field with the type of text
and I need to give this an ID so we can
reference it in jQuery I'm just going to
call this sum underscore text
I'm then going to create a span with an
ID as well and this is going to have the
value of sum underscore feedback now
once we type some text into the text
area and then highlight it like so some
text some feedback is going to produce
some text for us so we're using a span
to feedback some text okay so let's go
ahead and create our external javascript
file I'm just going to create a new
document in my text editor and inside my
J's folder I'm going to call this select
Jas so we need to include select Jas
into our page so I can simply go ahead
and copy this here and paste it here and
then just change this to select Jas
now that we've included select Jas we
can start to write our code beforehand
let's just preview this in our browser
you can see that we just have a symbol
text field we can type something in here
and then we can go ahead and select
something and once we have finished our
selection will have the span
just give us some text out here letting
us know that we've selected the text now
first of all the reason you might
incorporate this method into a text area
for an example for an example if you are
allowing your user to type some text and
then they want you want to be notified
or notify the user or some back-end
functionality when they've selected text
for example
changing font color if you're using if
you're creating some kind of text editor
there's a variety of options for this
select event handler and I'll leave that
up to you to implement into your own
website okay so in select is we need to
reference our text area which is hash
text or some text we then need to append
on the event handler which is select and
inside these parentheses we need to
create a function and that function is
obviously going to have a block which we
will start to execute code here so once
we've actually selected something inside
of some text which is our text field
here then we will be able to create you
know some something here that lets the
user know that they've selected text so
obviously this is just an example okay
so we're going to reference some
feedback which is our span and we're
going to apply some HTML to this span
using the HTML jQuery function so inside
of here we can just type something has
been selected so let's return to our
browser and refresh the page and let's
go ahead and type something in here when
we start to select something and then
release you can see that something has
been selected so we've created the event
handler and successfully relayed some
information to the user however I did
speak about some uses for this
functionality if you'd like to create
some kind of functionality to actually
grab the text that has been current
currently selected you can do this so
head over to Google and Google around
for this and you'll be able to find a
function that let you return the text
that's currently selected in the text
box however I'm not going to cover this
in tutorial because this has just been
how to actually use the event handler to
check if something has been selected</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
