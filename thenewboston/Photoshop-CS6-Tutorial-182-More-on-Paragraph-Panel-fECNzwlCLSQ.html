Blackford here with another Photoshop
cs6 tutorial and today in this tutorial
we're going to be working with the
paragraph panel so the paragraph panel
gives you control over the text in a
paragraph and it's right next to the
character panel usually so if you open
up this little paragraph icon here
that's how you get the paragraph panel
and then stop there you go to window
paragraph so the paragraph panel doesn't
have a whole lot of different things in
it but it actually just has just like a
few things that are just pretty much
pertain to paragraphs and I'll go over
those with you so go ahead and make a
paragraph by clicking and dragging with
your type tool and then you want to just
track type some things I'm gonna have to
make a bigger paragraph text box so let
me do that let's hide it hide some stuff
so if I have my textbook click in here I
see my text box a paragraph I can resize
that and I'm just typing in some stuff
here and that's probably good so I just
talked about thought of this off the top
of my hats now something like I had
premeditated as I was doing it so let's
go over the different stuff that's going
on in our paragraph panel so we've got
our justification in these first three
boxes right here know the justification
is the pretty much the methods that you
can use to align your paragraph so if
you click on the left
it'll align your paragraph to the left
if you Center it and then here's a
couple other justified these are mainly
used for like news articles these ones
over here on the right and then this
is totally justified at the end let's go
down here and we've got our indent
before our left margin and if I bring
that in you can see that everything's
getting indented more you know back to
zero you can see how it goes back over
here on the right is the indent the
right margin so it's going to do the
opposite and this one right here is the
indent in the first line bring that up
it's going to indent the first line like
that hey zero bring it back to where it
was the next one below here we've got
space before paragraphs and then we have
space after paragraphs so if I let's
bring this in like that
I haven't made any paragraphs but I can
and all you have to do to make a
paragraph is just basically hit Enter we
just do blah blah blah whatever that is
bring this back in and then if I adjust
the space between paragraphs you can see
that this bottom line down here is
working a little bit better and then
after paragraph let's see how that works
and I would need some more paragraphs
but you get to hit on this one it's
going to add space after a paragraph so
we would do it after this one that I
decided so you can do that then we've
got this button right here but you
probably had checked hyphenate if I do
that if I start bringing this in a
little it's probably going to end up
hyphenating some of the words for us
some of the larger words let me try
something like this and bring some of
these words together to maybe just one
word and see if it's gonna hyphenate
them for us
mm-hmm of course it's not the easiest
thing to do here well pretty much oh I
don't have the - they checked that's why
there goes that was my bed sorry about
that now we get hyphens on that
hyphenated words when they get to the
edge of the paragraph box so you can see
how that works like that and that's a
basically all there is to know about the
paragraphs and the paragraph panel and
pretty easy to work with and know you
know really how to use it so thanks a
lot for watching tutorial and sticking
with it and I hope you guys have a good
day have a good one everyone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
