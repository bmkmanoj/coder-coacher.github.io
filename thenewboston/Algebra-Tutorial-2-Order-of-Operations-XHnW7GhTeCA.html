order of operations and an operation is
just what you do to the numbers so we
follow the order PEMDAS or please excuse
my dear Aunt Sally which stands for
parentheses so we do with inside
parentheses first so three plus five is
eight and then excuse which deals with
exponents where we would solve this
second so to the to the third is 8
multiplication and division which come
which go together
multiplication isn't always before
division what determines it is if I had
2 times 5 divided by 2 I would I start
coming from the left and I do what
appears first so I would do 2 times 5
just 10 divided by 2 which is 5 but if
it came this way and it was 2 divided by
4 times 5 I would do division first 8
divided by 4 which is 2 times 5 equals
10 so these two sometimes you don't have
multiplication so sometimes you have to
do division first
or sometimes multiplication comes up
first so that's how we determine those
two but we do multiplication or division
after exponents so we'd get 2 times 5 is
10 and then 8 divided by 4 which is 2
and then the same thing goes for
addition and subtraction it just depends
on which shows up first which you do
what which one you do first so in 4 plus
3 which is 7 8 minus 1 which is 7 and
then so we're gonna use this order
please excuse my dear Aunt Sally to
solve some long equations
so for each one of these we're gonna
follow our order of operations so first
we do parentheses but in this first
problem there are no parentheses so we
don't have to worry about that next we
do multiple excuse me we do exponents
but again we don't have any exponents so
we don't have to worry about that
next comes multiplication or division so
we start coming we start here and since
division shows up first we're gonna do
that 2/5 or excuse me 25 divided by 5
which is 5 and then I'm gonna rewrite
the rest of this I like to do it one
step at a time at first because until
you get really good at using your order
of operations it helps keep everything
straight in your head so next we're
gonna we're still doing multiplication
and division so 5 times 4 is 20 and
we're gonna copy this down I'm still on
multiplication and a division and since
I still have one more multiplication I'm
gonna do that first so 20 minus 15 times
8 which is 120 so 20 minus 120 gives me
a negative 100 okay so for this next one
we have these things out here which are
called brackets and a bracket separates
a part of an equation from another part
of equation so what we do first for this
one is the thing inside the parentheses
so 12 divided by we're gonna leave our
brackets up 8 divided by 2 which is 4
times 3 divided by 3 which is 1 and we
leave those in the brackets so the
brackets are just another form of
parentheses which separates a whole part
of an equation from another part so now
what we do is what's inside brackets
first so 4 times 1 which gives us 4 and
now we can do our
exponents but we don't have any so then
we go to multiplication and division and
the only thing left is division so then
we do twelve divided by four and we get
three so for this last one I have for
you it's kind of tricky okay so when we
solve this one we're gonna treat the top
and the bottom like two separate
equations and then our very last step is
going to be actually dividing the top by
the bottom so we're gonna do order of
operations for the top and the bottom
separately so for order of operations
first for the top we have parenthesis
but there are no parentheses and there
aren't any exponents so then we go to
multiplication and division so the first
thing that shows up is multiplication so
we do 3 times 2 which is 6 and then I'm
going to read rewrite the whole top okay
and I'm gonna do my order of operations
on the bottom two our first step it
would be parentheses which we don't have
and next is exponents so 3 squared is 9
plus 2 squared is 4 plus 1 squared is 1
so then we're going to start with the
top again what comes after our
multiplication well division or
multiplication depending on what comes
up first since division comes up first
we're going to divide 6 divided by 6 so
we get 1 plus 2 times 3 divided by 6
over and our next step for the bottom is
gonna be addition since that's the only
thing that's left so and since addition
is commutative we can do all this
addition at once so 9 plus 4 which is 13
plus 1 which is 14 now I still got some
work to do on the top I can't finish
this completely yet so the next thing
I'm still on multiplication and division
the next thing that shows up is
multiplication so 1 plus 2 times 3 which
is 6 divided by 6 over 14
so we're zone multiplication and
division and we're gonna get one plus 6
divided by 6 which is 1 over 14 if we do
our last step on the top which is
addition we're gonna get 2 over 14 and
we're gonna reduce this fraction we're
not actually gonna divide it and get a
decimal we're gonna leave it as a
fraction just because it's easier but I
can reduce this by twos 2 goes into 2
once 2 goes into 14 seven times the
final answer is 1/7 so that's all of our
review for of operations just remember
the phrase please excuse my dear Aunt
Sally
every time we're going to solve an
equation but make sure you come back and
watch your next video which is going to
be on opposites and absolute values</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
