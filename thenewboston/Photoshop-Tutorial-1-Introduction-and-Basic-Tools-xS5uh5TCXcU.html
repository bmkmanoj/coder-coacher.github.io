tutorial and Photoshop in these
tutorials I'm going to be teaching you
every single thing that you want to know
about Photoshop I'm going to be starting
with a very very basics and I'm going to
be moving into some very advanced topics
I'm going to try to give you as much
detail as I can in these tutorials and
tell you everything you need to know so
before you get started in Photoshop
before you started working everything
let's just get to know our way around
Photoshop so we have it open right now
and as you can see to the left side of
the screen right here these are all the
tools and this is what we're going to be
learning today you can either view them
as a single row or if you click this
little two triangles right here you can
view them as a double row at the top of
your screen right here you have the menu
bar now this is just like any other menu
bar in any other program you have all
your basic functions like save open new
copy/paste as well as some other more
advanced ones we'll get into that more
later
the right side of the screen you have
what is called the palettes now this is
what makes Photoshop different than any
other image editing program these are
for the MOE more advanced topics and
we'll give them these later on and it's
toriel's and in the middle of course you
have the image window
this is for the space for whatever image
you're working on and right now I open
up this image right here just a display
what all the tools will do so let's
start the first tool that we need is
called the move tool is a very first
tool and if we click it we can see what
it does the move tool does exactly like
the name says you can grab it now the
next tool is called the marquee tool now
any time there's a little triangle next
to the tool it means that there's other
tools along with it to get to these
tools just highlight over your tool
click it hold down and you can see the
rest of your tools now this one has a
elliptical marquee and two other ones
with it but here's what the marquee tool
does on your image you can click and
drag and you now have a piece of an
image you have selected and there's a
lot of different things you can do you
can paint inside this piece or you can
pick it up in Moodle
and elliptical marquee does the same
exact thing except it's a circle shape
instead of a square or a rectangle the
next tool we have is called the lasso
tool you can either click it or just
click L and this will take you to the
lasso tool now the lasso tool is a lot
like the marquee tool and that you can
make selections with it so if you want
to just make a freehand selection by
scrolling around peace of your images
and letting go you now have a selection
that you can either paint inside or move
or just move around since we know how to
move that's the only thing we know how
to do right now and you also have a
polygonal lasso tool and what this does
is the exact same thing make selections
but it makes it in the shape of a
polygon
so as you can see we now have a
selection in the shape of a polygon that
we can move around and the last tool is
called the magnetic lasso tool what this
does is attach to any similar similar
colors and keep on that selection as
long as you keep your mouse over now
make sure you don't straight to the side
or I'll pick up on some colors that you
don't want but for the most part we
don't really use that tool it'll make
selections we use some of the other ones
now the next tool you're going to use is
called the quick selection tool again
this is one other tool and make a
selection say you want to select all
this Canyon right here or this arc
whatever it is so you would pick the
quick selection tool and copy all the
similar colors and now from here you can
do many things with it such as move it I
said it's the only thing we need to know
how to do so the other tool in that
section is called the magic wand tool
and it's much like the same just picks
the same colors that are related to that
color and selects all the similar colors
now if your next tool on our toolbar is
called the crop and just like the name
implies if you want to crop your image
and don't want the entire thing then all
you have to do is highlight drag over
whatever part of the image you want and
let go and you now can crop your image
you can vary the size vary the height
and width or you can even rotate it and
then when you're ready to crap just
press ENTER and there you have your new
image and this last tool in this section
is called the slice tool that's for
making web design programs and we won't
really talk about that as we're
beginning but that's all the time we
have for right now and the next topic
will cover the rest of the tools and if
you're not already there you can go to
