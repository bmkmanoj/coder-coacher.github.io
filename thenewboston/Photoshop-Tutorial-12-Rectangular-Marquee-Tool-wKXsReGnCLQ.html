Photoshop tutorial and in this tutorial
I'm going to be teaching you guys how to
use the rectangular marquee tool pretty
freakin sweet now we're going to be
working with the image of the puppy that
I got today actually my new best friend
in the whole world
old Dan how freaking cute is he
eight weeks old and actually I'm going
to be talking a little bit kind of quiet
during this tutorial because old Dan is
sleeping right behind me like three feet
literally and I really don't want to
wake him up because this is the first
time he's been sleeping on it but
anyways I'm going to be a little quiet
and try to do this tutorial so in order
to get the rectangle marquee tool we
need to go ahead and use this tool and
once you see the options you're going to
see rectangular marquee tool now this is
one of the tools that allows you to make
a selection or select a portion of your
image now why the heck would you want to
select a portion of her image well let's
say that um we wanted to cut the bottom
half of this image out so instead of you
know his feet it would say maybe we want
to add some text in there or maybe we
just want to cut out this rope and put
in I don't know like a hot dog so it
looks like he's eating a hot dog I don't
freaking know the important thing is you
can do many things but let's just focus
on making that selection for this
tutorial so once you have your tool
selected in order to make a normal
selection just go ahead and drag with
your cursor and once you release you can
see that the selection is made it's
going to have these little I call them
marching ants around a little dotted
line now like I said with a selection
what you can do is a bunch of different
things you can cut that on paste it
another location
but uh for now like I said we won't get
into what you can do with the selection
I only want to show you guys how to use
this tool now you may be thinking okay
that tool was easy enough to use however
there are a bunch of sub options that
you can or options sub-options options
tomato tomahto that you can use with
this tool the first one is this little
doohickey right here this is add to
selection now whenever you have this
option chosen what you can do is you can
make another selection and it adds that
to the current selection so as you can
see we have a selection over old Danes I
if we want to get his nose in this as
well make a new selection and as you can
see whenever I release that we now have
one huge entire selection his eye and
his nose and you can do this as many
times as you want if you want to get his
other eye in there to select that check
it out
one freakin huge selection now of course
since we have add this next one is
subtract so maybe we want to say you
know what I just want his eyes in there
so let's go ahead and subtract the nose
and it takes this portion out from the
current selection now this last one is
the only one that can get kind of
confusing what this intersect with
selection does is it's going to allow
you to make a new selection then what
it's going to do is it's going to see
where overlaps this selection and
creates a selection based on that weird
let me go ahead and show you so you see
that we have two of his eyes and the
little spot above is nose selected right
now well I'm going to go ahead and make
a new selection that selects all of this
area now take a note that the only place
that these two selections overlap is his
eye his right eye so I'm going to go
ahead and release and check it out
wherever the two selections overlapped
is where I'm going to get that current
selection that oh Lola Hannah oh sorry
that's why it's called intersect
selection tool basically where they
overlap now a lot of people ask you know
what how do I get rid of a selection if
I say okay oh crap I press the wrong
thing let me just go ahead and get rid
of that crap how the heck do I get rid
of it altogether
well in order to get rid of your entire
selection hold down ctrl on your
keyboard and press Z this pretty much
allows you to start from new and you
know actually I shouldn't have made all
those selections but but oh well let me
say this whenever you make a selection
for the first time and you hit ctrl Z
it's um going to do undo and that's the
shortcut for undo but the shortcut for
um deselection I guess it's called is
control-d so let me go ahead and
demonstrate that one more time
control Z is undo and that may do it if
it's your first selection but control D
is D selection so I guess I probably
should have said that first and foremost
but now hey you guys know shortcut for
undo as well so the other two things
that I want to talk to you guys about is
fixed ratio in fixed size selection so
with this selection tool right now we're
in normal that means we can make
rectangle selections the shape the shape
perfect square if we want now aside from
just making you know a free total
freedom over your selection you can give
it a certain rules to follow
so for style if we put fixed ratio of
course one to one a one to one rectangle
is a square so if you do that you can't
make anything but a square go ahead and
try I dare you to now if you do fixed
size what it's going to do is it's going
to allow you to input a certain pixel
amount now 6464 is kind of a small
square so what you can do is obviously
since you have a fixed size you don't
need to drag because it already knows
how big it's going to be all you need to
do is with this selected hover over a
portion of your image and click now
obviously as you can see what it does is
it makes that selection and it uses your
cursor is the upper left-hand side or
left hand point of that rectangle so one
more time just go ahead and click and as
you can see it makes a selection on the
image that's 64 by 64 and it uses your
cursor is the upper left hand side now
that is basically how you make a
selection using the rectangular marquee
tool I know oh what the heck just flew
into my throat that was disgusting but
uh yeah there's not much to it once you
know all the different tools probably
90% of the time you're just going to go
with normal and normal or whatever this
one's called
new selection normal that gives you the
most freedom and you guys are going to
learn some keyboard shortcuts and up
comes
toriel's but for now thank you guys for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
