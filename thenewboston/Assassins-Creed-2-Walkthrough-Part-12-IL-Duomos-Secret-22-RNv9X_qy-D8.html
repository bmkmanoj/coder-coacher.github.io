to the second part of the assassins tomb
called duo Moe's secret or however you
pronounce it and this is the part where
it takes a little bit of thinking and
actually knowing what they're doing it's
not just following the pattern so what
you need to do is go ahead and pretty
much get around the main Cement path by
using well you can see where I'm jumping
right now but it's a series of jumping
off and on the pillars again so aside
you pretty much need to get to the
totally opposite end of where you
started so go ahead and jump on this
plank right here and then go on jump on
that wooden beam right there and once
you're on here you actually run up the
wall to get to the second layer so a lot
of people try to jump on that flag right
there and just fall down you don't do
that you need to actually run up the
wall to get the second layer so from
here you see all these wooden beams and
what you need to do here is oh no I
might sneeze in like five seconds no I'm
good so go toward pigeons are jump on
that and run up the wall and go ahead
and you can just jump on to I don't even
know what floor or are now perfect the
eightieth just don't look down
whatever you do so go ahead and you can
see the plank right here where we need
to get to so for some reason there are
werden wooden beams right here and a
wooden beam just sticking out right
there so go ahead and jump on this piece
of wood hanging from a string because
you know there ton of those just hanging
around churches and go ahead and jump on
that and now go ahead and you can see
where to go from here and now from here
we need to actually get on the wooden
plank that's below us so once we land on
that go ahead and jump on this one
chandelier I guess it is and now go
ahead and jump to that and you actually
need to get up on that next floor right
here but you just can't jump up right
here as you can see because I guess
there's construction going on up here so
we look look how he's walking with that
one leg look like a dog about the
and put that leg down so anyways you
actually will actually need to go all
the way around and I think you can hop
up right here but um just anyways shimmy
around hop up the next layer and then
once you're on that layer go back to
where you're going to hop up before
around to the other side where they're
having construction and now you need to
climb to the middle climb off this plank
like a gun and jump but don't choke and
then turn left and you can see the next
area you need to go so go out on this
little wooden beam sticking out and go
ahead and shoot me over there and now
you can see you need to get pretty much
on the opposite side of the church
should go ahead and jump on this plank
hanging down right there and on one end
- there we go and then go ahead to that
and now we need to get even on the next
layer and make sure you're on the right
side of the ladder which is that side
right there and don't do that I did that
by accident so go ahead and drop down
hopefully I don't drop all the way in
the bottom good I was a little worried
about that really you're gonna go over
there there you go this is the right
side so finally after about ten years of
trying to climb up a ladder you need to
go all the way around this just to get
over there I mean it would be really
easy if you could just go the short way
but nope you got to go to the long way
so now just make sure you don't fall and
it's really hard to fall because um if
you over jump something it'll probably
just take it then next one so and if you
fall it's going to be a pain getting
back up so trust me just take your time
and I almost fell right there so go
ahead and we're about half way right
here and this is each part right here
because I mean if you hit your joystick
or something you're just gonna fall like
that and pretty much just hang on unless
you accidentally tap being drop if
anyways we're almost to the end right
now from here what you need to do is
climb up this wall that's another thing
that people don't realize
climb it up and once you get to the top
you're gonna reach a beam and you're
gonna need to shimmy across it and then
stand up on it and then jump on your
final thing so you know there is
obviously churches build those up here
and whoa I would definitely not do that
so I mean in the game I would just in
real life I wouldn't because I'm a wimp
or would I so climb up this and once you
get to the top of this final thing you
can go ahead and open the sarcophagus
and leave but first you want to steal
some of the church's money because you
know that's the only honorable thing to
do so take a little bit of that take
some here so you know steal the church's
money and then wrap someone's tomb so
you know how awesome is that so just
take that go ahead and grab that statue
if you want in a couple of those gold
bases
I'm just kidding you can't grab those
but anyways open this and you're gonna
get the next what's it called medallion
it's not called a medallion is it I
don't know let's see if they tell us I
guess not but I'm just gonna tuck that
right in there and then you exit through
the nearby window the one that's
glistening with all the glory so that's
it for this main thing just take your
time and thank you guys for watching
don't forget subscribe and I'll see you
