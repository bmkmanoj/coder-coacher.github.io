slash on live gamer for the new Boston
and in this tutorial we're going to be
taking a look at substrings
now basically what a substring is is
extracting part of a string a certain
amount of characters from a string so
let's go ahead and start it and make a
little demo for this so here's our main
sub what we're going to go ahead and do
is create a variable so we'll just make
this user string as string and we'll set
it equal to nothing and now what we're
going to do is we're going to prompt the
user to enter in a string so console dot
write line enter a string now what we're
going to do is we're going to get that
string you should be very familiar with
this okay so now what we're going to do
is we're going to print out the length
of that string so first off let's just
add some space here so that will create
an empty line and then we'll see what
the program outputs underneath that
empty line just so it's easier to read
inside of our console window so now what
we're going to do is we're going to do
console dot write line use the string
dot length and then we'll just go ahead
and convert that to a string so
basically what we've done is we print it
out user string dot length which gets
the length of the string and we just
went ahead and converted that to a
string and left empty parameters right
here so now we're going to get some sub
strings of user string so we're just
going to do console dot write line and
we're going to do user string dot
substring and inside of our parameters
we're going to have two arguments we're
going to have the start index and we're
going to have the length so we're just
going to start at zero and we'll print
out the first three characters of this
string
so whenever you're working with a
substring strings
always start at zero so let's say you
have a user string and you get the
length of that whenever you're counting
through that link it's going to start at
0 so if the length is 12 is going to go
from 0 to 11 because that's 12 values
but they always start at 0 so then we'll
just go ahead and do this a couple more
times dot substring and we'll start at 3
and we'll go ahead three characters and
then what we're going to do is we're
going to do this one more time but we're
going to do it a little bit differently
so instead of using two arguments for
the parameters have the substring we're
just going to go ahead and do user
string dot substring so what this is
going to do is going to print out the
first three characters of user string
then it's going to print out the third
through six characters of user string
and then it's going to print out the
remaining characters of user string so
if we go ahead and run this it's going
to say interest string so we'll just
type on live gamer and then we'll do Sam
so once again we get that air that I
always run into okay so let's run this
again so we'll just type on live gamer
Sam and you can see that it tells us
that the length of online gamer Sam is
14 and it's going to tell us that the
first three characters of this string
right here is onl the next three
characters is iv'e and then the
remaining characters is gamer Sam so go
ahead and you can practice a little bit
with sub strings and then once you've
got that nailed down go ahead and move
on to the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
