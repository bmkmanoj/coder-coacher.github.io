slash on live gamer for the new Boston
and in this tutorial women continue
working on our paint program that comes
from the book beginning Microsoft Visual
Basic 2008 by Fearon Willis and Brian
Newsome published by rocks I just want
to make sure to give them credit in each
one of these videos to prevent any
problems from happening I'm not claiming
this as my own but I'm teaching you guys
how to do it so if you remember from the
previous tutorial we created the class
graphics item so now let's go ahead and
we'll come over here to paint you do and
let's add a new class now if you don't
know what graphics item is then I highly
suggest you move back to the previous
tutorial because it'll be really
complicated if you don't know what it
does and what's in it and I don't have
the time to explain it again in this
tutorial so we'll create another class
called graphics circle now what we're
going to be drawing with is a circle so
when we start drawing with circles it's
going to create a solid line so here is
our graphics circle class if you don't
want to know what I mean by I mean
making a solid line let me show you guys
real quick I want files right here and
open up the finished product and I'll
show you guys what happens when what I
mean by drawing a solid line oh you can
see okay so you can see here is my paper
and when I start drawing with the circle
it draws straight lines here so go ahead
and close out of that I just wanted to
explain to you what that does so we have
our class graphic circle and you
probably have already guessed know by
now but we're gonna have it inherit from
graphics item so we'll go ahead and come
down here
and you can see that when I press ENTER
it automatically creates this sub draw
for us it's public over I sub draw you
can see here that we made that in our
graphics items class and it's must
override draw so whenever we inherit
from graphics item it's going to go
ahead and create this for us I want to
press ENTER now when you're making
programs in the future whenever you
create must inherit class or it must
override subs and you inherit from a
class that has those it's gonna fill in
all of those in there so you could have
like a million different subs it's gonna
fill in all this for you all of the must
override subs so here's our draw sub and
what we want to do is let's create a new
brush so we'll just call it object solid
brush as new solid brush and it defines
a brush of a single color brushes are
used to fill graphic shapes such as
rectangles ellipses pies polygons and
paths they cannot be inherited that's
pretty much the description of solid
brush and it's gonna take one argument
we're going to need color so we'll type
me dot color
so by using the keyword meat that refers
to the class graphic circle so it's
gonna use the variable color from
graphic circle this will prevent any
errors from happening by using this
right here because if we just use the
word color we may get an error because
that is a keyword for Visual Basic and
if we have any other color variables as
such as ones that are only inside subs
or methods or functions this will
prevent any conflict from happening and
if you're wondering where did we get
color from well it's in the class
graphics item it's a public color of
type color so now that we've created our
solid brush let's go ahead and draw the
circle so we'll do graphics and you can
see here that graphics comes from the
argument so you got draw and then for
the arguments we need a graphics as of
type system dot drawings about graphics
so we want to fill any lips now an
ellipse is basically a circle or an oval
and ovals can be warped in all different
kinds of ways they could be really long
and skinny really tall and skinny
whatever is around is going to be an
ellipse and a perfect circle would also
fall under that category so graphics on
fill ellipse then what we want to do is
use object solid brush for our brush
and then for the second argument our
rectangle will type me dot rectangle now
once again this refers to the public
variable rectangle that is in class
graphic circle now you can't see it here
because it's inherited from graphics
item so rectangle is given to graphic
circle by graphics item and then we can
use it by typing me dot rectangle okay
so now that we've created our graphics
item and our graphic Circle classes
let's come over here to paint canvas dot
B beam will right-click it and we'll
select view code so here's the code
that's gonna run inside of our paint
canvas class so inside of this let's go
ahead and create an enumeration now this
enumeration is going to hold the sizes
the possible sizes for the circle so
we're gonna have a small a medium and a
large
so we'll type public you know
graphics
graphics sizes as integer and we'll set
small equal to let's say five medium is
going to equal ten and then large let's
make large equal to 25 so we've got our
graphic sizes enumeration and let's
create one more enumeration now this is
going to be graphic graphics tools
and we wanted to be of type integer and
we can't forget to put in numeration
right here so public and um graphics
tools as integer go ahead and hit enter
and we'll set circle pin equal to zero
so whenever we make a variable of type
of graphics tools there's only going to
be one option for us and it's gonna be 0
which is a circle pin so this is all
we're gonna add right now in the paint
canvas class so we're gonna be adding
more in the next tutorial and if you
have any questions about our graphics
circle class or the anything else in
this tutorial or in the paint program go
ahead and leave them in the comments
I'll try to answer as many as I can and
if you understand everything go ahead
and move on to the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
