to show you a few other things that you
can do with shell scripting and I don't
want to get real in detailed because
again this series is just for Linux and
shell scripting there is a lot to cover
so for now I just want to give you guys
the basics and show you guys that shell
scripts do exist and you know just a
couple cool things that you can do with
it so if you guys are familiar with
programming you probably know about
if-then-else statements and you know all
that good stuff so if you want to use
the if statement in shell scripting then
what you do is you can do this and also
show you guys how to use parameters
which is that other optional information
that you can use whenever you're running
commands so for the first parameter I'll
just check if it's equal to like a hot
dog or whatever and then if you right
then on the next line if the parameter
equals hot dog then we can just you know
do whatever we want to do but you arm
typed hot dog now you can also add an
else condition and for this else
condition you can just say echo out um I
don't know this is going to be the
dumbest thing ever like you did not type
hot dog and then we can actually use
that parameter again so whatever they
typed we can get that information from
them so I'll just echo something like it
was and this is actually kind of weird
how you use them a dollar sign one so
that's how we're going to interpret it
now at the end just write Fi so make
sure you save it and I know I'm going
over all of this real quick but again I
just want to give you guys a real basic
overview of this not going to anything
in real you know great detail so bash
your Bucky let's just go ahead and add
hot dog first and it's going to say you
typed hot dog now since we added that
else condition we can type anything else
like tuna fish
hit enter and it says you did not type
hot dog
it was tuna fish so this is a really
simple explanation of how you can get
your shell script to make some really
basic decisions
now there's also I'll just show you guys
the last thing on loops since any like
even simple programming demonstration I
feel the need to cover loops so say
something like for string I'll say 4x
and like dog cat fish and I'll just
write do echo X so at the end of this
I'm just going to write done and this is
just going to loop through this so in
this series dog cat and fish and
actually I can't use cat because that um
it's alright umm like I don't know
elephant like it was that hard to think
of an animal alright so for this series
right here it's going to loop through
each one and treat each element is X now
for each of those elements is just going
to print it out on the screen
and the reason that I couldn't use cat
because remember whenever we use cat
it's a keyword that's built into Linux
for displaying stuff on the screen so we
can't use building keywords or it'll
throw it and remember to save it again
and bash Buckey boom roasted dog
elephant fish so that is your really
like the shortest tutorial on shell
scripts that you have probably ever
watched but that's the basics of it
that's what you can do with it and in
the next video I'm going to show you a
much better way to automate Linux
commands and that is through the use of
Python I cannot wait I will see you guys
then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
