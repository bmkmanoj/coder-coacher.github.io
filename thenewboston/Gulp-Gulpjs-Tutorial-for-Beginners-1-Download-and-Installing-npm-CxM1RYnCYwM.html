Robertson welcome to your very first
tutorial and gulp j/s aka gulp whatever
you want to call it whatever floats your
boat so I'm guessing that most of you
guys watching this video already have a
basic understanding of what gulp is and
what you can use it for but for those of
you guys who I don't know maybe you're
in school and your teacher is like hey
learn gulp or maybe you had a job and
your boss just expected you to know gulp
and you didn't really understand it yet
I'll give you guys a real brief overview
of what it is and to be honest it's kind
of hard to explain to a beginner exactly
what it is because unlike most programs
it's not just WTF is this mate trying to
do it tutorial and has asked me if I
wanna oh my god I want to dropkick my
computer now alright so like I was
saying it's kind of hard to explain what
gulp is because it's not just one tool
it doesn't just do one thing gulp is
kind of like a Swiss Army knife for web
developers so you can use it to do a
bunch of different things and I'll give
you guys a few examples so say that you
were writing some SCSS or less or sass
and you need to convert it to plain old
CSS well gulp can help you with that
another thing is if you just had some
CSS files in JavaScript and you want it
to minify them so your website can load
a little bit faster
well gulp can help you with that as well
so again it's a bunch of different tools
wrapped in one and I'm going to be
showing you guys how to use some of
those tools some of the more popular
ones in this tutorial series so enough
of me babbling on about whatever let's
go ahead and figure out how to download
it how to install it and how to set up a
gulp project so the first thing we need
to do is we need to download node J s
why the heck are we downloading this
when you really care about gulp well
whenever we download nodejs is going to
come with a tool called NPM or node
package manager and this is the tool
that we use to download gulp so I know
it's kind of weird that we have to
download a tool just to download
thing else but hey this is how it works
now if you guys are unfamiliar with
nodejs I'm guessing that most of you
already know what it is but if you guys
don't really know what it is or you want
a more detailed explanation of how to
download and set it up then I actually
made a whole other nodejs tutorial
series but for right now let me just
skim through real quick so you go to
this website and you click downloads and
of course you just choose Windows or Mac
whatever you're using and go ahead and
the installers are incredibly simple
just keep all of the default settings
and click Next Next Next you probably
going to have to agree to something and
you're going to have node so there you
go
pretty easy again if you want to walk
through then go ahead and check out my
notes toriel's but once it's installed
like I said you're going to have this
tool called NPM which stands for node
package manager
now all this tool is it's actually you
can do a lot of stuff with it but just
think of it as a tool that lets you
download stuff from the internet I know
that's a really simplified explanation
but just taking it like that for now so
how do we use this tool well if you're
using Windows then go ahead and type in
PowerShell and whenever you see this
right here windows powershell and go
ahead and right-click and hit run as
administrator so I'm going to hit yes
and the reason that you need to run as
administrator is because we're going to
pretty much download files for the
system so we need administrator
privileges now you also want to open up
the terminal if you're using a Mac and
the only difference from here and out
between Mac and Windows is if you're
using a Mac you need to type the word
sudo which gives you administrator
privileges before every command
so again Windows doesn't have a sudo it
just has run at administrator but
whenever you're using a Mac you just
type sudo before each command and it
basically means to run this as a super
user or an administrator and another
thing that I'm going to recommend before
we actually install gulp is go ahead and
remove any old gulp versions that you
may have installed on your computer so
in order to do this
type NPM RM which means remove gulp - G
so all this says is node package manager
which is that tool that we just
downloaded go ahead and remove gulp now
again I'm almost certain that you guys
probably don't even have gulp and star
installed but if you accidentally
installed it maybe you're playing around
with it a few months before then just go
ahead and remove the old version of it
and this - G means remove it everywhere
on our computer so I'm going to go ahead
and hit enter and it's going to say
warning uninstalled not installed and
this is fine this just means hey you
don't even have it installed already and
you're trying to uninstall it
it doesn't hurt anything so just go
ahead and run that command anyways and
now once you are ensured that you don't
have gulp installed anywhere on your
computer we can now install the most
up-to-date version of gulp so how do we
do that just go ahead and type NPM which
is that tool that came with nodejs
install gulp - CLI not bli CLI - G so
what we're installing is the gulp
command-line interface and again this is
just a tool that allows you to run gulp
commands from anywhere on your computer
so with the command line we can go ahead
and use the gulp tool and this - she
just means globally so we want to be
able to use this tool anywhere on our
entire computer we don't have to be
inside a specific directory or anything
like that so go ahead and hit enter and
dunt dunt dunt
alright may look at that so now gulp is
installed and we can go ahead and use
gulp commands from anywhere on our
computer and in the next video I'm going
to show you guys how to set up a web
project using gulp</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
