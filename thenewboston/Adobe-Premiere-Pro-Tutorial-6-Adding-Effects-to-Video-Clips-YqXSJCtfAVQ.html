what tier six premiere pro tutorial and
in this tutorial what I'm going to be
doing is I'm going to show you guys how
to add some simple effects to your
videos now I'm not talking about special
effects like transformers to where a
robot comes down and smashes a car over
your head I'm talking some really simple
effects like contrast brightness how to
make your video clips fade to black at
the end some simple stuff like that so
the very first thing we need to do is of
course get a video clip so go ahead and
take a video clip and pull it out on the
timeline just like that so now we have a
pretty cool looking video clip pretty
cool so say we wanted to I don't know do
something simple like change the color
of this or you know maybe make it a
little brighter or change the contrast
well what we can do is do something
called apply in effect to it and that's
what the exact same thing that that does
it can change it or alter it in some
kind of way so all of our effects are in
this tab right here named appropriately
effects and all the effects that we
apply to the video are under yes guess
which one video effects these presets
are for something weird audio effects
and audio transitions are for the audio
of course video transitions are for when
you're moving from one clip to another
clip I'll go over that later on but for
now say we want to do something like
change the brightness or change the
color of this video we would go under
video effects and then we have all these
options right here but the most common
ones are under adjust we can adjust the
color the contrast the levels I work
with levels lot because it's a really
simple way to make some major
improvements on your video so say you
want to change the levels in the levels
is kind of a fancy way of saying the
contrast of your video you can do so in
one of two ways if you have your video
clip selected in the timeline then all
of its effects are going to appear in
the effects controls at the top if you
don't have it selected then nothing is
going to appear but go ahead and select
that and you can go ahead and see all
the effects controls so
over saying all right here are some
basic effects that are built in already
so in order to apply levels to this just
go ahead and drag the levels from the
effects panel in the bottom left into
the effects controls and release now you
can adjust the levels for this video
clip however this is an easier way to do
it and go ahead and hit control Z and
that's going to undo that and I'm going
to show you the easier way if you say
alright I want to work with Auto Color
or we might as well stick with levels
and I want to apply it to this video
clip right here what you can do is go
ahead and hold the icon down and drag it
out on your video clip and once you have
it over your video clip you're going to
see that it's highlighted once you have
the clip highlighted that you want to
work with just go ahead and release it
and then it applies those levels to that
video clip so now you can go ahead and
adjust all these settings which we'll
get to this a little later on the level
settings for this video clip so that's
how you apply a simple effect to a clip
however like I said they're more than
just simple video effects there's also
something called transitions but before
I even get to that I but I might as well
mention this whenever you're looking for
an effect say for example you just watch
this tutorial inner saying alright
Bucky just applied level so let me go
ahead and find levels okay where did he
have it is it under audio whatever the
heck was that
if you go ahead and in the top right
here you can go ahead and search for
whatever effect you're looking for and
it's going to make your life a whole lot
easier the only thing you have to
remember is whenever you search for
something and you want to get something
else remember to clear it out for
example if you go ahead and try to
search for color right now and you have
levels typed in there then the only
thing that are going to appear is the
levels so go ahead and clear it out and
then you have all your other stuff you
see what I'm saying alright hopefully
you understand if not well that kind of
sucks so before I let you guys go I'm
going to show you guys how to make a
cool transition so go ahead and go to
the end of your movie and add a title
right at the end
now I'm going to go ahead and zoom in
and go ahead and play this and check it
out in our movie it just goes to the
clip and then it cuts to the title okay
pretty cool goes to the clip it plays
and then it cuts to the title you know
what I'm not really feeling it that
isn't really that exciting I wish there
was a better way of transitioning from
this clip to the title other than having
it just pop in well lucky for you there
is and all of those are under video
transitions so go ahead and expand video
transitions and let me think of a really
easy one that's going to be easy to see
on YouTube on our page peel go ahead and
grab the transition you want and drag it
in between the two clips now some of
them are going to pop on one side or the
other and some of them are just going to
go right in the middle well page peel is
is it gives you the effect of one of the
clips peeling off like a scab peeling
off your skin probably should gave
another example but that's pretty much
what it is like a scab peeling up and
you can go ahead and adjust the length
all right if we play this and check it
out okay that's pretty cool effect but
it was just too fast and I want to make
a little longer if you go ahead and drag
the length of it just like this we can
make even longer so now let's go ahead
and play our clip check it out a whole
lot cooler than just cutting from one
clip to another title or one clip to
another clip so those are the basics of
how to apply effects and transitions to
your videos and in the next surah what
I'm going to be talking about is all
these effects settings in how to master
the effect so now we know how to get the
effects on our video clip now I'm going
to show you guys how to work with the
settings and master it until you got it
exactly how you want it so that's what
you guys have to look forward to so
thank you guys for watching don't forget
