tutorial and I'm making for the new
Boston and in this tutorial I'm going to
be showing you how to use the color
struck so all you're going to need for
this tutorial is a button a color dialog
and an if statement checking to see if
the user actually selects the color than
the color dialog so in the previous
tutorial we looked at the color dialog
and one of the properties of the color
dialog has is color property and the
color property returns are colored so we
can create a new color here and I'll
call it C and we can study equal to
whatever color that user selects in the
color dialog so now this color C
represents whatever color that the user
selects a color dialog there are many
different properties inside of the color
struct the first one that we're going to
be looking at is the is named color and
the is named color property will return
a boolean telling you whether or not the
color is named or has a name so if the
color is black and yes it will be black
but if the color is one like color off
of black and it won't give you black so
now if they've been here checking to see
if the color is name and if the color is
named I'm gonna have a message box
displaying the name of the color so
we're going to use name property instead
of the color structure to see or to see
the name of the color so now maybe bug
here we should pick the name of the
color that we select in a message box
since it's black we should get black yep
since this is olive we should get Olive
yeah but if we select a custom color one
that won't won't have a name predefined
for it then we shouldn't do name for it
like yeah there's no need for that color
you can also check to see if it's an own
color or not and difference between if
it's a named color or known color is the
known color mainly has colors in it that
are used for Windows properties like
like scroll bars or fun things
and in order to see the name of a known
color I'm going to do dot to know one
color and then convert that into a
strength it's the name of it as I know
the color and you shouldn't be able to
see much difference here but this is
like flu yeah and who select a custom
color and then we shouldn't see the name
of it
nope don't see any of it in order to see
all of the different colors that are
known you can use a known enumeration
for the known color enumeration to see
all the different colors and yeah as you
can see there's like ones for the menu
bar one for a menu and there's other
ones in here as well but yeah window
window frame window x DC you don't have
to just set a color equal to whatever
you select a color dialog you can also
selected to something or static
properties inside of the color strata
for example you can set even go to color
and maybe do color dot and you can see
there's a bunch of predefined colors
right here we have maroon linen and all
of these colors that are predefined are
named colors so we sent it you can
achieve mint cream then we can just do
message box up show C name and it showed
we should get mint occurring in a
message box yep mint career you can also
set it equal to a known color in order
to do that you're gonna have to use a to
unknown color to color dot o from know
so you're gonna have to color it up from
known color and then you can just pick a
color in the known color enumeration so
if we wanted to set a equal to gradient
active caption we can do that and then
we can just do that to known color and
then convert it into a string so we can
see the name of the known color and we
should get gradient active caption in
the message box yep
in order to store color as a 32-bit
integer you're going to have to use the
property called c2 argv or to remain
your color and the to a RGB method it
will basically convert your color into a
32-bit representation of the number or
four byte representation and a stands
for alpha R stands for red G stands for
green and B stands for blue so if you
wanted to access those individually you
could do so you needed the a property
would be property of the G property and
the our property and obviously our and
all those Demming red like this means
LDS or three but we're just going to
convert it into an integer so we're
going to take two a RGB notice that you
can gonna convert it into a string so
that we can see it in our message box go
and we should see four bytes inside of
our message box yep the FF is for the
Alpha b9 is for the red the d1 is for
the green and EA is for the blue now if
you wanted to convert an RGB color into
a color you would use three colors we
will need the from argb method inside of
the color struct and it's a static
method so then we could just put 3 in
here if you speed up to air DB so this
put I in here and then we're just going
to set our
equal to the buttons background color
equal to B and B should be equal to C
because basically it's converting C into
a 32-bit representation of it or integer
representation of it and then it's
converting on that integer into a color
so this should be the same we're just
going to set this equal to like black or
something so you know what black is we
don't necessarily know what that other
color is so now I'm gonna click this
button our colors that are our bunnies
background - turns black yep so that's
pretty much all there is to the color
structure so see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
