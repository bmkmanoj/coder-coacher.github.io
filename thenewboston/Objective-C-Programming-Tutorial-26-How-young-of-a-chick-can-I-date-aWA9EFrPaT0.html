to your 26th objective-c tutorial now in
this story I was planning on teaching
guys how to pass multiple arguments into
a single method but I was looking at our
program and there's not really a good
method that we're going to be able to
demonstrate this so what I decided to do
is build a regular method in this
tutorial and it's it's a good one so you
might want to stay tuned and in the next
disorder we're gonna be converting it so
we can pass some multiple arguments into
it so we're saying all right what is
this fabulous method that you're gonna
make what this method is gonna do is
it's going to take your age and it's
gonna calculate it through awesome
computer programming calculate the
youngest girl you can date and if you're
a girl then I guess I'll make you a
lesbian wasn't it
but anyway so let's go ahead and get
started so let's go ahead and put - and
it's not gonna return anything so put
void it's just gonna be a little all its
gonna do is gonna pass at your age and
it's gonna give you a little print
statement you can date Chicks X number
of years old no younger so let's go
ahead and name this date age because
that's what we're doing and we're gonna
pass it an integer variable of a and
this is gonna be we're gonna pass it our
age so now let's go ahead and copy this
and in the implementation we can of
course implement it so control V and for
the body how do we want this method work
just a NS log statement again because it
doesn't have any return we just got
prints I'm out it says you can date
chicks percent i years old and the
formula for figuring out how young of
girls you can date is you have to take
your age you have to divide it by two
and then you add seven to that so for
example um if you were 32 years old you
would take that divided by 2 which is 16
and then add 7 to that and that would be
the youngest girl you can date no
younger
it's against the rule so now we put that
semicolon where it should be so now we
have a method called de-age so now if we
go ahead and make sure you don't have
been heirs
go ahead in our main method or a main
program I should say and but Bucky dates
age and of course it needs our age and
I'll put 23 I'll run this program and
see how young of girls I can date and
this is from les story I'm 12 years old
away 540 pounds you can date chicks 18
years old so me personally I can date
chicks that are 18 years old no younger
than that any younger than that then
you're asking for you know to catch a
predator but anyway so let's go ahead
and change this and say someone is 45
years old so let's go ahead and build
and run this and see if you're 45 you
can date chicks 29 years old not bad
sounds fair sounds fair and what we're
going to be doing in the next tutorial
is adding another argument to this so it
already takes age we want to add another
argument so there are some exceptions to
this rule so for example let's say
you're r45 but you have a million
dollars I mean then that age may
decrease a little bit to 18 or something
like that and let's say you're 60 then
the value would be 37 but if you had
three million dollars then the age might
decrease a little bit so in this in the
next tutorial we're gonna be learning
how to add another method or excuse me
another argument to this method to uh
you know kind of uh make it more
accurate so that took me quite a long
time to think of that so thank you guys
for watching don't forget to check out
the next tutorial and I'll see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
