my name is Harrison I manage YouTube
channel youtube.com slash cent X that's
Sen t de X as well as Python programming
net both these places are where I give a
bunch of Python programming tutorials
basically everything ranging from the
basics of Python all the way on to some
intermediate topics as well as some
advanced topics so some of the topics
that I cover there are things like
machine learning pattern recognition
image recognition robotics with the
Raspberry Pi algorithmic trading website
development with like Jango and flask as
well as games and it just so happens
that Bucky saw one of my PI game
tutorials so he had to have it who can
blame him so here I am teaching you
lovely folks PI game so with that let's
go ahead and get started what is PI game
obviously the name pretty simple it is a
gaming module for Python so what PI game
is going to do for you is going to do a
lot of the truly backend stuff that are
required for games it's going to do
those things for you while still
allowing you to control your games logic
and all of the graphics for your game
and that sort of thing but as far as you
know more complex things like how do you
actually take in input say from the user
like how do we know what key is being
pressed from the user we throw that out
we give that to PI game PI game does
that for us and then we just decide what
we want to do with those results so with
that to get PI game you go to PI game
dot org and I'm actually on downloads at
the moment but this should be where you
land they just default to news dot HTML
and you can first of all you can browse
other people's projects chances are if
there's a specific type of game that you
can't figure out how to make someone
who's made it for you already and you
can check out their game see how they
did it and and move on so with that when
you go to PI game org you're going to
want to head over to downloads now with
a lot of things with Python since Python
such a module heavy language sometimes
just getting everything to work together
before you can even program anything
can kind of be a challenge so pygame is
not above that challenge I know for sure
Mac users have a hard time with Piegan
you may have to use like Python 2 7 in
the PI game 4 to 7
I don't know that Mac has any support
for Python 3 onward this tutorial is for
Python 3 specifically Python 3.4 but you
should have absolutely no problem
following along into 7 as long as you
make the necessary like syntax changes
so print will be well you don't have to
change anything about print but unless
we throw exceptions that should probably
the only major difference between these
two things
so exception in python 2 7 is except
exception comma E whereas in 3.4 except
exception as E so you'd have to make
those small changes but for the most
part all the code will be identical so
with that we can see here that we've got
Windows downloads you've got your UNIX
distributions and then you get your Mac
downloads here 4 to 7 that's as good as
it gets
for Windows you can either download here
you can do the windows installer but if
you'll see the latest version for
Windows is 3.2 well lays python version
is 3.4 so that's kind of irritating and
when you go to install this is going to
look for pot like C colon slash Python
32 not 34 so this is going to be
problematic right out of the gate but if
you look right here they suggest that
you go to this website here and this
website is a fantastic website we're
going to visit that now I highly suggest
you bookmark this website especially if
you're on a 64-bit version of Windows
and Python because a lot of modules do
not come with 64-bit versions they're
just 32 what he's done is very compiled
and for you and built them as a 64-bit
module so we're interested in PI game I
kind of scrolled around lawsuit there
socialists revisit so as you can see
here we can look and there's an exe for
3.4 both in 64-bit which is here and
then win32 is 32-bit so depending on
what you are download whichever version
obviously if you're on Linux download
that you're on Mac again you have to use
two seven sorry
otherwise if you're on Windows download
either the 64 bit or the 32 bit I'm 64
so that's when I went down the already
half pad game so make sure you get that
also just as a quick aside if you don't
have Python I'm going to go ahead and
assume that people watching this
tutorial already have Python and
understand the basics of Python if you
don't already have Python you'll need to
download install Python first before you
try to install PI game otherwise it
won't find Python and will yell at you
so get that obviously you come here go
to downloads and then you can pretty
much use those quick options but if
you're 64-bit these quick options are
going to download a 32-bit version you
don't really want that so you'd want to
come down here and pick your the version
you're interested which in our case the
3.4 and then you would keep going until
you fine we'll go to the download page
and here we found our 64-bit installer
ok so just as a quick aside I'm assuming
you guys know the basics I'll try to go
kind of slow the first time we go over
any sort of thing like the first time we
hit a while loop we'll kind of go slow
over it but if you don't understand the
basics of Python you can you to check
those out on Bucky's channel or my
channel and probably help yourself that
way so so that's it with that once you
have PI game downloaded what we're going
to be using I just want show you guys
the environment I like to program
straight in ideally which is pythons
default IDE and to get there what you
want to do say you're on Windows you
should go to your Start bar and I in
fact let me move this down for you guys
so you would go to your Start bar all
programs and scroll down to see python
if you're onto 7 you can you see 7 we're
using 34 so 3.4 click on that and then
you click on IDL e and that would bring
up this window and what this is is
actually an interactive developer we're
not interested in interactive
development right now so you go file new
file and that gives you a blank document
and then from there we can type in this
blank document save it and then later on
we can run from that I'm gonna close
that out already have one up but that's
how you get to the development
environment that I'm going to be coding
in so
now that we have that the one major
thing that we need to do from this point
to figure out if we can progress into
the next point is to do an import PI
game so let's go ahead and run that
really quick and make sure that we get
no errors because if we get in there or
in trouble so now you have all the
basics of pi PI game as long as you were
able to make that import everything
worked out great you're ready to move on
to the next video where I'm going to
show you guys basically the bare-bones
to every single PI game script you have
so stay tuned for that thank you for
watching and again I am Harrison from
youtube.com slash Centex doing videos
for Bucky</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
