equations of non-linear graphs so the
first type of nonlinear equation we're
going to talk about is called a parabola
so and the most basic form of the
parabola is y equals x squared so we're
going to graph this equation right here
so if I plug in 0 I'm going to get y
equals 0 so I have 0 0 I plug in 1 I'm
going to get 1 y equals 1 squared so y
equals 1 so I have 1 1 if I plug in
negative 1 if you remember any number
squared is going to be positive so I'll
get negative 1 1 if I plug in 2 I don't
know why I wrote it like that and y
equals 4 so 2 4 same thing if I put a
negative 1 and this is what a parabola
looks like I miss my dot right there
it's like a like a u so now we're gonna
graph
I equals two so y equals two x squared
we're gonna do the same kind of thing
plug in points so y equals two times
zero so it was zero zero y equals to one
y equals two same thing is gonna happen
if I plug in negative one to two squared
so 2 times 2 squared which is 4 is 8
well this is gonna be off my little
chart I'm just gonna put it up here and
then same thing if I plug in negative 2
so when we put a big number out out
front the graphs gonna get skinnier and
the way I like to think of it when you
have a bigger number in front of an X
you have more exercise and if you have
more exercise you're gonna be skinnier
so whenever you have like a 4 out front
you're gonna have a skinnier graph but
if you had like a 1/2 out front you get
less exercise so you're gonna be wider
ok now we're gonna do negative x squared
ok so here if we plug in negative if we
plug in 1 we're gonna it y equals
negative what what same things gonna
happen if we plug in positive 1 and if
you keep going you'd get the same
parabola
it's just reflected across the x-axis
so when you have a negative out front
it's gonna you're gonna have a downwards
parabola if you have a positive out
friend it's gonna be up alright and now
we're gonna have to do two more in ones
okay
so each parabola has its vertex which is
where there's just one point and then
your graph goes like up from that one
point like that so so far every one of
our graphs has had a zero zero vertex
but if you plug zero into this you're
going to get zero plus two squared so y
equals four so 0 1 2 3 4 it's gonna
actually forget about that okay so
whenever you have a number inside your
parentheses if it's a positive it's
gonna shift your graph to to the left if
it's a negative it's going to shift your
graph to the right so your your
y-intercept if you set y equal this or
your x-intercepts if you said y equals 0
its 0 equals x plus 2 x equals a
negative 2 so negative 2 okay so if you
have a a plus 2 here it's going to shift
your graph 2 to the left so your vertex
is going to be 0 1 2 so then your graph
is gonna look something like this just
shift it over if you have negative 3
it's going to shift it to the right 3
and that's all we're gonna do with
parabolas make sure you come back and
watch your next video where we talk
about circles</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
