we know the basics of how to navigate
around let's go ahead and learn some
more useful things the first thing is
how do you just view the contents of a
directory so say that we're in Bucky
right now how do we just list all of the
folders and files inside well all we
have to do is navigate to whatever
directory that we want to and write dir
so hit enter and look at this this is
going to give you all of the files and
all of the directories inside now if it
is a file what it's going to do is this
going to list something like this you
see how it says get config 5353 is the
size of the file and this dir this means
that it's a directory so you see that
this one doesn't have that that means
that most of these are directories
except this one right here move over to
my desktop and run it again alright so
on my desktop I have a bunch of
directories to arrack other Python verse
shell videos and I also have this file
which is a jar file and this one is 14
million bytes so again at the bottom of
it efforts done listing everything it
gives you a real quick overview one file
and seven directories inside your
desktop so let me move back and here's
another cool thing that you can do so
you know that I said that whenever you
want to list the contents of a directory
what you do is you have to navigate to
that directory and then write dir well
you don't have to navigate to actually
so I guess that was a liar here when I
told you that you can actually list the
contents of a directory that you are not
currently in so say that we wanted to
list what's inside this slingshot folder
right here what I can do is write dir
and if I just run it right here it's
just going to list the current directory
however I actually want to list the one
inside desktop slingshot so this isn't
going to change my directory but it's
going to allow me to list what's inside
that slingshot folder now take no of my
path right here I am still in the
Bucky's directory right there so again
you don't
have to move into it but you know most
of the time that's what people do so I
figured I'll show you guys that now
another cool thing that you can do is
this let me go ahead and write dir and
right now we're just looking at what we
looked at at the beginning of this video
the contents of the Bucky directory one
file 20 directories look and beautiful
however there's an optional parameter
that you can use after dir and that is
/a so this is going to run the same
command but it's going to show you all
the hidden directories as well so if you
hit enter holy crap what is all this
stuff I mean we have some stuff that we
haven't seen before app data um NT user
at all these extra files that are just
popping up well what that /a does vir
slash a now that includes all of the
hidden directories and files as well now
the reason that you really shouldn't
mess around with that too much is
because whenever you have a hidden file
or directory it's usually hidden for a
reason and the reason is because Windows
or whoever created an application they
don't want you messing with those files
so that's why most of the time it's a
good idea to just ignore hidden files um
the one exception is I guess if you
think there might be a virus or
something on your computer and you want
to snoop around for hidden files or just
you're interested and you want to check
them out then make sure to do the /a to
view all files plus your hidden ones as
well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
