slash on live gamer for the new Boston
and this tutorial we're going to be
taking a look at dynamic arrays now
arrays by default are limited to the
number of items that you set when you
declare it so let's say you declare an
array and you have it hold 6 items so 0
through 5 once you get to 5 you cannot
add any more items in this tutorial
we're going to be learning how to make
an array bigger than it originally was
by using the read in keyword so we'll go
ahead and open up our toolbox we will
add a list box and we will add a button
we'll go ahead and close out of that so
we'll come over here and we'll make each
one of these a little bit bigger so
we'll just set the text for button 1 to
read in and we will set the name to
button 3 dim and we'll set the list box
to list array okay so go ahead and just
make this a little bit smaller we'll go
ahead and double click on read them to
open up the event for it and what we're
going to do is we're going to come up
here and we are going to declare an
array so private and we'll just do
string sports and we'll set it to 2 so
it'll hold three places as string now
we'll go ahead and populate it so we
will do baseball basketball and football
and we aren't going to need this right
here so let's go ahead and take that out
okay so now we have an array that holds
three items 0 1 &amp;amp; 2 so whenever they
click read in we want to add those items
to the list well first we'll add items
to the list and then we'll read eclair
it so for each item as string in string
sports we want to go ahead and type list
arrays listed items dot add item ok so
go ahead and run this and you can see
here that if we click this button we get
those three in there so now what we're
going to do is we are going to read
eclair that so let's wait for this to
load here okay so we'll add another list
box so let's come over here to our tool
box find list box
okay so we'll shrink this down some to
fit into our form and let's just make
this a little wider
and wilt it will set the name value of
this to list new array so now we'll go
ahead and come back here and we will
find our button read them click event
and now what we're going to do is we're
going to read Eclair string sports so
we'll type re dim and if you read the
description says reallocate storage
space for an array variable so it just
pretty much starts over from scratch so
we'll read in string sports and this
time how many places we want to tap well
right now I have two let's just do four
syllable whole five and then we'll just
go ahead and assign those to something
so string string sports three it's going
to be equal to wakeboarding and string
sports four is going to be equal to
let's just do soccer okay so now if we
do another for loop so for each item as
string in string sports we want to go
ahead and type list new array dot items
add and we're going to do we're going to
add brackets right here and then we'll
add we'll add item and we will add more
brackets now the reason we're doing this
is so that so that you can see each of
the items enclosed in brackets and since
some of these items are going to be no
we need to put other strings in here
because it will start complaining and it
tries to print out something no and your
program will crash so we'll just go
ahead and add these let's go ahead and
do it up here too so you can see so you
can easily compare them
and we will add them to the other side
okay so now if we go ahead and run this
you can see that here's our read in
button if we go ahead and click that we
get baseball basketball and football and
then over here we have empty empty empty
wakeboarding and soccer now when you
read Eclair an array it's going to clear
that array and set everything back to
nothing and it's going to make it bigger
or smaller whatever you want now there
is an easy way to fix this and we will
learn about that in the next tutorial so
thanks for watching guys - stay tuned
