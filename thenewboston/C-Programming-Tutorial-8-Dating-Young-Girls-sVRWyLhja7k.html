eighth C++ tutorial I think this is a
tutorial but I could be wrong if I am
who cares
anyways welcome to another C++ tutorial
and in this tutorial what we're going to
be covering is building functions with
return values sounds awesome
and that's because it is awesome because
in the past we created functions that
you know maybe we gave us some
information and it printed something out
on the screen and that's all it really
did but these functions with the return
values we're going to give us some
information and then it's actually going
to make a calculation actually do
something useful and return to us an
answer so you know instead of just doing
its own little thing and printing now on
the screen or doing whatever we needed
to do these are actually going to be
useful functions that we can use and it
gives us an answer that we can you know
set to a variable maybe maybe we can
print that answer around the screen so
if this sounds kind of confusing just me
talking once I get typing typing some
code and everything is going to make
sense so you're going to ask all right
Bucky since you need to make a function
that actually does something what kind
of function are you going to build well
I was racking through my brain and I was
like well maybe I can build a function
that converts feet to centimeters that's
kind of useful or maybe I can build a
function that converts like kilograms
the grams that would be a nice
demonstration but you know all this
scientific crap no one really uses in
real life so I'm going to build a
function that you are definitely going
to need in your lifetime and that is
this you're going to need to know based
on your age how young of girls you can
date and here is the formula for this
and guys if you didn't know this trust
me I didn't know this up until a little
bit ago what you do is you take your age
divide it by two and add seven and
whatever that number is that's the age
of girls you're allowed to date no
younger than that so let's go ahead and
the first thing we need to type is what
kind of answer do we want back well we
want the girls age back
that's our goal so that of course is an
integer and go ahead and name your
function anything you want I'm just
going to name my date calc for a date
calculator and now what kind of
information are we going to be giving
into the program well we're going to be
giving it our age which is of course an
integer Noah have no like I'm 23 and a
half crap none of that now I'll cheat
so anyways go ahead and put in my age as
that variable and then go ahead and
you're ready for the function body but
before you do remember from the last
tutorial and check this out
when if you right-click there's not a
copy thing right there that's kind of
annoying so code blocks and you fix that
anyways go ahead and paste this get rid
of my age in int and this is what the
function prototype is going to look for
this int that's what we're getting back
date calculator or calc that's the name
and we're going to be passing in an
integer as our age so anyways
anytime we use the my age variable
that's going to be you know we're going
to pass it in a number and it's going to
convert it to the variable my age so
check this out
we need one variable for the girl's age
that we didn't create yet so let's go
ahead and do that int girl's age and set
this equal to this
oh crap someone's calling me on skype
I'll just you know I'll just say I was
sleeping or something suckers and let's
go ahead and do this my who the heck
hire Indians are you serious quit
talking here right now
yeah I don't I don't think I'm going to
explain that one anyways moving on my
age divided by two plus actually it's
laying that up plus seven so here's
what's going to happen whenever we call
this function we're going to enter an
age like 23 because that's how old I am
or let's say 24 for simplicity when I
enter 24 it's going to say alright 24 is
now equal to my age so take 24 divide it
by 2 and add 7 and whatever answer you
get from that set it equal to the
variable girl's age and then once you
have that calculated go ahead and return
girls age as our final answer so it does
all this calculations and finally what
we get back is the value of girls age
which should be like a 1819 one of those
things sounds appropriate for me so
let's go ahead and what we need to do
now is call this method so we can go
ahead and you know just throw in a
number like 23 bolt let's go ahead and
build this program where we give the
user an opportunity to enter their own
age so we need a variable for H so let's
go ahead and put int age and now let's
go ahead and give them a little prompt
on the screen see out enter your age and
it with a semicolon and now what we need
to do is give them a way to enter their
age and set it equal to the variable age
so CIN remember that age so now what we
have is whenever they press a number or
type a number on the screen you should
say and press Enter
whatever a number they type is going to
be equal to the variable age so and
tighten that up actually there we go
that looks like nice nice to me so now
what we need to do is we need to take
whatever number they entered and we need
to pass it
in as the argument for this function so
how do we do that go ahead and call your
function and date calc just like that
and that number they entered is going to
be passed in as an argument but what we
want to do is this we want to print out
the answer on the screen so let me go
ahead and run this real quick and show
you guys a quick example and then once
everything works hopefully I didn't get
in errors I'll see in a second nope
I'll talk you guys through how it works
one last time so I'm going to enter my
age 23 press ENTER and the answer is 18
so I'm allowed to date girls that are 18
years old
no younger than that so let's go ahead
and run this again and just drive you
know so like let's try something more
like how young is a 76 year old man a
lot date 45 so any girl younger than 45
he's not allowed today so you know
that's how it works but this is how it
technically works so we got our function
prototype in our front function body so
now that you guys know what those two
are here is how the program is going to
work step by step your operating system
is going to call your main method right
here the first thing that's going to do
is recognize all right I got a blank
page that you're going to enter as an
integer this is just text on the screen
so the user knows what's going on and
this is saying all right whenever the
user enters a number store it as the
variable age and now what I'm going to
do is I'm going to take that age which
is you know 23 or something and I'm
going to pass it into the function date
calc so with this right here whenever it
comes across this line of code it's
going to shoot down to here and use the
function date calc so it's going to take
that 23 which was age before and now
convert it into my age and now it's
going to do some calculations to it so
23 divided by 2 is 11 that's how you
round in computer you kind of forget
about the decimal place we'll worry
about that later
so I know
it's eleven plus seven which is 18 and
I'm going to take that 18 and store it
in the variable girls age simple enough
and now once I have that answer I'm
going to do is return the number 18 so
basically this entire statement right
here is the exact same thing is the
number 18 so by calling this you get the
value 18 and by calling it with you know
76 you get 45 depending on what number
you enter is what you get back does that
make sense to you it makes sense to me
but anyways so then all it does of
course is see out which is pretty much
means just print it on the screen and by
the way in the last couple tutorials I
saw comma on one of my videos that they
didn't quite understand what this line
of code meant instead of system pause
what CN get means is basically wait for
the user to enter a character on the
screen they can press any button just
wait for any character get means get
character and see in of course you know
that means so that's what that means
there's a real quick explanation that
basically the same thing is system pause
because if we just comment this out and
run our program check this out whoa
it actually works without it that's
pretty good but anyways throw that in
there anyways because some compilers
aren't going to work without it so
anyways thank you guys for watching
don't forget subscribe if you have any
questions ask me on my forum check my
new website and I'll see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
