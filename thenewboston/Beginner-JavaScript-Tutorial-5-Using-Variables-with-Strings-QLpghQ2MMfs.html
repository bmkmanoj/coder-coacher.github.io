fifth JavaScript tutorial and in this
story I mean teaching you guys how to
use variables with the string of text in
your program so it's going to be awesome
and it's actually really helpful in
understanding how these programs work
and trust me you're going to use this a
lot whenever your program in JavaScript
so let's go ahead and uh well enough of
me talking let's go ahead and get
started so the first thing that we need
is two variables go ahead and make a
variable called name and just set it
equal to of course whatever your name is
Bucky and go ahead and make another
variable called like age or something
and set this equal to your age I'm 24 so
of course I'm going to set mine it's 24
so we already know that we can use
document dot write to basically write
things out on the screen so we can
either write name and if we go ahead and
print this out it says Bucky or we could
have went ahead and printed out age and
it will print out 24 but what if we
wanted to include this within a bigger
string of text well in order to do that
you need to use the addition operator
aka the plus sign and you write the
addition and this sticks it to whatever
string of text you're trying to type out
so for example it says Bucky um is my
name so go ahead and it's going to treat
this as the word Bucky and it's going to
add it with this string so let's go
ahead and just see it now says Bucky is
my name simple enough so anyways
whenever you want to write a variable
inside a string of text you just can't
you know write something like this you
just can't go ahead and write name is my
name or else check it out it's going to
say your name is my name if you want to
treat that as the variable you need to
put it outside the quotation marks and
you need to stick it together with that
plus sign and then it works perfectly
and not only can you do this before but
say you want to write something after
like Bucky is my name and my age is
plus h so again not only can you do this
before your text but you can also do it
after and check it out
Bucky is my name and my age is 24 so
easy enough that is how you use
variables alongside strings of text
whenever you're trying to write out
stuff so let's go ahead and delete all
this and let me um let's go ahead and
make some new variables let's go ahead
and make a very my own name tuna and set
this equal to I am a fish and then go
ahead another make another variable
called bacon and set this equal to
Baconator and then go ahead and add one
more called mmm
only got like two things why don't I
think a tuna and bacon table time any
time I make a variable I made like a
thousand Sorrells and I swear I only
made like two variables tuna bacon and
ham so heck it might as well include ham
and set this equal to am burglar make
sure it's spelled around or else it
won't work so anyways we have three
variables right now and we already know
that we can stick them on a string of
text but what you didn't know or maybe
you did is that you can also stick them
alongside one another so tuna bacon plus
ham and whenever we try to print this
out it's going to give us I'm a fish
Baconator Hamburglar so let's go ahead
and see that I'm a fish Baconator
hamburger you know it doesn't make any
sense at all and I probably should pick
something that did make sense but hey
this is just an example who the heck
cares so anyways that's what I wanted to
teach you guys in this tutorial about
that addition sign and whenever you're
working with variables or strings of
text you need to include that addition
sign or else it's not going to work so
again that's all I want to teach you
guys for this tutorial in the next
tutorial we're going to be diving a
little deeper and in JavaScript and
going over some more advanced topics but
trust me they're going to be easy to
follow along with and just stick with me
in no time you'll be a JavaScript pro so
anyways thank you guys for watching
don't forget if you have any questions
just go to my forum the New Boston comm
slash forum and if I don't answer them
for you someone else will so thank guys
for watching don't forget subscribe and
I'll see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
