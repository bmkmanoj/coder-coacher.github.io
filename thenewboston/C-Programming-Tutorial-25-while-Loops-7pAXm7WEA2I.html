video I want to talk to guys about not
only one the most important but also one
of those powerful tools that we have in
the C programming language and this is
called a loop now it's actually
incredibly important because what this
does is it allows you to run a certain
piece of code over and over and over
again
as many times as you want so I'll show
you guys our structure for it right now
it's going to look kind of familiar to a
if statement and it actually is really
familiar to it
the key word is wild now inside the
parentheses right after it you write
some test and the test is pretty much
the same ones that you could use for if
statement and then after it you have the
code that you want to execute so let me
show you guys a really simple example of
a statement right now so say that we
have oh no just get any variable to test
I'm going to name my tuna and I'm going
to set it equal to 1 now for the test
we'll just say um I don't know is tuna
less than 5
if so print out something on screen so
printf and we can just write a which is
right tuna is now % e which would give
us the value of tuna so pretty much what
this is going to do is it's a program
that's going to first set this variable
of tuna equal to 1 and then it's going
to test ok is 1 less than 5 as long as
it is run this bit of code so if you run
it right now it just says tuna is now 1
forever and ever
and you guys see how this is blinking
it's like printing it out a million
times a second or however fast my
computer is set now you're saying okay
well that's kind of a stupid test
because tuna is always going to be less
than 5 unless you know the universe or
math changes and that's probably not
going to happen anytime soon so we need
a way in order to end this loop we need
a way to increment tuna if there is only
like something called
increment operator or something Oh
that's why we learn the increment
operator in last tutorial so if you guys
thought it was useless and you're never
going to use it again whenever you're
using loops you use it all the freaking
time so check this out what we can do is
change up our loop to say something like
this so this is going to do is every
time this loop occurs it's going to add
one to tuna each time so if you run this
check it out so the first time tuna was
equal to one it tested if it was less
than five print it out tuna one did the
same thing for two added one did it same
thing in total got the four and then
once it got the four check it out once
the value of tuna was equal to four it
said I'm going to test this again
or excuse me once it got to five it
tested it one more time and it said okay
is five less than five well that's when
this test was false so that's why it
didn't print out tuna is now five so
again what a loop does is it basically
loop something over and over and over
again until the test becomes false
pretty freakin sweet so let me go show
you guys a really cool example of um
actually I got a really cool example I
can show you so get rid of this and
clear out everything except like the
bare-bones so we just have an empty
while loop and this is actually
something that you guys probably saw
before
my math teacher taught it to me when I
was in like um a sixth grade maybe he's
like alright would you rather have a
million dollars right now or I can take
a penny and double it every single day
for a month and then you can have
however much money that is at the end
and everyone is like take a million
dollars million dollars and so what he
did is he actually figured it out and I
was sure to get show you guys how to do
that so put int day and right now we'll
just set it equal to one even though
we're going to be running it for 31 days
and
for the penny we can just do float
amount and set this equal to point zero
1 1 cent so now what do we want to test
for well we pretty much want to double
it for 31 days so we'll keep track of
days and add a 1 to it every single time
this loop runs a process so we're
testing for day so is day less than or
equal to 31 as long as it is continue
this loop once it gets to day 32 then we
can quit because there aren't any there
aren't 32 days in a month so the first
thing I can do is just print out how
much we have just so we know so printf
and I'll just put something like um day
percent D and might as well give you a
tab and then we'll do a mount and then
after this arm we'll just go ahead and
put the dollar sign and then we'll build
a float float and line if you want to
point to new line and of course the two
pieces of info we need for this are day
and amount so this is pretty much going
to tell you on your first day you had
one penny tomato tomahto keep track of
all of that for us so after this what do
we want to occur what do we actually
need a program well the only things
we're going to be doing is taking our
amount and we're going to be multiplying
it by two so remember that little
shorthand I told you guys earlier - or
excuse me multiplied equal to it pretty
much multiplies this by two and sets it
is the new value for amount so it's
pretty much equals amount equals amount
times two that's all now after this we
need to add one today because remember
if we don't then this program is just
going to keep running forever which
isn't that bad because we keep making
money but you know it needs to stop
eventually
so I think we are good to go let's run
it and see what happens you got to close
out of this
all right check it out so on day one
move this over so you guys can see the
code so on day one you had one penny it
pretty much said okay of course the days
one right now which is less than or
equal to thirty one that is why I print
that out and then it goes ahead and at
times your penny by two and also adds
day or excuse me adds a value of one
today so day is now equal to two so then
a tested day is a less than or equal of
31 yes it is print that stuff out and it
did it all the way in your penny kept
Dublin one two four eight sixteen all
the way until you got to day 31 and
check this out holy crap okay I can't
even read this okay so we have ten
million dollars seven hundred and thirty
seven thousand four hundred and eighteen
so whoever decided to double the penny
was a lot smarter than whoever just took
two million dollars on day one even
though you know what I probably be happy
with both so that is what we did and
that is an example of an awesome way to
use a loop so if we didn't know how to
use loops then we would have to type
this code um pretty much 31 times and it
would be a pain our program would be
like I don't know like 900 lines long so
now you just do it and what is this five
lines of code pretty frickin awesome
so again that is what a loop is and
that's why one of the reasons why
computers are incredibly powerful
so anyways for now hopefully you guys
understood the concept in the next
tutorial I want to talk to you guys
about another kind of loop which is
pretty stinkin awesome - so then guys
for watching we're going to subscribe
and I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
