tesoro and actually this is the last
tutorial where I'm going to be covering
materials for now and in this store what
I'm going to be doing is I'm going to be
covering the specular control of a
material in other words how to control
the shininess of a material and it's
going to be awesome so well stay tuned
so the first thing we want to do is
we're going to be adding three textures
so go ahead and remember our shortcut
hold down T on your keyboard and click
three times one two three now one of
them is going to be plugging into the
diffuse one of them is going to be
plugging into the specular and last one
is just going to be a normal map so go
ahead and I already know what textures I
want to use so go ahead and clear
everything out and we're going to be
searching for something called ceramic
now go ahead and might as well search
textures and check it out I want to use
this cool Alliance base texture I think
that looks pretty cool and you can see
by the last letter the D symbolizes the
diffuse the N symbolizes the one we're
going to be plugging in the normal map
in the sm symbolizes specular map that
is a map that basically controls which
areas of the map should be shiny so let
me go ahead and grab my textures and I
want to associate this one with the
diffuse so I'm going to go ahead and do
that by clicking the arrow right there
let's plug that in right now I'll
associate this one with the normal map
so go ahead and do that or at narrow and
I want to associate this one with a
specular map so go ahead and do that
right there so like I was saying before
let me go ahead and give this set up and
we can go ahead and expand this we're
done with that for now so like I said
before the specular map is basically a
map that shows what areas should be
shiny so basically you have a map that
consists of black white and gray the
black spots say are right I don't want
those spots to be shiny at all the white
spots are basically the glossy spots
those are the spots that should be
really shiny so as you can see kind of
the top strip right here that has since
that's kind of grey on our map
that's going to be shiny this area right
here is going to be really shiny in this
part right here this kind of brown area
since it's totally black on our map as
you can see that part's not going to be
shiny at all it's going to be dull so
that's what a specular map is so let's
go ahead and if we go ahead and unplug
this we can see that we lose a little
bit of the shine but it's really not
shining as much as we'd like it to so in
order to do that we're going to go ahead
and boost the shininess by multiplying
it by a value now we're already familiar
with this and we actually know a
shortcut to do that go ahead and hold em
on your keyboard and click wherever you
want that multiply box the pop up so now
let's go ahead and plug in your specular
mass 2a and we of course need another
value to multiply it by so we can just
go ahead and add a constant by having
new constant and let's go ahead and plug
this in right now so we don't forget and
further constants value I'm going to
pick something like 150 that should be a
pretty good value so now if I go ahead
and plug this in the specular check it
out our object is now incredibly
awesomely shiny so let me go ahead and
rotate this so we can see maybe that's a
better view so now you can see hmm want
to get a real good view here well I
guess the lights coming from that
direction so basically you can see that
the gray areas which is the top strip
and especially this face is really
glossy in those areas such is this brown
area right here isn't really glossy
because that was the part that was a
black on our specular map so as you can
see check out the difference whenever I
disconnected that is our map by default
it kind of looks like a plain block of
cement with some blue paint painted on
and now by adding the specular attribute
we can get some definite boost and shiny
kind of turns into like a metal block
rather than you know just a cement one
so aside from that what we can do is we
can further control the specularity or
the shininess control by adding another
attribute to the specular power so that
being said let me give you guys another
tip if you hold down control in all on
your keyboard injury
egg you get a box around your selected
items and that way you can go ahead and
you can actually group them into group
which I don't want to do now I just want
to move them to the side over here
pretty cool huh so now what I want to do
is I want to mess with the specular
control a little bit so this specular
control just takes a constant number so
let me go ahead and right-click constant
new constant and go ahead and plug this
in right now and by default here's how
it works low numbers give you a big
shining this area it's kind of like if
you were to shine a big lamp on it the
whole area would be lit and zero is a
pretty low number so that's why this
whole entire area is lit big numbers
such as like 500 give you a really
specific small shinin ceria it's kind of
like shining a small flashlight or laser
so a big area like 0 gives you a big
area a small number like 200 gives you a
very specific area just like that you
see where I'm saying so let's go ahead
and give it something like put a
somewhere in the middle like four and
this kind of lights up our area my wanna
give it a bigger let's say 220 pretty
good median so check it out so with
controlling the specular attribute and
the specular property you pretty much
have all the control you would ever want
over the shininess or glossiness of your
material so that's all I had talked with
you guys about in this tutorial let me
think if I forgetting anything no I
think that's pretty much it so that's
how you control the shininess of your
material so thank you guys for watching
to subscribe and don't forget if you
have any questions just go ahead and ask
me on my forum because i rarely look at
my youtube comments i'm sorry to admit
that so anyways talk to me on my forum
and i'll be happy to chat with you so
thank you guys for watching and I'll see
in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
