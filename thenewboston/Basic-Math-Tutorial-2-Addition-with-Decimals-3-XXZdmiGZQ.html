decimals have fractions of a whole
number so this is 75 in 6/10 you can see
here how we had the ones place the tens
place and so on and so forth well now we
have the tenths spell tenths with the th
don't get that confused with tens and we
have the hundredths place spell
hundredths versus the hundreds just know
the difference between the two so we do
the same exact thing as we do with the
whole numbers we start on the very last
end and even though there's not a zero
here just pretend that there's a 0 so 0
+ 8 is 8 6 + 0 6 bring down the decimal
point a dozen points very important that
you bring it down exactly where it is 5
+ 5 is 10 put the zero there as a
placeholder carry over the 1 7 8 9 and
there's our product so over here we do
the same exact thing 4 + 2 is 6 bring
down the decimal point 8 + 2 is 10
placement holder carry over the 1 9 + 1
is 10 plus 6 is 16 care of the 1 bring
down the 6 + 1 on 1 is 2 so different
color and over here don't let this
confuse you just put an imaginary
decimal point right there an imaginary
zero as a placeholder we have 0 + 1 is 1
bring down the decimal point we have two
and one is three four and four is eight
6 + 5 is 11 put the one over there bring
down the one right there and 10 same
yellow over here don't let this confuse
you put an imaginary little doesn't
point right there and two zeros in
actuality there can be infinite amount
of 0 so you can keep on
from so on and so on so zero nine is
nine zero and two is to bring down the
decimal point zero and 5 is 5 7 3 is 10
and this example 2 + 6 is 8 0 &amp;amp; 2 is to
bring down the decimal point 6 + 7 is 13
carry over the 1 9 + 1 is 10 + 8 is 18
carry over the 1 bring down the 8 4 + 2
is 6 plus 1 is 7 and bring down the 1
over here if you get good at placement
holders you just know that there's two
placements behind the decimal point
so you start with a 7 and go to over
it's 9 and 7 &amp;amp; 9 is 16 you want to start
way over here way to the right carry
over the one you can put it wherever you
want on top of there on top of there
91 is 10 plus 6 is 16 carry the 1 and
you have to make sure it's two sixes
make sure you put the decimal point six
in two is eight plus one is nine make
sure you have enough room there 8 + 8 is
16 bring over the 1 + 1 + 1 is 2 so
that's 2 60 to 69 point 66 so over here
we have 2000 points so pretend that
there's an imaginary zero right there
let's change colors so 5 + 0 is 5 8 and
zeros eight decimal point 6 + 3 is 10 9
+ 2 + 1 is 3
all right over here with two decimal
places over so 7 + 9 is 16 carry the 1 8
+ 1 is 9 8 + 3 is 10 11 I'm sorry sorry
is that
carry over the one we have 7 and 3 is 10
plus 1 is 11 and then 4 + 1 is 5 plus 1
is 6 and that's all we have for addition
with decimals</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
