final oh crap I got to write this
frickin thing down 30 second ha ha you
see I'm not messing up any more 30
second Ajax tutorial and in this video
I'm going to be talking to you guys
about how to handle an XML response from
the server now if you guys are like
alright you know what instead of making
this entirely different function why
didn't you just handle the response
right here instead of calling a new
function well the reason that I like to
separate handle state change in handle
response is because I first of all it's
very bulky if we try to handle it right
here and our code gets very messy and
also I like to have one function that
just checks and make sure that you're
hooked up to the server correctly and
then in this handle response actually
let me copy that we don't have to do any
error checking it's all pure
functionality pure code so this like I
said once you dig through all the layers
of fat that's when you get to all the
good stuff so now we're finally here I'm
so freaking excited I got to call my mom
hold on not just kidding alright so
handle the response from the server of
course it's about function wrong this
function name is handle response now
what this is basically going to do is
loop through or go through the XML file
and grab all of the important data that
we need like the names and the social
security sorry I got phlegm in my throat
social security numbers and do something
with them we're just going to print them
out on the screen because you know it's
the most simple thing so the first thing
that we need to do is we actually need
to store this entire response as an XML
object so in order to do that just go
ahead and make a variable or object
whatever you want to call it and say XML
response now what this is basically
going to be is the entire file itself so
set this equal to XML let me let me see
if I can steal my object from somewhere
XML HTTP response XML so now we got the
entire response which is basically this
entire file stored in this variable XML
response simple enough so now what we
want to do is we want to start
extracting the information but we can't
just you know reach our hands in and
grab let's say the name of my clitoris
we can't just we need to do it in very
programmatically I don't even know if
that's a word but that's my word I'm
just freaking make them up making it up
very programmatically way so in order to
do this we go through the hierarchy of
the XML file we got the response now we
need to get the root element and then we
can dig down and get all the sexy
information so the first thing we need
to do is extract the root element so in
order to do that just go ahead and take
your XML response and there's a function
called document element let me to make
sure I spelled that and that it's
actually a property not a function but
what this property is is it basically
gets the root element of a file so
remember this file which was the XML
file has a root element called response
so now this variable root is now equal
to basically this element response so
now we can say okay and by the way all
XML files need a root element and it
makes it so easy to work with so once we
have that root element which is response
then we can extract all the sweet
information so root is basically the
response tag just think that so now what
we want to do is we're not really
worried about that response tag we're
only worried about the people's names
and Social Security numbers so we have
two people right now but generally if
you had a company let's say big
corporation you would have thousands or
you know hundreds of people so I'm going
to show you guys instead of doing it one
by one this is how you get an array of
all won't just go ahead and do the names
first
so go ahead and name your array I'm just
going to name it names which are
people's names and set it equal to the
root dot get elements by tag name now
what this is going to do is you're going
to pass it a parameter in other words
you're going to pass it on the name of a
tag so basically you're going to pass it
the word name or SSN someone is mowing
their freaking lon
as soon as I start making these
tutorials everyone decides it's good
it's good idea or a good time to like
chop down a tree mow the lawn my dogs
feel like barking farting anyways I'm in
the middle of a freaking tutorial and
okay let's go ahead and pass in name and
what this is going to do now is it's
going to say okay
I'm going to look at the route which is
basically looking at this XML file and
I'm going to get all of the information
by tag name and I'm going to store it in
an array called names so now what this
did is it said okay okay the first one
Bucky Roberts that's the first element
in our array next one mike litoris
that's the second element in our array
but nothing left so our array is two
elements long the first element at index
zero is Bucky and index one is mike
litoris so that's how you kind of sort
through an array and as you can see it
takes one line and it doesn't matter if
you have a hundred employees or ten
thousand employees or only two like we
have in this example this is how you do
it quickly and efficiently so of course
to do the social security number it's
very similar names which is call this
one Social Security numbers ssns now of
course the only thing we need to change
is the get element by tag name because
the tag of the social security number
isn't name it's SSN so if you pass SSN
in here what it's going to do is it's
going to create another array and it's
first going to store this and then store
this so now we have two arrays that we
just create
that they're each two elements long the
first one stores the users names or the
employees names and the second one
stores their social security numbers
pretty freakin sweet so now the only
thing we have left to do is basically
print them out on the screen run the
program and make sure everything is
working successfully so there's a very
specific way that we need to actually
loop through each ray and we can
actually print them out simultaneously
so we don't have to make two loops we
can all put it in one loop so I'm
actually going to be showing you guys
how to do that in the next video but for
now thanks for watching I'm going to
subscribe and I'll see you guys then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
