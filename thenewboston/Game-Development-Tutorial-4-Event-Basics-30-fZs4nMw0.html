tutorial and in this tutorial I'm going
to be going over events now what an
event is is every time a user does
something such as click their mouse or
press a button on the keyboard it's
called an event and in this story I'm
going to say how to get those user
events how to recognize them and once
you know that the user did something how
to do something with it so I already
have some stuff that I kept from the
last tutorial so if you don't know what
this is then watch my last tutorials I
got the ball in the image file path I
also imported all the stuff we needed to
import initialize the stuff we need to
initialize I already created a screen or
display and that's pretty much just a
window that's 640 by 360 and I got that
background image in that mouse cursor
image ball ready to use so now let's go
ahead and get to what we've been waiting
for events so what I'm gonna be building
in this tutorial is when the user press
up down left or right on their keyboard
I want to move that ball either up down
left or right so we need four new
variables we need X&amp;amp;Y X Y might as well
build them instead just talking about it
I move my cursor 0 0 we're gonna set the
X and y coordinate to 0 0 2 you know
just because we need to set in to
something and we will also want to make
two more temporary variables which is
move X and move Y and we're also gonna
want to set these to 0 0 just so we have
something to start out at and what we're
gonna do is um well you'll see what
we're doing a little bit but now let's
get to the heart of our game and that's
the main event loop this is the loop
that's going to keep our program alive
and be running over and over so make it
a while true and this is make sure that
whatever's in here just keeps going
going so this is where we're gonna be
building the most of our program so now
let me explain what I kind of briefed
over in the last tutorial and that's the
4 event in PI game event dot get every
time like I said the user does something
it's stored in an event so if they do a
bunch of different things like press key
on the keyboard click mouse press Y on
their keyboard press spacebar it's
stored in a huge list of events so what
this does is go through that huge list
of events and it tests each event and if
one of them's an event that we want then
it performs action so this pretty much
loops through all of the possible events
and gets out the ones we want so let me
go ahead and explain what I kind of just
went real through last time and that's
the quit event every event has a type
then this is either like cooking your
mouse button down as a type releasing
your mouse buttons type clicking the
quit button is a type clicking a key on
your keyboard is a type so let me just
explain what's going on I'm gonna test
if they press the quit on the window
which is this clicking this little X
button right here is the quit type so
let's go ahead and say if let me get my
space event type is exactly equal to
quit then you're you say alright if they
clicked that quit button which is if
that's the event they did what do you
want to do well I want to take pygame
and I pretty much want to quit it and so
that's the goin method to quit Pi game
and I also want to exit my system and
just to make sure that exits on every
system um all right so now we know what
to do if they um press the X button
which is the quit event type now let's
test for another type another event type
they can do is press a key down on their
keyboard and this event type is called
key down so let's test for that if event
I'm gonna get my period right if event
type is exactly equal to key down
ey do WN this Marines if they pressed a
key down on their keyboard what do you
want to do well the first thing that's
probably going to be useful is to figure
out which key they press down so let's
do that
and each key has a special character and
this is called the event key so this is
how we test for what key they press down
so let's go ahead and create if event
key K UI is exactly equal to K
underscore left what do we want to do
and let me do a little quick sub
tutorial on this k underscore stuff
every button on your keyboard has
built-in name for it so k underscore
left is that left button on your
keyboard k underscore a is the a button
on your keyboard
k underscore G is the G button on your
keyboard every weird button like space
and enter has a special thing like this
but for now just follow along so anytime
I write k D that means the D button on
your keyboard so if they pressed the
left button right here the left button
on your keyboard then what do I want to
do well I want to take the position on
x-axis and movie equal to negative 1
this is gonna move it left so move X is
equal to the negative 1 and I'm gonna
need to do this fall for all the keys so
if event key is exactly equal to K
underscore right what I want to do I
want to move it on the x-axis again but
this time I want to move it to the right
so move x equals they get ya positive 1
so actually I want to do Elif for else I
can't have a bunch of if statements and
I'm gonna need to go through this and go
through K up K down and so let's do that
right now
Elif actually that should be K why don't
you tell me that LS it
key is exactly a que underscore up what
I want to do is move wide move Y and set
this equal to negative one in this
version to another point when you're
yeah if you're like a in high school and
math class
I think negative 1 on the y axis is down
but since 0 0 on your computer screen is
the top left corner anytime you do
negative it's up so I know it's
confusing but just pay attention you'll
figure it out so L event key is exactly
equal to K underscore it down what you
want to do is move Y move y no I'm not
spelling movie is equal to positive 1 so
this story is getting kind of long but
those are the basics of an event so in
this one every event has a type and
that's mouse up Mouse down key up key
down quit and so the first thing we want
to test for right now is if they press
the key down so if they press a key down
what I want to do is go through this and
test what key they press down so that's
your basics on events and the next
tutorial I'm going to be showing you I'm
gonna be pretty much finishing this
tutorial and moving that ball around so
um thank you guys for watching and don't
forget to check out the next tutorial
where I'll be finishing this so again
thank you don't forget to subscribe and
I'll see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
