cocos2d tutorial and in this tutorial
where we're gonna be covering is
collidable areas but before i address
that let me talk about something I got a
couple of comments in the last video I
posted and whenever you guys saw the
dude and move around on screen you're
saying alright it would be a lot cooler
if it looked like the guy was walking
and said do you know just hopping from
tile to tile so what I'm gonna do is
when we finish all the basics for this
game I'm gonna teach you guys about
animation and cocos2d and you can have
different frames to make it look like
the guy is actually walking from tile
tile instead of just hopping from tile
tile and make it look like a better game
and you know make it fun or for the use
of Bert for now I just want to cover the
core you know the core programming and
then we can get into the advanced
intricate stuff but we don't even know
what animation is in cocos2d yet so
we'll just leave that alone for now so
like I said well I'm gonna be covering
in this story it was collidable areas on
the map for example our dude was able to
hop into these trees and he was able to
hop on the fence and on the mountains
but when we were programming in game and
if you ever played a game like Pokemon
or Zelda
there are some areas of the map that
your character just can't go these areas
are off-limits so what we want to do is
set these areas to collidable so your
guy just can't walk right through them
he's gonna have to bump into them walk
around them do something else but just
to be able to walk right through them
because you know if you can walk through
anything what's the point of having a
map so let's go ahead and do that right
now how we do this is the easiest way is
just to add a new tire tile layer not
tire layer so go ahead and push layer
add tile layer and then just go ahead
and sticking with our two-letter
convention let's just name it st and
make sure you have that layer selected
and then go to map new tile set and what
I did is well for the name you can just
put like special tiles and I went ahead
and I downloaded this one off the
internet open
and make sure your margin and spacing
set to 1:1 and I'll post this in the
link below so you guys can download it
too and you know work with me from this
tutorial but what this is is someone
made this and it's pretty much this a
red block with partial transparency in a
green block with partial transparency
and they made this so you can just paint
over any image that you want the person
to collide with and it's you know it's a
lot easier way it's a way that you can
visually see on your map when you're
developing the game what areas we want
to do to be able to collide with so I'm
not gonna be talking let's just go ahead
and do that so go ahead and select that
red block it's gonna turn blue my voice
just crack that's kind of embarrassing
alright so select that it turns blue but
we know it's still red and hit your
stamp tool right here and now paint any
areas that you want your dude to collide
with and as you can see since this has
partial transparency you're still going
to be able to see the underlying image
but you clearly know since it's painted
red that this dude is not going to be
able to walk her right through this part
of the map so I'm not gonna want him to
be able to walk through the mountains or
the fence and I'm also gonna want him to
be able to bump into the trees not gonna
be able to walk through that so go ahead
and paint all of these red there we go
again he's probably gonna be able to
walk through a patch of flowers in the
grass and obviously the path so only
paint the things red that you want him
to have to bump into just like that so
now what we need to do in our program is
say alright these red tiles we need to
give them a property so whenever we're
writing this in code we need to be able
to identify these tiles so here's how we
do this in your tile set right here go
ahead and right click this red tile and
click tile properties just like this and
now we want to give this a property and
you can name it whatever you want just
name it
collidable and give a value of true not
try true just like that so this is the
part in our code that we're going to be
able to identify these different tiles
what we're going to be doing is saying
are a there are some tiles and they have
a property of collidable if that's equal
to true then don't let the dude move
there so you know that's a little
preview of what we're gonna be doing but
for now make sure everything's photo
right all right looks good and click OK
and now what we have to do is file save
and now go ahead and quit tiled and now
what we need to do is actually import
this in our Xcode project so go ahead
open Xcode open RPG just like this all
right so now again if you didn't know
that was named Bucky's map so now what
I'm gonna do is delete this old one and
also move it to your trash that's very
important actually now import this new
updated one resources just like this and
go ahead and copy this and add and you
also need to import this tile set right
here
copy add looks good so now let me make
sure all right this all looks good right
here again this might have a different
path if it has just changed it to your
main you know no path at all just
straight file name dot ping but anyways
now that everything should be updated oh
another thing you're going to need to do
and trust me you need to do this or it's
gonna mess up highlight your main
project right here and click build clean
all targets and clean and now it says
clean succeeded what this means pretty
much is even though you imported your
new map it might have like the old map
in memory so whenever you build your
project and things aren't working you're
like all right I imported my new map
everything should be refreshed it
doesn't work that way we're gonna have
to clean everything and then once it
rebuilds it gets all the new stuff so
another thing you might want to look out
for but now that we have our map updated
and imported and we have everything
cleaned we're ready to begin typing some
code but I'm actually going to do that
in next tutorial since there's a lot of
code we have to cover and not that much
time in this video so for now thank you
guys for watching make sure you got your
map set up how you want it and then
you're ready move on to the next
tutorial so thank you guys for watching
don't forget to check out my forum and
don't forget the bye my iPhone games are
pretty cool and uh yeah that's all I got
to say had to throw on the plug there
somewhere so uh yeah see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
