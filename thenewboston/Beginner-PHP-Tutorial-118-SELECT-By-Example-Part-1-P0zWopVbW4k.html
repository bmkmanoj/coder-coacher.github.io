back with another video for the new
Boston now we've already looked at
selecting data from our database and we
did this using the code here if you
haven't already looked at the previous
tutorial that explains this code and
you're not comfortable looking at this
code and understanding what it does I
suggest you go back and view that
tutorial as well as if you haven't
looked at the general tutorial on
queries and using MySQL then I recommend
you view them as well now what we've
done here is we've selected a specific
field names from this table called food
where unhealthy equals u and calories
equals zip r700 so we've been quite
specific and in this case we've only
retrieved one value that's the icecream
value here with the ID of four now what
we want to do is be able to take user
input in order to return specific values
so let's say I want the user to be able
to specify if they want a list of
unhealthy food or healthy food or maybe
if they want to specify a maximum or
minimum calorie amount but for now we're
just going to go for the unhealthy
healthy food option and then the rest of
that will be self explanatory for your
own purposes so we're going to keep the
code we've already got here let's just
tidy this up a bit so it's a bit more
combined
if I will separate it just so it's
easier to view okay so what we now want
to do is take user input so we want to
come down here or in fact up to the top
we could do let's just cut off this
require here and reopen a tag there for
the rest of the PHP and we can put our
HTML in here now I'm going to create a
form and that's going to have an action
of the page that we're going the world
at the moment and the method is going to
be get just so we can see what's going
on in the URL bar at the top because
eventually what we're going to be aiming
for is something like Ronnie index dot
PHP
I want to aim for something like you H
equals you for unhealthy or H for
healthy so we're using this get variable
here to specify a value so what we want
to do is we want to create a field and
I'm going to say I'm going to create a
select field and this is going to be
called an you H and and inside we're
going to have our option so we need
option we're going to have a first
option and we're going to have a second
option
and these options are unhealthy or
healthy I can spell it correctly so
option value equals we'll just say you
and option value equals H so now let's
create a submit button we'll go down a
couple of lines and say input type
equals submit and the value of that can
just be a submit so that's what's being
displayed to the user and we'll add
something that's a bit more
user-friendly so choose a food type I
guess that would be fine
okay so let's um let's first of all okay
we'll leave that for now so let's press
f5 and choose a food type and unhealthy
or healthy now ignore this for now
because in the PHP code we've got a
static a quit a static query which we
which we predefined
so ignore this for now but eventually
what our form will do is it will produce
a list of foods depending on what the
user selects here so now what we're
doing is as well as creating our query
we're allowing the user to specify
things that they want to return this is
really useful in today applications so
I'm going to click on unhealthy and
click submit and you can see that up
here we've got you h equals u and here
we can say healthy click Submit u H
equals H so it was we're processing get
data through to the URL and then we can
process that in our query so how do we
do this well the first thing we need to
do is inside our PHP here we need to
check if these values have been
submitted so I'm going to say if is set
dollar underscore get u H then proceed
with all of this code here and then what
we can do is indent everything we've
already got inside just so it looks a
lot nicer
so in them that so if is set get
you H and not empty dollar underscore
get you H now what we can do is we can
say you H equals dollar underscore get
you H now let's um let's kill the script
there and echo this out so we know we
can we're basically testing for this
being submitted
so we'll refresh the page back to
index.php okay so we've got nothing
there now as we've killed the page
choose a food type unhealthy or healthy
so let's select unhealthy first and we
should be submitted and a you here for
unhealthy and now healthy submit and
we've got an H there okay so now what we
can do is we can insert this value
that's selected into our query to allow
the query to become more dynamic and
select the food type either whether
unhealthy or healthy depending on the
users input now before we start this
there is a problem that we do have here
and we have a potential for SQL
injection and I have a video on SQL
injection in this new book for this
series for the new Boston so have a look
at that video before you run anything
like this on a live web server because
you'll tend to find that queries can be
modified using data so for example if I
was submitting this this H value here is
eventually going to go into a query so I
could change this to something it
wouldn't be select star but just for
example I could change that so we can
input different things into our query
that doesn't make sense now it will do
in a moment so input equals H that's a
good point actually let's also make this
our STR all know maybe this STR to lower
so it always converting this to
lowercase in case people try to modify
the URL and
anything like that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
