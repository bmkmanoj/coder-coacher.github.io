slash on live gamer for the New Boston
in this tutorial we're gonna be working
on taking an account the spinach
multiplier now you may remember I said
something about this in one of the
previous tutorials and we're just now
getting around to adding that in I added
the hooking the log to the form 1 and
hiding and showing the log in between
that so now your program should look
like this so if you notice if we attack
it says Popeye has used punch for 5
damage well if we use spinach and attack
it says Popeye has used punch for 5
damage it doesn't take in account the
has spinach multiplier so there is an
easy fix for that we can just go ahead
and close out of this and what we can do
is whenever we create an event let's see
here
probably function create event so it's
string name equals Popeye then what do
you want to do well will declare damage
as an integer and what we're gonna do is
we're going to use an if statement will
set damage equal to nothing so it'll
quit crying about that
so if hero dot has spinach then what do
we want to do damage is going to be
equal to and let's say for blank damage
so hero die attack damage at index 0 dot
attacked numb so hero
dot attack damage so we're accessing
this array at the index of attack num
which is the randomly generated number
and so if he has this finish then we
want to multiply that by 2 and so we
could put an else statement right here
but instead I just thought of this we
can go ahead and
set it equal to hero dot attack damage
and the index of hero dot attack num so
it's gonna start off by using the base
damage as the variable damage but then
if it has spinach it's gonna set that
equal to the damage times two so instead
of putting all this long code in right
here we can just do damage x equals two
so we'll come down over here and instead
of having all of this array accessing
and the index values we can just go
ahead and put damage in so for damage
dot two string damage so let's go ahead
and run this and you can see here that
here is our game loaded up and you see
the log is stuck to it so let's go ahead
and hide the log we can attack you see
takes away ninety five so we can assume
that he punched and then the dragon took
away ten damage and so we can show the
log you can see that it's it goes it'll
go ahead and add steps to the log even
if it's not shown because it doesn't
actually close out of it it just hides
it for the time being so let's go ahead
and use a spinach multiplier so we go
ahead and click attack says he has used
kicked for kick for twenty damage now
the kick has a base damage of ten now
let's go ahead and we won't use spinach
you can see it gives us kick for a ten
damage because we didn't use the spinach
and we can use spinach again see used
anchor throw for thirty and then I
believe we should be able to use it one
more time looks like it so we can use a
spinach and they used kick for twenty
damage now you can't see that there
sorry but it says anchor throw for
thirty and then kick for twenty damage
and we don't have any spinach left so we
can't use that
go ahead and click that and say we get
Dragon has used cloth for eight damage
then when you just kick for ten damage
and if we tack one more time says Popeye
has one and you can see that Popeye has
one down here and it spawned a another
enemy for us
so go ahead and hide that log so go
ahead put this code in if you haven't
already and then once you do that this
is actually the final tutorial for the
game you can keep adding to it if you
want you can add graphics or so we're
going to be learning about soon and if
you guys have any completed projects you
can go ahead and put a video response if
you want that'd be best in in the reply
to this video or you can just leave a
comment saying that you finished it so
if you have any questions leave them in
the comments and if not go ahead and
move on to the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
