Photoshop cs6 tutorial my name is buddy
Blackford and today we're gonna work
with liquify again and we're gonna go
over some of the tool options so let's
go ahead and apply our liquify filter
whoops that's the one that I just used
filter liquify there we go
and we've got the liquify filter here
I'm gonna turn this little thing down
our my brush size down a little bit and
if you want to actually go ahead and
click on advanced mode now the liquify
tool options control the brush tip since
all the liquify commands are executed
with a brush it's a good idea to
understand how you control the brush tip
so when you apply a brush stroke the
faster you drag the less effect is
applied to the image so if I do that
that's a fast quick drag and that's a
less effect now if I drag slowly more
effect is applied to this image as you
can see it goes way farther in and
everything like that ok
so let's go over some of the tool
options over here we've got our brush
size and this can go now go all the way
up to 15,000 in cs5 and below it went to
1500 pixels but now we can go up to
15,000 it's way bigger than my picture
or my picture is actually alright so I'm
gonna bring this back down to something
manageable and you can change the brush
size with the left and right bracket
keys for quickness and as you see it
goes down incremental II by something
like algorithm or some mathematical
thing that Photoshop figured out all
right now the next thing that we've got
is brush density and this is in the
Advanced Mode it's hidden if you don't
have it open so there you go and
you can control how much the breath
brush feathers at the ends so I put this
all the way down to zero and I start
moving stuff you can see that's what it
looks like and then if I bring it up to
the highest which is a hundred this is
what it looks like way more okay
so put this at fifty we'll just keep it
around there somewhere the next thing is
brush pressure and it determines how
quickly the effect is applied to the
image when the brush is moving so when
you have a lower value it slows the
effect so this is at 100% right now and
if I bring this down lower and start
moving it I was just doing it right
there and you can see barely anything
happened let me bring this up higher so
we can maybe see something but there you
go so it lessens the effect when you
have it down lower when you have it up
higher it increases the effect that's
with a hundred so that's how it works
and then we've got brush right down here
which is also advanced and the brush
rate it determines how quickly the
liquify effect is applied to the image
when the brush is stationary so I have
to go to something like this twirl
clockwise tool and then you can see the
brush rate I put it all the way up to
100 it's gonna spin it fast and if I put
it down to like 17 look how slow it's
it's spinning it very very slowly so
I'll put that back up to 80 ish around
there we've got a stylus pressure here
and if you're using a drawing tablet
that's gonna be available to you but I'm
not using a mouse so you can use
pressure to affect the actual liquefying
effect and then we've got reconstruct
options so you can reconstruct the image
stage-by-stage after using this
reconstruct here right now let's try to
do something here
make that and then I go to my
reconstruct and now I've got the
reconstruct the entire image or I can't
click restore all and it brings it back
to its original state
so those are the options I wanted to go
over with you in this tutorial and
hopefully you guys learned some new
things and it's important to know how
your brush works and how you can affect
it using these tool options and
reconstruct options so thanks a lot for
watching this tutorial be sure to check

lot everybody have a good day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
