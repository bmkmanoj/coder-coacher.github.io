tutorial and in this tutorial I'm going
to be showing you guys how to check
their forum till when they enter all
their information we want to validate it
and make sure it's all right and also if
it is we want to send them a
confirmation email so they can actually
sign up for the game and just a reminder
to you guys um if you go to my website
that New Boston comm and scroll down
until PHP all of my source code is right
here for twenty seven twenty eight and
I'm going to put twenty nine after this
and another thing make sure you're
watching these videos in high quality if
you can't even read what I'm typing
right now watch in high quality and it's
going to be crystal clear and any
questions that you have sign up for my
forum at the New Boston calm and ask me
them there I never check my youtube
messages so if you ask me on my forum
the new boss and calm I guarantee I will
answer them for you so now whenever the
user submits all this data it's not
going to actually check the data right
here it's going to go to register next
PHP and it's going to validate all the
data there
so what we need to do is actually make a
file and we're going to say this as
register next dot PHP and the purpose of
this file is to validate all the data
that we got from this form in register
dot PHP and remember whatever the action
is that's what script is going to go so
under your new file you just created
register dot PHP the first thing that
well the first thing that I'm going to
do is make my PHP tags the second thing
that you're going to want to do in the
last tutorial maybe we remember we made
in a file to connect to our database we
want to include that anytime we're going
to be adding information or getting it
from our database we need to add
connection HP and make sure that those
are in single quotation tags so now that
we have included the connection file we
can connect to our database and I
remember I named mine like connect or
con FFF or something but just to show
you guys what did it yours is going to
be different but whatever is put include
and whatever your connection file is
remember we did this in the last
tutorial include it right there
the next thing or the very first thing
that you're going to want to do is test
if the username is alpha numeric and if
it isn't then we want to post the error
messages and this is what I mean by that
in the website already made oh let's go
Cora calm I don't have anything
embarrassing in my history do I know
alright just checking I don't I don't
want to post this video and have
something embarrassing in there tecora
calm and this is what we're going to be
creating in this tutorial we want the
user to enter a password with like or
username with letters and numbers like
this or gregg 55 but if the user enters
anything that has like symbols like that
then whenever they register we want them
to say username must only contain
letters and numbers so they got to error
messages an error message that's what
we're going to be doing today let's go
ahead and close that we don't need
anymore so the code for that let's enter
a comment so we know what you're doing
test to see if user name is alpha
America yeah ice powder wrong I know the
first thing we're going to need to do is
make a variable to test and this
variable is going to be whatever their
user name I mean a the user name they
entered and this is where the post where
are you register dot PHP
this is where the method post and the
name comes in handy whenever you build a
forum in PHP the method and the username
combined to make a variable so the
variable starts out with of course a
dollar sign underscore and then it's the
actions name and since we were using
post that's the name we want now in the
brackets you type whatever the name of
the input is so dollar sign is cord post
was the action or the method right here
in the name is username right there so
ever they typed in for that it's going
to be automatically converted into a
variable called test so let's go ahead
and do something with this information
let's go sit and make an if statement
since we're going to say all right if
your statement is alpha in America then
go ahead and continue on with the
registration else if it's not then we're
going to want you to going to want to
send your error message so first we need
a if statement and an else statement in
um send two actually so we say if then
we test something else if it's not true
then we're going to send you header
location invalid name dot HTML so we're
going to put our test condition right in
here and if it's invalid we're what this
means if it's invalid the other option
we're going to send you to this website
and that's a website that says sorry but
yeah
you entered a name with symbols enter or
something so the test condition for this
is a kind of complicated so pay
attention we want to have the test we
want
this variable to make sure that our code
isn't is not or excuse me is
alphanumeric it only contains on the
letters and numbers so to do that you
need to follow along really closely
because this is really confusing you
need to add a explanation point and type
in e ar e GI this is a built-in function
that PHP uses to test whether variables
are alphanumeric now in your parameters
in that I need you to add quotation
marks around right there quotation marks
first and then you need to add empty
brackets and in your brackets add the up
arrow that's above the six then type in
capital a - capital Z a - Z in lower
case and 0-9 what this is going to do is
test whether this variable is
alphanumeric now if you're saying
alright how do we know what variable to
test the other parameter it takes is the
variable test so again in case you guys
were wondering right here we have a
simple if statement that says I think
I'm missing a parameter somewhere yup
right here right there and right there
and you can see all right here we go
finally if um test right here the two
parameters it takes is what tests do you
want to do and what variable you want to
test so if you say RA if the variable
test is not alphanumeric or is
alphanumeric then we want you to execute
this code which will be typing in in the
next tutorial but if it is if it does
include anything besides this if it
includes anything besides capital
letters lower
letters or number we want you to send it
to the error message that says all right
you have a error something contains an
invalid symbol so again this is the
built-in PHP function right here that
tests the name that the user posted and
make sure that it only contains letters
or numbers so go ahead and again I'm
going to have all this on my website the
New Boston com you can plug all of this
just copy it and paste it in your
website if you want to make it really
easy but again study this make sure you
know how to test if your variable is
alphanumeric and thank you guys for
watching make sure to sign up in my form
the New Boston comm and again don't
forget to be watching these videos in
high quality so again thank you for
watching and I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
