Blackford here with another After
Effects cs6 tutorial and I want to teach
you about color correcting and there's
two ways that I'm gonna teach you and
one of them is harder and I'm gonna
teach you that first because you can use
it to tweak the easier way that I'm
gonna show you and it's gonna be pretty
awesome when I show you the easier way
if you didn't already know how to do it
so I'm gonna show you a couple effects
on how our that we can use to tweak
color correction and show you how they
work pretty much I've got this video
footage here of a lawn mower and it's
pretty much just nothing it's just a
lawn mower and I don't know it shakes a
little bit because someone decided not
to use a tripod when they're doing it I
don't know but I got this video footage
from a guy who asked me to work on it
and like clean up like some of the oil
stains and make it look nice and glow
and stuff like that and I did it and I
gave it to him and he never paid me for
it so now I'm just gonna use this
footage so let's get on with it
so I'm gonna delete off this effect I
already have so I have no effects on
this right now for color correction so
what we're gonna come up to is a layer
and there is a section or mean effect
we're gonna come up to effect make sure
your layer is selected is what I meant
come to a color correction and we've got
a whole bunch of stuff going on here
no most of these I haven't ever even
used but there are a few that I use that
are pretty nice so the ones that you
want to stay away from like the farthest
away from our auto color Auto contrast
and auto levels so these are kind of
like preset things that like I don't
know they don't really work very well
and let's come down to the ones that do
work so I don't have to even spend much
time on those the first one I want to
show you is called curves and this is
used for taking out color or adding in
color making things darker or bro
or whatever so we've got this line here
and this line you can click on it and
you can drag and it affects the color of
the video here let me increase the size
of this video
what's the do fit to fit up to 100% or
whatever so we've got that there and
this line here represents the middle of
what's going on so this how it is right
now
that's no effect has no effect on your
color correction of your video
whatsoever so we look at this dotted
line that's going down the middle right
here and think of that as like your 50%
gray so right here is 50% gray same with
this one going down the middle here and
these are think of these other ones as
25% 50% 70% so that's how you think of
these lines going from left to right and
from up and down this is 25% 50% and 75%
and then I'll make sense in a second so
on the right of the 50% line going up
and down is the brighter areas that's
where the brighter areas are going to
get affected so on the left of it
down here at the bottom that's the
darker area is getting affected if I
click and drag from the left side here
and bring it down the darker areas are
going to get darker and as you can see
the bright areas like the the lights and
this reflection here didn't really get
affected too much if I bring it up
higher the darker areas like watch the
tires or in the background and stuff
like that they're gonna get brighter and
since the since we don't have any other
points on it the embroiderer areas are
also getting affected because I'm moving
the graph and that top part of the graph
is also moving as well now you can click
this button right here to reset it back
to normal which is this straight line
and you can add points in here if you
want and you can move other points
without having to move the points boat
around it so we'll look at the brighter
side real quick so if I drag this part
of the line down it's going to make the
brighter areas darker now it doesn't
fully do it well if I bring it all the
way down it's going to fully blow out
all the bright areas and it looks like
this H in the middle is the brightest
thing there is put that back up to
normal and then if I drag this up the
brighter areas are gonna get brighter
like that fridge in the back is getting
brighter and pretty much everything's
getting brighter when you don't have any
other points except for one on there you
can also click and drag from this top
point to bring the whole entire line
down to brighten the entire scene or
darken the entire scene so this one this
way if you pull it down that that
darkens the entire scene and if you pull
this up from the bottom this will
brighten the entire scene until it goes
out into full light now we can also mess
with the different color values and not
just the entire scene so if we click on
this RGB drop down menu here we can go
into red green blue and we can also mess
with the Alpha let's go into red here
and if I am up here in the brighter
parts gonna take the brighter red out if
I bring this down and it's gonna turn
everything into more blue and green so
now there is no red in this because we
have it all the way down at the bottom
now if I could increase the red and make
it pretty much all red
so that's how that works you can grab it
from the middle at the 50% line and just
like slightly adjust it to get like if
you want to bring it down to get more of
like a an ominous color there and things
like that so that's how you work with
your color correction for at least using
curves I'm gonna turn that off I'm gonna
add another effect this time and this
effect is going to be called tritone so
effect color correction and down at the
bottom is tritone and this one's a quick
way to add like overall color to your
video so if you just want to kind of
like throwing like a piece of colored
saran wrap over the top of your video
almost so what we're gonna do is look at
these highlights mid-tones and shadows
the you want to pretty much keep these
in like the highlights you want to keep
brighter the mid-tones you want to keep
in like a middle kind of color and the
shadows you want to kind of keep in a
darker color here we can mess with the
colors and it'll mess here with the
different values on the video here so if
I come down to something like orange
it's gonna make the overall orange but
as you can see we don't want everything
to beat all this color because it's
pretty stupid looking right now so what
we want to mess with is the blend with
original ok bring that up and just blend
it in a little bit you can see how it
added more of like a blue color to it
and I'll toggle the effect here and you
can see how it actually affected the
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
