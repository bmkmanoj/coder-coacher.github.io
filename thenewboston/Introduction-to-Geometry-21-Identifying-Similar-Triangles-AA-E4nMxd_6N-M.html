triangles and we're going to do that
through this a a property so a a our
angle angle is when you have two angles
of one triangle congruent to two angles
of another triangle and if this is true
you can say therefore the triangles are
similar so using a a we're gonna do some
examples so the directions are find the
missing angles then state if the
triangles are similar so first in order
to find X we have to set these we have
to add these together and set the total
equal to 180 so if we add these two
together we get X plus 144 equals 180 if
we used to track that over we get X is
equal to 36 degrees so now we do the
same thing over here y plus 36 plus 66
equals 180 y plus
102 equals 180 so y equals 78 ok 78 so
we know that y equals 78 so this angle
is congruent with this angle we know X
is equal to 36 and this angle over here
is also equal to 36 so those two are
congruent so therefore triangles are
similar by angle angle and even though
we know that this and this is also
congruent all we need to know is that
two of these are congruent to prove by
angle angle so the directions are the
same we're going to do that with this
new triangle so we know that this is a
right angle and a right angle equals 90
degrees this angle 90 degrees so now
we're gonna use our interior angle
properties and set the angles equal to
180 so if you have those two get
together you get 128 plus a equals 180
so a is equal to 52 so since we know
that this is a right angle and this is a
right angle
that means that these two angles are
congruent because all right angles are
congruent to one another and we know
that this is 52 degrees and this
is 52 degrees so we can say therefore
triangles are similar by angle angle but
we're gonna check this one just for some
extra practice because it should be
congruent to this one so B plus 90 plus
52 is equal to 180 be plus plus 142
equals 180
if you subtract this over you get B
equals 38 so these are also congruent
you don't have to know that to prove
this you just need two angles but we
just went ahead and checked them just
for extra proof so we're gonna so next
lesson we're going to talk about other
ways to prove triangles are similar so
make sure you check that out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
