tutorial that I'm making for the new
Boston and in this tutorial I'm going to
be showing you how to use bitwise
operators a little bit more so all
you're going to need for this tutorial
is a button a short that is equal to
three and a message box displaying that
short in binary so in the previous
tutorial we looked at bits and we looked
at the knot or the invert bitwise
operator in this tutorial we're going to
look at the and operator first and the
and operator is not the same and
operator that we use in if statements
the and operator that we used in if
statements and it's two lands well we're
going to be only looking at one and four
right now so we're just going to do
three and five and this and operator
requires two numbers I'm going to have
one before it and one in front of it so
we're going to do three and five and
notes will not add the two together
instead it compares the two at a bitwise
level so first let's look at what three
and binary is three in binary is one one
so right here and we're going to put 0 1
1 because putting in 0 in front of it
doesn't change the value then I'm just
going to put and then I'm going to put
what 5 in binary is 5 in binary is on 1
0 1 so to put 1 0 1 here put an equal
sign so what it will do is it will do 3
&amp;amp; 5 or on a bitwise level 2 0 1 1 and 1
0 1 and like I said before it will not
add them together
instead we'll compare them and since
these two are the same it will do a 1 so
since these are both ones then it'll do
a 1 if these are different bits then it
will do a 0 and since these are
different again it will do a 0 and since
all these ones in front of it are all
zeros it will just do a whole bunch of
zeros because if they're the same it'll
do what they are the same at so since
these are both ones they'll do a 1 and
if these are both all in front of here
are all zeros it will do a 0 so in a
message box you should just get a 1
yep if we were to look at the and
operator going 3 &amp;amp; 5 3 &amp;amp; 4
let's look at with 4 is binary for and
binary 1 0 0 let's change this to 0 so
now once again we'll check to see if
these are the same
1 &amp;amp; 0 are not the same so local to 0
again 1 &amp;amp; 0 are not the same you'll do a
0 &amp;amp; 0 &amp;amp; 1 are not the same so we'll do a
0 and all the ones in front are all 0 so
1 or 0 &amp;amp; 0 is 0 so it would be a bunch
of zeros so in a message box we should
just get a 0
yep now let's take a look at the or
operator and just like in the if
statements we're not doing two or going
didn't one so let's do 3 or 4 and what
that will do is it will compare the bits
just like the and so first it will check
to see since these are both different as
1 is a 1 and 1 is a 0 it will put a 1
this time so as long as between the two
bits there is a 1 then we'll put a 1 so
since this 1 or 0 do another one and 0
or 1 for another one so we should just
get one one one message Bob yep now
let's look at 3 or 5 and once again 5 in
binary is 1 0 1 so we'll do 0 1 and we
should get the same result because 1 or
0 since they're both the same we'll get
a 1 since these are both sensors are 1
here you'll get a 1 and since there's a
1 here we'll get a 1 so like I said
before as long as there's a 1 between
these two bits then we'll get a 1 so it
should get 1 1 1 in a message box yep
and the only way for it to get a 0 over
here is if both the bits are zeros so
that's pretty much
for this tutorial so see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
