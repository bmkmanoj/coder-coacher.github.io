underneath here and basically what this
line is going to do is it's going to set
a request header and we're going to go
to the content type of of when we submit
so let's go ahead and write this out so
we're going to say XML HTTP set request
header so it's almost like the header
function in PHP but this time what we're
doing is we're specifying two parameters
and for the first one was saying content
type and then we're setting the content
type in here and this is application /xw
W and then it's a - again and we're
going to say form
- URL encoded okay so this is basically
saying we're sending for a form data
through as a post and we specify post
here remember now this isn't actually
going to work as it stands because we
need to predefined some parameters that
we want to send and remember the
parameter that we want to send is the
value of this text here so let's go
ahead and create a variable called
parameters and we're going to equal that
to something and then we're going to
append something on the end and the
something here is what we want to be
read as the post variable name so I'm
going to say this is text and then I'm
going to tell us equal to something so
what we can actually do is we can
actually set this now to hello for
example and we need to send these
parameters through now this looks like
get data would by by same text equals
hello we can also say and something
equals hello to or something like that
you know
we can send a limited post variables
through here however now we need to find
a way to send these parameters through
to our updating PHP because at the
moment we've just put them into a
variable what we need to do is we need
to actually put it into the apprentice a
parameters in there so what this is
going to do now is it's going to open
this update dot Inc dot PHP file ready
to post post data we're sending we're
changing the content type of the page so
we can submit the post data successfully
and then we're sending the parameters
through to the page and that's about it
that should work so because I've
specified this post data as hello the
posts term variable names text and the
values hello all we need to do now is
change this to post and you can see and
that we would have posted this value
through as post data so hopefully this
works let's click on submit and you can
see we've got hello so now what we've
done is we've achieved the whole point
of the tutorial and we've posted some
data through the using the post method
but obviously that's not good enough
what we're going to do is we're going to
specify this to be the value of our text
box here so our text input type here so
we're going to say document dot get
element by ID that thing I struggled
with so much earlier and we're going to
say text then we're going to say dot
value so remember what we know we don't
need the parentheses so remember we
essentially echoed out earlier so now
what should happen is we should get this
element by ID which is text down here we
should grab the value of it and post it
through to our update dot in Inc PHP so
it's a bit more dynamic now so we can
test the well how dynamic this is let's
just type in my name and click Submit
then nothing's happened surprise
surprise surprise okay so the problem
here is that I'm still in the frame of
mind with PHP I need to start
remembering we're coding in JavaScript
now
we're going to put a plus two a pen and
not a dot that's why I wasn't working so
let's go back to our page or refresh I'm
going to type my name as I wanted before
click Submit and we've posted this data
through successfully so whatever we type
in here and we click Submit is going to
be posted through to our update Inc PHP
so now in updating dot PHP we need to
start connecting to our database in
order to start putting the data into
this data field inside of our table so
let's just refresh the page so we can
start again in a minute okay so the
first thing we need to do is connect to
our database there's other videos and
connecting to the database this isn't
the greatest way to do it we may
retrieve errors etc etc etc so we refer
back to my older videos to up what other
videos to have a look so when this takes
three parameters we need the host
obviously we need the username we need
the password which for me is just blank
at the moment and then we need to select
our database sort of connected to our
MySQL server now selecting our database
and this is called Ajax so if we go back
over to our MySQL sorry PHP myadmin
our database is called Ajax now what we
need to do is check if this post
variable called text has been set so we
need to say if and we use the is set
here and we say if is set post text do
something and this something is going to
be just for now echo out okay just to
check that everything's working so let's
go back here and type in Alex and click
Submit we get an okay back here so we
know that this value has been set</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
