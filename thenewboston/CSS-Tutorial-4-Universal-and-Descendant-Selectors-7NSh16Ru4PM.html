in CSS last time I talked to you guys
about organization and CSS and this time
I want to talk to you guys about some
certain types of selectors now the first
type of selector I want to go over it's
called the universal selector and the
symbol for this is simply the asterisks
or the symbol above the 8 on your
keyboard
and what this does is for any rules you
type with a universal selector
it applies them to all elements on your
website so for example say we wanted to
change the font to Arial you simply type
font family and set that equal to Arial
and let's make another rule just for fun
let's set the color to red so now that
we typed in two rules and our
declarations this Universal selector
will apply to any element in our body so
let's type some text in here and let's
make a paragraph have text in here
and let's make a heading and have some
text in here too
so as you can see we now have a heading
a paragraph and some basic text in our
body and we have a universal selector
that should change it to Arial and red
so let's save that and take a look at
what it looks like if it were on the
Internet and as you can do we now have
our text in our paragraph and our text
in our heading and it's all applied
thanks to the universal selector so
that's how you use that in another
selector I want to talk to you guys
about today is called the descendant
selector and what this does is tell CSS
to only apply the elements if it's
inside another element so let's say we
wanted to apply the color red to all the
heading threes that are inside the div
element so here's what you would do
type div and add a space and set H 3 as
your selector now what this does is
apply the most recent element if it's
inside this element so for example let's
type our declaration color and we'll set
it equal to red
now what is what's this gonna do is make
all the heading threes read but only if
they're inside a div element so let's
put it to work type heading three and
type this shouldn't work and closed
heading three now let's make a div
element with heading three in it so
here's our div tag now we have the
opening heading three tag and I'll put
this should work and we'll close it off
and we'll make the closing div tag so
now we have one heading three that
doesn't have div tag around it and
another heading three that is surrounded
by div tags so let's save it and take a
look at what it looks like and as you
can see CSS only applied the color red
to the element that is in the div tag
and this is thanks to a process called
descendant selectors so next we're gonna
go over how we apply descendant
selectors and we're also gonna cover
some more stuff on selectors but for now
we're out of time so if you want to
check out this tutorial you can go to my
website the new Boston comm and I have a
step-by-step on everything we went over
today thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
