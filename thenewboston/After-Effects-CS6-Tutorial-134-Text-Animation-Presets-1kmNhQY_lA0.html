Effects cs6 tutorial I'm your host buddy
Blackford and today I want to go over
text presets obviously so it's gonna be
pretty easy and fast tutorials so might
as well just get on with it
let's uh let's start out I guess so what
I did is just created created a text
layer here with just some words I guess
and the text presets are gonna be over
here in the right and in this area where
it says effects in presets and there's a
section here called animation presets
you can twirl down there and then we've
got text right here so we'll go down and
now we've got a bunch of different kind
of Tex presets that we've got going here
organic is a pretty good section for
adding presets so let's just drag one on
to our text and we've got this preset
that's going on here we're just like
flies flies in like this and pretty much
these text presets are someone that
saved the settings on down here in our
text the animators that created
animators and just save them and add a
keyframes and stuff like that so that's
a one of the presets just hit control Z
to get it off or you got a delete out
the animators if you go too far now
let's throw on another one just let's
see this one says horsefly whatever that
means you can also drag the preset onto
your words in your comm panel
so let me Ram preview this
so that's what this one is
easy enough and you've got a whole bunch
of other kinds of text animated and out
is a decent one let's try this one fade
up fade up lines would see what that
does actually it what's used a fly-in
because fly ends aren't that aren't too
bad that's how that one works out
obviously it doesn't like come off the
screen for some reason but we can always
take that and like move it and then it
moves on to the screen or something like
that so that's I showed you how to do
this effect before in an earlier
tutorial but now you know that you can
just create it there and this is edit
the animator down here to fix your
preset and where it's starting out and
where it's not starting out so just
bring it down here to start it out so
I'm flying in out into the middle easy
enough and just got just mess around
with all these presets here I think you
can stack presets on top of presets so
let's try that let's add this blur one
in here blur by word ooh
bullet train let's try that one
it I see no bit uh erases the preset
that you had on there before so you
can't stack these so this one flies in
and blurs in kind of a decent way to
bring a transition to your words and
using these preset speeds up your
workflow so if you find one that you
like go ahead and use it just be careful
that you're not using corny ones or ones
that have been used a lot in time so
since these are included with After
Effects everybody can use these so
people may have seen a lot of these
makes a lot of these presets a lot so
it's it's usually a good idea to add
your own add your own type of like flare
to them I guess change it up a little if
you need to change up the settings a
little but I mean something like this
you don't really see too often but it
looks pretty decent so you could
probably leave something like this with
its default settings especially if
you're working on like something that's
not gonna be on television and it might
just be for like a company and it
doesn't matter if it's been seen a bunch
of times so just keep that stuff in mind
and that's how you add the presets very
easy and very editable and everything
like that so thanks for watching this
one it was a quick tip and it was way
too easy
so see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
