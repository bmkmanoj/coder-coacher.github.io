triangle inequality properties and there
are three that we're gonna talk about so
our first one says if one side of a
triangle is longer than another side of
a triangle then the angle opposite the
first side is greater than the angle
opposite the second side so say we know
that CB is longer then C a so which we
can tell just by looking at it so that
means that this angle angle a which is
opposite CB
angle a is gonna be greater than this
angle that's opposite C a angle B so our
next property says
that if one angle of a triangle is
longer than larger than the other angle
the side opposite the first angle is
longer than the side opposite the
smaller angle so this is basically like
the last one just reversed so if you
know that this angle angle a is greater
than angle B then the side opposite
angle a which is C B is going to be
greater than the side opposite B which
is ca whereas the other one we knew this
and then we could figure out that and
last we know lastly we know that the sum
of any two sides of a triangle is
greater than the length of the third
side so that means that the sum of the
sum of C B plus C a is greater than a be
the sum of a B plus C a is greater than
C be the sum of CA plus and C a or knows
excuse me C B plus a B is greater than C
a
so now we're gonna do some examples
where we use these to solve things so is
it possible to have a triangle with the
sides with the following lengths twenty
nine and eight so first we're gonna add
them all up and make sure that like the
length of these two is greater than this
one for every single pair of angles so
20 plus nine is greater than eight yes
that's true
nine plus eight is greater than twenty
oh wait we have a problem right here
nine plus eight is only 17 and 17 is not
greater than 20 so no it is not possible
okay with lengths nine 12 and 15
so nine plus twelve greater than 15 this
is 21 21 is greater than 15 12 plus 15
is greater than nine well that's 27 and
27 is definitely greater than nine and
nine plus 15 is greater than 12 this
would be 24 which is greater than 12 so
yes it is possible
which angle is longest so we know that
the sides measure X X plus 2 and X plus
8 if we were to order these from these
sides from least to greatest we would
have X X plus 2 because this X has the
same value for each side so if I just
have X that's gonna be less than if I
have X and 2 more than X so and then X
plus 8 because this is saying 8 more
than X and this is only 2 more than X
and since X is greater than 2 this is
our order so this is from least to
greatest
well our angles opposite these sides are
gonna be the same way
so that means since X plus 8 is the
greatest side the angle opposite X plus
8 is going to be the greatest angle so
angle 2 is largest
which side is longest okay well we know
this is a right angle and a right angle
measure is 90 degrees we need to find
the measure of this angle so that's 30
by the way if you couldn't tell
90 plus 30 is equal to 120 and so 120
plus X is equal to 180 because remember
the interior angles of a triangle equal
sum up to 180 so then if we subtract 120
over we get X is equal to 60 so this is
equal to 60 so the side that is opposite
the largest angle is going to be longest
so since this angle right here is the
largest that means side AC is the
largest so this is all we're gonna do
for today but make sure you come back
and watch the next lesson because we're
gonna start talking about how to
geometrically prove the triangles are
congruent</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
