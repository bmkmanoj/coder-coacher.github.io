back and in this video I am going to
show you how to make a file chooser
dialog so if ever in your program you
need to include the functionality to
have the user select a file like this
right here they click file open and then
I don't know maybe select a I know an
image or a text file whatever and also
I'm gonna show you not only how to do
that but give you guys the ability to
select entire directories so let's say
you're making like a file transfer
program and you want them to upload an
entire folder you can do that as well
it's just one little change but the
concept is pretty much the same so
already what I did before this is sort
of started is I made just a blank screen
and it has a button on it and the button
says choose file so this is already
everything that we learned I didn't want
to waste your guys time repeating myself
of you know about something you already
knew so this button is hooked up to this
on file clicked so this is the method
that gets called whenever they click the
button so let's go ahead and make this
right now and instead of like the last
tutorial where we made an entire
separate class for that pop-up window
what we're gonna do is we're just gonna
stick everything inside this class gonna
make it nice and compact so we pass in
soap and widget and now let me have a
comment right here I'll be like a user
click the open or choose file button so
yeah I made it a button but sometimes
you may want to connect it to a menu
item that's probably more common but you
know like I said I'm gonna keep things
real simple so just like before what
we're gonna do is make a variable called
dialog and this is gonna be equal to gtk
file chooser dialog alright so this is
pretty much a special dialogue from gtk
that allows the user to pretty much
select the file or a directory and the
parameters that takes our first the
title so I'll say select the file host
and the second one is self and the third
one is this so for this tutorial what
I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna set this
equal to gtk file chooser action open so
remember the last time we set this equal
to a plain modal or model still have no
idea how to say it but it's pretty much
like a plain pop-up well this right here
says that okay this is a pop-up that
lets the user pick a file now if you
ever wanted them to select an entire
directory then what you can do is you
can change this open to select folder so
just change that one key word and then
whenever they open that dialogue it's
gonna select the directory and set up
just an individual file right now we'll
just work with individual files and I'm
gonna hit open so that's what this is
gonna do and I also am gonna add how can
I do this alright so I'll add those
default buttons too so if the user ever
clicks open and then they're like oh
actually I click that by mistake
we want to give them this cancel button
right here and also there are two ways
that you can select a file you can just
select the area here and double click it
or you can select it in hit ok so let's
give them both of those buttons and all
that functionality is already built in
which is pretty cool so gtk actually let
me just do it this way you can add those
constants that have the word okay and
cancel but it's just easier just the
freedom to be honest so cancel and this
is going to emit the gtk
response type of cancel now watch
straight okay and this is going to gtk
let's type okay re looking good so now
what they did at this point is well we
pretty much set up the basic construct
for that dialogue and now just like
before whenever they open it we're just
gonna run it so dialogue run right like
there so this is gonna run and all the
functionality that we have is already
built in I mean we don't have to say
okay this is how you scroll to select
your file this is how you display all of
the files on your desktop or whatever
it's already built into gt2k so we can
just run it straight up like that
and then we can handle the response so
if response is equal to and we have two
different things
okay so if they click the okay button
and what we're gonna do is remember here
let me pull up this demo again whenever
the user clicks the OK button
that must mean that they had a file
selected so what we're gonna do in that
case is we're just pronounced you
clicked the ok button and it will also
print out whatever file name and they
selected so I'll print out BIOS selected
and you just do this way a dialog dot
get file name so this function right
here returns whatever file name they
selected from this dialogue or the
pop-up window and now what I can do is
just L if response
was my other response canceled all right
so if they hit cancel we'll just print
out like a user didn't want to select a
file so print user didn't choose any
file and there we go actually let's
change this to open since that's kind of
more clearly what you want to do and
you'll say you click the Open button and
user didn't choose any file all right
Oh looking good and that's hopefully all
right so the only thing we have to do
now is just write dialogue destroyed and
again this just ensures after they
either selected a file or you know
cancel it out of it
that the pop-up window actually closes
instead of them clicking cancel it just
stays there there it's that kind of suck
for them so now let's go ahead and run
this alright so look at our awesome
looking program right now I'm going to
choose a file and then this dialog pops
up now I remember all of this
functionality is already built into your
core operating system so now I can just
go to desktop whatever and I don't know
I can either just select this and hit
open and then you can see right here you
click the Open button file selected and
it gives you the path of the file or we
can do is remember we added these
buttons at the bottom so I have cancel
button in an open button so if we just
cancel out of there user didn't choose
any file and check this out this is
pretty cool if you just go to desktop
like I said before you can select the
file and hit open organ is double click
it and that's going to work - so gck is
smart enough to realize when you double
click a file it's essentially the same
as selecting it so again that is how you
do it with files I already showed you
guys had to do it with directories so
yeah there you go
go ahead and make programs open files
follow your heart and uh yeah achieve
all your dreams I don't know what the
I never know it's a thin my video so see
ya</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
