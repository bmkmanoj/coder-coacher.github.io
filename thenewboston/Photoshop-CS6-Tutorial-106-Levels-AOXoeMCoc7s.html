buddy Blackford here another Photoshop
cs6 tutorial and in this tutorial I'm
going to show you how to use the level
adjustments commands and what we're
gonna do is use that to adjust the tonal
values or do some color correction
within our photos and we're gonna do it
by using coming up to the image options
menu here
and we're gonna go to mode our
adjustments we're gonna go to
adjustments and we're gonna come to
levels and you can see that the hockey
is control l and levels is something
that you may use a lot if you're doing
some color correction and stuff like
that and your images so keep that up
there in my opinion it's one of the best
color correction tools that Photoshop
has and any other program and it's so
levels is something that's known
throughout other programs like After
Effects and I've seen it in other
programs like nuke and things like that
so let's go ahead and look at what we
got here so we have our box that came up
now what levels does is a basis color
information off this image in the middle
and what this image is called as a
histogram and it takes the black levels
the mid grays and the whites here and
you can adjust them to adjust how your
image looks so if I move this black
level right here and bring it in it's
gonna make the overall image darker if I
move the white level in here it's gonna
make the overall image brighter and if I
move the mid-tones here it's going to
adjust basically the same way so left as
brighter right is darker but it's going
to make it's going to adjust it from the
mid-tone values and not from like the
black values so basically it's taking
your mid-race and making them darker or
your mid mid Gray's and making them
lighter if I use it from the middle now
if you're moving around you
or sliders here and they don't your
image doesn't update while you're doing
that you just want to make sure that you
have this preview option checked here
see if I move in now it's not going to
show me what's going on but if I have
preview on then I'm definitely going to
see what's going on when I move the
sliders around alternatively if you know
exactly what you want to put in say
you're doing a bunch of levels or
something like that and levels commands
you can take put the values in manually
into these boxes here so if I I don't
know want to do ten here and it'll move
everything along the side er so that's a
one way you can do things so make sure
you have an image open rate before you
do this and apply the levels command
like I showed you the first thing I want
to show you is that there is a button
here called Auto and if you click it is
gonna do a quick levels adjustment for
you and you can see it did that and what
the auto is based on I'm gonna hit
control Z so I can go back it's based on
what's in the options menu here so click
on the options and you can hear auto
color correction options now it's based
on these different algorithms and it's
what you pick so you can enhance the
brightness and contrast and that's what
happens when I click on auto now if I
click on some of these other things you
can see how the auto adjusts them
differently here and then you've got the
option to snap the neutral mid-tones
watch I'll show you what that means if I
click on this you can see how the
histogram changes and becomes a little
bit more smooth when you're snapping the
neutral mid-tones and then you've got
your clipping here which means that
nothing will go past the darkest dark so
right now nothing is clipped I start
bringing this up it's gonna clip off the
darkest black so the darkest thing is
it's actually this gray right here so
that's what the clipping does
you can clip off on the highlights and
the shadows but you can't clip on
mid-tones because they're not at the end
so once you get some of this set up the
way you want it you can click on save as
default if you want and that's a little
default ass so if you didn't do anything
it's gonna just stand enhance brightness
and contrast and that's gonna be your
default so hit OK and pick whatever you
need to and oh let's get into this so as
I did this things got moved around so
I'm just gonna move them back it should
be 1 and this should be 255 and that's
what the starting values always are
usually that's the default values
another way to work with the level as
quickly is to use these presets now the
presets have the values here and you can
click on any of these so we got darker
here which will make the image darker
we've got increased contrast and there's
a bunch of them that will increase the
contrast and then we've got all these
other ones that you can mess with and
see if you like them in your image
default brings it back to the defaults
which is 0-1 255 and then custom here
you can create a custom image here or a
I mean a custom levels of adjustment now
if you create a custom adjustment so
let's just do something like this
we'll make it darker here so we got this
mid-tones to the right we made the
mid-tones darker you can click on this
little button over here that looks like
a couple like lines or something like
that
and you can hit save preset and it goes
already into your presets menu and just
hit mid tones darker or whatever you
want to name it save it and it'll show
up down here and these here are your
different levels adjustments that you
created
as custom so if I made one that was said
reduce redness and I cook on that and
you can see that there's no red in this
and I made that because I had a picture
on here one time that at a bar and the
neon lights were making the entire thing
red so once I did this it took out all
the red and made a normal color picture
so there's the darker and then this is
the default so you can see how the
presets get saved most of the time when
you're working with presets or the auto
you they're usually a good way to start
out something but you may want to
usually manually adjust and get to where
you want the image to actually be so so
you just they're just usually good
starting points Dupre they're presets
that are meant to give you like a good
starting point not to be like a final
option but I mean if your client doesn't
really care too much about it and it's
not like super fresh professional then
go ahead and just use these to get your
stuff done done quicker I mean that's
the more you get done the more money you
can make so if you get your project done
quickly you can go ahead and move on to
another project just make sure that you
guys are putting out good quality stuff
so we'll just put this back on the fall
so we have everything back to where it
was now you can just adjust certain
channels so when I was adjusting the
reduced redness channel here our reduced
redness preset here if I go to my red
you can see that I moved the mid-tone
slider here to reduce the redness if I
go look at my others they're about the
same so what I did is I started out with
a preset and then I moved the red
channel over to take out red so if I
start let me go back to the default and
you can see that there is a decent
amount of red and there's a decent
amount of blue especially over here so
if I go what's going
the blue channel and start taking out
some of the blue now you can see that
this is more of a yellowy picture
instead and some of the blue has been
taken out so if you want to you can
start creating presets that take out
blue and take out red and green and
stuff like that so let's go back to our
default I remember that you can save and
load presets from here so if your
presets it and show up you can load them
or if you go on the internet and
download some free levels adjustment
presets you can load them in using this
and find where you put them I would
recommend putting them in your levels
folder in your Photoshop files it's
easier for you to find now over here at
the bottom is called the output levels
and this is pretty much it sends out the
level or adjust the levels of ink your
gonna send out to your output device
which is usually a printer so this is
what this is for so you don't really
want to use this as an overall kind of
kind of thing use these sliders up here
that are in your histogram instead of
using the output levels because he can
see how that doesn't really work very
well it just I don't know it just just
only use them for when you're messing
with the amount of printer ink you want
to use one last thing that I wanted to
show you about levels is these
eyedropper tools that are over here
underneath the options and what these do
is they sample your image to set the
white point or mid gray point or black
or black point here so I have a white
selected here right now and if I go
ahead and select the white point now
this is gonna be where white is based
off from so I would pick something
that's something somewhat white I'm
gonna click on it first and something
that's pretty white this is
probably the closest I'm gonna get
because there's a darn old pure whites
and now the white point is set
differently and the histogram changes
and it controls you to go back I'm gonna
try the black point here and I'm gonna
use this black part of the shoe and you
can see that it's probably gonna make
the image a lot darker and you can see
that there it actually looks pretty cool
this way I like the way this one looks
so it depends on what you're going for
now this image now looks like it's more
at dusk or towards the night time
getting ready to become nighttime and
this image seems like it's more towards
morning time and give you more of like a
dreamy feel you can also set the
mid-tone value so just click on
something and these are ways that you
can go around and mess with your
different values to see like come up
with new types of color Corrections that
you might like within your bit within
your image so you can see that when I
did use the black one black when I set
the black point and made pretty
cool-looking image and I might want to
keep this at some point so that's what I
wanted to show you remember that the
samplers adjust your black point or
white point or mid-tone point and
changed what the histogram looks like on
your image so thank you for watching
this more in-depth levels adjustment
video levels is a very important tool
when using color correction that curves
and contrast and brightness and things
like that all combined together to help
you make really awesome looking color
Corrections and clients love it when you
take their image it makes something a
lot better and color correction is one
of the most impactful ways to do that
and get them to be like wow that looks
really awesome so that's all I wanted to
talk to you guys about here and I want
