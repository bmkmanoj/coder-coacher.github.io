and then this is order we're going to be
building that tab bar at the bottom to
navigate through our different views so
what's a bar is is it's pretty much a
bunch of different icons with titles on
it and each one you click represents a
different view so you can either go get
icons from you know somewhere I mean you
don't even need to have icons but it's
useful to have most people do so if you
want to make your own icons then make
sure that they're 24 by 24 and make sure
they're ping or PNG whatever you guys I
know you're having a huge debate about
what to call it a column ping but
anyways and if you want transparency on
them they can have transparency too so
that's cool part so anyways I already
got five so they're in my folder
downloads because I made them on my
other computer and here they all are
look at all the sweet pings I made ABCDE
go ahead and make here is anything you
want and I'm going to go ahead and
select them all and drag them over right
at the bottom right above a plist and of
course and go ahead and copy Adam and
now I have my five ping files want to
represent each tab so pretty cool so now
let's go ahead and hop in the main
window xib and this is going to open up
interface builder obviously now the
first thing we want to do here is we
want to get that something called a tab
bar controller now this pretty much as
you can see manages a set of view
controllers what this is going to do is
this controller icon is the route
controller it's going to control the
first view the user sees so in order to
get in our program just go ahead and
drag it over in main window to xib and
check it this main view that pops up is
now the first view that the user sees so
anyways this is a built-in um class from
iphone so it's pretty cool that we don't
have to code any of this automatically
gives us our own navigation bar at the
bottom the only thing we need to do is
change a couple attributes on it so I
told you how
is that I'm going to be teaching you
guys five different pickers and there's
only two different tabs right here so
that's the first thing we need to change
so go ahead and click your icon right
here and over in your attributes
inspector you see here are pretty much
the tabs item one item two we want five
items one for each picker so go ahead
and just click one two three edit three
times and this is going to add one for
each view controller and a view
controller is pretty much the same thing
as a class so now each tab controls its
own view or its own class so now what we
need to do is this tab is just saying
here this pretty much I really dumb tab
right here it has no idea what it's
supposed to be doing so what we're going
to do is go ahead and unselect it now
select again just make sure we got the
right thing selected and now that you
have that first tab selected what you
need to do with each of these tabs is
tell it what nip file it needs to look
at and what class is going to tell it
what to do so pretty much associate each
tab with this nip file in class and
you're saying all right how'd i do that
whoa in your attributes inspector right
here go ahead and put nip name and this
first one is going to be for the date
and go ahead and hop over to your so
pretty much that's how you associate a
tab with its interface builder so now go
ahead and its identity and now you have
to say what class is going to control it
so of course the first one it's the date
class just like that so after you're
done with this what you want to do is
you want to click on attribute inspector
even and now that you set all the
background coding properties we want to
actually change the cool icon in the
title itself so go ahead and
double-click it and the title is the
title that appears below we'll just
change this one to date and the image is
the icon so here are all your images
that you just imported I'm going to
change you this one to a and now you can
see the title switch to date in the icon
switch my sweet little custom made I I
mean a ping
so we need to do that for each item so
yeah you actually have to sit here and
watch me do mall sertab number two is
network this one is a single pecker and
for the identity of course single and
Africa attributes change the title to
single looks good and change it to be
and for the third tab the nib on this
one let's see I think this was double
and the class that's going to control it
is double and now let's go ahead and
change the title of the icon to double
is that which guest you were right and
see so now let's go in item number four
of course and the NIM name for this is
dependent there we go its identity is of
course dependent you guys really should
not add to do this by time i get down
all these and the title for this one is
de PE and D&amp;amp;C actually have to sing it
out and change this to d this is
actually one that makes sense d
dependent get it all right now for this
one NIM name this is custom pecker
identity custom and go ahead and change
this the e and change the title to
custom bam just like that whew alright
so pretty much we took each tab and gave
it its appropriate nib class in its
appropriate regular class and we also
change the what's called the icon on
each one in the title of each one andrey
repeated this for every single tap all
right we're done with that now let's go
ahead and click away so there we go so
the title actually changes so the only
thing we have left to do is tell this
controller that it's actually the root
controller so I mean check this out
easiest thing you'll ever do in your
whole life go ahead control drag from
the app delegate which is billing code
and release when it gets over tab bar
controller and select root controller
and that's all now this tab bar
controller is the root
troller for your program so now don't
forget please don't forget to save it
because we don't have to repeat all that
and quit interface builder and well I
guess if you want you can go ahead and
build and run this nothing's really
sweet is going to happen but I mean you
can click through each your tabs make
sure it's not blowing up and make sure
you have I cons in the right place and
again like I said each of these tabs is
going to bring up a custom picker and
i'll let you lets you do something now
it's cool with the picker but in the
next store i'm going to be working with
this date picker it's pretty much going
to pick the date and then out put it on
the screen so yeah that's what we're
going to be learning so there's a little
preview to it so thanks for watching
hopefully you watch my next tutorial and
learn how to do this and yeah if you
