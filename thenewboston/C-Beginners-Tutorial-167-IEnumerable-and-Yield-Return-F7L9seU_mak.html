that I'm making for the new Boston and
in this tutorial I'm going to show you
how to use the ienumerable interface and
I'm going to be showing you how to yield
return so all you're going to need for
this tutorial is a button and once you
have it on your form just go out and
double click on it so the first thing
we're going to want to do is create a
method that returns an int when your
goal and an ienumerable is basically
just a collection of objects so the
first thing that we're going to want to
do is go up here and say using system
collections
since the ienumerable interface is in
there is in the system dot collections
namespace so we can just say right here
i enumerable he's an interface and then
we're just going to want to give a name
tour method I'm just going to call it
get numbers and it's basically just
going to return a collection of numbers
in between the minimum and the maximum
that the user specified service will say
int minimum in maximum so we're going to
go right here and say for and we don't
have to say like in Thai or something
since we already have this minimum right
here so we can just put a semicolon
there and then we can say while the
minimum is less than or equal to the
maximum and then we're just going to
have it increment the minimum so that
it'll go through every number in between
the minimum and the maximum and when it
every time that it loops we're just
going to want to stay right here yield
return minimum and the minimum right
here is basically just on every number
in between minimum and maximum and yield
return will basically allow you to only
use everything inside of here as you
need it so if we were to just call this
method get two numbers right here get
numbers and put a minimum like zero and
the maximum is
and then it wouldn't do anything like
right now this doesn't do anything since
we're not setting me equal to anything
or we're not using it so yield return
will allow us to use these numbers
inside of this collection right here
only when we need them so let me just
put a breakpoint right there and click
the button and we'll see that nothing
happens when I step if it just goes
right down there because we're not using
on that collection if what if we were to
use this collection right here if we
were to loop through everything in this
collection then it would use it because
it's only allowing us to use what's in
this collection as needed so say for
each end in gifts numbers and all this
policy if you're I then we're just going
to have a message box ko saing on what
the integers value is so I down to
string all right so now we should get a
message box for every number in between
0 and 10 so we get 0 1 yep and there we
go
alright so as you can see it only uses
them as we need them so that means even
if we had an if statement here saying if
I is equal to 5 and we just want to
break out of this so if I is equal to 5
and just want to break out of here
actually I'll make it lower stupid stuff
through here and watch it so if I equals
2 then it will just break out of here
and it won't even finish going through
this for loop down here either so let's
just go ahead and put a great point
there and watch it work all right step
and then it goes since it's hitting this
method right here it's going to go down
there and now it'll all yield return the
minimum which should be 0 so that has it
incremented it yet then we go down here
and check to see if I is equal to 2
since it's not it'll display the message
box and we get a 0 message box loop
through again it will yield return 1 get
a message box they'll say 1 now we go
through again here it'll generate 2 then
it will check to see if it's 2 and then
since it is 2 it will break and then
I'll just jump down here so as you can
see and never finished going through
this for loop and this is really nice
because it will allow us to only use the
numbers as we need them so for example
if it took I don't know 5 to 10 seconds
to generate a number down here if you're
using this for some long computation
then you wouldn't want the user to wait
for the whole list to be generated if
you're only using some of them so this
is a great thing to use when you're not
going to be using a whole collection of
items or you're not going to be wanting
to wait in between each generation of a
number all right so that's pretty much
it for this tutorial on using yield
return so see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
