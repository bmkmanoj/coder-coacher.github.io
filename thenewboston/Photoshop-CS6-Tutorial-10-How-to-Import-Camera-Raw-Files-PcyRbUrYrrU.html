name is buddy Blackford and welcome to
another Photoshop cs6 tutorial in this
tutorial I'm going to show you how to
import Camera Raw data files so that you
can work on them in Photoshop now what I
did is I got some free raw files off of
this website here called raw samples
that CH and then you can download a
sample of a camera raw file from any of
these types of cameras and what a what a
camera raw file is is when you shoot in
the highest quality on like your digital
camera so if you're shooting with like a
Canon 5d or a Nikon d3x or something
like that
any of these types of higher end cameras
will shoot out these camera RAW images
that are used for higher and quality
images so what we're going to do is I'm
going to open up one of these and it
brings up a whole different bunch of
menus that are different when you're
just importing a regular image so I'm
going to open up the camera raw file
that I downloaded and it was a Canon 5d
camera raw image so I'm going to open
that up and it brings us to this screen
here where we can do a few things
differently to our image and adjust it
before we bring it into Photoshop so the
first things I want to show you here is
the different oops sorry
the different tabs that we have over
here on the right so we've got our basic
tab here that has a lot of color
correction what we call properties and
different little sliders here that we
can use to adjust how our image looks
they've got this new auto tonal balance
button here that we could click to try
have Photoshop automatically try to do
that for us if I click on it now we get
a more brighter colors and it looks
pretty sweet so that's something that
you can mess with in here in Photoshop
there's a bunch of other tabs here we've
got tone curve work that we can mess
around with detail grayscale and all
these other ones that you should go
through and click on to see what's
inside and mess around with a little bit
now I'll go over these in more depth in
a later tutorial when we realize what
everything means a little bit more but
that's what I want to show you quickly
now there's a preview button up here
that if you toggle it and on toggle it
you can see how the different balances
how your different properties have been
modified and how they look if you have
unchecked it's just going to stay on
what was our regularly imported now
there is a set of options up here where
we have our zoom tool our hand tool
where we can move this around if we
needed to so if i zoom in enough I can
use my hand tool to move around we've
got our color sampler and white balance
tools here target a just targeted
adjustment we got our crop tool so
there's a few different tools here that
we can use to edit our photo here and
then we also have the zoom level down
here at the bottom that we can use and
there's a couple presets here and then
we also have the fit view which is handy
if I come down here and click on the
file name here I can change the color
space the bit depth the size here
and some of the resolution and
everything in here and then I can check
this to open up as a smart object if I
would like and I'll go over that stuff
later on so we can change all this stuff
to what we want it to be so I'll just
hit OK I'll just hit cancel because I
didn't want to change anything now over
here on our tabs over here we also have
the menu options here where we can load
settings that we have saved or save the
settings that we have now to use on
another photo and other things such like
that that we cannot we can save the
defaults and everything like that so
that's how we import a image into the
camera then if we like what we have
going on I can click on save image to
save it to a location and it defaults at
the save and save location which is
pretty nice and then you can add the
document names and change the file
extension you can save it as a DNG which
is digital negative and then we have the
JPEG same thing again here we've got our
Tiff's and then we've got our PSD s and
then also down here we can also change
the format as well so if I wanted to
save it I just hit save and it will save
it in the same location with our new
modifications and then I could come down
here to either open the image or I can
hit done and apply it'll apply these
changes but it won't open the image for
us in Photoshop so let's open the image
and it brings it up for us and now our
image is imported with our new colour
correction tools on it so that's how you
start opening up camera RAW files in
Photoshop and as I just wanted to show
you that it was a little different from
importing just regular images because
you get
to mess with more color correction and
tone values and everything like that so
it's pretty that's pretty cool what we
got going on there and I'm just going to
end the tutorial here I guess so thanks
for watching this one and we'll go more
into depth in about this later on so
thanks for watching see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
