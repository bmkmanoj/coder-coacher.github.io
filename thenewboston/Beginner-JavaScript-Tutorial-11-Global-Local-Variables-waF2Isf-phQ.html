actually had to think about that for a
second welcome to your 11th JavaScript
tutorial and in this tutorial we're
going to be talking about something
called global and local variables so the
concept of a global variable is simple
it's any variable that you make that's
outside any function and a local
variable is simple it's any variable
that you create inside the body of a
function so I mean there are only two
places you can make them simple enough
but the rules when you use them they get
kind of tricky so let me go ahead and
show you guys let me first demonstrate
what a global variable is and when
you're allowed to use it let's go ahead
and make a variable called Girl and I'll
set it equal to the name of my first
girlfriend called Kelsey I'm sure she
will appreciate that so Kelsey if you're
reading this what's up
and so by the way she wasn't technically
my first girlfriend I had a girlfriend
in fourth grade named Nicole but we
really didn't weren't
boyfriend-girlfriend she just let me
play with her Giga pet it was nothing
serious Kelsey I actually went on my
first date with her we went and saw what
was it the wedding singer with Adam
Sandler and he had a mullet and I was
extremely nervous the whole time hey I
was in fifth grade give me a break guys
and her mom drill was their inner fan
but still was pretty cool so anyways
let's go ahead and make a function right
now
and we'll call this spit it really
doesn't matter what you name it I'm
gonna name it spit because it's going to
spit out this name so all this function
is going to do is document dots right
out on screen the name of that variable
girl now check the cell like I said you
can make variables in one in two places
inside the function right here or
outside of the function where you made
this girl since this variable is outside
of the function we are allowed to use it
inside the function right here now let's
go ahead and let me prove that to you
right now let's just go ahead and call
spit and when I run that line of code
it's going to type out Kelsey and now
let me go ahead and document dot right
that variable and then this is going to
print out Kelsey so anyways the point
I'm trying to get across is whenever you
have a variable outside of function you
can use it both in the function and
anywhere else in the program so let me
go ahead and refresh this and it says
Kelsey Kelsey just as we predicted
simple enough but now let's go ahead and
take this variable cut it and there we
go and let's go ahead and make it inside
this function right here so now inside
this function we created a variable
called Girl and we're going to try to
run it inside this function and outside
the function so now let's go ahead and
refresh and actually had to save that
and refresh and we see we only get one
Kelsey
well why is that we made the variable it
didn't have any typos we didn't forget
the semicolon or anything so why is this
Kelsey only appearing once well like I
said with global variables whenever you
create a variable outside your function
you could use it in any function you
want and also anywhere else in your
program but whenever you create a
variable that's inside a function you
can only use that variable inside that
function if we had another function we
couldn't use in that if we had another
function could use in that and we're not
allowed to use it outside that function
this function is very greedy it says
whatever my variable is I create their
mind no one else is getting them boy so
that's why whenever we call it spit it
printed out Kelsey because this was the
function and then when we try to just
use it on our own it wouldn't let us
because it said all right the variable
that I create it's mine I get to keep it
so that's why it only printed out once
that was the functions call not the one
outside so anyways the point I'm trying
to get across global variables when
they're created outside any function you
can use them anywhere inside functions
outside functions whatever but whenever
you create a variable inside a function
it's called a local variable and that
variable can only be used within the
function in which it's declared aka
created so that is your basics of global
and local variables in yes
that is the technical term from global
and local so if you have a test it's
okay to write global and local so thank
you guys for watching I think you guys
for putting up with my history of fifth
grade girlfriends and I hope you enjoyed
and hey again Kelsey if you're watching
