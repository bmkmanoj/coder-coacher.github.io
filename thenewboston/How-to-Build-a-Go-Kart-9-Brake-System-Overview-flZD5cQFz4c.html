the braking system on the go-kart but
before I start putting all the pieces on
I want to give you guys a quick overview
of each piece of the braking system what
it does and how it works so it pretty
much starts right here with a master
cylinder this is the part that's going
to connect right behind your brake pedal
and it's filled with hydraulic fluid or
brake fluid now these right here some
people call them hydraulic lines I call
them brake lines they're hooked hooked
up to three of these things and these
things are called calipers now as you
can see of course there is a master
cylinder that sits right behind your
brake pedal these two calibers right
here go behind or go on your front
wheels and they also put a third one
that goes on your passenger side back
wheel now usually in cars you only have
some on the front - so this go-kart is a
little bit unique because it has one in
the back which is kind of odd so here is
basically how it works you start by
filling up your master cylinder with
brake fluid now whenever you press on
the brake two pins are going to be
pressed in there which is going to
release brake fluid from your master
cylinder and allow it to move through
these brake lines now whenever the fluid
gets to these calipers on each wheel
what happens is these calipers in them
have two brake pads you see that let me
see if I can find it you see that little
gap between those two black things
that's pretty much where something
called a rotor is going to sit in the
rotor just think of it as your spinning
tire right now so whenever the fluid
gets released these brick pads are going
to pinch together like that and pinch
your rotor so of course when your rotor
is pinched your tire can no longer spend
so again remember about your master
cylinder
that is then be controlled by your brake
pedal and it's filled with brake fluid
these are brake lines those things are
CalPERS and CalPERS pinched and open
your brake pads
so let me go ahead and show you guys
real quick what I'm talking about with a
rotor this is a rotor right here so of
course you put your tire on here and
your tire spin in we cruising along the
highway well suddenly one you when you
want to stop you hit the brakes in the
brake pads right here they pinch so
whenever they pinch your tires not going
to spin anymore because this thing got a
hold of it so you'll see probably more
clearly later on when I install
everything but that is the basics of how
it works it pitches this and then it
stops immediately so in the next couple
videos the first thing I'm going to do
is install the brake pedal and then I'm
going to put the master cylinder on and
then I'm going to install the calipers
so that's what you have to look forward
to so thank you guys for watching and
look at my cab
I can't might be dead right now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
