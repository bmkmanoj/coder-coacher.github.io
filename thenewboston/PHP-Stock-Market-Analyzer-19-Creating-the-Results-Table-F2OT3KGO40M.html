think tutorial in this lesson we can go
ahead and start building that table and
remember this table is the one that we
want to store the results of our very
first formula our very first predictor
so let me go ahead and I already opened
my cpanel I'm sorry I didn't show you
guys me open in it but I'm going to go
ahead and hop into PHP my admin and once
I'm in here I want to select the
database I want to use and I am working
in the database YouTube now again if we
take a look at my code my code only
updates and inserts into a table it
doesn't create a table so what we need
to do is we need to manually create that
table now if we hop over my coat it says
the tables name is analysis a so let me
go ahead and copy that beast right there
and that's our table name and now let's
count the number of columns 123456789 so
this table is going to have nine columns
or nine pieces of information and now
it's going to ask us for all of those
crap so ticker is the company name this
is going to be a VAR char and we'll just
give it will make this the primary key
and I think that's right there under
index now the primary key remember is
like the unique identifier in since the
ticker I mean if we look at all the
other things the day's increase the
percentage of days increased they can
you know maybe share um what's it they
can share values so the ticker is the
only thing in this table that's going to
be unique so that's why i chose the
primary key for that now we need to go
through all of these and i actually
wrote them down on piece of paper next
to me so this is what information we're
going to have in this table days
increased this is going to be the number
of days that the stock increase and
that's going to be integer you can't
have like a day and a half so the next
thing is percent of days increased I NC
and this is actually going to be a float
you can have like 18 and a half percent
are you float float so now the only
thing I'm going to have for increase is
average increase % and this is going to
be like does it increase by an average
of two percent or three percent or
somewhere around there is probably
typical so this is also going to be a
float so now we want to do the exact
same things for decrease how many days
did it decrease and I want to make sure
that I spelled it yep days decreased
there we go percentage of days decreased
and this is also going to be a float an
average dkirk that's wonderful average
decrease percent now after this we have
two more why well remember I made that
weird custom thing called Bucky's x
value in Bucky cell value so I decided I
might as well go ahead and insert those
into the database to Bucky's x value is
a floats and Bucky cell value is also a
float so now what we want to do is go
down here and see save or add this
always confuses me ok should i pick save
or add save or add i'm just going to go
ahead and hit add or excuse me save and
it says that is not a number what do we
have that doesn't make sense oh we need
to value for this I'm just going to go
ahead and put eight and okay it should
be good go so save this beast and check
that we now have a table created called
analysis a and if we look at the
structure of it we can verify ok ticker
they zinc nine pieces of information it
all looks good to go I'm going to stop
the video and make sure that I didn't
spell anything wrong and in the next
video where we're going to be doing is
we're going to be running this script
and once we run it hopefully it's going
to run through all of these companies
analyze the data from all of these
tables and insert the results into this
table coat and now
sis a so there you have it that's what
i'm going to do thank you guys for
watching don't forget to subscribe and
now see you guys then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
