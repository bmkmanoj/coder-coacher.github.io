twenty first tutorial and in this
tutorial we're going to be going over a
special type of loop called the do loop
yes this is what you guys have been
waiting for the do loop so I can't
remember what soro does I want to say
the last tutorial but it's been a couple
days since I've been at my computer so
I'm not positive but a couple tutorials
ago we went over a special kind of loop
called the while loop and what this loop
basically did is a test of the condition
and so long as that condition was true
it ran a bit of code so you have
condition test it and if it's true or
run a bit of code over and over until
you tell to stop basically well what the
do while loop does is basically take
this structure and it flips it upside
down it's going to run a bit of code
first and then it's going to test if a
condition was true and if it is true
it's going to run it again until it's
false so it basically since it runs the
code before it tests the condition even
if that condition is false it already
ran the code once so anytime you want to
ensure that you run your code at least
once this is what you need to do so
that's basically let's go ahead and take
a look at an example right here and whoa
easy skirt boxes don't get that close to
each other so let's go ahead and make a
counter variable make it X I'm going to
send men equal to five because you know
starting at zero and one skin old let's
start at five because you know why not
my tutorial so now the structure for the
do-while loop is this go ahead and write
do do and then go ahead and write
whatever code you want and I'm just
going to go ahead and write like
document right
let's go ahead and write the variable
first so we can see so it'll be 5 to
begin with and then go ahead and write
soup is something stupid on the screen
like hello and then just go ahead and
add a line break because we're going to
be printing this out a bunch of times
and we don't want it all on the same
line
and when you're done of course add your
semicolon a que semicolon and now go
ahead and increment X because we don't
want it to stay in the same number the
whole time or else this loop is going to
run forever so now after you have your
coding syntax now is where you put the
while right here so we have to give it
condition to test just right like while
X is less than or equal to 20 and then
add your semicolon at the end so as you
can see it's set up a little bit
different than the basic while loop
first of all it has a semicolon at the
end and second you have our condition
before your test and also the special do
keyword or you know special word
whatever you want to call it so let's go
ahead and save this and take a look at
it and see what it does actually let me
go ahead and add some space there I make
it easier to see it goes 500 600 700 800
down low 10 low I won't go through them
all so it goes all the way until it says
X is less than or equal to 20 and then
it stops so let's go ahead and take a
look one more time why this happens
stupid Windows 7 shaking the boxes
putting down shaking them and put them
up but when I'm trying to make a tour
I'm like yeah this one oh right here
doesn't work like that so anyways what
we have here is a variable X that
started if 5 so this code regardless of
what the condition is it didn't even
look at the condition yet it's running
right now and then it says all right I'm
done running the code and now you want
me to run it again as long as X is less
than 20 well the next time I run since
we incremented X is going to be 6 and
I'm going to keep doing this keep
incrementing X you shine 7 8 9 all the
way to 20 and then once it gets the 21
it says alright as X less than or equal
to 20 no it's greater than 20 so that
when your loop shuts off and quits so
that's why you go five all the way to 20
because 20 is in fact less than or equal
to 20 it's equal to 20 so that's the
basics of a do-while loop um let me show
you a case scenario where X could be
like 35 see in this example the
condition isn't true at all but this
loop is going to go ahead and run one
time so let me just go ahead and run
that 35 Ehlo and then it's going to shut
off immediately after that so whereas if
we were to stick this in a while loop it
would never run since the tested the
condition first but since we're going to
do while loop what it does is it runs
the code at least one time and then it
tests the condition so by the time it
sees that it's false it already ran it
at least once so that's why it printed
out so anyways that's the main
difference between the do loop or excuse
me a do-while loop and a basic while
loop it's pretty much a while loop
flipped upside down and you guarantee to
run it at least one time so you're going
to see when we're programming when this
is going to come in handy and when a
while loop is going to be necessary but
for now just wanted to give you guys the
basics so thank you guys for watching if
you have any questions don't forget I
have a website in a forum you can check
out and also don't forget subscribe so I
will see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
