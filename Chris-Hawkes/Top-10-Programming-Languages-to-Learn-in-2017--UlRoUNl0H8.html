here it is the coveted top ten
programming languages to learn in 2017
just a little bit of background behind
myself I've been a software developer
for about seven and seven or eight years
now so I've been doing enterprise
development for quite some time I also
created a top 10 list of programming
languages to learn last year for 2016
and in that process the videos received
close to roughly 700,000 views or so
with thousands upon thousands of
comments from the programming community
so I did a lot more research into this
year's list compared to last year's list
so I hope that this will appease you
know a lot of the different industries
that are blossoming out there now one
thing I do want to mention is that this
is still the top-ten programming
languages so this isn't about like okay
the top 10 newest languages or top 10
that doesn't you know that competes with
our modern-day programming this is about
what are the top 10 languages to learn
this year and and that is for jobs for
money for building new things so you
know we could always have this to this
topic all that you know cut we could
argue about this all day long but let me
just get into the list now number one or
number ten I'm starting from the back to
the front we're going to go with Haskell
so I said if you're going to go
functional you might as well go with
Haskell Haskell is a purely functional
language everything is built with
functions functions call other functions
functions are everything is immutable so
immutable makes functions reliable and
you know you never have any sort of
shared state and things like that so a
lot of things that end up biting you
with a shared state system for
multi-threading and if you if you create
a proper Haskell program you're going to
have blazingly quick blazingly quick
application you're going to crunch a lot
of numbers so have schools been around
for a very long time an honorable
mention would go to Scala f-sharp and
closure you could probably add maybe a
lick sir in a couple of
the ones as well but if you were going
to pick a functional language to add to
this list I really think that Haskell
fits the bill because it is purely
functional and is going to teach you
proper functional fundamentals you know
if you compared to some of those other
languages that I mentioned that are not
entirely purely functional number 9 on
the list is assembler language and where
ASM for short so we're seeing ASM
returned to the browser we're seeing a
lot of people go back to assembly
assembly as the lowest of all
programming languages out there for your
computer lower level means that it's
closer to the hardware you're going to
be able to tweak things on the computer
that higher level languages will just
not let you have access to it also means
that you're going to spend a lot of time
writing ones and zeros and pointers and
it's going to be a very very complex
process of being able to build
complicated machinery and in programming
languages that may arise out of it the
assembler language however if you are
going to push the envelope of what's
possible with programming assembler is
going to be the go-to language to do
that so we're going to continue to see
some of the smartest individuals writing
assembler code out there number eight we
have go which is the go programming
languages language or also known as go
lang ken Thompson one of the the
founders or the creator the B
programming language back in the late
60s or early 70s I'm not sure what date
that is he helped design the go
programming language ultimately it arose
out of Google's project and Google when
it was first getting started actually
used Python for its stacks so the first
Google suit a search engine was using
Python eventually they ended up having
to do a lot of data crunching with a
with a faster static type language which
gave rise to like C and n C++ at least
at googles operations to be able to
parse through their massive amounts of
data because Google wanted a better way
of getting developers on the same page
and writing code that each could
understand much much easier but also be
extremely powerful and be built with
concurrency in mind go was created for
that reason
and Pi in Python is um Python and C++ I
mean some of that old Google code is
being replaced with the go programming
language code not all of it I mean
there's still quite a bit of code that
you're going to see with those other
languages but go is going to continue to
rise in popularity because anytime you
have a company with as much influence as
Google you're definitely going to do
good so continue to see go rise in 2017
it's somewhat of a slow rise since it's
been out for a few years now but it's
definitely a language worth picking up
the next one is number seven C++ so C++
is built on top of C which is the dawn
or the Godfather of all programming
languages so C++ still powers many games
GUI applications when it comes to game
engines and things like that you're
going to see a lot of libraries in
c-sharp and python that are just ported
from C++ library so if you needed to
push the envelope of what those printed
frameworks and engines are doing you
have to know how to use C++ C++ is the
language of choice that you're going to
use if you get into the game development
with Unreal Engine and it's a it's a
language that goes back all the way to
the 80s it's been around for a very long
time somewhat of a bad rap depending on
who you ask a lot of things have been
tacked onto the C++ language but there
has been a resurgence in its pot and its
popularity over the last I would say ten
years I never really left but for the
longest time people were saying oh well
you know this or that is going to do
away with C++ and eventually we won't
need C++ anymore and and that's just not
the case it's still going to continue to
be around there's still quite a bit of
jabs at using C++ and and just continue
to see that into 2017 number six this is
somewhat of a surprise listing if you
watched the video from last year
typescript is as being mentioned not
even in the top ten but also at number
six so that gives it a lot of credence
compared to you're probably like well
typescript omit typescript is bringing
type safety to javascript javascript is
the language for the browser
the older browser script standard things
there was no there was no block scoping
you had all kinds of you you can
consider JavaScript a functional
language some people will tell you it's
not a functional language but an
argument can be made either way but
JavaScript allows you to do a lot of a
lot of things like passing in JavaScript
functions as a first-class citizen also
the fact that you don't know what types
are being returned from JavaScript
functions just by looking at them so if
you have a statically typed programming
language like C++ or Java or C sharp you
can clearly look at a method and
understand what type you're going to be
getting back with JavaScript it's not
the case you can concatenate it all into
one line and you have no idea what's
going on without the painstaking process
of stepping through it so it makes
things very difficult to work on if you
have large development teams you can ask
any large development team javascript is
not as easy to be on the same page with
as compared to something like c-sharp so
this has given rise to languages built
on top of JavaScript which get compiled
down to raw JavaScript we've seen it if
you look at what react is doing with JSX
or you see with CoffeeScript but when
you look at all those different those
different flavors of what's being done
here typescript is definitely the number
one overall those guys number one mainly
the main reason for that is because
Google has even ditched JavaScript in
favor of typescript for the new angular
2.0 project all the documentation for
angular 2.0 are being done in typescript
typescript is going to allow you to
understand what your functions are
returning another thing too is it was
actually designed by anders Helzberg
who's the creator of the C++ or I'm
sorry the c-sharp programming language
and he's an extremely smart you're
definitely a genius when it comes to
language design c-sharp is a fantastic
language and an typescript is built and
the same flavor so it makes JavaScript
quite a bit better to deal with and I
think that we're going to see it emerge
as the top JavaScript preprocessor
number five is Swift Apple is doing away
with their objective-c so whenever you
thought of Apple you always thought of
Objective C and some people will still
tell you that you think of an objective
C but Objective C isn't going to make
the top ten in this list it's going to
be replaced instead by Swift and instead
of Swift being further down the list
like it was last year Swift is going to
move up it's going to be one of the most
popular languages on the TOB index it's
going to continue to rise as more and
more Apple developers switch over to the
Swift language there's a lot of legacy
code out there that's all written in
Objective C but eventually we're going
to see much more Swift out there and
that's going to be all these Apple
developers know so I can I would think
that we're still going to get a lot of
growth here in the next few years for
Swift number four is Python it's going
to take one step down as we're going to
see of these compared to these other
languages but python is a great first
language it's it's been rising in
popularity for the last ten years it's
been a popular language for the past 30
years since Google's used it for the
longest time and it powers YouTube and
there's so many other things you can do
with Python I could talk about it all
day long in fact Python is now the
number one most hot programming language
of all IT schools and the entire United
States and we're talking about some of
the greatest schools like MIT and
Stanford and Carnegie Mellon and all
these other great schools they were
teaching Python because python is open
source it's easy to pick up as a first
language it doesn't burn people out with
its static type checking and stuff like
that so Python is a dynamically
interpreted duck type language and
you'll have to read up more on that I
have plenty of videos by the way on that
if you're interested but python is a
great language to learn if you want to
get into robotics or bioinformatics or
just mathematical computations if you
want to get into some basic gaming
indefinitely web development with django
django power sites like Instagram and
Pinterest and reddit comm and not to
mention YouTube again so python is going
to be a continuous um it's going to
continue to grow an epic number four on
this list and I believe number three on
the list last year Python is an
absolutely fantastic language in
and it definitely should be learned even
by experienced programmers number three
is Java not to be confused with
JavaScript this is a powerful static
typed language and it's ruled the job
market for decades now so if you look at
okay well I want to get a job and and
how do I get into a corporate at least
corporate Enterprise Development Java is
has ruled that market for quite some
time and I don't expect that to change
anytime soon I don't think it's now like
the flavor of the month type of thing
it's not like everybody's like oh I love
job I want to jump into the Java train
but Java is is somewhat of a necessity
there's so much code out there there's
so much opportunity if you're a good
Java developer you should be able to
find a job a little bit easier than I
think then if you would be a Python or
PHP or Perl developer for sure so Java
is also the language of choice for the
android framework so if you want to do a
lot of Android development Java and
Android kind of go hand in hand so we're
going to continue to see Java roll the
market so if you're looking for a
languaging you haven't learned Java
you're definitely not wasting your time
learning it number two is JavaScript
this was the number one language last
year on the list so this one this is the
only agreed-upon language of the web
browser for so long we've heard of
languages like ASM Jaya so we're going
to hear about how dart Jas is going to
be the new language of the browser but
the thing is as JavaScript keeps getting
better the newest JavaScript 6.0
standards also known as echo script 2015
has a lot of things like lexical scoping
and as like using the let variables it
has promises in module importing there's
going to be a lot of stuff that
javascript is bringing to the table and
javascript seven is going to promise to
bring even more stuff so as as the
JavaScript language matures we're seeing
some of its voids being filled with its
newer releases so we're seeing languages
like typescript pop up to try to fill
some of that like the void that
JavaScript brings but the fact of the
matter is javascript is going to be it's
not going anywhere it's it's if you want
to be a web developer you have to know
JavaScript you absolute
have to know it you're going to see
typescript probably arise in popularity
because of the shortcomings of some of
the things that Java Script does
especially dating back a few years ago
but then watch you know those
deficiencies shore up and JavaScript
continued to be a popular language for
web development the only thing that
javascript isn't really going to do
because it would change the way
JavaScript works and operates is that
it's never going to be a type safe
language so with typescript that's why
brings this type safe to the JavaScript
and that's why I really think the
typescript is not going to be really
replaced by JavaScript I think that
they're going to both be pretty
important hand-in-hand the final and
number one on this list is this c-sharp
language now to all you nan Microsoft
developers out there you're probably be
like Oh Microsoft fanboy blah blah blah
but if you guys know me and you know my
videos I've been harping on Python and
Django since I started development I
love Python
I love Django I love I've gotten into go
I've done some roughs tutorials I've
done all kinds of stuff but you have to
get you have to give the nod the c-sharp
this year because some of the things
that the new CEO Satya Nadella and
Microsoft has done he's open sourced the
c-sharp language itself he's open source
the proprietary Visual Studio I
integrated development environment for
writing code we're seeing the the azure
cloud environment start to take more and
more business like many fortune 500 and
fortune 100's are now putting their
application stacks on the Microsoft
cloud Microsoft recently bought LinkedIn
they bought xamarin which xamarin is a
billion-dollar platform that is used to
be able to write mobile apps using C+ or
objective-c or you know mobile apps for
Android or Apple or even the Windows
Phone you can do all of that stuff in
xamarin it's also in the language of
choice behind the Unity game engine so
with Microsoft sitting on nearly a
billion dollars in cash and going out
and buying companies like LinkedIn for
20-some billion dollars they are going
to continue to be a force and even where
they haven't competed due to really
turning their back on some of the
development community over the last 10
to 15 years maybe longer they're
starting to gain some of that back and
they have so much money and so much
influence that they're able to pretty
much buy their way into areas that they
really couldn't compete just on the
simple fact of program or love so
c-sharp will make the number one on this
list all I would say the top five of
these languages I mean you cannot go
wrong with any one of them but if you're
looking for a language to learn and and
anyone on this list I don't think you're
going to be wasting your time at all and
2017
all right guys let the comments begin
let me know what you think and here's
