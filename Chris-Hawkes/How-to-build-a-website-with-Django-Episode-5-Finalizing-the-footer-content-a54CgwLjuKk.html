along now we're knocking out a big
portion of what we need to do to get
this application closer to production
environment now what we want to do is
add some like basic footer links like
Terms of Use and all that stuff so let's
go ahead and do that now we're gonna
create another ul and another set of Li
stuff and right now these links some
point know where we're gonna do is some
simple contact us do like privacy policy
every website should have some sort of
privacy policy
this should be a terms and conditions
and then we'll do another one for
contact us privacy policy terms and
conditions as far as I can tell that's
probably all this website will need do
that and then
I want to give this UL class a class so
I can override the default feature
because it's gonna be just a little bit
different than what our other UL element
had so we'll just call this footer menu
and then below this let's go ahead and
say I guess give it like a P class will
say copyright inside our copyright let's
go ahead and just say and copy boys and
girls clover Fredericksburg and then
we'll give it a year so that's good so
let's go ahead and style copyright and
first things first what we want to do is
we want to say footer dot Fleur dot wrap
position:relative and then inside here
our copyright
say position position is absolute weight
one percent display:block
text-align:center
bottom-5 pixels and see what that does
real quick
it's not exactly what I was looking for
at the moment
the reason why is that we do need to
give the rap a height which not sure
that we did let's go ahead and go in
here
we're give this width 100% height 40
margin zero height 150 and let's see
what that does
all right because our text is white and
it's showing up on a white background we
do not want the rap to be a background
play with which it's currently getting
so we want background to be the same
color as the footer it seems to be
inheriting that the white background
from the previous rap that was defined
so now this should show up a little bit
better right
yeah that's about fine let's go ahead
and fix the UL element in here so we
have this defined as footer menu so we
can simply say in our class so should be
dot the footer menu Li we're gonna say
display:inline-block float:left width is
going to be it's gonna be well we have
to have some sort of weight so just give
it a width of like and I want to take
this I'm gonna have a width of a hundred
percent text-align:center let's see if
this actually centers up it's not
centering empty no lie elements
really we could just say display:block
with Auto margin
okay that's strike two my this thing's
starting to annoy me let's go ahead and
just say with one percent the Li scare
125 pixels we're not gonna float it and
text-align:center so let's see what okay
so we definitely need the the full width
here so it's just give it 200 pixels
I don't like the way that looks but the
fact of matter is it you know it's
entering the elements in the middle it
just doesn't look like it's all centered
that well for right now I'm not gonna
mess with that any longer
and that could take some additional
tweaking if we want to we do want to
position this absolute though and then
we want to sit on the bottom probably
about 15 pixels so it should sit above
the copyright content no not sitting
right on the joint
some reason our copyright this thing
should be sitting on this zero we don't
have a height this thing should be
height 20 pixels I didn't have it
sitting on the bottom I'm gonna keep
this actually where it is so 5 pixels
and that should work pretty well
I guess because of the margin and stuff
that is being applied change the margin
and padding or the P element so now it's
it's where it's supposed to
now the footer menu I'm gonna go to put
this 25 pixels from the bottom so that
might work a little bit there you know
it definitely needs more room than that
probably twice as much let's just say 50
might be a little bit too much but
that's fine for right now and let's go
ahead and just change the color real
quick so footer menu Li a is gonna be
white make the font size 14 pixels
text-decoration:none
and then the hover is gonna be much more
simpler hover since it's on bottom
content will just a hover and would you
say text-decoration:underline so it's a
much more simplistic type thing since it
is a footer link so
yeah I mean I can I can live with that
somewhat somewhat
alright so I'm gonna go and cut this
video off in the next video let's go
ahead and start I will name our links
and then we'll start creating some
additional pages so that we can link
those up and we'll move on from there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
