want to talk about whether or not we're
headed into another dot-com bubble
bursting type of situation that we saw
back in 1999 in two thousand I wasn't in
the tech world back then but I've
certainly read a lot about it the
dot-com bubble bursting in 1999 led to
all kinds of problems i mean we went
into a pretty pretty deep recession the
stock market crashed a lot of companies
went out of business developer salary
has dropped demand for developers
dropped and things were pretty ugly for
several years and then we came out of
that and then once things started doing
good again we started seeing the rise of
things like MySpace and Facebook and
Twitter and YouTube and all these major
websites that were being used by
hundreds of millions of people but not
making any money but at the same time
valued at hundreds of billions of
dollars so it's something that we hadn't
really seen before that you know these
speculative valuations for companies
that had no plan or even you know laid
out any sort of plan to actually earn
money which is generally the number one
rule of running a business and any
society is that you have to find a way
to make money so if you're not making
money you're borrowing money and
typically these companies that were just
getting started or considered you know
startups that's what they're called a
lot of them exist on the west coast of
the United States like in California
Silicon Valley or you know maybe out of
Texas like Austin Dallas Washington DC
New York so if you're not making money
you're borrowing money and you're
borrowing money from venture capitalists
so million million millionaires or
billionaires and their certified venture
capitalists meaning that they are
legally allowed to invest their money
into some anti startups and they're
called angel investors so if they're
angel investing they're they're putting
their money in high-risk startups and
for the last decade now I mean it's been
like cool to be a business owner a
Silicon Valley hipster
you know with your idea and your
connections from Stanford and wherever
else and your hundreds of millions of
dollars to get your company off the
ground and by extravagant office in
downtown Palo Alto and you know what i
mean so we've seen that and then they
take the money they hire the best and
the brightest developers and programmers
are making you know 150,000 on average
on the west coast in the united states
and some of them are making way more
than that some are even making seven
digits and what that does is it ends up
increasing demand across the board for
all programmers because then companies
like Google and Microsoft and you know
large homeless like that have to pay
their programmers more money in order
for them not to lead to this hot startup
with hundreds of millions of dollars in
venture capital funding so it ends up
creating you know demand and programmer
salaries increase and we've seen it
increase a number of times over the last
ten years so it's been a very good time
to be a programmer for instance if we
look at two extremes you have San
Francisco as of right now according to
indeed com which is the number one jobs
website they have senior developers in
San Francisco making a hundred and forty
on average now that's average so there's
quite a bit of people making a lot more
than that but if we look at Washington
DC which has a much lower cost of living
then then silicon valley and west coast
san francisco and the senior developer
there is making a hundred and thirty so
developers are making a lot of money
there's a lot of people making a lot
more than that a lot of people making a
lot less than that but ultimately if
you're a senior program or you're making
decent change in the united states right
now and you have been for some time but
the news of late is that venture capital
funding is starting to dry up venture
capitalists are starting to pull out and
the reason why is because since the
great recession of 2008 when the US
housing market crashed and brought down
the entire world into a recession the
dollar started to become cheap because
our Federal Reserve lowered interest
rate
to near zero levels making it very easy
to borrow money and essentially have to
pay little to no interest back so the
dollar was cheap meaning that it was
good it was a good time to invest in
stocks and also in to invest in startups
to get the most out of your dollar which
was being devalued every month by the
Federal Reserve on top of the low
interest rates they were actually
printing money every single month and
I'm not talking about a little bit of
money I'm talking about fifty sixty
billion dollars a month of printed money
lowering the value of the u.s. dollar
combined with a low interest rate it
sparked investment and that investment
went into Wall Street and we saw Wall
Street continue to like after the crash
of 2008 come back very strong in the
2009 and the 10 and you know all the way
up until recently stock market has been
a very very good place to make money
right now but it doesn't necessarily
reflect mainstream Main Street United
States because typical mom and pop shops
and middle-class you know continues to
struggle with higher health care and
higher cost of living housing you know
no longer being affordable or you know
that it was affordable a few lost I have
to value in your home maybe you're
upside down something like 8 million
people went into foreclosure it was it
was a ridiculous mess and obviously
Europe and the euros eurozone with all
their issues on followed shortly after
so you fast forward to today and you're
seeing that the Federal Reserve in the
United States has finally stopped making
money so cheap they stopped the printing
presses some time ago and they've
started raising the interest rates with
promises to raise them you know higher
into the future now they're still very
low and it's only been raised one time
just a few months ago by like point two
five percent which is hardly anything
it's still enough to have venture
capitalists start to look at where we
are as an economy and start to pull back
because it's going to become more
expensive to borrow money so the issue
that I see is that we've had companies
like Twitter who have been in existence
for I don't I don't have the exact year
but I mean twitter has been around for
at least five six seven years now
well in the last six or seven years
Twitter's actually never turned a profit
they keep saying their their
profitability is right around the corner
but they've never made any money yet and
they're supposedly valued and the
billions so if we look at their market
cap according to today's stock they're
valued at nearly 13 billion dollars
although they've never made any money
pandora radio is the same thing they've
been around for several years now at one
point they were like the number one
provider of streaming music they might
still be I don't know I know Spotify is
definitely putting some pressure on them
and you know pandora has a market cap of
over two billion dollars but they lost
85 million dollars last year so they've
never turned a profit either so if
you're not actually making money as a
company which is the number one role of
making money you're obviously borrowing
money so if borrowing money from venture
capitalists all of a sudden becomes
unavailable to you what's going to end
up happening how is Pandora or Twitter
going to be able to pay for top
developer talent if they don't have
hundreds of millions of dollars of
venture capital funding continuing to be
poured into their companies the answer
is that they're not there's no way that
can continue to go on I mean we've seen
big box stores like brick and mortar
stores like Circuit City radio shack
borders bookstores oh you know those
three companies weren't turning a profit
and you know granted their expenses were
probably a lot higher since you know
they had brick and mortar stores as
opposed to servers and developers and
salaries I mean they still if you're not
making a profit you don't stay in
business so that's both bad and good
it's mostly bad for developers because
unless you're trying to start the next
you know Twitter or something like that
then it's your it's not going to affect
you too much but I think what we're
going to end up seeing is it may come
back down to realistic levels you're not
going to see the snapchats and the
Pinterest of the world being valued at
hundreds of billions of dollars or you
know 50 billion dollars without making
any money or having any sort of revenue
plan beyond just you know some you know
pipedream like you know thought up like
on it scribble down on a piece of paper
of how you might make money one day
because you're going to start
advertising or something you know it's I
think people are going to want to see
especially stock investors are going to
want to see companies actually making
money I mean for the longest time
Facebook wasn't making any money but we
always knew that they were going to
because they were so large and you know
because of their network of how they
connected family and friends and I mean
people like myself I don't even hardly
use Facebook but I wouldn't think of
deleting it because I'm still connected
all my family and friends and there's
there's no other reason you know like a
competitor isn't going to lure me away I
mean they'd have to have a significant
feature and really I wouldn't even be
the first ones to jump on it like
Google+ I mean Google+ is okay but it's
not as good as Facebook and nobody
jumped to it so I'm not going to spend a
ton of time on google+ so my point is is
uh you know Facebook is I think one
exception of a company that didn't make
money for the longest time and but
everybody knew that they were eventually
going to same with Amazon that they had
a similar history during the last com
crash though i read that amazon stock
price was a hundred and seven dollars
and when the market crashed in 1999 and
by the time i started recovering in 2001
amazon stock price was at a low of seven
dollars a share so i don't know what
percentage that is but obviously that is
a that is a pounding and and they're one
of the few that actually escaped the
dot-com crash without going on a
business so i don't think we'll see
anything as severe this time around but
there's definitely been a bubble
building in the tech world and everybody
is known about it for quite some time
it's helped salaries it's helped
companies and eventually that party has
to come to an end at least for a while
it may not be that bad then one thing
that has me concerned though is that in
addition to just the tech world you know
kind of drawing up with it with the
money that was flowing freely we're also
seeing other issues like oil-exporting
nations including the United States who
had ramped up production to like
all-time high levels since like the
1970s
that entire industry is being put out of
business right now because of oil that's
just flooding the market from like Saudi
Arabia and Iran trying to you know
retain their their dominance in their
market share so it's it's crushing
smaller companies or companies but
countries out of South America or even
Africa the Middle East and obviously
Russia as well major economy that relies
on oil exports so I'm wondering what's
going to end up happening there because
already they've been struggling and then
you have your China whose whose keeps
devaluing their currency to try to you
know make make them more profitable with
their exports and stuff like that and
cheap labor and stuff so I'm just
wondering I mean you have all this stuff
that's kind of brewing and we're
probably you or at least some people are
saying we could go into a recession
anyway not just because of the tech
world so I think you know the bubble if
the bubble is really bursting in the
tech world it's happening at a pretty
ugly time just because we're we have all
these other market forces out there that
are also coinciding to create kind of
like a perfect storm I think so kind of
a gloomy outlook but I don't think it's
the end of the world I just think that
you know ultimately you have to be
prepared that you know there may be some
layoffs in the future if if the bubble
does crash and you're going to see some
companies go out of business you're
probably going to see some salaries
decline hopefully not but I mean that
would just be probably the worst case
scenario one good thing though I can
think of is like I said if you do have
some sort of bootstrap small mom and
pops type of idea you'll be able to get
it off the ground I think easier than
because you in this day and age right
now it doesn't matter if you have a good
idea and you're the first to the market
with it if you don't have the most money
somebody can just steal your idea and
make it better so talent goes a long way
but it can't take you all the way there
and when you're trying to build like
next Facebook or Twitter or something
like that ideally you probably want to
keep your scope and check and maybe not
try to tackle something so large but I
know that's what the hip and cool guys
and you know to stand for an Ivy League
graduates all want to do they all want
to start the next snapchat and Facebook
and all that stuff because you know
Zuckerberg had a movie about them so
they want that
too so you know maybe you try to find
something a little bit more modest maybe
maybe try to plan something like that
just to make sure that that you're
prepared as a developer if we end up
doing do going into a crash just try to
make sure you have something something
going on besides you know just what you
have here now anyway guys that's really
all I want to say just kind of giving
you guys a heads up and just let you
know you know what I thought about it so
anyway guys have a good night thanks for
watching and please subscribe bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
