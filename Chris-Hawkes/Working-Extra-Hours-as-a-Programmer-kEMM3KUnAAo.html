give a quick shout-out say thank you for
the sixty thousand subscribers one of
the reason why I hit that mark as
quickly as I did because I just got
50,000 I think like last month or
something but the reason why is because
Google ended up deciding to take that
video I do with my daughter and make it
viral to the point where it got like
four hundred thousand views in just a
matter of a couple days and it turns out
that like there's quite a bit of like
complete assholes and pedophiles that
are on the internet so like I had ended
up disabling the comments on that but
anybody that's like here to see my
daughter you guys can just go get the
bug out I don't care if you think she's
pretty if you think she's ugly like I
don't give a like you're not here
on my channel like I'm not I don't want
to hear from you so if you subscribed
during that that moment that Google
decided to throw a couple on a thousand
random views my way people that weren't
even interested in programming to which
is completely surprising to me so I I
don't know why they picked that video of
all videos and then they just like throw
it out in front of everybody but either
way there was quite a few i would say it
was like a couple hundred thousand views
and i'm not sure so it was weird i
probably gained like you know like i
said three or four thousand subscribers
on that so it seems like you know since
that time there's also been like an
influx of people that are like
complaining about the content that I
make and it's like well this is what
I've always done so you know hit the
 Road if if you don't like it
that's that's what I got to say but
other than that things are going pretty
well as far as like being a programmer I
ended up having to take work home with
me this weekend so that kind of
sucks but then like when I go to try to
connect running into like network issues
or I can't even authenticate so that's
kind of too but the good news is
is that I'm about to see my capitals
place so if you guys want talking about
whether or not chris is just making
random content well that's what I do
it's a hobby but this this capitals game
up we go on there verizon center
nice i'm pretty pretty stoked about that
but i suppose if this video is going to
have a purpose we should go ahead and
talk about bringing work home with you
so sometimes when you're programming you
have to to do stuff like on the weekends
work evenings are trying to make
deadlines and things like that sometimes
it might be your own fault sometimes
they give the other people's fault like
the circumstance is very when it comes
to something like that but that is like
a reality unfortunately for being a
programmer is that you do end up having
you know you have certain amounts of
work you have to get done and sometimes
that work is like just like instead of
the other day about the puzzle piece
type of thing where it's like even if
you think that things are going to go
well and you've done it before then you
know things can sometimes like fall
apart you then have to put in you know
some extra time so that is one thing you
want to consider when when you look at
different companies as far as like you
know if they have a much higher salary
do they expect people to work a lot more
it is it better to actually have that
higher salary and work a lot more a lot
of younger people feel that way then you
know some of the older people they they
feel more inclined to take a position
with a company where it's like you know
eight hours is kind of the status quo
and then it's very rare that they work
overtime and or that they have to I
think most places that I've ever seen
especially you know working at the two
corporations I've worked for that you do
have to do extra time every now and then
but it shouldn't be something you have
to do all the time so that makes it much
more reasonable so if it's like if it's
kind of a place so that you're doing
that all the time we definitely no
second guess you know whether or not you
know that yes it really started liam
weighing and how many extra hours you're
working and then obviously do the math
and figure out what it is that you
actually make based on the amount of
work that you actually put in so that's
that's pretty sound advice I think
coming from from somebody like me who
has changed jobs to make a higher salary
and things like that but have the way
into a lot of factors now not just like
you know locality and things like that
because a lot of times if you're going
to you know from you you obviously have
to take that into consideration but
that's not necessarily something that a
company is concerned about because a lot
of places it's like
we're going to offer you the job you
should work you know in this area and
things like that so if you decide to
take on that commute oh that is
something that you know in my opinion
you shouldn't ask for a higher salary
for that it might raise your overall
price a bit but you know in a sense to
the end to the company they probably
don't give a that you have to
commute you know an hour two hours a day
or something like that where I live in
Virginia I've told you guys this before
but a lot of people they commute up to
DC and I'm actually going the opposite
direction but DC is a nightmare
when it comes to traffic like even today
I'm going to be on the web to the
verizon center and I'm getting ready to
leave it's Saturday and it's
three-thirty right now Saturday April
fifteenth and DC is about 40 miles north
of here but the highways in a complete
state of fuckery going all the way from
like south of fredericksburg all the way
to like Springfield Virginia which is
just south of DC and it's where the
Beltway starts that wraps around DC
anyway it's just a complete nightmare so
I'm going to end up leaving here
probably in the next 30 minutes so I can
get up to Springfield hop on a
train get into the city and then get
into the stadium so I have to devote
essentially two hours to get in and
around the city which is its kind of it
it's a downside to living in the
Washington area it really is washington
d.c like I said the traffic is it has
been ever since I've been here
and it's been my whole life and even you
know beyond that like if you compare it
to other cities and things like that it
compares up there with it fluctuates
between like Los Angeles and and DC as
far as the two worst cities where people
spend the most amount of time in traffic
so that's another thing you have to take
in consideration like I've been a fan of
trying to get my wife to want to
relocate somewhere else where there's
less of a commute lower cost of living
and things like that but we're both DC
natives like we've grown up in a DC
region they were very East Coast so like
trying to get her to come you know
convince her to let go to Dallas or like
Tampa even though like the cities there
might be more stuff to do
ooh maybe not there's a lot to do in DC
but you like dolls for instance there's
a low cost of living it's a big
metropolis you can do shopping and all
that stuff a lot of jobs and security
there but it's also very flat and
playing there's no mountains there's no
oceans like there's no trees like as far
as like a major force compared to what
I'm used to doing in Virginia so anyway
just a lot to kind of like pour over
there but when you're a programmer the
good thing is is like you have you have
opportunities everywhere one of my
buddies that I work with he came from
Austin he's working in richmond virginia
right now and he was interviewing and
all kinds of different places i think
one of them was like Sacramento and
can't remember all the places but he
originally hails from New York around
New York City and ended up going to
austin to find a job but once your bunch
of kids though I think that the equation
changes like because obviously you're
dragging your kids your wife and you
know if you're single or if you you know
you're just like you know have a
girlfriend or something and you guys
it's much easier I think to be able to
relocate and to take up on those
opportunities but once you start having
a family and things like that your
priorities start to change a little bit
and that also plays into whether or not
you actually want to have a job where
you end up having to do a lot of extra
work like if you feel like it's a
constant state of like 10 or 11 hours a
day like then that's no good you're much
better off you know getting paid fifteen
twenty thousand dollars less if you're
working you know less hours because even
if you are making that extra money like
it you know the taxman you know for
excess of 100 thousand dollar salaries I
mean it's like it is a pretty good chunk
of change ends up going to taxes on both
the state and federal level so I don't
know man to start kind of speaking I
guess in generalities but once again i'm
excited i'm going to be going up cmi
capitals play hopefully we can take it
again to from toronto here and that's
that's what I'm doing today so thanks
for 60,000 guys that's all I got to say
have a good day bye hey guys so I just
want to take a moment to mention that
