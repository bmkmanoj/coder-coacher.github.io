everybody is having a good evening and i
have a question here from one of my
viewers and his name is what's his name
his name is i don't know i'm just
getting his name is julius caesar which
probably isn't is real name anyway or it
might be it's not julius anyway so he
says I'm just wondering if I learned
Python from YouTube channels like yours
and through the internet am I still is
still so self-taught so I consider
anybody anybody to be self-taught like
you're self-taught if you did not to go
to some sort of higher education
institution I would consider that also
even like certifications to some extent
like I think once you start going to
boot camps like if you go to a boot camp
like my sponsors boot camp like dev
mountain coding boot camp I think even
at that point you then have like a
certificate that says hey you you learn
this specific criteria so I think that
would be like a good complement to
self-taught but even then I would say
that that's where you start crossing the
threshold into actually getting you know
paid education that can that can vouch
for the education that you've received
whereas like you know fully self taught
for the most part I think is you know
something that isn't really verifiable
beyond you know your portfolio or your
employment history so you're at a major
disadvantage in the workforce I think
when when you do go that route and I
think it's much harder to get your first
gig without some sort of education but I
would definitely consider that to be
self taught so you learned through
YouTube you buy some books and you learn
on your own initiative that's definitely
self taught a lot of people and I've
talked to people including my wife who
says that you know she needs to like the
classroom structure a structured
environment in order to learn and be
able to stay motivated and things like
that a lot of people just don't have the
motivation to go out and learn the
things that they really don't want to
learn now programming is a little bit
different because a lot of times we have
this natural interest and we just start
driving forward with our interest and we
find the whole thing fun and I mean it
doesn't seem like work so for for that
matter like I've recently started
learning and picking up math and I've
been taking math courses on like Connick
out of me and things like that some
braids low grade school math that I
don't even remember from my high school
days and things but I'm doing it on my
own initiative in my own accord and I
think in a way it makes it easier for me
because it's like you know I don't have
to learn this but at the same time I can
just put it down and call it a day call
it a week call it a month you know
without actually having to put forward
you know that that really that extra
effort that a college or institution
would require from you so I can see you
know employers wanting to have that
degree it also shows you have that drive
and initiative to finish something but
in this day and age the employment or
not the employment with the educational
system at least within the united states
i think is getting set for a major
disruption I think my channel is even
you know something that kind of hints to
me that that you know obviously the
world is changing YouTube has created a
platform that people are able to not
just share their thoughts and ideas
through pictures and words but now
through videos and through your getting
things straight from the horse's mouth
and one of the best books I've ever read
recently was and I didn't even read
about the audiobook but it was called
dis disrupted by dawn or dan lyon so it
was this book right here in this book
was absolutely phenomenal like it was
great because if you buy the audiobook
it's actually Dan Lyons who is doing the
narration so he gets everything you know
within with the perfect context so yeah
it sounds like me talking to you guys
for my video it's just you know he's
obviously reading what he's already
written down but he's a good writer and
and his story is just absolutely you
know fascinating with with starting the
he went into a tech startup which was
hubspot out of Cambridge Massachusetts
and it's one of the unicorn you know
billion dollar internet startups and
things like that that everybody was
talking about and basically he just he
describes it as a millennial nightmare
and if you just say if you anybody
that's interested in tech I think would
enjoy that book I loved it but um the
point is is that YouTube has provided
this new medium where you know through
our own words and actions and voices and
everything we're able to you know
describe and communicate with each other
and I think that's great education can
also do the same thing and from what
I've seen like here's a python tutorial
series that i created just on September
eighth and it
he has 36,000 views and its really
relatively well received and it's just
me teaching you guys how to how to
program in Python I'm not an educator
I'm not a teacher I didn't go to school
to teach or anything like that and I
think a lot of people would balk at that
however a lot of people seem to get a
lot of benefit out of this and if they
get benefit then the naysayers can you
know go themselves for all I can I
care I'm just trying to help people out
and the thing is is that anybody can do
that and for the most part some of the
information I offer in here I get told
is better than some of the stuff that
they're learning at you know companies
that are paying people to teach to teach
classes major institutions and things
like that I'm not going to say to my
education is on par with something like
that you're going to find in Stanford or
anything like that but from an average
Joe like myself teaching other people
you know that they can also do the same
thing I think is you know very
motivational YouTube provides that
medium and it's completely free for
anybody that wants do that and then with
you know ebooks and things like that
books are now cheaper than they've ever
been obviously a lot of people have been
able to do you know torrenting things
like that like software applications
which then ends up benefiting the
company because there's been situations
where somebody might torrent you know an
application learn how to use it and then
they end up buying it or they get hired
by some company where it's their job you
know to use that which obviously you
know drives the company to continue to
buy the product because that's what
people are trained on I think it's just
near this whole flowing thing that the
Internet is a vast source of information
it's also a vast cluster when it
comes to things like politics and social
media and every average idiot being able
to give their opinion including my own
one of the things that I've had success
on is giving my opinion on top 10
programming languages it's one assholes
opinion but I've had like 700,000 views
on one video that did it and now people
try to copy and steal my but the
thing is is that people are interested
in it I have an opinion on it people are
interested in my opinion I try to back
it up with details some people tell me
I'm full of most people think it's
okay and it's just you know it's the way
it is but the inner the educational
institution i think is definitely set in
right for you know a major major
disruption it is such a
a racket and I can talk about this
probably all day long but college
textbooks is one of the things that I
absolutely hated buying and if it was
available online like I I'm not going to
go there but basically college textbooks
are an absolute racket you don't need 27
versions of accounting one that updates
every six months I mean who's getting
the kickbacks on that it's paid
for by the students by federal funding
we've seen the with itt tech
you know these terrible diploma mills
that are giving people worthless
education basically getting paid by the
federal government through the taxpayer
so basically that's mostly middle-class
you know hard-working middle-class
people that end up paying the brunt of
all these taxes and then you have no
 ball companies are basically
screwing over kids who think that
they're getting an education they're
going to change their lives the internet
doesn't do any of that stuff like
YouTube's not doing any of that if
somebody goes to my YouTube tutorials
and then they decide they don't like it
then they can move on they didn't lose
anything but their their time and effort
and they can make that decision
relatively quick they can go to Coursera
if they want you know there's major
major institutions here now they're also
charging money and I feel like some of
their stuff is not nearly as as low
level or in your face and very very
personable as like some of the YouTube
stuff like what I've done and everything
but you know this is something that I
think is also interesting and even the
larger institutions see the writing on
the wall I personally feel like the
johns hopkins in the Stanford's and the
University of Chicago's of the world
they're always going to have their place
as an elite educational institution and
obviously cambridge and other you know
universities from different countries
around the world they're always going to
have their place because that's truly
where the elite talent should be going
to get the other education in order to
advance you know the sciences and the
math and things like that you're going
to have people like zuckerberg who was
also you know he was going to harvard
when he when he became famous with
facebook and he was going to have you
know major success no matter what he did
but and those types should end up going
to those major institutions so i'm not
saying that they shouldn't but there's a
vast majority of people that I mean you
can't have everybody in the world be a
programmer
and that's something I it's a topic for
another video actually I don't want to
not only go down that rabbit hole right
now but the point is though is that yes
if you're using these online resources
especially under your own initiative
without being force you don't have
anything to really show for it except
for your personal experience that you
have to then show to other people you
are completely self-taught if we're
saying that anybody that goes to college
is technically self talk to teach
themselves what's being taught to them
then everybody's self-taught and that's
you know then you distort the this the
the definition of what that means and
and that's just not what it means so I
think yeah continue to learn on check
out my tutorial series here on Python if
you guys are interested I need to expand
it I'm sorry that I don't get around to
doing it I think once it starts becoming
relatively well received I it puts a
little bit more pressure on me to not
 it up and like start putting on
videos that are going to end up you know
making it look worse and things and if I
start getting rushed then that's just
what ends up happening one of my
favorite authors of all time in fact
really an idol one of my few items that
I've had in life growing up is Bill
Watterson the creator of calvin and
hobbes this guy i mean it just it's it's
absolutely phenomenal book just it's
just it's great like the artistic the
creativity of it the imagination and the
characters and everything is just it's
absolutely unreal but why did he stopped
he stopped because he was only 36 when
he retired by the way he's still only
like 53 or 54 years old right now he's
been retired for almost 20 years and he
retired because of the you know the the
daily stresses of having to then like he
wanted to make sure that he was not
selling himself short and in some ways
I've sold myself short on some of the
videos that I just put out there and I
think that with the tutorial videos I
actually think you know selling yourself
short on those is even more important
you know not to do then just coming up
with a video like what I'm doing tonight
where I can just simply talk in front of
a camera and a microphone and and call
it a night the tutorials I think I need
to spend a little bit more time on
trying to perfect that because some
people do do appreciate that and they've
said that my tutorials have actually how
them get a job and things like that so
for those reasons I actually want to
take it you know more serious and as I
progressed in this whole YouTube channel
i think i have spent more time trying to
take those things serious and more
serious i think the quality is going a
little bit better but once again if I
start getting rush then it's just it's
too much and the quality starts to slip
alright guys that's all I got tonight so
thanks for watching make sure you about
the video please share like comment
subscribe and all that stuff thanks guys
bye hey guys so a lot of you asked me
how do I get my foot in the door to
become a programmer and I just wanna
take a moment to mention dev Mountain
