in this world man there are the
programmers that actually want to be
computer nerds they're like that study
logic that study mathematics that are
very good and very gifted at a lot of
those things that actually love the
puzzle pieces of programming and then I
think that there's this other set of
programmers you know this other greater
flock of programmers that can actually
do it day to day but then you know
they're successful at being able to to
be able to get the job done but all not
necessarily you know be in coding for
the actual passion of solving problems
and programming logic or looking at the
beauty of a programming language what I
mean by that is that other person that
other type of programmer I think is like
the entrepreneur that kind of looks at
programming and how it can enable them
to do something better than what they
could do before without any of them
having that knowledge whether it's just
logic knowledge or whether or not
they're able to use near the programming
language to be able to do something that
they weren't able to do before whether
it's automation or something to that
effect so I think that there is hope for
both types of programmers though
honestly because there's going to be the
programmers and you know the Facebook's
idea if you look at the you know the
spicy Jay who is 1 of the major
developers behind react or the Dan
Abramov of the world and things like
that those people are naturally gifted
they're they're they're people that and
they essentially if they were a
carpenter they would look at a tree to
understand how they could actually make
you know a wooden chest like a shiny
wooden chest you know cherry wood or
whatever the hell it is you know but
there's those types of programmers that
can literally make something from
nothing and those are like I said are
the spicy J's and Dan Abramov so John
Skeets of the world and then then
there's like you know the vast majority
of other types of programmers that I've
been talking about for a long time which
are the web developers the the typical
even you know gaming and game
programmers game developers Automation
developers even you know UX designers
and things like that so there I think
that there should be two distinct
separate types of fields for programming
for me when I was first getting involved
in this whole thing I was looking at
programming languages libraries and
frameworks and then immediately from an
entrepreneur point of view
what can that do for me what can that do
for the business that I'm trying to
create how can I make money with that
that is I think one side of the
programming equation that I've
personally seen where I don't see it in
other people I see it a lot of oh yeah
you know that person's made a lot of
money doing this and that and I want to
I want to make a lot of money too but
you know I'm still more into the nerdy
aspect of you know just like being
involved in coding and here's the thing
like if you're going to be a software
engineer for a major development company
especially a software development
company they love the nerdy types they
love the Dan Abramov from the John's key
to the world because that is you know
those are the people that can literally
make something from nothing that is to
an extent like if you're a software
development company now if you're a
business and has a technological need
like you have you have a lot of stuff
that you need to automate that you want
the customers to be able to do that had
manual or human intervention then those
types of things can be solved by people
that don't necessarily have to be the
dawn of the Dan Abramov of the world I
always sit in a room off because
actually my buddies are they poke fun at
me when I'm talking about being a DNA
parole because whenever I can't figure
something out it has to do with a es6 or
reactor redose my running joke with them
is I'm like damn you Dan Abramov or you
know they guy just for whatever reason
like I just I I kind of picked him out
of the blue just as like the scapegoat
for for my lack of ability to understand
a problem at a given time but really
it's just a joke but it it's funny how
he just comes naturally out when I'm
talking to you guys but so the thing is
is like I do I have personally met
people that are like DNA of them off and
then I've met people that are not theirs
and like I would say the majority of
them are not like that and luckily for a
lot of those people a lot of business
needs out there are not necessarily
relying upon the those types as well so
can you build so can you build a wooden
chest like if your partner can you build
a house out of a tree and I like
obviously spending multiple trees or
whatever but
there are certain people that understand
exactly what it is that they need to do
and they kind of just like make make
something from nothing and then there's
a lot of people that just can't do that
and work if you ask me the question
because I'm sure some of you guys would
probably ask me like where am I on that
like am i that type of developer I don't
really know I really don't I think that
when I got into programming I got into
programming because I wanted to solve
business problems I wanted to be a
businessman I was going to school for
Business Administration and I worked for
a major corporation on the business side
of things I wasn't an IT so I understood
the the the importance of IP but that
wasn't really where my interest live
when I was first getting into all of
this stuff so I think some of it was
superficial like you know when I was
first getting in and idea the YouTube
and Facebook's of the world and things
like that making the news and all the
money and and back in those days I
thought just a simple idea it could be
you know brought to fruition with a
little bit of a hard drive and effort
and things like that but so you know in
my net crew that creative type I think I
am in some extent because it to some
extent because I have created websites
I've created this channel this channel
is now had is almost 7 million years so
that's a 7 million people out there have
watched me maybe multiple people over
and over again but either way there
there there's seven like exact let me
check my stats real quick so just in the
last 28 days I've had almost five years
of content launched on my channel so to
me like okay I may not be the best
developer in the world but clearly I
have a creative passion and a drive and
things like that I think a lot of you
guys subscribed to me for that and I
honestly think that especially as I get
older like I'm curious to know whether
or not I'm in that first group of
developers which is like you know it's a
Nuri I love the program there's nothing
better in life than programming and then
there's the other people that are like
hey I can use programming because I can
make money with programming I can solve
problems that I have I can be creative
with programming and I'm sure that the
two sides they're overlap
to some to some extent but I really
think that I'm on the latter half of
that I would have to say that if I had
to choose between the two that I would
be on the latter half now the thing is
is that even if you're like the nerdy
coding programmer type I mean sometimes
you run out of that piss and vinegar
that I was telling you about and I've
talked about that in other videos and
things like that and luckily for even
those types there are other career paths
like for when that might end up
happening and that's when you kind of go
into management or you like look at
leadership restart going into consulting
and things like that and then you have
like I said this other the other side
maybe where I feel like I'm I lean more
towards it's like did the business
creative side like how can I use this
technology is it really beneficial for
me those are still those are still very
important type of people I believe
because they're the ones who aren't
necessarily looking for the most
artistic like or even the most logically
sound solution for something they're
looking from a business need how can I
accomplish a business specific goal in
the shortest amount of time with you
know with the least amount of man-hours
and and things like that so once again
the two sides overlap I think that
there's obviously if you if you have if
you asked like a super nerdy and every
mouth of the world like using Bill I
will read up solves all kind of types of
business means and things like that you
know of course they're going to feel
that they're solving the same problems
and then you're going to a lot of people
that are like more just you know kind of
get it done types of people that are
like no I can use I don't need to use
reality a six inch angular or something
like that I'm just going to stick with
the more old-school Ruby on Rails Python
Django I'm going to go to the market
first I'm going to see whether or not
the market is going to accept my product
unless been more time in marketing and
things like that because we all know
that if people aren't out there using
your product it doesn't matter how well
it's designed it's not going to make you
any money it's going to be a failure so
you know getting to the market first a
whole Lean Startup type of mentality
that's that's where I feel like
programming and a large extent should be
another thing I want to mention is that
in a
I'm talking about this more length with
programming is something that everybody
should be getting into I know some of
you guys that reached out to me you're
like I don't know if I want to be a
senior developer right on that I want to
be a software developer or whatever I
may be I just want to learn Python and
there is absolutely nothing wrong with
that like we are living longer now than
we've ever lived in the past especially
like in the United States when Social
Security was first implemented I believe
the average lifespan was around 60 or 61
and then you weren't even eligible for
until I what 63 I could be wrong on
those numbers but now the average
lifespan is like 82 by the time you fast
forward a couple of decades we're going
to be like the average lifespan into the
hundreds so can you be a developer later
on in life I think you absolutely can
and I think that you know Brenda you're
not going to be that first type of nerdy
type of programmer I was telling you
about that's going to be you know making
new software languages from nothing I
mean at least in my opinion that's
probably not you know the past it that
that month should be striving for at
that point I think it's more about how
can I use programming to be a better
employee to be a better husband and a
better father it has been a better
father like a better everything like you
can be you can use programming to
whatever sort of advantage that you see
fit and I talked about this as well like
in different you don't necessarily have
to be in software and technology you can
be in plumbing or HVAC or trucking and
logistics whatever it's like you can you
can find your niche in any of this stuff
and programming is going to make that
easier I really do I think it's going to
make it easier at the very least if
you've never become a programmer and you
never even use programming you know code
that you've written specifically for
your business and things like that at
least having superficial knowledge of
that still makes you a better and more
knowledgeable person overall so that's
my thoughts tonight guys thanks for
watching make sure you subscribe also
check out my sponsor dead mountain
coding boot camp they made this video
possible and I just so you guys know Deb
mountain is a coding bootcamp that's in
person so it's not online a lot of
people have criticism towards all my
boot camps because they kind of cheat a
little bit in the fact that when you're
going to an in-person developer boot
camp
you're actually working with real
programmers real people have been in the
industry and they're going to be
focusing on technologies like Jake
jQuery JavaScript node angular they have
12 and 16 week courses if you need
housing opportunities you can reach out
to them the link to dead mountain is in
the description tab below so check them
out and I know it's expensive guys but
people are getting hired with with boot
camp certificates so that that is good
news then and hopefully we can continue
to change the world in that regard all
right take care of mine</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
