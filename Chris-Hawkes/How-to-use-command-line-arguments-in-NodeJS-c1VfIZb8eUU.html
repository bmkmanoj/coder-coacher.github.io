nodejs app and what I'm trying to do is
I want to show you guys how you can read
command line arguments in order to
conduct a certain or
take a certain action depending on what
sort of argument gets passed to your
program if you've never used command
line arguments all that means is that if
you open up a command line that's where
the command line comes from and then
when you start your app you actually
start your app with two arguments your
first one is the node argument which
tells it to use the node engine and then
the second argument is actually the name
of the program that you're actually
running so to show you guys an example
of how that works we're gonna go ahead
and add a file here to the main app J's
file and this is using the Express node
framework and all your arguments that
are passed to node are going to be
stored in something called process start
Arg V which stands for value so R value
and we can go ahead and loop over each
one of those elements and I can show you
what they look like when we put them to
the screen so we'll say value index and
then
sorry I only need one print to see their
alright so we're just gonna do the
console dot log and here we're gonna end
up writing out to the console index and
then we'll just say give it a delimiter
and then do the value
alright so I fixed the parentheses
hopefully you guys can see this so
there's gonna loop through every
argument and then print it to the
command line so let's go ahead and run
the app so we run it you can see the
first argument snowed like I just like I
said in the second one which is actually
starts counting in zero so the second
one is app da Jia so if I went ahead and
I passed it another argument let me go
ahead and kill the program I could pass
it any number of arguments so here I'll
just say test and you can see that now
the third argument is test and then I
can give it any sort of arbitrary number
of arguments test1 test2 test3 and you
can see that they're all printed out so
really this this third argument which is
the index number to test it would be
what I'm looking for in my particular
example because what I want to do I want
to go ahead and just some detect I can
just say I can create a variable like
dev mode or is dev mode really I'll just
call it dev mode it's gonna be the name
of the argument equals process arc val
and we're gonna give it the second index
which is actually the third argument and
then I can take some sort of action
where I say if dev mode equals and we'll
just say go is the name of the argument
then I can go ahead and use the built-in
nodejs
or express RJ a static handler so this
will actually serve static content from
my application if it's in dev mode so
the only way dev mode is gonna be there
as if if I pass any arguments so let me
go ahead and just say my argument is dev
since I'm running it locally so the app
gets started everything goes well
hopefully my application will be running
with CSS and you can see the application
is running now because I'm in production
with this code base usually I'm getting
nginx actually used all my static
content
and let me just make sure I'm praying
this out I'm gonna see what value is
actually there crap so that's test just
the way I want it so I'll go ahead and
review remove this real quick and just
to make sure this particular line is
being hit I'll just do a console dot log
console that log true I just to show you
guys that this is working as expected so
if I pass in the argument dev you can
see that it is true my particular issue
the reason why the CSS is not found is
actually because of the folder structure
I have a different folder structure from
my production environment to my dev
environment that's something that I need
to sort out so that'll be not related to
this video anyway guys thanks for
watching that's how you use command-line
arguments and nodejs
and please subscribe bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
