a question from a viewer he says Chris
Hawkes brother I want to be able to
create a web app with server-side
scripting for software for mac and
Windows and I also want it to be for
games what are the two or three
languages I should learn first so the
first one that comes to mind and really
this is the only one I know for this
type of situation that would be c-sharp
I mean c-sharp for Windows it's now
cross-platform for both Windows and Mac
with the new dotnet core so there's
really I think no other way to go when
it comes to games now the reason why
games just because if you're just
getting started programming you don't
want to you don't want to get in over
your head I mean you could you could
probably go with C++
maybe but let me first try to explain
that the case for c-sharp and c++ maybe
my second option there but unity is a
very easy game engine in order to use so
if you have some basic c-sharp
experience and you're gonna be able to
hit the ground running with unity
relatively well now it's not easy
because game development is not easy at
all especially a 3d game engine which is
also capable 2d and you know work
obviously that's a 2-d game right there
but unity I think may it's just it's
it's a great framework and it's built
for this the c-sharp language so I don't
want to confuse anybody the actual
back-end the libraries that that the
lead of basically the core engine itself
is written in C and C++
but they've opened it up to basically
creating an API that you use c-sharp in
order to to work with the engine
although you can use other languages as
well like JavaScript and boo but I think
people should just stick with c-sharp
because it really it's annoying having
the documentation scattered all over the
unity unity ecosystem where like some of
it's in JavaScript and some of it is in
c-sharp so definitely you know c-sharp
is a is a solid language to learn it was
you know it was it has a lot of the
corporate backing of Microsoft obviously
so a lot of people don't like Microsoft
but the the language was designed really
really well it's completely
object-oriented its statically typed and
it's it's compiled so it's fast it's
going to be faster than Python it's
going to be faster than PHP or Ruby or
Perl or anything like that the
documentation I think is not very very
forgiving for newbies this is something
where I originally was getting into a
c-sharp tutorial series and I just
realized that you know I was getting
some feedback I was moving too fast and
one of the reasons why I haven't given a
tutorial in c-sharp is number one I do
it you know day in and day out and you
know I just I'm not sure that I want to
continue monkeying around with it
because I use it during the day so I try
to keep things fresh for me but in
addition it's because it's it's a
relative bitch to get started with
compared to some of the other languages
I find Python to be much easier I find
Perl to be easier and Ruby and
JavaScript I even find easier than
c-sharp so a lot of stuff is very
Microsoft II I would say if that's not
that's not really a word but basically
Microsoft has like almost like a way of
explaining things and a terminology and
even their ecosystem and then they're
there hacker community is very Microsoft
II compared to like some of the Linux
and Python guys that that I've also come
to know over the years so you know those
downsides said if you can learn c-sharp
there's a tremendous amount of
opportunity out there to make a lot of
money a lot of a lot of companies are
you know full C sharp or really dotnet
is what the the ecosystem is that
c-sharp is is is really built around but
a lot of companies are are considered
Microsoft shops or dotnet shops and that
just means that you know they're all
about the Microsoft set of products so
that means they're using Azure for cloud
hosting nowadays and Azure is you know
giving a lot of companies a run for
their money like even AWS Amazon's AWS
is where a huge majority of websites are
storing their data that they're running
their websites and things like that but
Asher is in second place there and you
know they continue to grow and their
products I can I know first hand a lot
of huge humongous billion-dollar
companies are using Azure for cloud
cloud hosting and storage and everything
and then microsoft also has xamarin too
so if you do get it good enough with
c-sharp then you can eventually get
involved with with xamarin which
microsoft ended up buying I think people
said it was for four hundred million
dollars but xamarin is what a lot of
companies use to make apps so youyou
asked about you know well really you
didn't mention apps did you no you
didn't mention apps oh but either way if
you ever wanted to get into app
development and Zoomer might be a decent
option for you I personally have never
found a whole lot of enjoyment and app
development I just wanted to be a real
miserable experience now I haven't tried
to port anything from unity yet so I'll
see if that changes my mind any but you
know one of the biggest pains for me
with with with that development is that
the being able to test them like the
emulators are absolutely ridiculous to
have to set up like ie was getting
motion and game motion actually makes
the process a lot easier than I would
say that it's ever been in the past but
being able to test your Android stuff
with all the different Android OS a--'s
and and being able to plug in a device
that you need to you know like through
your USB and running local apps and
things like that or even setting up an
emulator like for xamarin Microsoft
Record recommends this hyper-v emulator
but in order to do that you have to like
modify your bios of your system your
computer system in order for some of you
know some people like I think my PC
needs to have that done in order to to
activate it and I think when I tried to
do that for whatever reason it said that
my computer wasn't even eligible for
this hyper-v so things you know even
after what almost 10 years it seems like
a mobile phone development it's still a
major pain in the ass just to get get
started really and that's that's one of
the biggest things like as a program I
just want to be able to get started and
that's why I think unity is great now a
lot of people gave me some slack about
you know dotnet horror making some you
know statements saying that it wasn't
ready for primetime I don't know because
I did that video where it says is dotnet
good option well by all means go ahead
and use it and the day I made the video
though the next day I talked to a buddy
who actually created a dotnet core it
was a asp.net core website so it was it
you know MVC in his database he was
using Mongo so he was able to get a
Mongo database set up now as of August
though there was like a stack overflow
question that showed that post res still
didn't have a database driver in place
so there was no way that I could use
Postgres without using entity framework
seven and that and that goes back to
August of this year I made the video in
like November so really it's not like
I'm not far out of touch with it but
dotnet core is something I do want to
get involved in in 2017
I think it's relatively just you know
it's new obviously so things are
changing you know they've had some
issues trying to brand the product
they've changed the name a few times but
ultimately dotnet core it runs on Linux
Mac and you can you know set it up with
docker as well so this is the this is a
first for Microsoft another product that
they've done really well is visual
studio Kay this is turning into a
goddamn Microsoft advertisement they're
not paying me anything so I'm gonna stop
now anyway so c-sharp is a good option
because Microsoft there's still there's
there if you go that route that's you
know that's a good route to go now you
were talking about like game engines so
you talk about a fast language that's
used in software that is used in games
and you know that way I would point to
the Unreal Engine because they use C++
and you know this is a triple-a game
engine that has made games like Batman's
Arkham Asylum and things like that I
mean it's it's it's you know top-notch
games it's really really large yeah
you'd paid millions of dollars to
actually build code like this so C++ is
a is a language that I've never really
gotten into too much but that is
something that obviously is used in
software apps a lot and then the final
option I would say would be Java so like
I believe minecraft was created in Java
but I'd have to look that up but Java is
obviously a humongous
which it's really the the alternate
option to c-sharp so if you're if you're
gonna be a dotnet shop and you're gonna
go with c-sharp and if you're gonna be
more of a Linux like you know Java type
shop then then obviously you're using
Java if you're using guide wire guide
wire is very popular in the enterprise
ecosystem right now in and I and guide
wire uses something called gosu or
gossip which is gos u programming
language which runs on the Java Java
Virtual Machine so it's basically a
flavor of Java from what I've been told
but I don't do a whole lot of that
either but job is everywhere it's
actually there's probably more Java jobs
in there are c-sharp but you know that
is a great option now finally I would be
in a bad spot if I didn't mention one of
my favorite languages which really
doesn't do what you wanted to do so I
will mention it anyway though just for
any sort of newbies because Python is a
great language Python is what I read my
websites in you can make relative you
know basic games in Python but it's not
really it's not it's a dynamically
interpreted language so it's not
compiled you you don't if you're not
really going to make it you're not going
to use it to make you know hardcore game
engines or operating systems for the
most part at least not that I know of
anyway but if you need something like a
systems programmer like run scripts to
collect data make basic games like like
really really basic games and then
Python can do that Python is used in
gaming industries for tying servers
together and things like that like EVE
Online I know uses Python so and another
thing too is that there are software
teams that are using Python as well so
the Python has GUI toolkits like pi PI
side and hi cutie name is Paquita or
maybe was just QT but there's a QT port
over to Python that allows you to write
a lot of modern software type apps and
Python but my choices would be c-sharp
probably than Java than C++ and Python
comes to your specific question and I'm
curious what anybody else has to say
about that
all right guys uh thanks for watching
you have a good day take care of hey
guys so I've talked about this a lot
Deb mountain coding boot camp they are
my sponsor they're one of the reasons
why I'm able to do these videos and they
offer a 12-week intensive course that
teaches you the technologies of the here
and now they're gonna focus on a lot of
things that are actually being used and
websites things like jQuery and they're
gonna be using stacks like nodejs the
12-week intensive course is to try to
get people in the job market so that is
their entire focus we've all we've
talked a lot about on this channel
whether or not a college degree is worth
it I'm not the one to be able to answer
that question for you I absolutely think
that college degrees are great
especially in computer science I never
want to convince somebody to say that
they shouldn't do that you know
obviously schools like Stanford and MIT
I'm you know I'm an envy of all those
graduates however there is you know the
bulk of developers that don't
necessarily need to be the MIT graduates
to actually have success in the
programming world I think I speak
relatively well for for that type of
person and with coding boot camps we're
seeing them you know try to offer more
skills more modern-day skills because a
lot of times when you're going to a
computer science course and a major
university you're learning technology
that's already outdated by the time
you're learning it with Deb mountain and
coding boot camps like what Deb Mountain
offers they're focusing on really what
is hot right now so and they also focus
on a relatively you know small set of
skills in order to make sure that they
are teaching you what you need to know
in order to be productive in a in a
workplace environment so make sure you
guys do me a favor do yourself a favor
check out the link and that in the
description tab below for more on Deb
mountain coding boot camp thanks guys
