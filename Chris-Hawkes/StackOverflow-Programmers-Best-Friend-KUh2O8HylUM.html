tonight is one of those nights where I
just don't feel like doing anything I
have sat down in front of the computer
and would literally like to last like
three hours I've just been watching
music videos and reading articles about
musicians and it's funny how the web
will just spend you in all these
different directions so John's on meds I
was watching one of his videos I
mentioned him a lot I don't know why I
give him so much free press but seems
like a real cool guy but wait and we've
talked back and forth on the comments
which is pretty sweet but um he was
telling this story in one of his latest
videos when he did the story of his life
that he was in this life small town of
Idaho which was really outside of Boise
the reason why he was there as his dad
was in the Air Force so he moved all
over the country but in this small town
he happened to be at some sort of stand
when the band blink-182 had come up to
ask him where the movie theater was
because they wanted to see the movie
American Pie for which they had a small
cameo and they actually hadn't seen
their their nurse themselves in the in
the film it and this is like a major
Hollywood release so at first John
didn't even realize who they were I mean
and this band was huge in the 90s so my
and my um like my taste in music has
changed quite a bit like I can tell you
that back when kids like New Kids on the
Block and I was just a young kid in like
grade school I didn't like New Kids on
the Block I lived in a outside of DC and
Silver Spring Maryland which really is
you know it's it's you're pretty much in
the city right on the outskirts of
Washington DC and at that point you know
everybody like New Kids on the Block and
all this other stuff and I was listening
to Guns N'Roses like I for some reason
like even though none of my friends
listened to him that's the kind of music
I liked and then in that kind of
transition into actually it started with
like Bon Jovi back in like New Jersey
and my mom took me doing a concert when
I was like even younger but I guess I
was into like 80s hair metal type of
stuff which kind of gave way to you know
it's Guns and Roses which was kind of
like a cross between a hair metal and
going into the 90s and then going
through the 90s man I was on this
Nirvana kick and then eventually that
transitioned into to hip hop when I
started listening to whoo tang clan and
then that ended up trans
you know Tupac and Biggie Smalls I kind
of did that through all through high
school but I did have a respect for
blank and I've always liked blank and
now I'm this you know rock music you
know person that that really got into
programming because of rock music so
it's funny that I can spend two hours
just you know reading up on things
because once I went to blink-182 it was
like oh yeah you know Green Day I wasn't
huge fan but they were unlike the Rock
and Roll Hall of Fame on my mother and
the Hall of Fame and then you're looking
at oh yeah Prince is in the Hall of Fame
now and then it just it it goes on and
on but um one of the things I want to
talk about in this video is like
somebody mentioned it before the Stack
Overflow is a great source for
programming information and that
couldn't be more true what what is funny
is when I first started getting into
programming the Stack Overflow was
popular but as a programmer and somebody
was teaching myself and didn't really
know I didn't really think of it as like
the go-to there was still quite a bit of
like thread forum sites that you got a
lot of your information from and
nowadays you see a thread forum site and
you're like oh dammit that you know I
don't want to get my information here
but sometimes when Google's sending you
there you're like oh I got a I got a
weed through this garbage to figure out
you know where this answer might be
because good will think set the answer
lies inside of here and it's almost as
bad as like the Google Groups have you
guys ever gotten into the Google Groups
when you're trying to find documentation
just a horrible setup so Stack Overflow
they came along with the Stack Exchange
there's a dotnet site by the way they
they basically revolutionized the way
question and answering should be and
then they built this this this
accountability into the site we're like
you can't really cheat it very easily
and you know there's this entire
community that that keeps up the
environment you like for the most part
you don't see trolls that infest things
like YouTube if you go to youtube and
you you know you could it could be a
news article about some terrible tragedy
and it's just it's it really is 90%
troll just flame baiting you know this
and that just with these extreme views
like celebrating the death of cops
vice-versa I mean it's just just
terrible human beings you know people
acting like complete animals but with
with stackoverflow i mean that stuff is
completely moderated I never really see
that type of activity and it might just
be because it's a programming
environment and it just doesn't flow and
we don't really talk about world affairs
and things like that but what is
interesting to me is that when I was
first getting started I had all these
saved scripts and everything and I told
you guys a story when I lost my hard
drive that I was I was upset by all the
work that got poured into building these
scripts that I would most likely never
use or even be able to you know find out
you know because basically if you're not
just filing away the stuff in a way that
you can find it easily it's like saving
a bunch of bookmarks and you know
forgetting why you have all this stuff
saved it happens all the time and for me
though I you know a lot of it was just
the effort that got put into it it was
almost like a museum that you want to be
able to reminisce on and be like oh
there's the way things used to be done
in the Chris Hawkes world and then he
learned how to do things you know the
right way or at least he thinks he does
until you know six months down the road
and I realized that I'm doing all this
stuff wrong now but with Stack Overflow
people have kind of at least in my book
have kind of done away with this whole
ok let me store all this knowledge on a
flash drive or in some you know folder
on my desktop where I'm gonna go ahead
and resort to that stuff now for my
business perspective like if you're
working for a company and they got all
these different things that you got to
do like you know if you need this access
you got to go and request it from this
person now that's the kind of a you know
an exception that I'm talking about
where we at work you know will end up
creating these folders and stuff where
we're storing all this how-to
information because it directly applies
to our job but when it comes to you know
programming which is also our job as
programmers we don't really need to
store all that anymore we don't
need to put it in even bookmarks and
stuff like that Stack Overflow is this
humongous wealth of knowledge when it
comes to programming it's almost all you
need where you used to have Perl manuals
like the camel book that told you all
about Perl and you'd always have to find
your way back into the camel book
because of the way Perl was written
you know that then got replaced with
these these forums and stuff like so if
it's pearl like the pearl monks and
that's a terrible site by the way you
know you have all these different thread
forums and stuff and then Stack Overflow
came around and now it has everything
man it has literally everything you can
see all these tags of certain things
that I follow I don't answer as much as
I should it it really kind of sucks like
in some ways I've said that there are
some flaws with with the way this works
because if you were in the door on Stack
Overflow when it first came out like
you'll notice a lot of people that have
you know 20,000 30,000 you know score or
something like that they might only have
like you know ten accepted answers but
it might be something so common like how
do you hide or show something in jQuery
well that's going to be looked up a ton
of times it's probably uploaded a
thousand times so somebody you know if
somebody obviously just got ten thousand
points just based on that question alone
and that's not even counting you know
additional points and stuff like that
that I'm sure that I don't know I guess
they're only going to get points if they
either ask the question or if they
answer the question but still you know
that is just one particular case I've
seen questions that have literally
upvotes into the thousands and stuff so
if you were on you know something that's
that commonly looked up then you're
gonna end up getting a higher score than
other programmers that are coming along
now so I've heard in the from certain
people they're like during a programming
interview it should be asked what is
your Stack Overflow score and to me I
think that that is misleading because
like I said if you were in the door 6 or
7 years ago you're gonna have a much
higher score now obviously if you have
more time to answer people's questions
and get all involved you might have a
higher score too but then again you know
what have you been doing to be able to
answer all those questions for all these
people all the time and I say that as
somebody who spends quite a bit of their
time doing YouTube videos but still I
think you guys understand what I'm
getting at if you spend a ton of time on
Stack Overflow you're obviously gonna
have a higher score if you're getting
started just now it's gonna be much
harder for you to get up to the scores
that other people have if you're a true
expert which there are many of you know
true experts on here that you're gonna
have a high score but those are you know
really the exception and not the rule
and so I just think it's you know
it's unnecessary to ask you know
somebody else what their stack overflows
for is that's just my opinion or at
least hold too much credence with you
know what their score is so I find that
that interesting that you know in this
in this glorious day and age that we
don't have to store all this stuff and
to to favourites and to dish drives and
flash drives and portable hard disks and
things like that or cloud nowadays now
that that said I mean what happens if
like somehow Stack Overflow had like a
catastrophic you know fallout or they go
out of business or they lose all their
data I would imagine that would never
happen I'm sure that they're backed up
many times over in AWS and Azure and all
this other stuff but if that would ever
happen it'd be a majorly sad day and the
programming in the stream so yes
Stack Overflow is the number one source
for programmers to get their information
in fact I would argue it is the most
important source out there besides maybe
the technology that you're learning if
you go to that particular website itself
one of the things I didn't mention like
when somebody's like we'll see sharp
resources and and I think I did
mentioned you know Microsoft's resources
like their website but it's not very
good but if you're gonna learn something
like typescript or you're gonna learn
angular 2.0 or react or something that
you always start with the the actual
documentation from the company or
whoever produced that particular thing
and then maybe you proves to the source
you know source and then you start
writing code and you stack overflow to
help you and you can also use YouTube
tutorials and videos as well but you
know you always start with that with
that documentation but anyway it's a
it's a good day to have to be a
programmer because we have stack
overflow
and indefinitely if you're not on this
this is the you go to site for all your
questions alright guys thanks for
watching have a good night bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
