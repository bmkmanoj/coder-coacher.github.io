so in this video what we're looking at
here is we're looking at the top 10
programming languages that I've
determined for jobs in 2016 and I've
looked at a lot of different sites and I
can actually compiled a bunch of
different lists to do a analysis on each
one of these jobs and I looked at them
you know websites like indeed.com
github some of the other blogs and that
were written out there by other
companies like ink comm and a few others
like Mashable some of those they're
there research is a little bit suspect
in my list I do actually give some sort
of insight into how I feel as a
programmer and the programming industry
so I am a senior programmer for a major
corporation and just what I've seen so I
do give a little bit of my own input in
this and ultimately this boils down to
just really what my opinion is and you
know backed up by you know what I deem
to be good good evidence you know for
these these arguments but so nothing is
ever set in stone it's very difficult to
try to determine the best programming
language each language is is good at
different things so there's never any
one-size-fits-all programming language
but this particular list we're looking
at mainly jobs like what are the trends
for that particular language and then
how many jobs are there right now in
that particular for that particular
piece of technology and then we also
look at how many different types of
industries are actually using that
particular language so is it just used
for web or is it just used for gaming or
some you know those so those also get
accounted into the list so there's tons
of good languages out there and just
another disclaimer I didn't mention
sequel typically when you're doing web
development or any sort of development
that deals with a database you're
expected to know sequel
so there are sequel admins out there
that are very good at sequel my sequel
experts and DBAs and things that are out
there this list doesn't really include
DBA so
if you were like a dedicated DBA for
your team you know there's definitely
good industry and secret sequel would be
like a top-ten language for sure but
once again for most of these languages
for most daily tasks that I've run into
in a corporation you're expected to know
how to write some sequels so you may not
have to be an expert in it you have to
at least know some of it so that's why I
didn't include that include that in this
list
nor did I include HTML or CSS because if
you're doing any sort of web development
you should understand what the box model
is you should understand you know basic
CSS styling in HTML syntax so those are
not included either but they're
definitely a top 10 that you must know
if you're going to do any sort of web
development all right so that being said
let's go ahead and go down through this
list here so number 10 on the list and
this is um definitely wouldn't have been
there if I if I counted sequel because
sequel most likely would have taken
pearls position but as much as people
want to say that pearl is dead it's
still not dead it's actually still used
all throughout even in a lot of major
corporations like slash dot still using
it I believe Amazon is still using it
just a few years ago when I was just
getting into programming about five
years ago Perl was the main language of
amazon.com so I have a hard time
believing that all their code has been
updated and they've removed Perl all
together Perl is on a fast track towards
a decline just because of the amount of
market share that's being taken away by
Ruby and in Python and even before that
what PHP was taking away from Perl
because PHP is so much like Perl except
it's just for the web however Perl is
still around there's still quite a bit
of servers that are actually running on
Perl there's a ton of text scrapers and
automated batch programs and things like
that that are still written in Perl and
if you're a pro programmer you have some
hope in that Perl 6 might do some it
might cause some revitalization in the
Perl community so the Perl community is
not dead it's it's on the decline it's
still number 10 on this list and you can
even see on like the TLB index on that
Perl every time it drops out of the top
ten it comes right back the following
month it seems like so Perl is still
around that's my argument there
number nine is C++ and you could argue
that maybe this goes a little bit
further up on the list on C++ is
definitely having a resurgence lately
with I C++ 14 is one of the state of the
standards that you people point to and
say hello to you know C++ is becoming
easier to use easier to handle the
garbage collection and memory management
C++ is widely used in gaming engines if
you're going to be a game programmer
definitely C++ is a good option it
powers the Unreal Engine and just pretty
much every old sort of physics library
out there I mean there's going to have
some sort of C C++ API for for using it
so C++ is definitely a good language to
learn it's a very difficult language
especially when you compare it to some
of the more modern languages like Java
or C sharp or or even Python C++ will
definitely be a challenge for a lot of
people out there so yeah you have to be
pretty damn good to be a C++ guy and I
mean there's always going to be work for
you if you do know that but it's number
9 on the list just simply because of our
trends and and you know where we're
headed in the future our number 8 on
here is Objective C and Swift now
unfortunately for Objective C similar to
Microsoft c-sharp it's only available
really on Apple and iOS however Apple in
iOS is extremely popular Apple's one of
the most valuable companies in the world
if not the most valuable I don't I
haven't remained up to date on that in
the last few months but it does to I
would being the most valuable company in
the world so there's obviously a lot of
demand people line up and buy the latest
greatest iPhones and IMAX and all that
other crap that they sell that they can
sell without even trying so if you want
to cater yourself towards the Apple
environment Objective C and Swift is
always going to be able to have a lot of
opportunity there for you and I
mentioned both of them together because
Swift is active sees on replacement it's
very similar to it's like pythons it
actually takes a lot of influence from
Python and it's apples it's apples
effort to make an easier programming
language than the objective-c language
which can be difficult it's kind of
grouped in the C++ category as bars I've
just you know the the amount of effort
to try to learn and master that language
alright number Seven's PHP a lot of
people with a PHP was on the list
there's still a ton of PHP jobs out
there no matter what you guys want to
say there's a lot of freelance work a
lot of blogs a lot of everybody that's
that's writing a lot of e-commerce
stores are written in PHP if you look at
e-commerce there's really no web-based
alternative to something like you know
open card or magenta or any of these
other you know numerous PHP shopping
cart platforms C++ or an um sir c-sharp
doesn't have anything out there as far
as I know I mean and some of the options
that are out there they're so difficult
like with Python and you know they have
things like Django Oscar and Satchmo and
they just all fall short of what a PHP
shopping cart is so until some of these
websites become just as easy as a
wordpress plug-in there's going to be a
lot of PHP opportunity out there a lot
of PHP jobs because it's just so easy
for any newb to go out there and start
up a PHP site number 6 is Ruby and
almost primarily because of Ruby on
Rails
if you look at just rails in general
it's going to crush Python Django and it
would even give something like node
JavaScript a run for its money
as far as just the sheer amount of Ruby
developers Ruby opportunities and jobs
and startups it's still use Ruby so that
it's number six on its list um but it is
kind of one-dimensional in that it's
just for the web even though you can use
Ruby for other things it's just it's
relatively uncommon number five on the
list is Microsoft c-sharp language and
just similar to Apple if you're catering
towards a Windows environment which is
still like 80% of the OS market or more
I'm not sure what that specific number
is it's just a guess um but they
definitely dominate the operating system
marketing they have for decades that's
why Bill Gates is the richest man on the
world on earth and it's the reason why
Microsoft makes like 23 billion dollars
every year in profit
Microsoft is a huge corporation they
invented the c-sharp language it's very
similar to Java syntax when when they
first came out but since that time
c-sharp is just made a lot of excellent
improvements it's a very good language
to know and if you're going to do any
sort of Microsoft development it's a
it's a must for you to to get involved
in that number four is just regular old
C C is the Godfather of all these
languages in fact every language I've
mentioned so far is written on top of C
so if you know C you know all
programming languages and you can be a
hardcore hacker with C however you're
not going to find a lot of corporate
gigs in like the web world because a lot
of people aren't trying to write that
Rossie C is a very low level pedal to
metal type of language where you're very
close to the hardware and it if you're
trying to you know a hack like an
embedded system or something like that
you probably be pretty good going with
the language like C to do something like
that as opposed to any of these other
languages I've already mentioned which
is a much higher level meaning much less
code needs to be written to do you know
typical everyday programming tasks
however if you're ever trying to push
the envelope of what your particular
language is capable of doing C would be
a good language to learn if because it's
just it's like like I said it's every
language is written on top of it so if
you know C you can alter any language on
that it's written on top of it all right
on this list is Python a lot of people
probably wonder why Python is emerging
so so much lately I'm just recently
Python was named the number one language
introductory language being taught in
all IT schools it actually took that
from its rival their java programming
language Python can be object-oriented
but it's also it can be functional
Python is used not just for for
programming like GUI apps like in
regular desktop apps it's used for the
web there's even mobile pushes for it
so python has actually found a lot of
different domains and in the web world
it's there's numerous Python web
frameworks out there including Django
which is the biggest Python framework
and that that actually powers on
websites like Instagram Pinterest
discuss discuss the commenting form that
you see on like all the major sites out
there and at one point they were getting
like seven billion hits a month or
something like that so they were getting
a ridiculous amount of traffic on them
Django um front-end but there's a lot of
other sites like Washington Post at one
point was written in it National
Geographic and PBS a bunch of others use
Python and Django so I'm definitely not
going anywhere as far as a language to
learn it's very easy for a lot of people
to pick up so that's why it's number
three on this list if you look at its
trends it's just skyrocketing as far as
jobs and opportunity number two is Java
Java has been on a dominant player on
this list for forever for at least some
going on almost two decades now I guess
and it's definitely not going anywhere
anytime soon my job is like your typical
programming corporate gig where you know
you have programmers the nine-to-five
that are using Java to run servers and
all kinds of back-end processes it's
good for collaboration among large teams
it's all object oriented so similar to
c-sharp it's um it was actually there
owned by Oracle now but Java was
developed by Sun Microsystems in the
late 90s and they did it as a means of
being able to collaborate amongst large
development teams and they were
definitely a very successful in that
because they inspired Microsoft to build
their net framework and then c-sharp on
top of that in the early 2000 so Java
and c-sharp can control and dominate the
the corporate IT world as far as like I
said the 9:00 to 5:00 programming gigs
so if you're looking to get into a big
corporation on Java or C sharp is
definitely a good option for you number
one on this list is JavaScript and
JavaScript by far and away is becoming
the most important language to learn
you're using Python c-sharp Java Ruby
whatever sort of web development
language you're trying to use you're
going to have to be really good at
javascript javascript now with no job no
js' which is built on the v8 chromium
engine and that is actually in an engine
that has a JavaScript API but it's
actually machine level code written in C
and C++ so it's it's lightning-quick
compared to Ruby on Rails or even on
Python Django and it would blow away
both of those on technologies and speed
it's fully asynchronous has all the
synchronous nature of JavaScript built
into it javascript is also a major
player and any sort of web plug-in
whether it's like photo viewing or even
writing video games in a web browser
which is being done through WebGL which
is a OpenGL port to JavaScript for web
browsers so as we move into the future I
mean we may see we're seeing web RTC
which is on chat clients and sharing
your screen with a fellow you know
friend across the world through your
browser all that's to being done through
JavaScript now it can be done with other
technologies as well but the bottom line
is that javascript is slowly replacing
what we relied on these other languages
to do so if you know JavaScript you
definitely can get a job if you're an
expert level now JavaScript I would say
is very is more challenging than than
what initial tutorials and things might
try to teach you with it I mean it's
truly an art it takes a long time to
master a long time to get right and
there's some definite quirks about that
that make that about the language itself
that make people you know say JavaScript
a terrible language and all that but I
mean don't don't believe that hype
javascript is definitely not going
anywhere it's it's truly emerged as the
alternative to server-side technologies
it can be the server-side and
client-side technology that you need so
if you're trying to be hip and move into
the future as far as jobs I mean I would
say javascript is by far and away the
most popular and most important language
to learn all right guys so that sums up
the top 10 list that I've created once
again this is all opinion based on
do some research into it I'm a
programmer or senior programmer for a
major corporation so I have some insight
into the industry more than you know a
blogger that might work for Mashable
that's never programmed a day in his
life but you know these are all just you
know opinion based and there's plenty of
languages I haven't listed and there's
plenty of you know there's plenty of
different arguments that can be made for
each one to be in a different position
on this list but ultimately I feel like
it sums up their programming world and
where we are right now pretty well all
right guys thanks for watching please
