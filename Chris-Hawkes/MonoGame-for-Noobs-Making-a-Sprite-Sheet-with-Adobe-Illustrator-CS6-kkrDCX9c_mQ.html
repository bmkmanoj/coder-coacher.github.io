for noobs tutorial in this video this
doesn't just apply to mono game but this
is really anybody that's using
illustrator to try to help them create
animated sprites or sprite sheets and
I'm not really sure this is like a
picture perfect example of a sprite
sheet but what we have here is we're
gonna go ahead and we're gonna create a
400 pixel wide image 250 pixels tall and
what I want to do is just have it so
there's four columns each column will
have its own image that is 100 pixels
wide by 250 pixels in height and let's
go ahead and just get started with that
so if you have Ellis traitor
this tutorial mainly pertains to anybody
that just has illustrator okay so if you
don't have a tile hopefully GIMP or
something can do something similar to
this but I can't really help you so I
apologize so anyway let's go ahead and
create this image and it's going to be
400 pixels in width 250 pixels in height
and the first things first we have to
actually take a rectangle tool because
it needs to have an object in order for
this thing to work at least as far as I
am aware I want to get rid of the the
actual outline of this and then just
make sure that the actual width and
height is all appropriate here so that
does look good and let's just go ahead
and make sure we adjust us just over the
artboard so now that we have this object
you have an option up here on your
object under path to go ahead and say
split into grid and over here you can
identify how many rows you have and how
many columns and as I stated before
there's gonna be one row because my
images are really tall and and it's just
going to be four columns so you can see
it takes it and it finds the perfect
width now one of the things you're gonna
want to do is you're going to want to
add guides so that you can see where
you're placing your image so now that I
do that you have these like 4 perfectly
aligned guide markers and we can now go
to file in place and I'm assuming that
you have some sort of image or something
that you already
know how big it was in size now this
image is horrible
obviously I just I just created it I'm
just really playing around so anybody
don't try to judge me on that anyway
here's the second image so we're gonna
import four of them and really like I
said this is an awful example of how you
make well I'm drawing anyway because I
mean this guy wait till you see him move
like he looks awful but the concept is
solid so here's the fourth and final
image we place him in there god damn it
this thing's getting in the way alright
alright so now you have the four
perfectly aligned images now you have
these green markers and they will show
up so if you don't remove them they will
show up and I'll show you that right now
I'll see if you save it you're gonna
disagreeing lying about why I don't want
that so you need to go over to your
layers and inside your layers just make
sure you grab your group of these path
items here make sure that that is
highlighted and I'm just delete it so
you can get rid of it and then go ahead
and just save it as a PNG or a jpg or
whatever you want to do and that way you
have these images that you knew from the
advance how big they were and now
they're they're perfectly aligned so to
see that in action I already have this
particular image stable and pull that up
now now here's my mono game and just out
of uh as a testing thing I have a music
here that I don't want to play because I
don't have copyrights you play it on
YouTube they'll end up taking my video
down or something so let me find out
where I'm playing that
something like me yeah I started comment
that out real quick so let's go ahead
and watch this little guy now that we've
been able to do that so you see how he
moves now once again the animation of
him he's always moving and you don't
want to do that in your game and that's
just something that I was playing around
with but that is his sprite movement if
you're wondering how to do the code to
make this right it's actually here and I
have a website if you guys are
interested it's called new post comm I
have a few websites but this is one that
I've kind of geared towards my
programming tutorials and stuff and
there's this tutorial series in here and
this model game for noobs tutorial I
have a bunch of different videos and
stuff and or at least some explanations
of things will they code samples so you
can get all the code samples for
everything that I'm doing with mono game
and I hope to to make that available so
anyway if you need code samples that's
definitely the best place to go to new
post and just try to find it under
tutorials alright guys thanks for
watching you have a good day bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
