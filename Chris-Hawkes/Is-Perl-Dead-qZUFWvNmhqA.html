we're looking at is whether or not the
Perl programming language is officially
dead in 2015 the fall of Perl has been
going on for close to a decade now a lot
of new programmers may have never even
heard of Perl when I was just getting
started in programming Perl was actually
the first language I turned to because
it was still a considered a pretty good
hacker a language and a pretty good
option for the web although for me
learning it didn't it never compared to
Python but you know this particular
video is about Perl so in the early
2000s I mean it was still it was still
that one of the kings and the arena of
the worldwide web at that time the
dotnet language was coming out for C
with C sharp and so Microsoft was
releasing dotnet which was kind of an
answer Microsoft's answer to the Java
programming language which was developed
and maintained by Sun Microsystems at
the time which is since Mumbai Oracle's
but you know it was Microsoft's platform
to compete with Java and there was a lot
of you know buzz going on with those two
technologies you know being the the new
programming standard but you know during
that entire buzz period Perl still ran
the web and it was even dubbed the Swiss
Army Chainsaw of the internet or the
duct tape that held the web together
essentially a good portion of the
world's most popular languages including
I'm not languages but websites including
amazon.com was actually run by Perl
pearl had a low barrier entry into
programming compared to like C and other
languages at the time although rival
Python was around it was very inferior
to Python or to Pearl throughout the 90s
so in the 90s and in the early 2000s
Perl was you know the go-to language
which now it can really be looked at as
Python but Perl held that
that title for at least 15 years or so
pearl was founded back in the late 80s
by this guy and named Larry Bois who was
actually more of a linguist he was also
a very good computer programmer but he
wrote Perl in a way where it would be
more like the English language so he
wanted to make Perl as easy as possible
for programmers and not necessarily as
easy as possible for people learning to
to program so for a lot of developers
that were coming from a sea background
Perl just did things quicker and it was
faster to write it was it was just it
was a it was a breeze and basically it
was a joy to work with compared to some
of the more verbose languages like you
know the low-level C or having to use
our gargantuan you know language like
C++ so Perl was a very nice middle
ground between those two two languages
one of the biggest problems for the Perl
community and for the Perl language was
that in the early 2000s Larry wall the
creator of Perl had announced that they
were working on a Perl 6 which was going
to be a brand-new version of Perl and
along the way they had indicated that
Perl was Perl 6 wasn't going to be
backwards compatible with earlier
versions of Perl up until that point
Perl had prided themselves on always
maintaining their code base to make it
backwards compatible if you look at one
of the problems in the Python community
the Python 2 to 3 transition didn't go
very smoothly at all but at least Python
3 was finally released and it has been
making some good headway as of late but
with Perl we've waited for more than 15
years now for the Perl 6 version to
actually come out and in that time the
Perl 5 library is all the way up to like
I'd have to look it up but I believe
it's like 16 or 17 iteration of the
5-series or something like that so I'm
actually checking on the latest 5
version right now yeah it's 5.22 is the
latest version as of the date of this
video so Perl is obviously still being
created and developed in the pro/5 form
but while that's going on there's still
this Perl 6 competing project with a
horrible logo we went from you know
pearl being a logo that that had the
camel which was really cool and the
reason why is because the camel was on
the old O'Reilly books and he O'Reilly
always have some sort of animal on there
book covers and Pearl the learning pearl
was was a camel actually you know it may
not have been it was just a really the
pearl book by O'Reilly that had the the
camel on it but in pearls sakes we're
using this awful butterfly which is just
terrible however it's still not not
nothing released and we'll get into that
in just one moment one of the problems
with pearl is that it's considered to be
a right only language so what that means
is that programmers can write some
sloppy code on one line or maybe a few
lines and it could just be completely
illegible even to the person that wrote
the code if they were to come back in a
few weeks or a few months later code
shouldn't be written that way and many
will argue that pearls should never be
written that way but the problem was is
that a lot of really gifted programmers
they use pearl thought it would be
clever to write a lot of code bases
where they could just you know make it
into this you know crazy form and find
all kinds of creative ways to do
something that should be you know rather
mundane with pearl it prides itself on
there's more than one way to do it where
if you compare that to something like
Python Python community is more like you
know there's multiple ways of doing it
but really one right way or pythonic way
of doing something so completely
different personalities for each
language there with with Python you
typically get guidance and how something
should be done in Perl you know there is
some community guidance but there's a
lot of straying from that throughout the
1990s Perl was known as being the go-to
language for bioinformatics
and it held on to this for quite some
time and has slowly given up all of that
that hold over to Python and other
languages like our so unfortunately for
Perl it doesn't have any it doesn't have
a whole lot of use in the bioinformatics
field anymore and it didn't really just
stop with bioinformatics according to w3
techs the number of websites that use
Perl
as of 2012 had fallen below 1% and it's
sure to not be any better at this point
the TLB index also saw a Perl fall out
of the top 10 and as low as the 15th
most you know widely basically they have
a different way of accrediting languages
but it fell at one point all the way to
15 as of late I believe it broke back
into the top 10 according to the TLB
index but it keeps kind of hovering you
know in and out of the top 10 where it
used to be up towards the front it's
taken a backseat to languages like like
Python and even PHP so let's take a look
at an example here of some Python or I'm
sorry some Perl code here number one
thing you're gonna see which I
absolutely hate is this whole area right
here so this this whole use static thing
down here can't do my thing is just
terrible this use warnings and the
strict mode is because in Perl if you
you can actually use variables that are
not declared so it'll just allow that to
go through without ever giving you any
sort of warning that you're trying to
reference an undeclared variable
javascript is actually a language that
does that as well and also has a strict
mode and it's pretty terrible and in
this particular case I mean this code
here is just sending an email so it
looks like it's pretty simple and dirty
and for most cases it is but if you
notice like the arbitrary like and
lambda type expressions there that are
commonly found on like c-sharp it's just
to me it looks it looks kind of
Pino Glee and this is just a small
example of a program that actually sends
an email however because you know this
sends an email for somebody that knows
Perl I mean they can just write this
quick and dirty thing and they have a
program that knows how to send an email
so a lot of things can be done in Perl
that are that are very easy one of the
bad things Perl has though is it has
literally zero support for
object-oriented or Ian tation there's
frameworks out there that are something
like they have one that I think it's
called like moose moose or something
along those lines that is supposed to
solve some of their object orientation
wolves but it does a terrible job it's
not a new object oriented it's much
inferior to Python c-sharp Java or any
of those object or and languages now the
whole Python versus Perl debate
so we've long since had the Perot versus
Python debate and Perl used to win all
the time in that regard in 1999 Perl was
the fourth most widely used language
according the tlb index and at that
point Python was the 22nd and part of my
sloppy writing and then if you fast
forward to today Python is now the sixth
most popular language and pearls not
even in the top ten and it it kind of
flirts with the 10th position
however pearls like I said it's fallen
all the way down to the 15th
the thing with Python versus Perl is
that there used to be a big debate that
you know Perl was fast or have more
users Python is most certainly surpassed
Perl is you know being the better
language for newcomers it's the most
widely taught language and and all IT
schools throughout the world it's now
considered the number one learning
language over I took that spot over Java
and pearls not even on that map Python
at least has some object-oriented
support Perl doesn't most major api's if
you're going to be using any sort of API
for you know whether it be red box or a
Fandango or you know something like
Amazon
well Amazon probably has a Perl API but
there's basically any sort of you know
public facing API out there Google App
Engine whether they supported Python and
they still don't support Perl last I
checked so pretty much anything that is
that is out there that people want you
know to be used they have some sort of
Python implementation
whereas Perl doesn't have nearly the
same level of support anymore
if we look at indeed.com and jobs is
always an important feature when you're
trying to compare two languages you can
see that the growth numbers there I mean
they speak for themselves
Perl is pretty much falling flat
the last five years or so and wasn't
even doing that great even before that
Python has been overtaking pearl and
Jobs you know for going on over a decade
now so so a lot of people will still
argue oh there's something out of Pearl
Jam's well there's still a lot of cobalt
jobs and and you know so that doesn't
necessarily mean that just because
there's a few pearl jobs there's still
quite a bit of legacy pearl code so it's
not like Perl programmers are gonna find
themselves out of work it just may not
be the most stable thing going towards
the future so with these types of trends
it's really hard to try to push
newcomers to Perl instead of Python when
number one Python is easier to learn
it's more widely taught it's more widely
used there's more jobs there's more web
frameworks
it's got object-oriented support the
arguments between the two is just not
even fair
Python blows Perl away at this point
sorry Pro rise it's just it's the truth
Larry wall used to crap on Python and
say it was snake oil and all this other
stuff well I mean he's eating his own
words now because Python is most
certainly the better option right now
than Perl but whether or not Perl is
dead that is another and story entirely
so pearls trying to get Perl 6 released
Larry wall said that that Perl stick
should be released by the end of the
year he actually went on record to say
that relatively recently just a few
months ago which was not really big news
because they've been promising Perl 6
for a long time but according to Larry
wall they're finally going to get this
thing pushed out the unfortunate thing
is that the the logo here is going to
stay the same which is just just
terrible
so this thing should probably go but if
they want to actually get this thing to
spread it would be much better if they
just keep the camel so I don't think
pearl would be a horrible language to
learn at Perl 6 eventually comes out
they're supposed to have well actually
it's not even clear what kind of what
kind of features they're gonna have
that's gonna be any better than any
languages that are out there now but at
least you know if it releases it'll be
something so it's Perl dead kind of
that's my overall opinion it's pretty
much it's headed towards the dying path
and I'm not sure that anything can
revive it at this point anyway guys
that's it thank you bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
