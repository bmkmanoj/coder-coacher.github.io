from Rob Diaz he said hi Chris I know
 about programming I'm confused on
all this language programs
I need something easy to start to get my
feet wet Python is the way to go or
thanks Rob there's some typos in
everybody no no no problem there Rob so
a lot of you beginners have that
question okay which language do I start
with I know I've talked about
this to death like I know about that but
guess what
it gets clicked and no just it does get
clicks but seriously it is a a valid
beginner question and it's not even just
about the clicks it's literally as a
logic question it's the same questions
that I kind of pondered over for the
longest time like so I will tell you
that when I was first getting started
like I wanted to get into programming I
didn't know if CSS was a programming
language or HTML I didn't know like
so the first thing you have to do is to
get an interest in programming so for me
it was it was about web development so
it was simple for me there was a lot of
stuff going on at the time YouTube was
like a relatively new thing and then
being bought by Google they were in the
news you know the Facebook social
network movie and everything so I
understood like what a website was and
that the basic foundations of a website
were that you have some sort of server
and then you have a language that runs
on that server and you have HTML you of
CSS and you have JavaScript that all run
inside of the browser but a lot of
people don't really understand that so
that is something that you have to get
out of the way like so okay so if you
are trying to get into programming and
you're trying to pick your first
language and your goal is to do
something with web development then I
would say pythons are great a great
choice here but before you even get into
like you know server-side code or
anything like that if you truly are
brand new to this industry you have to
understand what javascript is you have
to understand what CSS is and you have
to understand you know what hTML is so
if I go ahead and all you need is a
Chrome browser you right-click on
something you say inspect and that's
going to pull up your developer console
and this is actually something that web
developers used
and day out I don't know anybody that
doesn't use Chrome for their development
for stepping through their JavaScript
and everything else these days and they
make it so much easier than it used to
be like I right-click and I look at this
this I hover over this you can see Rob
Diaz his name I'm hovered over it on the
right hand side as long as long as you
have the elements tab selected here on
the right hand side you can see all of
the CSS so I can actually click on this
and I can change it any color I want oh
look I just changed YouTube style how
did I do that okay so I'm obviously
adjusting the color what is this pound
science using this you know this
hexadecimal I'm not even sure what the
hell that is I guess the text decimal
but it's a coloring system that browsers
use do I have to know all the ins and
outs of that no I don't but I have to
know that I can actually say that and
this is a CSS and I could say color red
and you can see it's a much brighter red
Google has this ability to click a box
and give you a hexadecimal based on this
like this color rainbow thing which is
very impressive I'm sure other browsers
have caught on but Google was the first
one that I saw that was doing something
like that
you look at font weight what does font
weight you can start exploring all this
stuff so you give font weight and if I
say Boulder then you can see that it's a
much bolder font type I can give text
decoration what about underline so this
is all CSS right so I'm doing all right
so now Rob Diaz is underlined so there's
there's all kinds of different things
that you can do within the Chrome
browser to learn about HTML and CSS and
that is actually where you want to start
assuming you want to get into web
development so you want to be a program
where you want to get into web
development you start with that and
nowadays like I said it's so much easier
than it was because you can explore
around like if I were to take this this
comment here and I say inspect and I
look at this and you can see all the
styles that are effecting in everything
and a lot of the stuff may not but if I
were like display:block or something and
maybe give it a margin bottom margin
like 50 pixels now you can see it's
pushing down 50 pixels so if I hover
over you can see that that pink section
there is that
the margin so that gets into the whole
box model thing which everybody needs to
be aware of when you're a developer you
can actually see the box model here
margins like the exterior then you have
your border and padding is like the
amount of space on the interior that
could actually increase elements like
the actual space elements take up so a
lot there's a lot to learn with CSS now
luckily we have things like bootstrap we
don't have to do so much of this stuff
but you still have to understand the
basics of it as a web developer so I'm
getting too much into the web
development but obviously all this stuff
here is actual HTML which is like the
skeleton CSS is the style so if you have
makeup you apply makeup to your face you
can think of CSS like that and what is
actually delivering the data well it's a
combination of a server-side language
which could be Python like YouTube
actually still makes good use of Python
from what I understand and then there's
a lot of JavaScript these days so
JavaScript you can actually write if I
clicked on console instead of element I
can actually say hello world right into
the console and I can start running
JavaScript I can start having var X
equals 1 X plus 2 equals 3 you know say
you can start doing all kinds of
different coding within the browser so
if you want to be a web developer all
you need is Chrome it's not learning
about HTML CSS and JavaScript you master
those three you can get a job anywhere
because that's something that a lot of
people just fundamentally lack they
don't understand the ins and outs of it
then you have things that are built on
top of that that make our lives even
more interesting which is things like
react jus so those are JavaScript
libraries that make data binding and UI
and everything a lot more programming
intensive so is Python a great language
to learn from web development it
actually is Python is an absolutely
fantastic language so the the Django
framework was built with Python and that
actually is at one point Pinterest was
using it they ended up outgrowing in
kind of wrote their own but reddit.com
uses Python Instagram uses Python
YouTube uses Python so Python is great
for a server-side stack and it really
boils down in my opinion there's Django
the Django web framework which is a
really popular option and this is what
like I said I Instagram
Pinterest we're using at one point
Instagram still does I believe and then
you have flask which is a much more
smaller less of less intensive framework
however it doesn't do as much as Django
so a lot of the times when you're a
beginner you need this thing to hold
your hand and do as much as as much for
you as possible you need the largest
community that has the most questions
asked on Stack Overflow because you're
most likely going to have those same
same questions that as you go along on
this this building process here so yeah
Python is great for a first language it
really is because Python isn't just
limited to the web you can do things
with Python like basic gaming you can
build software applications that have to
be installed there's things like PI QT
or PI exe which like I said if you want
to build distributable software if you
want to do web development and Python
you can do that if you want to do like
robotics like iRobot uses Python the
Raspberry Pi has Python installed on it
by default so you want to start getting
into like like embedded systems type
type things like Python does that very
well so like with raspberry pi you can
get certain things that have Wi-Fi and
HDMI and like and even like I said I was
thinking about building my own telescope
mount with the using like Python to
download astronomical data to try to
just like automatically rotate my my
Dobsonian telescope to wherever it is
you know like it with it with a go to
because those mounts can be like three
or four thousand but I was thinking you
know if I buy some you know some basic
assembly could I build my own robot with
something like the Raspberry Pi for like
a fraction of the price and how if I did
it that good I couldn't even maybe
distributed or distributed so I can say
proper English so but that's my thoughts
man like that is uh that is there's a
lot that goes into ok I want to be a
programmer what do I start but assuming
you want to be in web development that's
where it's at man but if you want to be
in game development like I would suggest
like c-sharp over C C++ probably even
though there's still more opportunity
for c-plus plus and the current market
because there's still so much code that
gaming
engines and things use but c-sharp is I
would think a much more pleasurable
language to work with if you're gonna
get into something like gaming now if
you're in the java or android
development that you're going to want to
do java if you're going to be doing any
sort of apple systems you want to focus
on swift or objective-c but starting out
man I would probably think you probably
want to get a job in the industry and
most likely that's that's web and start
with HTML CSS and JavaScript and the web
side of things and then move on to
something else
all right guys make sure you check out
my sponsor I have two sponsors now so
they're paying the bills for me which is
nice
we have dev Mountain coding boot camp
they are at 12 and 16 week intensive
course that focuses on technology to
here now it's an on site location so
they're not teaching you online they're
out you're actually going to work with
real developers people have been in the
field I've worked with people that
actually have graduated from boot camps
and also have taught at boot camps but
they do things like they're going to be
working on git and github and so you can
deal with version control systems and
understand how all that stuff works in
addition we have site one through three
so if you're trying to build your
portfolio or get your name out there as
a developer as a blogger heck even if
you want to build a website for your
mom's friend who owns a restaurant and
you want to show their a menu or
something like that on online and maybe
even charge them a little bit of money
for it then so I want you three can help
you get something up and running quickly
if you don't want to deal with shared
hosts or dedicated servers virtual
private hosts all the work that ends up
coming along with that you can also
check them out the description tab below
has links for both of these companies if
you guys are interested in that and
