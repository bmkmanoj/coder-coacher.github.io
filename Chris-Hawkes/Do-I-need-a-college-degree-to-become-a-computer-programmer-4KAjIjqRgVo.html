want to talk to you guys about and
hopefully get user feedback because I'm
genuinely interested in myself about
whether or not it's still necessary for
a programmer to get a college degree
being a programmer to actually work as a
programmer and I'll say for starters
that I was able to become a programmer
at a major company one of the largest
insurance companies in the United States
and I was able to become a programmer
even without going to college
we're actually attending any sort of
computer science courses at all I went
to a community college to study Business
Administration and along the way I was
able to get my foot and the door of the
company on the business side of things
meaning that I wasn't hired to do
programming work initially but each
night I'm uh I guess I working dedicated
guy I would come home and I would teach
myself how to program I really enjoy
doing it my grandfather's actually a
programmer and so is my father so I'm
actually a third generation programmer
and I didn't decide that I wanted to be
a programmer until 2009 when I was 28 or
so and it was actually because of a
concert that I attended in 2009 that I
wanted to build a website that was
better than any website out there to
promote my favorite band and what's
funny at the time is that nobody had
ever really heard of the band except for
a few people I had some friends that
near the band and I mean I was the only
way I would ever have known about them
they weren't mainstream they weren't on
the radio or anything like that and I
was actually listening to all kinds of
different types of music mostly like
mainstream and stuff at the time so
anyway I just felt like after attending
this concert it was at this like dive of
a bar in Baltimore Maryland
this isn't the band but this like just
shows you kind of like the the
rough-and-tumble scene there so I'm 28
or 29 and
I've just decided I want to be a
programmer at this particular show which
was really weird and the band let me
just give a shout out is is this band
Bayside so I was like you know what
nobody's ever heard of Bayside I'm
really people have I mean they're
somewhat popular as far as like the
alternative scene but at the time they
certainly didn't have that much
recognition they weren't on a major
label or anything like that so I was
like well I'm gonna build a website that
that somehow promotes and I had this
entire idea of like using like a
medieval time frame and all this stuff
like I had all these different ideas and
I didn't know anything about programming
I didn't know anything about web design
or running a business or CSS or HTML or
JavaScript or jQuery or
you know go you can go on and on or what
server client was I didn't know anything
and this was in late 2009 so this would
be like November of 2009 and after the
show I remember I talked to the lead
singer of the band this guy named
Anthony and I was telling him about it
and I still didn't really know what I
was doing the time at that point I just
started looking into some basic HTML and
I was like hey man you know making this
band this website he was all supportive
of it and you know and that's probably
to be expected because I was one of his
fans or whatever but he was just like oh
that's cool man and all stuff and I
guess from that moment on like I felt
like there was a little bit more
pressure to be actually be able to pull
off what it is that I had been talking
about so long story short guys I started
then programming and in 2009 and trying
to do whatever I could each night after
working all day to try to learn as
quickly as I possibly could
by studying YouTube tutorials reading
books my first Python book was learning
Python I dabbled with different
languages like Perl and PHP and then I
moved to Python after Perl and I
realized that Python is just so much
better and more clear than Perl and I so
I decided I you know I want to be a
programmer but I figured out that real
quickly that nobody was going to hire me
including my you know the company I
worked for with my given skillsets or at
least that's the impression that I got
just because everywhere you look it
seems like everybody wants to
agree so there are success stories in
the IT industry and I just feel like
those success stories are getting a
little bit fewer and further between and
that's mainly why I'm creating this
video now to kind of touch base with a
lot of you guys because I know a lot of
the people that view my videos are
teaching themselves and they're in a
similar boat that I was in several years
ago where you know they want to try to
you know learn on their own maybe they
are going to school but I feel like a
lot of them probably aren't and that
that you know they're doing it as a
hobby and as a way to change their life
and maybe one day become a programmer
for a company where you can actually
draw a paycheck instead of being an
entrepreneur so that's mainly why I
would like to get you guys feedback just
to kind of get engaged the area where
you live whether whether you're in
another country or if you're in the
United States my experiences are from
the United States and I'm in Virginia
outside of Washington DC so Washington
DC is kind of the market that I'm in and
I got to tell you I mean like I said
with the current job market the way it
is I mean it looks very lucrative to be
a Python developer in Washington DC so
I'll go ahead and just show you guys
according to indeed.com which is the
number one job site right now
I mean they're saying the average Python
developer in DC is earning one hundred
and thirty thousand dollars a year and
even a junior and DC is making 78 so
cost of living in DC is pretty high and
our traffic is actually one of the worse
than the entire country in fact I just
heard a survey this morning that said
that according to some new survey by
some company or I don't know the
specifics but I mean how DC is the
number one most gridlock tri-city as far
as traffic so I can tell you that living
outside of DC I mean it is a nightmare
to commute to to DC at least from
Virginia pretty much everywhere around
the entire DC Beltway is just a
nightmare to deal with on a day to day
basis and even on the weekends now
there's just so much traffic around here
but it's not as ridiculous as New York
City or San Francisco so a lot of people
still do the crazy commute where they're
spending literally four hours a day you
know driving back and forth to work
trying to get to these
sometimes it's even worse than that but
you can see that you know the prices are
just skyrocketing for for Python now
it's not just Python that it's paying
that much like if we look at c-sharp I'm
actually a c-sharp developer why I work
but I'm not in DC but you can see that
you know according to that's 116 now one
of the reasons why I feel like Python
probably gets paid a little bit more is
Python is probably you know there's
there's fewer Python programmers and
there are c-sharp developers a lot of
overseas schools and things are
concentrating on Java and c-sharp to
kind of get there they're graduates into
the if they you know do come to the
United States you know that they would
try to get them into like a Java or C
sharp market I'm also thinking and this
isn't you know based on any fact or
anything just my personal opinion that
with Python a lot of data scientists use
Python so a lot of those guys that you
know they might have a doctor like a PhD
and some sort of you know bioinformatics
or something to deal with biology or
something like along those lines and
they're not really you know full-time
programmers I should say you know
they're not like you know writing GUI
apps and Python or something like that
they're using it more for numbers
crunching and stuff like that so that
may be some of the case another thing
with with DC from personal experience
that I raised as far as a degree is
concerned it seems like almost every job
I look at in the Washington DC area
they mentioned some ridiculous amount of
experience required or a degree like
pretty much every single one of them
like we could go through a list here and
pretty much every one of us a Python
programmer DC see one of the things
about DC is we have a lot of government
contractors like this BAE Company you
know a lot of these a lot of these these
companies are very hard to get into just
because they are government contractors
like here's an example of Booz Allen
Hamilton which is a huge government IT
consultant company and you see it's a
data scientist job so most likely you're
gonna be doing number crunch
using Python but basic qualifications
Bachelor of Arts Bachelor of Science
degree and this is actually somewhat
lenient a lot of times they say that
it's you know an absolute requirement so
at least a Bachelor of Arts there to
even get considered and a company like
that I mean you're not even gonna get
through the you're not even gonna get a
human to look at your your resume if you
send that in and you don't have a degree
they don't they don't care if you
invented Facebook I mean you're not even
and get through the initial processing
because you don't have that checkbox to
check off and unfortunately at least
with the DC market and with so many
different government type jobs a lot of
and it might have something to do with
like the guy that leaked all that data
to that didn't have a degree and ended
up going over to Russia but they're
pretty much all saying that you have to
have some sort of degree like here is
bachelor's degree in physical science
data science computer science and two
years of experience for this particular
job and once again you guys can look for
yourself
and I'm curious where you guys are and
whether or not that's different in
different markets but I can I can assure
you that you know DC it seems like it's
almost a necessity that you have to have
some sort of pro at least a four-year
degree and preferably in computer
science but at least something along the
lines of finances or or mathematics to
even be considered for some of these
jobs so that's that's one of the number
one problems with whether or not you
need a degree number two is the cost of
actually getting a degree in degree
since I'm in Virginia I looked at like
the cost of attendance for something
like a school that's not considered like
a you know super awesome computer
science school which would be Virginia
Tech but it is a good school and they do
have computer science degrees it's just
not you know it doesn't compare to
Stanford or something like that but you
can see they're just in-state tuition so
for a four-year computer science degree
at Virginia Tech by the time you have
even you know imagine food and
everything on top of this I mean you're
looking at at least $100,000
a college fund or college bill as soon
as you leave you know to try to compete
with all those you know those jobs that
like I just showed you so at least
she'll be considered because you did
spend that hundred thousand dollars and
you do have that degree under your belt
but that's really expensive and and
that's not even like I said a top IT
school so if we looked at it at a top IT
school you know something like Stanford
Stanford is way higher so if you were a
hotshot that's going to Stanford like to
Google guys you're looking at about
sixty five thousand dollars a year and
these are probably minimum amounts it
goes up from there so so you have to ask
yourself you know how badly do you want
to be a programmer a lot of what I hear
nowadays and probably would be my advice
I mean even for myself I mean this is
what I did but I mean a lot of people
are doing the two-year transfer you go
to Community College for two years I
mean you're only spending now you
probably get financial aid assistance
and maybe even grants depending on your
situation if you're in the United States
and I mean you're gonna pay a fraction
the amount of college expenses as a
four-year degree and then you can get a
guaranteed transfer and do like a state
school so like even the community
colleges I attend have guaranteed
transfers in the you know top schools
like University of Virginia even
Virginia Virginia Tech William and Mary
a lot of you know really good good
schools George Mason and there's a big
list so you really want to look in make
sure whatever sort of community college
you're going to go to have some sort of
guaranteed admission program and make
sure you also meet the criteria for that
admission because it's not just
guaranteed a you get a two-year degree
you can transfer and sometimes there's a
caveat it's like you have to have a
certain grade point average or something
along those lines so what I find really
interesting is that I really think it
boils down to the fact that I kind of
got lucky I mean I got my foot in the
door as a programmer and it's been that
way for for many years now so
I feel like I'm pretty well entrenched
Nate especially with a two-year degree
and a lot of computer programming
experience and even having my own
company and having websites and things
that I run and I have you know it's a
like a working portfolio I don't think a
lot of those companies would even give
me a second look because of the fact
that I don't have a four-year degree but
I do think that you know I would still
be able to find something given my
scenario and my work experience but I
don't know how easy it is gonna be for
like aspiring viewers that might be
teaching themselves how to program in
Python I think your best bet might be if
you really don't want to go to college
and you're not going to be able to work
your way into like a business side of
things like I did where you get into the
company and then say you know you guys
got an IT department let me try to get
in that short of something like that I
mean you guys really have to probably
start your own company start your own
website build your own open-source
project I've actually done a lot of
those things as well just because when I
was trying to get in the door I went
ahead and I I created something called
um and it's not really used by a whole
lot of people but I created an
open-source project called Jango easy
avatar and I remember I was really
excited because according to pi PI like
when I released it you know I had like
20,000 downloads I'm not sure how
accurate their their download counter is
that I've heard that it's not exactly
accurate but you can see I went ahead
and I I created this thing I released it
on github I'm the creator not a whole
lot of people use it I actually still
use it for a couple of my site so uses
html5 file upload and to be honestly I
wrote this years ago it's probably some
real sloppy stuff in there and I never
really got a chance to go back in there
you can see I wrote it two years ago so
it was like my first stab at a Python
extension so it's it's a complicated
thing I remember I you know learn this
and that trying to get my packages built
and everything but I mean this is the
kind of stuff that you have to do to at
least show that you're interested like I
did a commit on the Django web framework
you know even though it was a very minor
commit it's
they'll showed my name as a contributor
to Django and you know that caught their
attention
I do these YouTube videos trying to
teach other people what I've learned and
try to give back to the Python community
I created that's a gross picture I
created this website here on new movies
calm and even though this move this
website you know probably gets a couple
hundred people a day or so used to get a
lot more than that at one point but you
know this website doesn't really make
it's not financially lucrative or
anything I actually did it because I
wanted to teach myself how to build a
responsive website to show to my
employer to be like hey look you know I
built a website and it's responsive and
you know we it was like a new thing at
the time everybody was talking about
responsive buzzword and all that stuff
and man this thing is going slow that's
not good
it's probably cuz I'm screen sharing
here is but anyway so yeah I built this
website so at least you could be like
and this thing needs a ton of work by
the way but at least I could be like a
little guy I built this and you know I I
maintain it you know I have to set up my
own servers for and all that stuff so
there's always that route and I think
it's still going to be difficult to try
to get somebody to give you a second
look but I mean it's worth a shot so
anyway guys please leave comments let me
know what you thought I kind of rambled
on in this video but I've been trying to
figure out how to present to you guys
you know my situation as far as how I
got in and then trying to get feedback
from you guys is to you know what type
of situation are you guys currently in
right now do you already have a degree I
mean are you just watching these videos
because you know you're learning
something new or you like my voice I
mean what it what is it cuz um I'm just
curious like just trying to share and
maybe kind of see if we can help each
other try to figure out our goals in
life and what we're trying to go alright
guys thanks for watching please
subscribe and thank you to all my
subscribers out there too I really
couldn't be happier with the fact that
you know people are actually subscribing
to my channel I still can't believe that
to this day anyway guys thank you have a
good day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
