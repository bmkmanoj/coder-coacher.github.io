just pondering the thought of whether or
not intelligence is hereditary and I've
actually been seeing this pop up on a
lot of comments and things like that
that show up in programmer discussions
where it's like you know people a lot of
people are saying oh well science has
proven that you know smart people or
you're just naturally gifted to be smart
you're naturally gifted to be a
programmer and you know there's certain
people that aren't you know gifted and
aren't gonna be capable of being
programmers and things like that and
I've said many times before that I think
that's the the programming
languages of today allow you know you
can get by without even having to do
complex math and things like that you
can build websites you can make a
million dollars how you can make a
billion dollars and it doesn't take an
extreme amount of Education it doesn't
even take an extreme amount of
intelligence at times I mean sometimes
it's just simply dumb luck
and sometimes it's just about who you
know you know obviously being in the
right place at the right time and you
know it's obviously has to go with luck
as well but you know I just think it's
it's um it's not true number one I think
the science is flawed there because we
do understand that we share the same DNA
sequences for the most part between
humans I think there's like literally
three billion different DNA types that
we have or something and and somewhere
around 15 million are unique to
individuals so you know that 15 million
supposedly is enough to make it so that
like they're trying to equate some of
these studies that I've actually seen
like this one here that like roughly 40%
of all of your natural gifted ability of
intelligence comes from your parents and
it's directly passed down to you and a
lot of this is done based on you know
polling of like children they're like
you know I think that one study had
18,000 participants and they were all
children and they they looked at their
parents and they all you know did the
tests and things like that and and based
on correlations you know their tests
that they had with their parents they
were able to distinguish that the ones
that have someone her parents also had
smarter children and then they
determined it to be you know largely
genetic base so you know there may be
some truth to that but I think in a lot
of cases it boils down to your
surroundings so that other sixty percent
comes from
you know supposedly other things but I
would think even that 40% has a lot to
do with it as well because if you if
you're growing up in a shithole and your
parents are like crack addicts and and
they treat you like or maybe they
don't even try the best they can for you
but you know they're there cards that
they've been dealt
they're in such a bad situation that
they're not able to provide you know the
natural surroundings that a child needs
in order to be able to to nurture all
that intelligence and are in order to
you know build up their brains and
things like that you know I find I find
I wonder how much of that like we'll
never know yeah there's really no way to
know you know why like you know poor
areas and things like that typically do
worse on test scores and stuff like that
it's probably because they live in a
poor area right I mean I would think
that that some of that plays into it now
one of the things with me is like I've
never I've never I've never claimed to
be the smartest guy in the room and I've
had people telling me that I'm not good
enough mine in my entire life you know
so II I've never been past a free hand
or anything like that I've struggled
with a lot of different things that I've
learned and and my with my struggles
like I can see my growth and I may not
have like raw natural ability in order
to be able to you know maybe see
patterns and things like you know
something like Einstein could see or
understand you know complex math like
you know somebody like like an Einstein
or Stephen Hawking or something like
that but the good news is is that that
the actual the the success that we can
have in life isn't always dependent upon
your your raw intelligence one of the
interesting I was watching a John Thomas
video the other day and it kind of this
this kind of reminds me of that because
I feel like perseverance can actually
make up for the fact that somebody might
actually they might have they might lack
a little bit of intelligence in a
particular area or all natural ability
to to process a lot of complicated math
maybe they did too much LSD in their
time or they smoke too much weed who
knows like there's all kinds of things
that you know that people may have done
that could have damaged their bodies
along the way and puts them in a maybe a
worse frame of mind or something or
to keep up but there is one thing that
you can always do even if you do lack
and in that field and that's just you
know raw perseverance of trying your
hardest not giving up and giving it a
hundred and twenty percent where
somebody else might not be able you know
might not be able to do it or may not be
as committed to it and I feel like
either you can make up for gaps in that
way so in this video John is talking
about his actual schedule like he busts
his ass every single day because ok let
me tell you about what I do during the
day ok so I get up I do myself I write a
thousand words a day or more ok and then
I fast until five o'clock so he goes on
and it explains like the fact that this
dude is like pawns and waits like he's
he's reading he's writing he's he's
working out if he's trying to focus on a
particular area like he's he completely
bust his ass when he was talking about
his Pluralsight courses he was working a
full-time job and it's like 80 different
Pluralsight courses or maybe it was 18
modules all together but it was just
like and that was with a full-time job
with a family and all that stuff and in
that is a lot of dedication that you're
not going to find from just everybody it
doesn't just I I meet people all the
time and they don't have the same level
of enthusiasm or go go get it attitude
and like for me I feel like that makes
up for any sort of lack of intelligence
that I might have in a particular area
so you know these didn't
tell me that I'm not good enough but I'm
gonna come and give it 110 percent and
I'm gonna eventually catch up and I'm
gonna be right on their heels
when when they least expect it so that's
kind of my mentality I also used that to
have a chip on my shoulder like when I
went for that Android interview and they
didn't even look at the app like
that was a slap in the face it was
embarrassing at the moment you know I
had to go back and tell my wife I didn't
get the job I didn't really go into the
details of what happened but it was a
complete embarrassment but what
did I do i rebounded and I gave it 110
more percent on top of what I was
already doing and said you know what I'm
not gonna let these tell
me what I can and can't do and you know
since that time I was able to basically
kick my way into the door I'm able to
compete with
senior programmers I may not get up and
be able to solve the most complex
abstract math problems or even some of
them may be more less complex ones but
 I am going to build a
website I'll build a database I'll
manage the entire stack and I'll be on
your heels eventually if I'm trying to
compete with you whatever with whatever
I'm trying to do I mean that's my
mentality as well like I think it takes
that to try to compete with some of
these assholes that try to say that
you're not good enough because maybe
they weren't born with a silver spoon in
their mouth maybe they were fed three
three meals a day and looked after and
went to bed at a proper time and
actually had to do their homework and
stuff like that other kids didn't they
weren't raised like that they came from
the school to hard knocks they they may
have went to dinner or went to bed
making their own dinner at like eight
years old or watching themselves when
they're six and seven I mean and it gets
much worse than that but that's the
reality to a lot of people out there and
if they're doing research on those types
of kids then it's when
you say that they're genetically
inferior to some other kids that may
have had a better surrounding it's just
 in my opinion and in science
you know it I respect science and a
great deal but you know there are things
that we don't know there are things that
science tells us is fact in that war
that you know this is you know the most
plausible theory and all this and
then eventually we do a full full 360
and we're back at like square one and
we're like wow you know we were
completely wrong on that but I mean I I
feel like you know this is one of those
things and and and it's it's a bad thing
to spread this kind of information like
hey maybe you're not good enough to be a
programmer so you might as well just
quit you know that's you know if you let
that voice get inside your head
you're never gonna succeed and and it's
just I think it's a bad precedent to set
just set right now and I'm not just
reading about it here and there I'm
hearing about this on hacker news
on YouTube people are leaving comments
on my videos like it's in Scientific
American you know people are trying to
tell me that I have some sort of raw
capabilities and I was I was doing
some of the nastiest work crawling
around army crawling and and crawl
spaces with rats
 you know what I mean if I was so
goddamn smart I don't think I'd be down
there doing that kind of work for $12 an
hour like I mean I don't know like I
mean I worked my ass off to be able to
get to where I'm at and I think that
ultimately I'm just getting started so
if I'm curious to see where I'm at five
years from now or ten years from now I
don't feel like anything's gonna fade I
have different interests and things like
that but when I find something
interesting I pursue it and I think that
a lot of people need to do that a lot of
people are asking me what is the bare
minimum in order to learn Python do I do
it four hours a day or something like
that you should be asking yourself you
should be like you should be setting
some sort of goal for yourself now I
mean number one you shouldn't even care
how long it can take you you need to
just because then you're going to be
comparing yourself against other people
who once again you know according to
science they might have more genetic and
disposition to be more intelligent than
you there or you know in my theory you
know they could have come from a better
background with with you know parents
that maybe took better care of them and
things like that there's all kinds of
things that that play into that but when
you start comparing yourself to these
other people I don't really think it
gets you anywhere I think that you need
to focus more on what do I need to do to
make progress do I feel like I'm making
progress am i doing the bare minimum and
 you know what I mean that you need
that you need to do as much as you
possibly can and that's right that's
really the only way because this is this
is an industry that's filled with smart
kids you're gonna you're gonna be with a
lot of smart people that are just
naturally gifted there's gonna be a lot
of the kids that that were born with a
silver spoon in their mouth and they
went to the fine universities and they
were paid for their by their parents and
things like that I mean they're smart
those kids are smart too they've gone
through all the courses and they
understand probably more college based
mathematics than you're gonna understand
and and don't even be able to grasp
things quicker than you in many cases
because I feel like there's a certain
amount of intelligence that you gain
just by trying to figure out like I
am a much better researcher now than
I've ever been I'm much better at
writing legal documentation than I've
ever been it's not like I'm gifted
towards like just writing like you know
like one example is that if if I need to
pursue
something legally or start trying to
like start pumping out legal mumbo-jumbo
like I can do that relatively well and
that wasn't something that I'm just
naturally gifted to do it's something I
learned how to do and to be honest it's
something that has now benefited me
quite a bit because when people and
companies pissed me off I if I need to
take any sort of like legal action or
start to you know threaten legal action
and things like that and that that type
of stuff has worked out for me many
times in the past and it's not just
naturally gifted it's learned so anyway
guys that's all I got tonight man let me
know what you think and take care guys
