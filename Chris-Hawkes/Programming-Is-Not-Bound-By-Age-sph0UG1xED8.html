just wanted to share a comment that was
posted on one of my videos that I
thought was great this is about a guy
named Bob Ross I don't know that's his
real name or not but that's his his
google name and he posted a comment on
my older programmers video where I
talked about the fact that I know I
personally know and have worked with
older programmers that are you know
still have a brilliant mind
my father's in his 50s and he's you know
a really good programmer a lot better
than most maybe not most people a lot of
programmers I've worked with and and he
doesn't different things so I can't even
really speak to some of the things that
you know that he does better than me but
um you know when it comes to like Java
Script and some of the latest standards
and even UI like I'm like God dad you're
doing it all wrong
but you know that's sad like he's still
he's you know he's got a lot of
experience in C++ and C thing you know
that experience that I don't have and
he's phenomenal with Perl so one of the
interesting things that he was saying is
that I'm 72 years old started
experimenting with microprocessors in
the mid 70s after 15 years as an
electronics technician I tried to stay
away from business programming he said
not a bean counter
but concentrated on control measurement
real-time programming my first
meaningful programming done an assembly
for Motorola 6800 6900 family a system
aimed at control for the petrol drilling
industry which is petroleum and having
the close to the hardware programming
experience has opened many doors for me
my skills are still in demand when
hardware drivers are needed or a
real-world measurement application he
said God delivered me from Cobalt but
C++ is fabulous I still prefer fourth I
don't even know what fourth is so you
know Bob's experiment experiment
experience goes back to the 70s you know
that that's just that's amazing to see
what you know what he's been doing all
this time so you know during that time
Dennis Ritchie was still coming up with
the CFC language I mean there were all
kinds of different languages at that
time that the people were using
obviously COBOL was around and and COBOL
is still around there there's still a
huge demand
and those programmers are making a lot
of money because their mainframe
programmers there's not as many of them
around as there used to be so the thing
is is that there's a lot of government
shops there's a lot of older businesses
that have been around since you know
anything pre 80s and they're still
running mainframe systems I mean look at
the amount of revenue that IBM is
pulling in IBM's main revenue model
comes from mainframe systems so you know
branded their revenue has been declining
because yes there's some of their
customers are leaving mainframes and
going to the cloud and things like that
but you know the simple fact that
they're pulling in as much as much
revenue as they are that means a lot of
customers are still running mainframe
systems and they need to have assembly
programmers they need to have COBOL
programmers and even fortunate I would
imagine I guess that might be what
fourth is you might be talking about
Fortran I don't know that might be I
really don't notice AI haven't been
around that long I started programming
at 28 so for me my older days are jQuery
I'm just kidding well actually I'm not
it's probably like my oldest days jQuery
was like something new when I was first
getting started so so then you know
people were asking him you know what if
he was he said they said you still work
full time would you say keeping up with
changing changes in technology has been
an issue for you
at what age do you think it's too late
to begin a career in programming so they
ass straight from the horse's mouth they
ask Bob that and Bob responded by saying
thank you it helps if you are naturally
curious and stimulated by learning new
twists and turns if turning on the light
bulb over your head fascinates you then
you have a great a future ahead take
care of your health and investigate new
things
bon voyage so it's almost like the fun
fun function I shouldn't promote his
channel since he's kind of my
competition but he's great he always
says stay curious and he's absolutely
right about that because one of the
things that I've always had even before
I became a programmer is I've always had
like a pretty insane curiosity when it
comes to a lot of different things when
I hear a musician that I like I I
instantly want to know where did they
come from you know what type of culture
influence you know their their ability
to make this type of music but even
things like like you know look
companies like industry companies where
it's like Raytheon we're all do research
on on Raytheon and not because I was
going to potentially work for them but
because I was just curious about their
company and I found that they bought
Hughes Aircraft and you know it's like
how did Howard Hughes you know his
aircraft
he was aircraft he existed into the 80s
I believe when Raytheon bought it but
the thing is is like I I'm insanely
curious about all kinds of things a lot
of history things and and you know and
just it's not just engineering
curiosities with me but there's
definitely a lot of curiosity that I
have in the engineering and tech field
but also just I think everywhere and I
think that helps so I mean clearly it's
helped with Bob that he said that he's
naturally just you know he has a
curiosity like how does probably
alternating-current work and you know
how does the light bulb actually turn on
how does the phones work how do we keep
switchboards and mainframe systems like
he obviously knows a lot more about
assembly level and in computer systems
that all we know is higher-level
object-oriented stuff now
maybe object-oriented comes a little bit
more natural to us than it does maybe
you know maybe boss but to Bob but I
call him boss is fine herbs but you just
never know I mean I would imagine with
his experience that it's it's invaluable
for what he does and and I would imagine
I think it's great that that he's they
used it and continue doing this now on
the flip side I'm 35 I feel like I'm not
old I feel like I'm going to be
programming for a long time I get told
that I'm I look like I'm more like 25 so
that's cool I know that's not gonna last
forever but I'll take that while I have
it I had somebody actually tell me that
today at work but the the thing is it's
like I don't want to exclude and talk
about you know have this channel about
like older people you know I have a lot
of young programmers that watch me in
fact some of the people that seem to
look up to me the most or the younger
ones and I and that's great so the thing
is that I guess I want to try to hammer
home and you know maybe see what I can
do to change the world for the better in
the sense that I don't know that that
we're limited by our age
or that were limited by our gender or
anything like that or even our genetics
like if you have a curiosity that leads
you you know that leads you down a path
of tinkering and playing and
understanding you're you're gonna you're
gonna be well off I mean I think that
you are I don't know that I have some
sort of natural gift for for math and
complex calculations a lot of the math
that I do in my head I'm not fumbling
around with sheer numbers and I'm M
Erised a multiplication chart just like
most likely everybody else did I mean in
some cases I'm sure people are really do
they're doing all this memory processing
but for me I could say you know what 12
times 12 144 I memorized it there's no
calculation there that's that's just
based off of memory 8 times 8 is 64 so
we do that and I'll I'll say 8 times 8
is 64 okay okay so then 12 times 2 is 24
64 play you know nice then there's a
little bit of addition and subtraction
there but you know as far as math and my
head is concerned that's about as far as
I go and and I don't I don't have this
like I don't think natural ability to
just see patterns that some people just
can see and and things like that but it
doesn't prevent me from being a
successful programmer or a successful
businessperson or even to have enough of
a drive to to learn something and to
repetition and be able to understand it
and you know it's just I think a lot of
these labels that are put on us by
society and and if we accept those
labels before we even try
then we're just I think we're selling
ourselves short and probably not doing
humanity its due diligence really
because I was on my way home today and I
was listening to this this conservative
talk show host I don't even normally
listen to you because I came home in an
earlier time today that I normally do
and and this dude just happened to be on
the radio but he was saying that when he
was younger he wanted to be a
psychiatrist and and he came from an
uneducated family and he was actually
you know getting ready to go into
college you want to figure out what he
wanted to do and he couldn't really have
intellectual conversations with his
family because they just they didn't
have the same education level and
everything
and even for me like there's like people
that I don't really communicate with
from a programming perspective because
they just don't understand me they don't
understand what we're talking about and
and he just don't get anywhere but he
was talking to a doctor and the DA and
the doctor was like apparently a younger
male and you know it you know looked
like to be good you know in good shape
and everything and and it seemed too
educated and obviously it was because
it's a doctor but he asked some he said
you know I'm thinking about you know
being in being a psychiatrist when I
grow up and I just want your thoughts on
that and the guy said really you want to
spend your entire adult life listening
to other people's problems and and they
said and you know it was that
conversation that said you know I'm not
gonna be a psychiatrist so he ended up
being a doctor apparently but he never
went to school for psychiatry now what
if he would have found some sort of
passion in psychiatry on his own I had
you know some doctor not given all
psychiatrists a label of yeah you're
just listening to people's problems all
day long to me isn't that more of a
psychologist and not a psychiatrist but
I have a stepfather who his father went
to the University of Chicago and is a
PhD and in psychology so not psychology
psychiatry actually I did I believe it
yeah it might be sick I don't
remember all I know is he has a PhD from
University of Chicago and he actually
worked at NIH as a director in NIH
National Institute of Health in
Washington DC area for a long time and
has been retired for at least two
decades now but you know extremely smart
guy but you know had somebody had told
him not to do that then then you know
who knows I mean maybe he never he never
takes that that position so if we're all
told that we're too old to be a
programmer or you know the programming
industry is dominated by males or are
dominated by people from India I've
heard that that that same thing as well
they're like all Indians are IT workers
and it's like you know these people come
up with these labels and things and in a
society is just is lazy like that I mean
we talk about it all the time like
there's no due diligence when it comes
to reporting people shouldn't make
assumptions and we should try to be
curious
and make decisions for ourselves seek
advice where we can but you know
obviously your own experimentation is
going to be the most the most helpful
feature one of the things that is tough
for me is like when people ask me to
list my you know three top top favorite
languages I'm going to give my
perspective but you probably just don't
want to listen to my perspective you may
find help in my perspective to make a
decision but I wouldn't want to give
anybody any sort of life-or-death type
of such type of advice or anything like
that but you know we have to learn from
people around us learn from the mistakes
of others so that we can hope for
hopefully not make those mistakes
ourselves but most importantly we learn
from our own mistakes and we learn how
to be you know humbled I guess by those
mistakes and those are typically where
we learned the most and if we're just
taking people's advice without actually
experimenting and trying then we're not
really being you know researchers and
engineers I don't think so
that's just my thoughts on this I think
it's great to Bob commented here and not
to exclude the young people at all
because like I said it doesn't matter if
you're if you're eight years old or if
you're you know 70 like bob is I mean
you know start programming there's
there's huge opportunities in it alright
guys thanks for watching make sure you
subscribe make sure you vote up and take
care bye hey guys so a lot of you asked
me how do I get my foot in the door to
become a programmer and I just wanna
take a moment to mention dev Mountain
coding boot camp is a 12-week intensive
course that focuses on the technologies
of the here-and-now for web development
some of the things that they're actually
teaching in this 12-week course it's
geared to get you into the industry by
focusing on things like jQuery nodejs
react angular how to use github so a lot
of the things that you're going to need
to do as a developer as soon as you
start they're going to be teaching you
in this and this coding bootcamp and the
entire goal is to be able to get you
into the industry within 12 weeks so if
you guys are interested in learning more
