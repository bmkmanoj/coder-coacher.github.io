going to be looking at a site called
site 1 2 3 and this is a website that
has really catered towards like really
people that want to get a website up and
running as fast as possible really any
business owner that is trying to have a
modern professional portfolio type of
website this is like the perfect product
a lot of people will tell you like to
use WordPress and things like that so
you know that's something that you know
that people have the ability to do but
some of that stuff carries you know a
decent amount of complexity having to
set up your own server having to deal
with a domain purchasing domain like DNS
forwarding you have to set up databases
you have to maintain your database to
make sure that there's no sequel
injections and things like that so there
is a ton of complexity that is involved
with just even the simplest of websites
so for people that don't want to have
that type of complexity in their lives
like people that really aren't trying to
do all that from scratch there's a lot
of people out there so side 1 2 3 is
really cater towards getting people and
you know getting them a website as
quickly as possible alright so I was
actually messing around with this
website earlier where I was creating a
hipster code website and I'm just trying
to see what I could do here but I want
to just give you you can see I was kind
of joking around where I said I get
asked on good but it's kind of what site
1 2 3 is all about it's about getting
stuff done as quickly as possible you
can see like if you wanted to have like
a modern bootstrap theme you know they
have all that stuff out of the box now
you're probably like well you know what
if this theme isn't right for me they
have all kinds of different themes that
you can actually choose from this is
just like the one portfolio theme that I
ended up you know doing just initially
so what I'm gonna do right now is I'm
gonna actually edit the site so I'm
gonna go back in here alright so on the
home page you can see that you can have
different images and stuff like that
that you can have for the slider you
could even turn that slider off if
that's not something that you're
interested in so before I even go into
editing what I was at playing around
with earlier I just want to show you the
actual create a new website
process you can see there's a big button
here it just says create a new website
and this is what I was talking about
where you have all kinds of different
options a lot of templates are like one
size fits all so you don't have like a
music it doesn't really change changed
like too much between a photography or a
restaurant like so if Europe is a
restaurant owner you could I'll just do
that
all right so now it generates this
starter website we could take the tour
I'm not gonna take the tour right now
but here you can see that this is much
more cater towards an actual restaurant
where you have your menu online so for
anybody that has like a small pizza shop
or something like that then it's it's
much easier just to use a website
builder like site 1 2 3 to go ahead and
just get that taken care of for you you
can have your contact and set your your
point of contact down here let me clear
these messages if you need help they're
also there to help you in fact it's
quite quite ridiculous the amount of pop
ups they'll prompt you with but all you
gotta do is just shut it down all right
so here's another template that I just
brought up which is the e-commerce
platform so if you wanted to sell stuff
like if you're a basic artist or just
selling stuff like an Etsy type shop and
you can have a working shopping cart so
one of the great things about a site
like this the site 1 2 3 is that like I
said before if you're if you're a pizza
shop guy or you're like a plumber or
something like that then a lot of people
don't want to deal with the hassle of
having to learn how to code even if it's
HTML and CSS or basic JavaScript that's
only like half of actually running a
website I've had my websites go down
because I've done database migrations
all incorrectly breaking everything so
having some people manage that stuff for
you if you really don't feel like that
that is your area of expertise is like
really it makes it a huge benefit to
people that aren't programmers but even
if you're a programmer like myself they
are they gave me a an offer on this so
I'm going to actually set up my new
media website for it I believe and
that's something I'm gonna be working on
here but as another side note here you
can see that this website is actually
created using the same template
and this has their cart and everything
and in place all right so that's pretty
cool all right so here I'm going to go
back and I'm gonna actually edit the the
images here these are all images that I
paid for legit I didn't steal it or
download or anything I totally paid for
these I pay from paid for them from I
stock photography I think of us so you
can see here if I'm building like a
company page like I own a domain that's
called New Media LLC at least I think I
mean I have never done anything with
that body years ago and I don't think
I've ever done anything with it but it's
it's the parent company to everything I
do online so like I don't know I don't
really talk about very often but that's
all honestly like any sort of business
deal is any bank account any like all
that stuff is done through the business
and not like my personal personal stuff
here so the interesting thing is like I
wanted to build a website and I just
never did
so I guess here's my first time I'm
gonna do it now you can see clearly that
comic whatever it is is not a very set a
very professional looking thing I'm
looking for more like a probably like a
cursive for then again like I don't
really have any business cards or
anything so it's kind of difficult to
say that looks kind of cool but it's
hard to read so one of the things
whenever you're dealing with that's kind
of cool to see but I'm a terrible judge
of font and and things like that like I
am I'm just I'm just terrible I so
whatever I think is good is generally
bad here's something good there you go
that's professional you know just for
right now for the sake of this video I'm
gonna do this sorry the nice thing is is
that I don't have to upload CSS or
anything so if I change it I can just
come back in here and update it so what
is my slogan at new media LLC let's
think I don't
No here we go all right and then our
button read more let's see well yeah I'm
not gonna read more all right you know
what we're not gonna do that
all right let's so how do I get rid of
this thing it might make me a bit
actually like okay yeah if I don't put
any text it goes away
okay good all right let's save it before
anything bad happens no I don't want to
publish it yet though all right so
here's like the pages like about and
here's where I'd actually go ahead and
update all that so I could say edit all
right you know what now that I've done
my little about I need to go back to my
home page and be a little bit more
professional than I don't know I could
say empowering the world through
technology
all right so let's move down to the
pages we have our promo about so this
isn't my image so I'm going to need to
upload a different image so down here
you can actually update your team and
you can see that my team has uno numero
or numero uno yeah there's there's one
guy on my team and that's oh that's me
and all of you of course you guys are
all my teammates as well but I think
52,000 painted faces that actually be
pretty awesome if I had the time I would
put like 52,000 page like faces like
right on this joint know that it'd be
really cool actually so here is my three
services that I just made up off the top
of my head I said consulting which I'm
not in the market to consult really at
the moment I said new media offers
information technology consultancy
services whatever that means expert
techno technology services new media
provides expert experience in today's IT
environment all right and then I said a
sponsorship seek maximum exposure via a
new Media LLC sponsorship all right so
now I'm going to move down to my contact
information and here for my email I can
do it auto reply which is pretty awesome
and I'll say is that right or as I just
say CEO see it I don't even know it's
such a stupid title you know I'm not
gonna say that I'll just say and since
there's only one I was I say I alright
that's good enough for me
alright so that's another thing too is
like if you've ever tried to deal with
your own mail server that can be one of
the biggest nightmares ever plus you
have to really worry about your mail
server being hacked because then your
mail server could end up being you know
used to like fish and spam and do all
kinds of stuff for the next thing you
know the FBI is knocking on your door
like dude why are you sending out all
this stuff alright so now we can go with
the design I'm definitely not gonna
change the layout but if I want to
change the layout wouldn't be that big
of a deal you can see the different
color themes they kind of go with my
regular hipster code website so I'll
probably just keep that the way it is I
can do my fonts and change those I'll
probably just keep those the way they
are show search tool no I'm not gonna do
that show phone number I'm not gonna do
that
show address I'm not gonna do that show
social networks so I do need to edit
that so here I will put in my YouTube
account and the Twitter and the Facebook
is not really gonna do Facebook
all right and here is Twitter so now
what's cool though because I updated the
social networks here if I go like down
here you can see that there's like
YouTube and yeah I don't want to exit
but you can see that that is on their
show action buttons no I don't have that
alright footer layout social network
show mailing list I don't have one I'll
just go with the default there favicon I
don't really have one either and I don't
have that either
alright so now this is where you can get
into some other cool stuff here like you
can set it to multi page or like a
single page app you can have terms and
conditions so like if you edit your
terms you would put all that stuff
inside of here alright so here I'm going
to be pasting in a site terms and
conditions which is like a legal
document that I've created a long time
ago and I use it on my different
websites that pertains to my business
and also I want to have a privacy policy
every like legit website has a privacy
policy so a lot of places like Amazon
and things like that they won't even
work with you if you don't have a
privacy policy in place so you should
always do that in fact like right here
I'm gonna I'm kind of using the same
privacy policy that I'm using from
hipster code so I'm going to change that
new media LLC okay so now I have a legit
privacy policy search engine
optimization so homepage will say IT
consulting and marketing
so really it's three things education
consulting and marketing homepage title
you know I'm just going to paste the
same thing in all three of them right
now so English they formatted timezone
hello there we go
now another cool thing I want to show
you guys is like they have this plugins
thing so if you need to integrate Google
Analytics into the site or AdWords if
you were trying to advertise for your
product and your homepage and they have
the tools right there for you
webmaster tools anytime you build a new
website you should always register it
with Google Webmaster Tools so that way
Google knows about your site and they'll
start indexing and everything like that
Twitter I'm not a big fan or really I
know anything you know too much about it
so I can't comment on a lot of these
other things but definitely like
analytics Adwords and and that's about
it another thing too is they have this
live support chat which is pretty sweet
so like if you were really like if you
had somebody that you were paying to be
available for the product and that's
pretty sweet
all right so we're done here so now if I
go ahead and I save it I'm gonna say I
want to publish it so you can actually
see it publicly you guys could even go
to the site and you can see IT education
consulting blah blah this probably needs
a little bit work that's too light of an
image in fact I should probably switch
that out which I'm going to do that real
quick I'm going to switch I'm going to
switch one of these images here where I
say you know what I guess these are free
images that they're allowing you to use
all right so that's a little bit better
like putting a darker image there makes
it a little bit easier to read I should
probably change the color maybe I don't
know but here I mean I have a pretty
legit
you know website so that it's and it was
very easy to create obviously I did it
in a matter of like 10 minutes so for
people that don't have an IT background
it saves them a ton of time to use a
site like this so you can see since it's
a single page job if you click on any
one of these links here it'll take you
down to the certain section where it's
at if you guys want to get in contact
with me feel free to do it to this email
since now it's going to end up going
directly to me and down here it's simple
footer and stuff like that alright so
the final thing I'll mention on this
review here is that if if you look at
the domain you can see that hipster code
comm dot site 1 2 3 dot me is actually
the domain that you go to to get a
public you have to get here publicly now
you have the ability though to purchase
the domain through site 1 2 3 so that it
doesn't have to have site 1 2 3 media on
the end because obviously a lot of
people don't want to add that to their
domain name so if you have hipster
girl.com or somebody that you could
transfer you could transfer it over to
site 1 2 3 or you could purchase the
domain directly with site 1 2 3 when
you're setting up your product so that's
probably a question a lot of you guys
will have you can see here that like you
know if I were going to actually keep
this permanently I definitely I'm not
going to keep on the site 1 2 3 but it
does allow me to at least you know
publish collaborate with other people
and do it you know for free so alright
guys make sure you take it take a look
