hey guys what's up welcome back to the
Django web series how to build a jungle
website and last time we had built a
pretty sophisticated user profile system
and we're just going to continue to move
on now the website itself looks far from
finished but the purpose of this
tutorial is to kind of get the gist of
how to build an entire application so I
don't want to spend too much time on the
HTML the CSS like designing a logo or
adding a logo stuff like that because
ultimately I feel like that's kind of
moving away from what you know what the
Django discussion should be about so
really we're just going to continue to
move along on the path of setting up
certain things that the most jangled
website should have so let's go ahead
and we're going to build a to our URLs
dot pi file which is going to basically
if there is an error when the website is
in production meaning when the debug
settings in the settings dot pi file
here the debug settings at the top if
that is set to true then it displays
error messages but when it's just set to
false like it should be on a production
website and we want it to be able to
direct our error pages to certain
specific pages as opposed to displaying
like a 500 or if the debug is on then it
would display all the debug information
you don't want another user to be able
to see so let's go ahead and open up our
URLs file and we're going to go ahead
and import a handler so that we can take
care of the the response and when I say
in where we actually don't even need to
import it it's actually very easy to add
this particular feature so we're going
to say handler 404
equals views dot custom 404 and 404 is a
page not found error message which is
pretty common and now we're going to add
a 500 as well and we'll just call this
custom 500 so now in our view is we need
to be able to serve up that that
response so let's go ahead and add that
now and we're simply going to do just
like we've added any of these other
pages we're going to just create that
here
alright so just like any other traffic
being directed back we're going to do
the same thing so let's just copy and
paste this so we can do the 500 as well
which is about the same thing alright so
now all that's left to do is we have to
go ahead and create the templates for
those those pages
and we want to inherit from base so
let's like we do in these other pages
like copyright let's just go ahead and
copy this entire top part and then paste
it into our 404 and we'll just a page
not found is the title we always have to
do our in Block in our template and
we'll just just an h1 for right now I'm
sorry this page or the page you
requested could not be found or maybe we
should say we're sorry I'm not sure
which one sounds more personable but
anyway that's going to be the message
that we display for right now and let's
go ahead and save this page also as 500
h HTML and we'll call this new música
will just be like oh crap
this page is not working correctly all
right so we'll go ahead and update our
URLs file and the views and everything
that we just worked on
and in our settings file here we want to
go ahead and just set the debug to false
actually I don't want to change that all
right so it's go ahead and update that
and we're going to intentionally go to a
page that's not found so we'll do
profile two are actually three we know
there's no profile three and you can see
that the correct page is being rendered
it looks like we have a template error
going on that and what's actually going
on is this is actually extending a 500
error message because what we did is on
what's triggering the 500 if you
followed along in our profile system
we're trying to query the database for a
profile object that does not exist so it
throws a 500 errors so it's not just a
standard page not found it's an actual
500 so we had a problem with our
template that we were missing one of the
curly braces so I just went ahead and
added that back in so the mark-up should
appear correctly now and you can see
that does oh crap this page is not
working correctly now let's go ahead and
just go to a page that's definitely not
found page not found and it looks like
yeah because I copied and pasted I jack
that up too so we missed another curly
brace on this one
alright so there's our custom 404 and a
custom 500 page that is now working
correctly alright guys if you have any
questions or anything just I'll leave a
comment and please subscribe thank you
for watching have a good day bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
