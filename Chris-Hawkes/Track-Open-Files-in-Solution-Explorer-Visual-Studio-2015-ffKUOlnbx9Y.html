simple tip video on how to use Visual
Studio 2015 and one of the common things
that you'll find is when you're actually
in a file you might be have like a ton
of different files pulled up on your tab
up above and one of the helpful benefits
of Visual Studio is that you can
actually have where you have the current
opened file also be highlighted and your
solution Explorer over here on the right
so it gets a lot easier especially when
you have 20-30 files and you click on
one that you know exactly where that
file lives and your file directory so in
order to be able to sync that you just
want to go to tools and options and then
you want to go to projects and solutions
and then we're gonna go just under
general and right here the second option
track active item and the solution
Explorer so just go ahead and check that
and click ok so now you can see that
like if I click on this you see over
here on the on the right hand side the
solution Explorer is now tracking that
file so now I don't have to you know try
to figure out or hover over the you know
the tabbed item to figure out where in
the directory it is so a lot of people
find that helpful and this is just how
to do that in 2015 so thanks for
watching guys thanks bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
