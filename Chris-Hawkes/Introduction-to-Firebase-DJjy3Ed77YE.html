is just a basic introduction into what
is firebase and whether or not you
actually want to learn and learn it to
use it in your next project so it's not
a tutorial it's gonna teach you how to
actually use firebase it's just really
just to give you a quick refresher on
whether or not you want to use it and
really what the hell it's all about all
right so what is firebase and if you go
to their website they say the firebase
helps you build better mobile apps and
grow your business that's obviously very
vague so we need to know like really
what is it about so it's a framework and
it's it's a framework that uses a
restful api that communicates directly
with google's back-end no sequel
database google has the ability to scale
data massively they have millions of
servers and their technology to be able
to scale out data on those millions of
servers and be able to retrieve them
almost instantaneous and also be able to
update in real time essentially meaning
that you communicated with one server on
the network and and those data changes
are then reflected all across all the
other millions of servers and everything
on their their data farm or server farm
that type of scalability is next to
impossible Google is one of the few
companies that can actually do it they
they now run and maintain firebase so
essentially it is a great product for
real-time data synchronization no sequel
meaning that you can use JSON documents
which works extremely well with modern
front-end frameworks like react angular
view all that stuff is built for JSON
data so definitely a good solution for
this modern approach another thing to
because it's no sequel there is no data
schema like you would see in a
relational database so it's it's a very
modern approach it's basically Google's
a Google's best ability to provide the
the basically to provide fuel for the
progressive web app movement all right
so what are some of the pros it's no
sequel we've already talked about that
so it works across platform so it
doesn't really matter if you're using a
project built with node Python C sharp
or Java those are all going to work
because whatever technology you're using
you're communicating with the firebase
cloud and infrastructure
via API calls so just via HTTP which is
the language that the browser speaks
since the language of the Internet and
it's why we can have companies like
Apple and Microsoft get along because
they they both speak that same language
so it's supported by Google Google
bought the company that used to be
firebase used to be its own company
actually and got bought by Google and
2014 so has once again the real-time
synchronization between different
clients in the backend almost instantly
or instantaneously that is something
that is like I said next to impossible
for a lot of businesses to be able to do
especially once you start having
multiples of servers so there's no
set-up cost because of your your entire
architecture using firebase is all in
the cloud of firebase there's no there's
no overhead so that's a major benefit
for using firebase additional things to
know so apps built with firebase are
considered to be progressive web apps
and once again a progressive web app
just means that it's it's a website that
has the same look and feel as a native
mobile app installed on your smartphone
to use firebase you need to know
JavaScript so that doesn't definitely
need to know JavaScript so I would jump
all over that and you might as well if
you're gonna no job if you're gonna jump
into firebase with no experience and
anything else and then I would suggest
that you use you learn JavaScript first
and then you use nodejs as your back-end
because that is also a technology that
you write the code in JavaScript
complicated to explain it for brand-new
newbies I'm not gonna try that on this
video but yeah definitely definitely go
with JavaScript be for branding or
programming and want to get involved in
firebase some once again it was art it
was its own company which is cool like
it used to be had series funding or
venture capital funding initially so a
lot of smart people behind this project
from the get-go so who is using firebase
there's all kinds of massive major
companies using firebase and a lot of
these companies are using it because
they need real-time access to
information like trivago is trying to do
price comparisons with all the different
hotel providers and then you have
companies like lyft that are using the
GPS and constant data streaming back and
forth from the server you know to the
end users so they can figure out where's
my driver worse you know where's the
person how we're meeting up things like
that so Shazam is another website that
has I think something like
million monthly users or something along
those lines so a lot of major companies
are using firebase so it's got a lot of
power behind it so what should be made
with it so once again I kind of just
answered that question but because of
the real-time data synchronization it's
perfect for modern you eyes that deal
with with JSON so that's basically
everything these days like going all the
way back to like knockout frameworks
like that they're just going to work a
lot easier with with firebase and with
you know with something like a MVC net
razor template or something like that or
template view language like that it
especially excels at apps like chat
based systems so once again that
real-time I need to have instantaneous
like updates reflected on the UI so it's
very good for that and once again GPS
like that's why lyft is using it so it
could also be a good solution for a
massive multiplayer like online games
probably not anything sophisticated just
you know basic games that are gonna pass
some you know limited amounts of data
backup or you're not gonna run Call of
Duty in the browser or anything like
that obviously I'm this technology
doesn't solve cancer or anything like
that but anyway where do I learn more so
I'm gonna put the links to some of the
documentation articles and if you guys
have any good tutorials that you want to
share that that I should put in the
description go ahead and let me know
also feel free to leave any comments
about anything I left out or what your
experience is with firebase so that
other people can see it and I thank you
guys for watching this please subscribe
and have a good day bye so this video
was brought to you by Deb Mountain
coding boot camp there are eight boot
camp that is based out of Utah but
they're also in Texas in Arizona now and
they have very good reviews so make sure
you guys check them out the link is in
the description tab below they offer
courses in web development iOS
development UX or user experience design
Quality Assurance and just a few other
ones in fact they're even getting into
Salesforce as well now so they're
continuing to adapt their courses based
on what the market needs are and major
companies are hiring some of their
alumni so make sure you guys give them a
look they have great reviews and thanks
for watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
