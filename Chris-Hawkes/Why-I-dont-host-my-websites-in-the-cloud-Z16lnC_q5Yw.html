I'm going to quickly discuss one of the
reasons why I
is to actually host my own server when
it comes to trying to figure out where
to actually host your application once
ready to produce it now one of the
things I'll mention is Microsoft Azure
seems like a good product it just
recently dropped their prices and their
entire scheme looks a little bit
different so it seems to be pretty cheap
it's a lot cheaper than it was however
one of the things that really pisses me
off about any sort of cloud-based
programming or cloud-based setup is that
you always have these like billable
hours and you never know what the hell
that you know actually means and if you
do research on it you will most likely
end up more confused than when you
started this whole cloud pricing thing
it just seems like a racket to me and
I've never I've never been a big fan of
it especially as a small business just
trying to get things off the ground as
your Amazon's ec2 or Google App Engine I
mean they're probably great products for
large companies that have entire IT
staff that they have to pay for I'm sure
at that point and this is just my
opinion then it would become an
attractive option for me like if I had
to scale overnight or something like
that but the bottom line is that most
projects never get that big and to be
honest with you if I ever do get that
big that'll be a problem that I would
want to have and I could probably
transition my stuff over pretty quickly
to some sort of cloud solution if I ever
deemed it necessary or maybe I just run
my own server farm like you know
Facebook or Google or any other major
company is currently doing so I mean I'm
not saying cloud is complete crap or
anything but when you compare it to
something like Linode which is my
favorite hosting company you pay 20
bucks a month you don't have any sort of
confusing billing schedule or anything
like that it is $20 a month and your
guarantee these resources which
definitely blows away as or even with
their newest reduced pricing this also
gives you the flexibility of having the
actual root access to your server so
literally you have to set up your own
server which can be good and bad but
once you learn how to do it I mean
they're step-by-step tutorials on all of
it then I mean you're definitely you
have much more flexible
going forward with different software
and services that you may want to run
off of your server if you look at the
three terabyte or terabytes of transfer
or the 48 gigabyte of SSD storage your
equivalent and as your even but with the
reduced prices I mean it's going to be
quite a bit more you know we're talking
hundreds of dollars more a month and I
gotta say I've had Alan know $20
accounted at one point I had peek
website website traffic of well over
100,000 visitors a month and I think I
came within like 15% of my available
resources or something like that it was
it was a very minor amount like I wasn't
anywhere close to actually exceeding
that $20 a month account I mean it was a
blog based site so there wasn't a whole
lot of CPU you know being taken up or
anything like that but it was still
quite a bit of users that were
downloading the page and viewing it
simultaneously and I held up just fine
another alternative to Linode is a newer
kid on the block which is digitalocean
and this is another good company that
i've heard a lot about but the Linode
actually goes back a little bit longer
and to be honest with you Linode has
always had stand-up service and it seems
like digitalocean is you know somebody
that has come along with a lot of
venture capital money to grow and expand
quickly Butlin odes been that guy that's
been on the block for a long time has
been offering service that is um next to
none for a very long time so I would
definitely recommend the node over
digitalocean but you can't you can't go
wrong with digitalocean either both of
them have a $10 month account if that's
better for you now another thing about
lonoa and both digitalocean is that they
do not support net so if you're going to
build an asp.net website unless you're
using mono which is a whole nother story
then you're not going to be able to host
any sort of dotnet platform website on a
Linode account or a digitalocean account
so in that case if you are building a
dotnet site you're probably going to end
up being forced to use Azure or the
cheaper alternative which is a Rackspace
however they are expensive
- I've looked at on I think the cheapest
I could get them was like $75 a month
and it didn't even compare to the $20
month one no resources so as much as
I've you know wanted to do a dotnet site
I just can't bite the bullet and pay all
that cash to be able to host my site
with Azure or Rackspace at least for
your typical blog site that's aimed at
getting a lot of traffic I would go
bankrupt by the time I started making
any money so I don't have that kind of
money to just spread around and make
Microsoft richer so for that reason I
choose to set up my own virtual private
server which is what my note is here and
I couldn't recommend them more and
they're perfect for Django or PHP or
anything other than net all right guys
thanks for watching and that's how I
choose where I want to host my websites
thank you bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
