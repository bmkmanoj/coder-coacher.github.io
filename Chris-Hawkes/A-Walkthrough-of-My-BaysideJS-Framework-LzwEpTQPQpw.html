about a yet another nodejs framework
however the difference between this
framework and any other ones that I've
talked about in the past including the
Django and the Python stuff that I've
done is that I've actually created this
framework so it's not very it's not all
that great yet I don't think so it's
named after my dog which is named after
the band bayside which is my favorite
band they're actually the reason why I
became programmer a programmer and I've
told the story many times but you know
being in their concert 2009 I believe it
was and I just decided to be a program
or so I named my dog after them and you
guys see my dog bayside and plenty of my
videos and now there's a framework named
after the dog named after the band but
it all goes back to the band basically
so it's called base IJ esta which is
going to be the name of it hopefully
there's not going to be any sort of
collision problem right now but here's
here's the basic gist of it and let me
look at it on github and also this is my
first foray into actually building
something on github come on where are
you whatever Google hasn't really in
Dexta yet okay so I have 39 commits and
that's because I when I started building
this thing I built it without really
having a true direction in mind I I
wanted something like Django so if you
guys have ever done Django I wanted to
have authentication authorization and
admin system and all that stuff and to
date I don't have the database
integration part I don't have that
authentication piece or the the Django
admin which is so helpful too many
python django developers but i hope that
i can eventually have it here but it's a
relatively it's a relatively simple
website so if you were going to do some
sort of static site you could use
express or you could use this or you
could use anything that you want out
there but i wanted the learning process
so that's why i went ahead and i built
this so let's go ahead and step by step
just figure out how we would actually
create our app in this thing and I also
want to make it as easy as possible here
is the app it's going to be called new
music so I just have it in my projects
directory Visual Studio code so i need
to enter
she'll and if i'm on windows i can just
type CMD and it takes me right to that
directory so it's an empty directory
there's nothing in it the first thing
you're going to want to do whenever you
build a modern JavaScript project these
days using note is you're going to do
npm I knit and that's going to create a
Jason config file for you which keeps
track of all of your projects
dependencies what is the dependency it
just means that your project is using
some library and it's going to keep
track of the version of that library
that you're using and it makes your life
easier so go ahead and type mpm ident
press ENTER and this is going to ask you
a few questions so I do want the name of
the project to be noob music it's going
to be version 1 point 0 and I'll say a
rock music website and then I'm going to
say a pas is my starting point my test
command I can leave that blank so I'll
press Enter same with the git repository
and the keywords I can go ahead and
throw my name on here alright and then
the license others leave that license
that's fine so now we went ahead and if
I do a door you can see that there's a
package.json file so now if i do npm
install and then i'm going to do hyphen
hyphen save that way it'll add this
install to our package JSON file and I'm
just going to say Bayside so this is
going to reach across the web if you
have npm install by the way i should
have said that you need to have no DJ s
installed so node installs npm for you
so that's beyond the scope of this video
but that should be the first thing you
do whenever you use note is actually go
and download and install it on your
computer but normally they just have
these install files it makes it very
easy so that's all I did it went ahead
and installed and it puts everything
inside your node modules folder so this
is just a standard node.js way and if we
look inside here if you look up at the
top you can see that bayside is is right
there hopefully you guys can see that I
went into bayside I'm sorry and I look
in there you can see those the bayside
files there so let's go ahead and back
up two directories to our main directory
which is new music and here is where
things get a little bit i wish it was a
little bit easier but this isn't too bad
if we look
it I need to say node space dot /a node
modules forward slash bayside forward
slash bayside admin jas so all one big
line and then put a space after that the
jas part and then this is going to be
the name of your app so if you remember
I said my starting point and my NPM mine
it was going to be a pas so I'm just
going to say app and now it says just
like that your bayside app was created
so now if we look in here bayside
created a bunch of both several projects
are directories really you have the
static directly and on the templates
directory and then this app guess file
so let's go ahead and look at what was
created for us we're going to use Visual
Studio code which is a free editor that
you guys can use it's actually really
good and I'm not a Microsoft fanboy
saying that it's actually extremely easy
to use that I've used Adam before
they're in fact they're both built off
of the same engine most vs code and Adam
but you can download this here and run
your projects and everything right from
it so it makes things a lot easier but
it's for free once you have it open you
just had to say open folder and we're
going to go to where we installed on
this project so I put it under my Visual
Studio code and I have it under new
music and i'll just select this folder
so now you can see it shows all the
files that we have and if i click on app
jas you can see this is the main this is
the core code that is your base ID app
and you can see at the top it says
require bayside so that's no Jo saying
hey I need the bayside framework and
then these configs can be over rideable
so if you want to change the port number
you can do that here also it expects
your templates to be in your templates
directory so that's what this is
specifying so that's why this is the
templates was created for you to show
you where you need to put your templates
another thing too is that I need to make
a config entry for the static folder but
it creates a static folder where your
jss are you I'm sorry Jas and CSS stuff
should live and it even creates a main
CS just so you can see a working example
of CSS and your app
so let's go back to our command prompt
and we're going to type node fjs and
then you're going to see it's a server
listening on 3000 because that was the
default so if I pull up another browser
I'll just pull this up and we go to our
local host address which is 127 dot 0
dot 0 dot 1 and then you do colon 3,000
because that's the port number so when
we go there you can see your Bayside app
is running now you're probably like well
it's a relatively simple site it just
built a standard you know basic template
for you with nothing in it and that's
typically not what you want for a
project so i went ahead and i downloaded
here a start bootstrap creative web
frame basically it's a template so if
you type free bootstrap templates you
can download these zip folders which has
all this us you know these static I call
them static content folders so let's go
ahead and extract this entire all these
folders here to our static folder of our
application so I'm going to click
extract I actually have it here in the
drop down but it's you can see it's
putting it in the static folder here so
it's going to add all these folders to
your static folders so i click ok if I
go to my project and I look in here and
I look in static so all those folders
are now in here including all that CSS
all that stuff that I had before was
overwritten which is what we want also I
want to take the template and I'm going
to extract that to my templates
directory and say ok I'm going to say
yes because I'm going to be replacing
what was there and now you're going to
see nothing happened when you refresh
you actually have to stop the server and
restart it you can actually use node
there's things like note a demon or
something like that or something along
those lines so now you can see we have a
new template being rendered but the
static all that CSS and all the stuff
that makes it pretty is not actually
updated so what we need to do is go into
our editor go into our templates and
click on index and what you want to do
is fit
two paths to all this static content so
what do I mean by static content well
here is a reference to the vendor folder
so if we look in our project directory
by clicking this button you can see
inside static there's a vendor folder
that we extracted over there so
basically everything is in the static
directory so what I need to do is say
forward slash static /and anywhere
there's like a reference to a file I
need to do that so here's another one
I'm going to replace this this one you
don't have to do that because you can
see it's actually a web an entire web
address so this is actually going across
the internet and grabbing something
here's another local reference so we'll
fix that will fix this if we go down
there's going to be some images down
here so this will get just tedious for a
moment all right so you can see that
there's two image references right on
top of each other so we're going to
replace both of those I can even make it
I could do it a simple copy and paste
but just in case you guys are not using
this editor I don't want to do any sort
of shortcut I'm just going to go through
here for just a moment only take a look
at half a minute to update all this
stuff and then we can see the result
right so we're almost done here so then
just let's go ahead and add these a few
more references vendor vendor and then
this final one it looks like so press
ctrl s to make sure you save it now we
need to restart the server though so it
will reflect our changes so i can press
ctrl c to stop the server and just press
my up arrow and it will type what I have
before which is no tap jus and this will
run again and now if I go ahead and
refresh you can see you have a much
prettier looking website running on the
base ijs framework so what does this
framework good for well if you wanted to
use if you wanted to integrate mongo DB
or something like that you could easily
do that nothing really stands in your
way if you if you look at them this
entire structure here it's actually
using a template engine that is very
similar to what jinja to is which is
very similar to Django's template engine
so if you have any familiarity with
django that you'll feel right at home
you pass in key value pairs so let's
just look at this as an example here's
title and home if you notice when you
put in a title it's going to appear up
here and you can see create a bootstrap
is the name of the title because of this
template but let's go ahead and replace
it with this title value that we're
passing down to our template so I'm
going to go into the index and all the
way at the top I'm going to find the
title tag and here it is and what I'm
going to do instead is I'm going to say
inside these brackets I'm just simply
going to say the name title so now
you're going to see when we we probably
have to restart again I think yeah you
have to restart it's going to be helpful
if you end up adding a tool to watch any
site at a time you make a change that it
will restart there's tools for node to
do that but now you can see at the top
that it says home so when you're passing
data down to your application that's all
you have to do so you have your URLs
which is the path and then you have your
your views and once one specific thing
that I do need to address this was more
built for single page application
where you end up building end points and
then passing data back but they're still
going to be some work that I need to do
in order for the the URLs to be more
discoverable because these aren't really
built for new dynamic URLs which is
pretty important so it's one of the
features I haven't gotten to yet but as
far as you know adding URLs and adding
the views it's just going to you know
that's all there is to it you could
abstract this out to a separate page if
you wanted to but I just as keeping it
as simple as possible i decided to just
keep it all in one page so you can see
everything that your application is
doing so once again as far as though you
know what is this good for right now
this would be a good website for any
sort of gallery site like okay you have
some sort of family member that's asking
you to make a website for their coffee
shop or something like that this would
be probably an ideal situation for that
as soon as you you really need you know
probably the the dynamic URL so that's
going to be the next feature that I look
for because right now you'd have to
actually you know right out your URLs
and if you want the pass arguments you'd
have to do it through a query string and
not you know through like a regular
expression like Django has it so that's
something that I'll work on here pretty
soon but let me know what you guys think
man this is this is my first stab at a
framework and I wasn't really sure what
I was doing when I first got started
here but overall I think I'm happy with
just basically being able to set up a
nodejs I relatively easily just four
simple websites alright guys thanks for
watching have a good day and by</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
