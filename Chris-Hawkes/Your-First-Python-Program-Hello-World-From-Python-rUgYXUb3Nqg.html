we're gonna do is start with Python and
everybody starts off in every
programming tutorial with a simple hello
world programs hello world that sounds
like a dumb name
why not print your mom's got TIG ol
bitties hello world and we're gonna pass
on now as far as these Python tutorials
are concerned I'm not gonna explain how
to install Python yeah I mean go go on
the web type in install Python pick a
version you want hey Chris Hawkes
are you a dumb you already
explained how to install Python in the
first video
don't confuse people with your
my IDE and that stands for integrated
development environment everybody has
their own option here I'm using active
state comodo which is not free it's
actually quite expensive so I personally
like it I recommend it but most likely
if you're just learning programming just
download a free editor like I would
recommend like aptana studios has a free
one and that's a PTA na studios you
could use something like crimson editor
notepad plus plus I'm just a few other
ones and but you want to get some sort
of program running that can actually
that you can write your code in because
you don't want to just use a regular
notepad file that'll be a disaster so
let's go ahead and write our first
program and all you have to do in Python
is say print now in order to save this
as a Python file so that the computer
knows to run it and invoke the Python
interpreter which will be installed on
your machine
we're gonna go to if I said training
yeah we're gonna do it under training
here I saw I got these other files in
here that save this hello world and you
want to do a dot py on the end so it
saves it as a Python file and if you
notice too this is a simple casing
called camel casing it's the way most
programmers work everybody has their own
preference but what it does is you keep
the first word with no capitals and then
you capitalize any word after the first
word so hello world the W is capitalized
and that's called camel casing because
it's like a camel hump alright so we're
going to save that and pull this joint
out sorry I don't even remember if we
just we put in our training god damn it
right now man alright so there you see
it's it's their hello world dot py so in
order to run it hello and then you see
it prints out hello world so I'm gonna
go ahead and kill this first video we
just want to do a simple hello world the
program that's all it is so that's your
first successful program hopefully
you're able to do it and I apologize if
I do use cuss words sometimes I just try
to keep people's attention and make sure
that I'm paying attention as well all
right I'll talk to you guys later
alright and we'll do some more
programming in the next tutorial
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
