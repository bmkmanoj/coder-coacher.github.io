on stackoverflow today and i noticed
that they said that i had enough points
or something like that in order to be
able to cast a vote for one of the
moderators because apparently on Stack
Overflow they want moderators to be
elected from within so people from their
own community to be able to say who
should be a moderator and who shouldn't
we've talked about the type of people
that actually exist over there and the
fact that the site is you know somewhat
now some people really like it some
people think it's it's not very good and
they think that it's not very you know
welcoming to newcomers and things like
that so the moderators oh they all
compete against each other in order to
be elected and from what I was reading
the amount of effort that people are
willing to put into being like a
moderator or you know elected official
of a site like stackoverflow is
absolutely amazing to me so one of the
things that's disheartening that when I
read about some of these articles is
like let me give you an example here
this one dudes talking about hey Who am
I you know he's 25 he's a Dutch web
developer he does asp.net and people are
asking them they're like you know how
much time can you spend moderating every
day it's like dude you wait why are
you even asking me that like I mean but
I understand that that's like probably a
relevant question but just immediately
if somebody asked me to do that and I
was even considering it I'd be like I
have that some night you know I'm
not answering to some guy with 6,000
points who wants me to devote half my
life to this thing that I don't even get
paid for but it's interesting because
this brings up the whole gamification
thing so I guess an argument could be
made that like gamification is about
trying to get people to use and interact
with your site in order to increase
their score and things like that in this
particular case this person I don't know
that they get additional score posts on
stack overflow from becoming a moderator
I find it you know very interesting that
people are actually interested in
devoting so much of their life in order
to be one so listen to some of this
though this one dude Makoto is asking
you seem cool
busy's talking to a guy who actually
teaches in New York City computer
science of all things n he's a senior
developer I mean he says not only do you
have a lot of things going on in your
life which is quite awesome that sounds
so douchebag is anyway says being logged
in and active between 7am to 11pm isn't
the same as being hands-on from 7am to
11pm how do you intend to strike a
work-life balance on stackoverflow ma or
with stock out overflow moderation
lumped on top once again the first time
I get a comment like that like I am not
dealing with people like that if I'm
devoting my free time and attention to
helping out the community i'm not sure
like these people getting paid am I not
aware of something because honestly i
would never put up with even a minute of
this if I wasn't getting paid and I feel
like I give back to the community quite
a bit i've devoted quite a bit of time
to this channel trying to respond back
to people I've done tutorials that
literally make no money and they've
helped thousands of people and so I feel
like I do give in a lot to programming I
also devote a lot of my life to
programming but no way would I ever
devote my time and attention to people
asking me to be available all day long
when I have family friends life you know
there's there's things going on that
we're I've said before we don't get more
time so you know choose wisely whether
it's your whatever sort of programming
language you're you're deciding to to
learn you want to make sure that you're
using your time wisely that's one of the
things that I didn't do initially like I
changed around way too much when I was
first getting started and I didn't focus
on enough learning enough of a
particular technology before thinking
that I needed to learn something else
and it didn't really get me anywhere it
allowed me to you know basically be able
to carry on a conversation with a casual
programmer that might know a little bit
about the technology but beyond that I
wasn't any sort of senior type of you
know developer type thing that that
could earn me a lot of money so what my
advice there is that you know you want
to make sure that you're focusing on
whatever it is that you're going to do
you know put in one hundred and ten
percent effort so if it's going to be
PHP don't worry about what Python people
are doing or whether Django is a better
framework than laravel if you chose PHP
then
focus on that path and try to get
yourself a PHP development position
which will end up you know getting you
more experience in other areas too but
the thing is is like this is this is
like crazy like the amount of effort and
this isn't even what I was reading
before let me find you some other gyms
in here so here's another guy who is
competing for his spot he says I spend
more than six hours a day on Stack
Overflow mostly flagging reviewing or
hammering and then he says all right
here somebody asked him a question is
six hours a day sustainable for you this
dude responds by saying yes I don't mind
I sleep for five hours a day and work
for seven there's an additional six
hours of free time do it live your life
man like you have six hours of free time
why the hell would you want to be on
this boring ass site for six hours of
your day for free and I'm assuming for
free and there must be I don't know
people are getting paid I don't think
they're getting paid I have like a 4050
Stack Overflow score I've never made a
dime and I think I've contributed a
decent amount of time to this website
because I do get stuff back out out of
it but I think this is just taking
things a little bit to farm we need to
pump our brakes because if a if a
development gig is like hey i noticed
that you're not a moderator on Stack
Overflow because you don't like to spend
six hours of your free time every day
writing code for everybody else even
though you get paid to do that all day
long and you know we don't give a
that you don't have a girlfriend or wife
or kids or have enjoyed any bit of your
life so far at young you know whatever
sort of age you are not only man it's
it's it's a road that I don't really
feel like going down to be honest
already we've seen technology start
moving in the direction of trying to
make things as easy as possible or to
change every six months like 80 case in
point with the JavaScript community
where you don't really have any sort of
upper advantage on any sort of younger
developer so if you're a senior dev and
you're dealing with a technology that's
only two years old you know some sort of
junior can come along and be much better
at that technology and you know there's
really no no there's no
I guess the discrepancy between a junior
and a senior is is trying to be
diminished it almost feels like we're
trying to diminish that as much as
possible not just in corporations
because let's face it salaries are the
most expensive thing that an IT
organization has to deal with the
majority of their expenses are in
salaries that's why they're always
trying to lower the salaries that's why
they looked at h-1b visas and things
like that where especially in the united
states where they game the system to try
to bring in people from overseas or to
outsource to try to save it save money
it's just because that developers are
very expensive especially with the
market the way it is right now now
granted I've already noticed that job
opportunities and offers have been
declining a little bit recently because
a lot of the startups are losing their
funding and it's been going on for at
least a year now in and who knows with
this new election coming up whether or
not that's going to continue to happen
but the point is is that the you know
the situation is already stacked against
senior developers with the technology
changing every six months and this is
just another step in that direction
where it's like hey I see you don't put
in six hours a day on stackoverflow
what's what's wrong with you and you're
not a real programmer now here's the
good news at least as far as the United
States is concerned I know firsthand
that even what I do by going home and
coding by staying up to date with
technologies YouTube whatever this is
way more effort than what you're going
to find from a lot of other developers
and the 925 community they just don't do
it they go home and you know rightfully
so they try to enjoy their lives instead
of trying to spend every waking moment
writing code so here it says at the
bottom this election is currently in the
nomination phase nominations closed in
seven days you need to you need all the
following badges to nominate yourself as
candidate Strunk and white civic duty
deputy and convention well I'm not going
to vote I have no interest in voting for
any of these people I don't think any
one of them should be spending every
minute of their waking lives trying to
moderate and close out to placate
questions and things like that I myself
have actually closed we're not really
closed but I have actually spent quite a
bit of time on Stack Overflow saying you
know linking to the correct answer i'm
not one of those dicks that will down
vote it or anything like that but all it
will provide a link in the comment every
now and then of some sort of duplicate
answer but either way like I said I just
think the gamification you know getting
people to spend their actual time and
effort for free is absolutely amazing to
me and I don't think anybody has done it
better than stack overflow but that said
even though there are some issues that I
have with ever you know people highly
pay people spending so much of their
time doing stuff like this there's also
the fact that you know Stack Overflow
has provided a lot of good in the world
as far as you know the answers and is
keeping the community relatively clean
you're not going to find a lot of trash
talk and spam if you look at YouTube
comments it's absolutely atrocious what
people are writing especially on like a
viral video there's just it's just so
yeah like I said it's atrocious that's
the best way to describe it but with
Stack Overflow you don't really see that
every once a while you'll see somebody
you know go off-the-cuff or like you
know go on a rant or something like that
and but most of the time like it gets
taken down pretty quickly and it's just
it's amazing how well they're able to
keep the community cleaning and going
strong and everything so you know I tip
my hat to that I think that's a good job
I certainly wouldn't be able to do any
better job at that and you know this
site is definitely something that I
spent quite a bit of time on so I do
love i love Stack Overflow I would say
that's helped me a ton but you know
let's be reasonable here people
shouldn't be logged in to stack overflow
from 7am to 11pm every day just to be a
moderator that's alright guys
thanks for watching have a good night
bye hey guys so I've talked about this a
lot Deb mountain coding boot camp they
are my sponsor they're one of the
reasons why I'm able to do these videos
and they offer a 12 week intensive
course that teaches you the tech
geez of the here and now they're going
to focus on a lot of things that are
actually being used and websites things
like jQuery and they're going to be
using stacks like nodejs the 12 week
intensive course is to try to get people
in the job market so that is their
entire focus we've all we've talked a
lot about on this channel whether or not
a college degree is worth it I'm not the
one to be able to answer that question
for you I absolutely think that college
degrees are great especially in computer
science I never want to convince
somebody to say that they shouldn't do
that obviously schools like Stanford and
MIT I'm you know I I'm an envy of all
those graduates however there is you
know the bulk of developers that don't
necessarily need to be the MIT graduates
to actually have success in the
programming world I think I speak
relatively well for for that type of
person and with coding boot camps we're
seeing them you know try to offer more
Skills more modern-day skills because a
lot of times when you're going to a
computer science course and a major
university you're learning technology
that's already outdated by the time
you're learning it with Deb mountain and
coding boot camps like what dev Mountain
offers they're focusing on really what
is hot right now so and they also focus
on a relatively you know small set of
skills in order to make sure that they
are teaching you what you need to know
in order to be productive in a in a
workplace environment so make sure you
guys do me a favor do yourself a favor
check out the link and that in the
description tab below for more on dev
Mountain coding boot camp thanks guys
