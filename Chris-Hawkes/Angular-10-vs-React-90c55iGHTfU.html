this video I've gotten a question about
which JavaScript framework I i prefer
angular or react and for all the
naysayers out there I mean I know that
comparing angular to react is not an
apples-to-apples comparison it's more of
an apples to oranges comparison there is
there's differences between the two both
have kind of their own opinionated way
of being able to accomplish certain
things now angular kind of aims at being
the full scale web framework kind of
like a Django air ASP and it's all
JavaScript and they have you know very
angular specific ways of being able to
do everything from routing to data
access and data binding and stuff like
that while react basically says hey you
can use whatever sort of stack you want
i'm going to stay out of the way of all
that you just need to go ahead and build
some components using you know our
philosophy our design philosophy of
reusable web components and then you can
apply our framework to whatever sort of
back-end that you want whether it's
Django or ASP or Ruby on Rails now when
you compare the two about which one is
more opinionated while they're both
opinionated react is certainly the
easier approach when you're trying to
integrate a website or you're trying to
integrate one of these two frameworks
into the website stack that you happen
to choose so react pretty much works
with everything angular sometimes can
cause a few headaches when it comes to
actually getting it implemented namely
when i tried to use angular which with
django while you can use the two pretty
i mean i wouldn't say that easily but
the bottom line is that react is
certainly easier to integrate into both
react to django and asp i would say by a
long shot once again it's not exactly a
fair comparison just because react is
handling more of the view where angular
is trying to handle everything the NBC
aspect of web design or web development
now a lot of JavaScript people i mean
people that may try to promote irelia or
maybe ember or
bone or underscore or any of these other
millions of libraries that we have out
there and JavaScript communities I think
a lot of people would say that both of
them are bloated and you know a lot of
people i would i would think have a
problem with how angular handles
template data binding it's it's rather
ugly i think the way now angular 2 point
0 may have made some improvements with
that i haven't really spent too much
time with angular 2 point 0 but i
absolutely hated its its templating
language for angular 1 point 0 now with
react a lot of criticism is thrown
reacts way with its j sx trim their
language that it has in jsx is really
just a form of javascript that compiles
to regular JavaScript that builds HTML
essentially so a lot of people think is
really ugly that you know we have this
jsx where we're kind of combining this
javascript and HTML into one making this
you know soupy mess of a of a language
and a lot of people like to separate
their concerns and they criticize react
for that actually personally it took me
three separate attempts where I say you
know what I'm going to give react a shot
and for the first two attempts i looked
at jsx night sorry mess image I have sex
and I said all to hell with this I don't
like it and ended up you know trying to
write react with raw JavaScript and
eventually kind of saw the light and
started using jsx and eventually it
started growing on me and I realized
that I would much rather write react
code using jsx and not using jsx so it
is weird though there are some weird
gotchas with that and certainly some
criticisms towards react with the j sx
library and it being somewhat messy both
websites are heavily used in production
react has actually been used by the
Facebook guys since about two thousand
eleven so I mean Facebook is certainly a
large-scale website that has scaled with
the best of them and a lot of there has
been some misconception about whether or
not google actually backs angular
the fact that matters is that Google
does use angular it's one of their more
popular projects and several websites
including the YouTube gaming website is
is created with angular so it is untrue
if somebody says that angular doesn't
actually use our google doesn't actually
use angular it's not that's not true
they absolutely do so both of the
frameworks are actually sponsored and
used by major corporations now one of
the concerns that people had with
angular is that angular from the 1.3
version which is the last stable version
of the 1 series to where they went to
the 2.0 series a they had initially
implemented a completely new design
we're really anger 2 point 0 wasn't
going to resemble one the 1 series at
all and a lot of people were very
concerned about that corporation spent
millions implementing angular and they
thought that you know would stick around
for a while and the hotness that is
angular has been fading over the last
year and a half or some or so a lot of
people have switched over to this
framework of that framework and react
has actually taken some of that Thunder
although as far as JavaScript frameworks
or concern is as far as new frameworks
are concerned mangler still is way more
popular than react but people were
concerned because angular is you know
supposed to be this Google's you know
brainchild is sponsored by Google but
they also had this polymer project which
was released just two production earlier
in 2015 hasn't really seen a whole lot
of adoption although they are using this
for a few sites but polymers approach is
different from angular and that polymer
is trying to build the entire web out of
reusable components they feel that you
know the component based system of
building a dynamic fluid UI is the way
to go to have you know isolated chunks
and for a long time we know we've seen
that with the MVC pattern with something
like Django burr it's all module based
you know what I mean so everything is
isolated it's easier to unit test and
polymer tries to fill that gap a lot of
browsers don't support it though so in
order for poly you know so mainly
polymer is like a polyfill in order to
be able to support something called a
shout
Dom where entire components can have
encapsulated meaning enclosed inside of
it CSS and JavaScript that doesn't
interfere with other components that
have their own CSS or JavaScript or
images or whatever it may be so people
were concerned that polymer might be
trying to knock off angular and and for
the most part it kind of it kind of is I
mean there's going to be a polymer can
work with angular polymer is kind of a
different direction for Google and when
we come we talk about web components and
if Google thinks that that is the
direction and the future well react has
already kind of seen that what you know
the Facebook guys they've already kind
of seen that and they've already done
that with react and react although
they're not using the shadow Dom thing
they're using something called a virtual
Dom it's still kind of the same
philosophy and it's something that
they've already been using for several
years now so you know a lot of people
saw that as a major plus towards react
being that Facebook is already kind of
envisioned what angular didn't see you
know several years ago and what Google
didn't see several years ago which has
now you know prompted them to create the
polymer project and also to kind of
redesign angular from the ground up so
so react kind of it does a lot of things
right that these other frameworks are
envious of including ember which has
recently designed their their view
system to better reflect react and they
tried it out now that they're actually
faster than react but react is more than
just speed it's also a you know like an
opinionated design philosophy for
building reusable chunks of code which
are components and if you want to
compare a component it would be very
similar to something like a jQuery
plug-in where the jQuery plug-in you had
a script and maybe you have to have like
you know four or five dependency scripts
and stuff like that and then you have
images that that plugin you know relies
upon including CSS and maybe fonts and
icons and all this crazy stuff so you
end up getting you know some there's
some you know really sloppy plugins out
there in jQuery like if you're using a
photo viewer you have to bring in like
you know 15 files and stuff like that
and then you have to instantiate and do
all kinds of you know work to get it
to actually work right and even then
there can still be problems and it can
conflict with other plugins and stuff
like that so this whole component based
system is supposed to be doing away with
that sloppy way of building websites
that we were so accustomed to over the
last time you know really since the
birth of jQuery now when it comes to
learning curve react most certainly has
angular beat by a long shot granted
react is just handling the view portion
of the MVC pattern while angular is
trying to tackle all of it you can get
up and running and react no matter what
your stack is in a matter of you know
hours or maybe you know days if you
really want to you know get going pretty
proficiently and if you want to be like
you know expert level me probably be
good to go after just several months of
using react while angular is a lot more
competent complicated a lot more
opinionated and tries to do a whole lot
more for you so there's quite a bit more
to learn when you compare react to
angular a lot of the negative publicity
surrounding angular 2 point 0 is a
little bit taken out of context
considering the fact that angular 2 is
still under heavy development and and
they they're constantly on changing
their direction but out of the gate when
angular 2 was announced like there was a
lot of people jumping off the bandwagon
before anything was even finalized so
there was a lot of bickering and arguing
within the community in fact one of the
core developers ended up leaving and
starting the array lea project which is
a now competing project with angular 2
so the javascript framework war is at an
all-time high leading into 2016 and to
be honest with you it's kind of rubbing
people the wrong way it's getting a
little bit old at this point even at
places where I've worked I've seen
competing frameworks like nobody nobody
knows what to choose because the wars is
just ongoing I mean you have you don't
even know if Google is really backing
angular or not and what their plans are
the future and you don't even know you
know how long these core members of the
angular team are going to be there
they're just so many different competing
venues in the JavaScript arena that it's
just it's mind-boggling at this point
and once again I can't express this
enough angular cannot be specifically
compared to react because be react is
more of a library as int you as jolly as
jQuery is a JavaScript library for
accomplishing you know certain things so
react can be thought of as a library
while angular is an entire web framework
so they're compare their very different
in that regard but what react does
angular also tries to do and I think
that react is just it does that portion
of what angular tries to do as far as
handling the view better and I think
there's no question about that but the
question really it comes up where it's
like okay if I do want to do an entire
angular web framework should I try to
mix react and two angular probably not i
mean angular's big enough on its own for
users have to download and run in their
client browser so you know you pretty
much have to make the decision if I'm
going to go with angular I'm probably
going to stick with angular's templating
and view system and not try to to add a
bunch of complexity there because
there's going to be enough complexity
already out of the box so really that's
it that's my opinion um I think angular
is okay I've done angular I've
integrated into Django and you know I
thought that was fine I liked the fact
that react kind of gets out of the way
of my design decisions whether I whether
or not I want to use node or Django or
ASP and for that reason because it's a
library I just have to include the file
I just found it to be much easier to
work with and I do plan on getting back
into angular 2 point 0 once it is
finalized and released and I'm curious
to see how that goes i think there are a
lot of corporations that are still
already invested in angular and some of
them are kicking themselves now some
people are jumping off of it but you
know there are you know quite a bit of
jobs out there and then angular field
and there was such an explosion of
growth that angular is not going
anywhere anytime soon even with the 2
point 0 version that conflicts with the
one point 0 so whether you choose
angular or react it's completely up to
you i would go with react and if you do
go with with angular i don't think it's
a terrible decision or anything so
that's just my opinion and thanks for
watching guys have a good day bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
