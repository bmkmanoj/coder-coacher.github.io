interesting quote today I saw it and I
just thought of a chair with you guys
and it's it's funny because both Bill
Gates and Steve Jobs they go back like
all the way to the late 70s early 80s
where there are few mainly into the
early 80s I suppose that would be the
best way to describe it and in a lot of
people think that automatically Bill
Gates was like more successful than
Steve Jobs but it was a time where Steve
Jobs was running Apple in the early
1980s where he was one of the most
famous business persons alive I mean he
was still in his 20s it was worth you
know definitely there are tens of
millions if not hundreds of millions at
that point and the Apple was worth about
a billion dollars so he was words a you
know pretty good portion of that so and
Bill Gates in the early 80s like he was
doing a building software Microsoft was
building was a 30 million dollar a year
company it was building software for
apples Apple 2 computer as well as for
the new up-and-coming Macintosh that
Steve Jobs was working on that it would
end up you know making you know Apple
quite famous on it but during that time
what if I'm really interesting is like
Steve Jobs and all his um his motivation
you know being artsy and doing a lot of
acid and everything while he was at
college like it was it was it was a lot
of turmoil and everything while they
were working on the Macintosh project so
this is like during a time where a
couple of Apple products had come out
and in the market they were they were
being tested by IBM also you know
companies like you know and there were
other PC makers and Microsoft wasn't
really into the operating system at the
time but they were building things like
Word and Excel and things so they were
working with Apple but it did the reason
why I breve and bring this up I just
thought it was funny is because of a
quote that Bill Gates um once said now
the whole thing just to give a little
bit of a background though the GUI that
would end up becoming you know what was
in the Macintosh and what you know
really people credit Apple for
revolutionising although they didn't
come
but it was really the GUI which is
graphical user interface so it's hard to
fathom now but there was a time where
like we didn't have any sort of
understanding of clicking on icons
clicking and dragging things overlapping
each other held we didn't even have an
understanding of like rolling a mouse
wheel across the screen and things like
that the GUI was something that Steve
Jobs was able to get his hands on by
visiting the Xerox facility and actually
seeing what they had built but they they
get credit for building the first
graphical user interface really and when
Steve Jobs got ahold of it like she
immediately knew that that's where he
won't you know the direction that he
wanted to go with Apple it was the
future direction and things like that
and then you know it would end up giving
way to like here's the Macintosh when it
was finally released in 1984 you can see
like it basically it's a precursor to
what we have now with Windows and I
remember back in the days of using like
Windows 3.1 but it's just interesting so
the quote I was going to mention you
guys basically in 1904 the release of
the Macintosh around relates to the
Macintosh Bill Gates shifted Microsoft's
development over to the autumn what
would become Windows and then that's
pretty interesting because you know they
weren't doing any sort of graphical user
interface or operating system right
anything like that but when Steve Jobs
caught wind of Bill Gates working on
this he called Bill Gates down to
Cupertino California to the Apple
headquarters where basically Steve Jobs
ripped him a new one for about two days
straight and at one point he said like
you're ripping us off and and then Bill
Gates end up end up responding with
qualities like well Steve I think
there's more than one way of looking at
it I think it's more like we both had
this rich neighborhood named Xerox and I
broke into his house to steal a TV set
and found out you had already stolen it
so they both attribute the fact that you
know that Xerox was there their
motivation to build the the modern-day
graphical user interface
you know gives us the iPads and
obviously windows and everything from
tablets to gaming systems everything it
changed really everything and we
probably would have headed in that
direction eventually anyway because I
can't imagine the masses you know even
in today's society using command lines
like I do when I'm using my putty system
and things like that for my linux server
I don't I don't see us using get bashes
and stuff to get a lot of stuff done
these days clicking and dragging and
things like that just immediately make
it easier and another example of that is
at one point in the 80s as well the
Steve Jobs went to visit and I an artist
in New York City who happened to know
Mick Jagger who is the lead singer of
the Rolling Stones and and at one point
Steve Jobs met with Mick Jagger and gave
him one of the Macintosh computers and
was like trying to show them and even
show them showing them how you could
draw on the computer screen and
everything and um apparently Mick Jagger
either was like too stoned or just
unimpressed or just didn't understand it
because it was such a new thing at the
time but his daughter immediately took
to it and things like that so it's just
interesting business but these you know
these modern easy to use computer
interfaces they've always liked you know
the children like children younger
people they've always had an easier time
kind of you know using these things just
because it's not something it you know
it seems like you would think that it's
new to both of you so it'd be just as
easy for either one to pick up and learn
but some people you know obviously get
set in their ways and things like that
and I think children just kind of take
to electronics and everything a little
bit easier but it's kind of a side note
but it really did the entire purpose of
this video is just simply that you can
take somebody else's idea and make it
better in fact that's what most people
do with almost everything it's not like
anybody comes up with some truly
revolutionized new idea to do something
like that so on the same token like you
always have that person that's like I
got this great idea and it's just dating
app or you can like follow chicks around
and see where they are when you know and
you can stop them you know and you're
like thinking out
terrible idea of it then somebody's
going to put some sort of no more
legalized spin on it and maybe it's some
way to actually be able to hit on hot
chicks like who knows I don't know but
the fact the matter is like there's new
products that are always being developed
sometimes they're just a small step
ahead of the previous products and for
that reason we're all just kind of
gouging at each other's eyes trying to
come up with the next big thing and it
takes a shitload of luck and it takes a
shitload of knowing the right people but
you know I've always said you could be a
thorn in somebody started like sides
like okay you know you probably probably
have to pick and choose your battles
like you know you're probably not going
to build a search engine that's better
than what Google is able to do maybe you
can maybe you find another unique little
spin on it but Google found a unique
spin and they were able to turn
themselves into a massive giant nowadays
I feel like the time is right for
something to change in the search engine
market we all think that Oh Google gives
us the best results because Google just
gives us everything we need on page one
and two well it's everything we think we
need because we don't know what we don't
know
you know they we don't just think about
that we don't know what we don't know
Google's entire search results man the
games you have to play in order for your
website to be seen the fact that you can
have it like you could have a tremendous
in video website with unique content
everything like that and you're still
not going to be seen well how would you
know that well you wouldn't know that
much to actually go out and build
websites that are never seen that's how
you know that that kind of exists
and it may not be the best thing but the
problem is that you have gatekeepers
that control what is seen and what isn't
seen and that's one of the reasons what
I kind of speak out against sites like
Reddit and Stack Overflow and even some
of these other sites where you have all
these gatekeepers that can control all
of the content and I understand they're
trying to battle you know they're trying
to battle there's a pirate's and the you
know the trolls and out there but
the thing is like you know the pickings
are I think ripe for something better to
come along eventually because Google has
dominated this search
market for decades now and once again we
don't know what we don't know the
Internet has brought us a lot of
tremendous vast wealth of knowledge but
even my youtube channel like I would
like more people to find my YouTube
channels at all possible I worked my ass
off to try to get this YouTube channel
to get the amount of views that I've had
and stuff like that maybe it shouldn't
have taken that long I don't know man
maybe it should have taken longer maybe
they've given me a huge break I don't
know I but I do think that somebody
eventually is going to come along
they're going to make something a little
bit better there may even just be a more
revolutionised way to research and
and that we interact with each other
maybe that new thing is augmented
reality or virtual reality or 3d
printing like you I mean I don't know
man it could be anywhere but you always
want to be keeping your eye out because
sometimes that that our that that
idea that spark was invented by somebody
else ten years ago and just never got
off the ground so keep that in my gut
