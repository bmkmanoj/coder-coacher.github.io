installed let's go ahead and try to just
do the Django admin command just to make
sure that's working so when you type
that you should be able to see all this
stuff here so that's good that means
Django's installs that's good way to
know all right now let's go ahead and
create our first project inside of this
directory that we were in previously I'm
gonna build a directory in here that I
want to store our project and um this
may not even be I started doesn't think
about this previously I'm actually gonna
have a new directory inside my projects
directory for our tutorial and that's
where I'll put my door here I guess I'm
gonna put the project inside my projects
directory and I have a movie development
because my regular site is movie so
there's gonna be kind of like an
alternate test environment for the movie
site so I'm gonna call a movie develop
the Eevee
and now that we have that there is a bug
with virtual environment when you're
trying to use Django admin normally you
should be able to say Django admin start
project and we're gonna call it my
project but you're gonna see it doesn't
work and it's reason why is there's a
bug with virtual environment so we have
to actually spill out the entire path to
virtual environment so I have to go
Python see pulling forward slash
actually the back slash I'm gonna say
projects plates on movie plays on movie
scripts and then to Django admin Qi and
then when I say start project my project
I'm gonna spelled this wrong there's a
Python moving no it is all right that
we're excited spell down wrong so now
maybe your computer doesn't do that but
I think it's a virtual environment bug
where I just can't find the virtual
environment Django admin that you're
looking for so you have to kind of spell
out is that exactly where that Django
admin is located so the star project
function actually works now by doing
that you created this directory my
project the name of our application and
inside here you have a manager a py file
so everything you're gonna do is most
likely gonna be inside this manage that
py file then in my project file we're
managing our py is located inside here
you actually have the my project module
of your application and this is a
particularly has settings URLs and
what's the G file so anyway all that is
installed and working properly in the
next video we're gonna go ahead and get
into how we go ahead and set up our
application from here so I just want to
keep it short and sweet this is how we
create a Django admin project using
virtual environment and we'll get
started in the next video as well thank
you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
