we talked about tuples and how they're
related to lists and blah blah blah
now we're actually gonna get into a new
value type which is third value type
that I was holding off on explaining
because I felt like there there needed
to be a little bit more explanation
instead of just glossing over them very
quickly and one of the important ones is
actually called the dictionary in some
language is a dictionary which all it
means is a key and a value and the key
is what you actually reference to get
the value so it's like you know you go
into a dictionary and you look up a word
your word is your key the definition is
your value that's why Python calls it a
dictionary which is actually a better
word than what other languages call a
hash array or an associative array like
in Perl the Perl programming languages
calls it an associative array I believe
Python makes it a little bit easier when
they just say dictionary and the way you
create one is just use these curly
braces so you use these little curly
braces and you're going to see that it's
a dict which is short for dictionary
dictionaries have keys and values well
I'll just say key and then you separate
the key in the value by colon on a value
so what if I said okay print the value
of what is this it's gonna print
everything and it's gonna perfect not
print it in dictionary form so you have
the little curly braces there now if I
said I just want the value here how do I
look it up well you look it up by key so
I'm gonna pass in inside instead of an
index integer saying you know we're in
this your dictionary this value lives
I'm actually giving it a key a unique
key that can be looked up
to return a value and you'll see it
returns I'm a value and if we did once
again the type of that it's going to
return a string because I'm a value as a
string and if I took that out and I made
an int I can make it an int just fine
keys can actually be an int and I can
say give me the look up by int and we'll
do the same thing I'll change this back
I'm you know and instead of the type
since you guys know that they can just
return the types that they are based on
the lookup you can see it works the
exact same way so your key can be you
know an int or it can be a string but
we'll say Chris Hawkes Chris Hawkes is a
cool guy but only decent programming so
that's two key value so I look up once
again I say how am I going to find the
value that I'm looking for and I passed
Chris Hawkes and you might be like well
the values right there why do I need to
do all that work just pass by your
dictionary could have millions of
records it can be an entire Webster
dictionary with millions of values if I
want to add multiple values to this
dictionary you can put them on a new
line like I just did but you separate
them by the colon so this will be a new
value you you guys are great before
watching this video
so we'll give it a new value of you and
you see it returns you guys are great
for watching this video anyway your your
dictionary can be huge once again it can
be as big as you want it to be you're
gonna see that in Django a lot if you
ever get into the web development there
anytime you need to have something where
you can predictably predictably you know
look up something like for instance a
band right so I'll say Bayside which is
my favorite band and then they're from
Queens New York that's where they're
from but you know what this is actually
about it example see I would actually
have my variable name Bayside which is
the name of the band and the Bayside I
could say origin so instead of this I'm
going to say origin and we'll get rid of
this bottom one down here and then we'll
go ahead and give it a John row as well
and if I want to go ahead and just I can
print multiple values that I'll just say
Plus should probably put one of those
newline characters that we were talking
about before so I could do that in here
and really I'd probably want to do
something like this
origin plus and then genre plus so you
can see I add the extra space there so
the formatting will be good and when you
look at this you'll see you know two
separate lines origin Queens New York
genre alternative so that's why you know
key values are good because I want to be
able to predictably say okay I'm looking
for the origin for this band object well
I know how to find the origin because
there's a key that says origin that
gives me the actual origin I'm looking
for there's a key for genre that gives
me the drama that I'm looking for we
talked about lists and one of the
previous videos I could say list of
bands and then I could put in baseline
now one of the things that I was also
telling you about his programs are read
from top to bottom left to right I'm
actually referencing Bayside before it's
actually found before it's what's called
instantiated meaning created it's not
there yet I need to actually define
Bayside before I try to call it and add
it to a list because Python didn't know
what I was referring to list of bands is
not divine no I'm sorry this needs to
say equal I'm silly and and I probably
didn't even give you guys a chance to
actually see what the error would be
Python is a language that's interpreted
top to bottom left to right so this is
gonna break see Bayside is not defined
and that's actually what I want to show
you before I didn't realize I didn't
have the equal sign there but if I
declare Bayside before I try to use it
and so I'm instantiating it meaning I'm
creating this thing I there was nothing
before and now there's a Bayside object
which is a dictionary
then I create my list and I say assign
that dictionary object to the list of
bands and when I run that you can see
that and most likely I mean most likely
you to have like a band objects really
and you probably have like something
like name like everything's lowercase so
I'll do that so really you'd have
something like that that way we could
print the name and all that stuff
because we'll get into into this more in
the future here but when we have our our
objects we're going to be creating
objects using object-oriented
programming to predictably pass values
around so that we know how to use them
and that's something for a later video
because honestly it confuses newcomers
for the language and you don't need to
jump into it right away but you can see
the importance of key value and that's
why we're talking about dictionaries
here so I don't want to get too much off
on a tangent here but that is the the
Python dictionary in Python 3.5 all
right guys thanks for watching once
again and I'll get into some more videos
here in the future</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
