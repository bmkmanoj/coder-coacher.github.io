morning so I'm talking about web
development steps in 2017 so I said this
is a guide this is actually something
that I just kind of brainstormed
together with really laying out the
exact same the exact steps not only that
I took to become a web developer several
years ago which still applies to today
but also to kind of lay out in addition
to some of these things that I've
learned that I've kind of jumped around
about like I would say that I learned
CSS and things like that but this is
ultimately the exact order that I
learned most of the stuff when I was
getting started and it had I'd you know
had this guide I probably would have
followed this stuff you know these steps
you know forbade them one by one because
it still applies to 2017 but just as
much as I did back when I was getting
started so first things first is this
seems so simple but a lot of people are
like where do I get started so you're
creating a website the first thing you
need to do is you need to have space on
your computer in order to store it your
your data and your data is going to be
HTML pages and it's going to be other
stuff that we talk about in here but
just create a folder and another thing
too is that you put some thought into it
too because you're going to have a lot
of different projects and you're going
to end up being like oh I remember I was
working on that music site now I don't
remember where I stored it on my
computer so you know do yourself a favor
and just find you know a particular
project you should have one folder on
your like C Drive on your computer and
then you should have all your projects
under that or something that that's what
I would recommend just make sure you but
you have some sort of standard for how
you store your folders for your projects
so you need an editor I say get visual
studio code and this isn't a requirement
so I said if you have preferences other
than visual studio code that's fine but
if you're just getting started web
development and you don't have a text
editor to actually write your code in I
recommend Visual Studio code because
it's the best text editor I've seen in
quite some time in fact it's more than
just a text editor it can be used for
integrated development environment
stuff as well so stepping through your
code and that stuff that you'll end up
needing as you get into really complex
programming months down the road so
Visual Studio code here is a it's free
for Windows and any other platform
actually but you can install all these
different little plugins that make your
life easier so here's all these
different programming languages like C
sharp and Python and chrome will Chrome
is just a debugger for making web
development easier but a neo go and C
and C++ so the point is that you get all
this fancy styling you get a number
lines and things like that because
technically you can write code writing
your notepad of windows but you probably
want to kill yourself after going that
for like a couple days because it would
be miserable
so these text editors they add styling
in colors and they can even inform you
when you're typing something wrong and
you know even give you suggestions on
what it is that you're trying to do so
that's the reason why you want an editor
in 2017 so the next step is you want to
learn HTML so that is eesti starting the
founding block of any sort of web
development no matter what anybody may
say HTML is very very relevant you have
to understand what it is it's not even a
programming language but it's a markup
assistant syntax but browsers read HTML
and they end up rendering things based
off of HTML so we use additional tools
on top of that that we're going to talk
about to manipulate how the browser
displays things but ultimately a browser
knows how to display HTML and there's no
magic to it or anything like that you
learn HTML syntax you're going to need
it no matter where you are in web
development it does not matter you
absolutely have to have it so I said in
your project folder spend some time you
know understanding how when an anchor
tag is which is a link and how to link
one of your HTML pages to another page
so obviously store your HTML pages in
the same folder that I said in step one
of this this guide so I said how do you
learn HTML well you can buy a book on it
if you want some people are book
learners some people like to go to
websites on and learn like our YouTube
tutorials I have YouTube tutorials on
the subject I have my hipster cocom and
there's a million other ones out there
and many that are probably much
than what I'm doing so just um figure
out what it is that you're comfortable
with I also recommended the w3c website
because they've been around for a long
time and for HTML it's rather basic and
as far as how the demonstrations are
laid out so it's really you know it's
sufficient enough in order to learn in
my opinion so the next one this one's a
little bit tough because people are
going to try to skip and jump through
this as quickly as possible but you want
to learn CSS so I've talked about in
previous videos the CSS is very very
relevant and then you need to understand
it now you don't have to be a master at
it because a lot of cases you're gonna
end up using like templates and things
that are out there for you you just need
to know enough to to be able to you know
change them to your liking and things
like that but then if you really want to
be a cutting-edge designer or you know
be able to take those themes or even
create your own themes and things like
that you have to be a master at CSS you
have to know it very very well so I said
you know spend quite a bit of time
making those HTML pages and changing the
colors the layouts understand the
differences between inline and external
style sheets and also make sure you
understand the box model which is how
containers can be positioned using
floats also margins padding's
which is all part of the box model but
absolute versus relative positioning is
all those things are very very important
and CSS and if you don't understand it
you're gonna have hard times and any
sort of web development do you do so the
next step is to learn photoshop so i've
been i've been using adobe photoshop
since I got started um now I'm not an
expert in Photoshop because there
there's like thousand page book so you
can have in order to be like this great
artist on Photoshop but that is not
really necessary for a web developer but
there are things that you need to do
like oh you're like oh I need this to be
on the transparent background alright I
need to be able to resize this and make
it you know sort of save it you know for
for web development purposes so you
don't have like a three Meg image on
your website things like that so it's
really important the Photoshop plays a
big part in all my web development needs
now there are free alternatives like
GIMP but they're not
very good compared to photoshop like
Photoshop is the best an industry
standard and by a long shot so I say you
don't need a master Photoshop so I've
kind of already talked talked on that
you don't have to learn everything in
that thousand page book or even do some
of the crazy stuff that that you do with
different like layers and masks and
stuff like that you probably don't have
to deal with a lot of that and just
basic web development so next one is to
learn Java skipper scripts so I say
spend time writing raw and vanilla
JavaScript right into the HTML pages
that you've been working on to this
point so understand how Java Script is
being being rendered as I was saying
have it load time so JavaScript has time
so you can display an actual time right
in the browser also you can redirect
using JavaScript and be able to move
data around as well so you need to have
a lot of I think those founding
principles to understand how JavaScript
is looking at pieces of your HTML page
so this is a complicated step because
learning JavaScript could literally take
you anywhere from you know one year to
five to ten to be a true master of it so
you don't need to to be an absolute
master I don't think in this step before
moving on to the next one especially if
you try to keep things simple for your
website but we'll talk about that more
in just a moment so after learning
JavaScript I was saying at that point
you need to learn jQuery because jQuery
is still around no matter what people
say jQuery made our lives easier and
modern day JavaScript is making our
lives more difficult so jQuery still
does a lot of the things you need to do
very very easy so you don't need to use
angular and react in order to display
some Ajax data from a web server like
it's not necessary you're doing your
overkill at that point but jQuery still
makes your life easier for most little
things and also some pretty complicated
things as well so I think you definitely
shouldn't learn jQuery in 2017 learn how
to use jQuery to replace what it is he
did with your bra and vanilla JavaScript
and then maybe take it a little bit
further to just learn some of the more
popular features of jQuery like hiding
and showing up containers and thing
like that so the next one is to learn a
server-side language so there's all
kinds of options here server-side
languages are going to be the language
that is running on the server that ends
up saying hey I need to go to a database
or hey I need to display this page
because they visited this URL and all
that stuff that's all done by a
server-side language so there's many
different languages like C sharp Java
Python PHP Ruby JavaScript which uses
known any bunch more that you can choose
from I always use C sharp or Python
I'm just day-to-day but there's nothing
wrong with Java Ruby or PHP and no GS is
also pretty damn awesome too so you pick
one of those though and some people
choose no just simply based on the fact
that they can use JavaScript to interact
with it so you don't have to learn
another language and that can save your
development time so either way though
you need to learn enough about the
syntax in order to before moving on to
the next step so once again you don't to
be an expert programmer and you
shouldn't try to cram everything in in
like a weekend or a week and plain and
simple if somebody says that they learn
a programming language and like a matter
of a couple days and they're really just
an idiot and unfortunately they don't
know that they're an idiot but they will
end up you can't possibly learn how to
master a programming language and
understand the community well enough to
be able to jump in and design some of
the best projects that are in that
community without years of experience in
most cases so don't try to cram it just
take it one step at a time and and know
that you want to be a master at it so I
have a cold so learn sequel using a
norman dorm is an object relational
mapper so it's a known as a norm but raw
sequel has been used since the 1970s or
even go on that I don't know but being a
sequel developer is very important if
you want to be a sequel developer so
you're writing raw sequel but it's an
ugly ass language that's been around for
a long time and object relational mapper
z' makes sequel much easier to deal with
so languages like C sharp has entity
framework so you're writing sequel and
entity framework instead of raw sequel
python has a django object
mapper for the Django framework if
you're using that and then there's
sequel alchemy which is used by a lot of
other popular Python frameworks like
blast and things like that but
ultimately you're writing sequel in a
different way in a more user-friendly
way and really that's all you need to do
for a lot of full stack web development
and then by the time you need to raw
some write some raw sequel you can end
up looking up and you know being able to
help but I wouldn't spend a ton of time
trying to be a sequel master unless you
really want to be a sequel developer so
yeah that definitely I learned enough
about sequel though in order to be able
to communicate with a database using
whatever sort of server-side language
that you chose now the next step is then
to learn a web framework so the web
framework is going to end up helping you
build a website and all the code that's
necessary for a website to work so
depending on whatever server-side
language each show is that's going to be
the framework that you chose so if you
chose nodejs and you're going to use
javascript you're going to use something
like Express j/s or sales if you're
using Python then your new use Django or
flask the idea with the web framework
though is to learn enough to be able to
use the framework in order to deliver
all the HTML pages that you design in
the first steps and getting all that
stuff to just intertwine together in
order to have all your JavaScript or CSS
and HTML running and all based off of a
web framework that is delivering that
content so there's going to be
instructions and whatever sort of web
framework do you choose but having all
this prior knowledge leading up to that
point is going to help you so much when
it comes to understanding how to
actually tie all that stuff together the
next step is you want to buy a domain
name a domain name is like youtube.com
or Chris Hawkes or my hipster code com
so you buy a domain name I always go to
GoDaddy for whatever reason I just I
find their user interface very easy to
buy their domain and then all I don't
host with them I just simply take their
domain and point it to my web host but
using GoDaddy it's just easier for me
but there's also like one in one I
believe
another one and I'm going to throw some
links in the description tab below so
you can actually check those out for you
know links that I recommend for
companies that actually sell domains
even by hosting packages from them if
you want but my personal host of choices
and the next step I said by a web host
so you can use one of those domain name
companies to host your web application I
use the note for all my websites but
digitalocean is just as awesome some
people might want to go to the cloud
like a more traditional cloud provider
like Amazon AWS but it's going to be
more complicated and more expensive and
then Microsoft Azure as well would be a
Microsoft option so I said this is a
personal decision it really depends on
you know the type of project you're
trying to make if it's just simply a
website like that doesn't change very
often or that you don't plan on getting
a ton of traffic then you probably just
want to deal with a shared host like
webfaction but if you plan on getting a
couple hundred thousand views a month or
in a week or something like that you
probably want a virtual private hosting
you would use something like OneNote or
digital ocean or like I said Amazon AWS
or Azure but that that's like an
entirely separate video discussion I
think on the options there now I said
once you have your web host install FTP
tool like files though a lot of people
don't know about FileZilla but it makes
some transporting files from your
computer to the web host much easier I
think it's a user friendly format for me
I find it easier some people will be
like well you can just use get well you
can but you're using a command line to
do get commands and it's not to me it's
not as clear I just like the the actual
user interface layout of FileZilla feel
like I can reason about what's going on
much easier because I can see in my
folder in real time oh yeah uploaded
this file to the wrong folder and
that happens all the time by the way so
deploy your code to the web host now
this is going to be the nightmare where
you end up you know depending on what
type of setup you have but this could
take a while you know if you're using
your own virtual private host and all
this other stuff but deploying all that
code that you've written and all these
steps leading up to this time to the web
server so that everything is then
visible to the internet you know to
anybody around the world they can
finally see your code and everything you
know this is when you finally have
something to show on your resume to say
I own this website and I fully manage it
and created it I'm a full-stack
developer because that website obviously
in most cases is going to have a
database it's going to have you have to
set up like you're like a singer host so
there you're gonna have to figure out
you want to use Apache or nginx or
something like that but it you know
there's a lot involved in that final
step but once you get that done there's
a lot of satisfaction than knowing that
you're a website developer and that you
have something online that people can
see to say hey I built that you know so
it's extremely important I think and all
things considered I think that you can
get websites and do all these steps and
literally a matter of new weeks really
but you know fully understanding it to
the point where you feel like you can
bake a website and do these steps over
and over again and a day or something
like that then you know that I think
takes years it really does but we'll see
but I mean there's definitely the best
way is by learning and doing and this is
honestly like the exact steps that I
would follow today and that in most
cases I followed mostly you know back
getting started but a lot of it was you
know just me learning the hard way okay
I need to do this I need to do that
anyway you're getting straight from the
horse's mouth because I've been I've
been developing websites now since 2009
so about seven years and anyway let me
know what you guys think make sure you
subscribe motive a video and share also
this video is sponsored by deaf mountain
coding boot camp so they are my sponsor
make sure you guys check them out the
descriptions and the the will the link
is in the description tab below so check
those guys out they have courses actual
on on-site courses that are both 12 and
16 week courses which can be online and
also can be on on their actual location
they're based out of Provo Utah but they
also have locations in both Dallas and
Addison and there
taming the growth writing new
technologies so they're actually
focusing on the technologies of the here
and now so they're focusing on things
like nodejs and angular and react and
the point is is that they're trying to
get enough information and es you'll be
able to land that first full-time gig to
get more experience in and you know the
industry itself so definitely check out
Gov Melton they're one of the top-rated
coding boot camps available right now so
thanks for watching guys you have a good
day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
