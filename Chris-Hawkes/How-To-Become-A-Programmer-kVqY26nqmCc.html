quick tip from programmer to programmer
as far as what you should do and
shouldn't do is if you're trying to get
your foot in the door as a programmer I
just so I just kind of thought of this
I'm not even sure how legitimate or
valid you know this point is but one of
the things I want to mention is that any
sort of programmer if you're spending
the time and you're not going through
the computer science route and you're
trying to get into the industry and say
you're teaching yourself it's probably
advisable that you have some sort of
stack overflow account that you're using
not only to just you know to ask
questions but also to answer other
people's questions to try to build up a
score I don't actually contribute nearly
enough but I do have my actual user
account which goes by my real name which
a lot of the you know top users do use
their real name like even the Python
creator guido van rossum is on here so
you can see if you type him in here so
even you know the Python creator is
going by his real name so we go and we
look at the users on this site I mean
some of these top users I mean these are
some of the best programmers in the
world and there's really no way of
denying it somebody like them you know
jon skeet here I mean this guy knows
more c-sharp in Java than than anybody I
could possibly imagine possibly more
than the guy who created c-sharp himself
so I mean he's just super genius but
Hugo's by his real name and I have a
point here behind that in just a moment
so the bottom line is when you look at
you know these guys like all these these
top programmers not all of them use
their real name some have like an air of
mystery about him which is really weird
like there's this one guy that
contributes to the WebGL community and
he's obviously like on a next level of
genius and he doesn't actually use his
real name which i find interesting but a
lot of these guys that actually spent a
lot of time helping other programmers I
mean they have named so anybody in C
sharp nose jon skeet i mean the guys
doing tutorials and he's writing books
and stuff like that and
he's also the top he's approaching 1
million points on stack overflow which
is a going to be a record but he's
clearly in the lead and then you have
like Alex Martelli he's also a writer
and author of several Python books and
he's big in the Python community same
with a Marten Pieters here as well and I
mean both of those guys I mean top level
geniuses so my point being behind all
this is that you should have a stack
overflow account and you should have it
in your own name now that being said
when you're a noob and you're just
starting out you're going to ask a lot
of probably very unprofessional or very
you know noobish questions so it's you
know I'm of the opinion that you should
probably have a second stack overflow
account one that you ask dumb questions
on and the other one that you're using
to actually build up your profile and
your score under your real name because
you know that may end up coming back to
haunt you I don't have heard of actual
people getting asked on their interviews
what their stack overflow of scores so I
haven't personally run into that but
I've heard of that so it's really not
even that big of a deal but but to be
honest with you like I don't ask dumb
questions on this profile anymore
because this stack overflow community
can be vicious I mean if you have
something like I mean you could be like
an expert Python God you ask a dumb
c-sharp question next thing you know you
got like ten down votes and people
calling you an idiot basically and you
know their own way and nobody wants that
under their own name because then you
feel like you have to defend yourself
but if you have a second account where
you just ask questions I me don't care
what these people think you don't care
what they've a downvote you or not so i
think that's beneficial so anyway my
next point is that you probably want to
go ahead and make sure that you get set
up on github I don't have a lot of
activity on github either I I did write
this project actually no not that
project sorry I wrote one because that
project didn't work for me but I wrote
on Jango easy avatar which really needs
to be improved a lot but I wrote it for
a simple use case that I had and then I
didn't make it really extensible and now
if I got download a bunch of times and
i'm not sure if anybody's using
or not but I have you know at least
contributed the Django project before
and stuff like that so it's always good
to make sure that you do have some sort
of github profile and then you know
focus on trying to contribute to the
project even if it's you know minor
things like you know like updating like
maybe spelling that might be messed up
on a website or something like that all
that source code is going to be in
github and you can contribute to all of
it so before you can even do that though
you have to make sure you learn the
ropes of github and how it works and how
repositories work in general so it's
something that you would definitely be
able to benefit from if you go into some
sort of production programming
environment because you're going to be
using some sort of stores source control
to work with other developers so github
is a good way to to just get your foot
right in the door there if you're able
to get involved in like a project like
say you're a Python guy and let's look
at like to say you're a big Python guy
and all or a django guy really and then
you have a django rest framework right
i'm not sure if it's gonna be able to
find this here but so jangle rest
framework writes those guys Tom Christie
right so he wrote this Jango even
contributed like 10,000 or 12,000 bucks
or something like that so that he could
update his own library to make it more
compatible with the newer versions of
Django because Django didn't really have
a great rest will API tasty pie was the
other one and that one was actually last
I heard actually I JumpShip a couple
years ago on at least a year ago or more
because apparently it wasn't actually
set up to work with Python 3 at all and
the offer had no intentions on updating
it so I'm not sure if that's changed or
not but there was a concern in the genco
community that we weren't focusing
enough on a restful api so that gave
rise to django rest framework really
taken places the number one but it
needed an overhaul so it was such an
important project that Django is
mentioning it on their their homepage
Django's used by obviously you know
billion dollar companies out there from
my Pinterest Instagram and all the other
stuff and this guy Tom Christie I mean
he essentially could get a job anywhere
he wants because I mean all he's got to
say as I wrote during a risk framework
and anybody's gonna hire anybody that
has anything to do with Django or Python
is going to hire them now I don't know
how long this guy's been programming but
I know he's good he's got to be to be
where he's at but there's no reason why
you can't make yourself like an integral
part of this particular community I mean
you have to read the source code you're
going to have to hack away at you're
going to break it on your own to really
understand it but you know say you're
able to contribute and you'd become one
of the top contributors it doesn't
matter that you didn't write the project
you could still be like I'm one of the
core developers of you know Django rest
framework with Tom Percy or whatever and
this is just an example but it's getting
harder and harder for self-taught
programmers to get out there and get
their foot in the door but these are the
ways they actually can get that done now
anybody nowadays can can set up a blog
or website or wordpress site and blog
about this and that and that's just not
going to work anymore if you build
websites from scratch maybe you have a
beautiful-looking blog I mean that might
be a pretty good credential but you know
nobody cares about a bootstrap template
that you're using and some sort of blog
or something like that it's just not
enough anymore so this is all just my
advice on how new aspiring programmers
might be able to take advantage of some
of the popular websites and tools out
there to help them get their foot in the
door all right well that's about it it's
all I got to say tonight so thanks for
watching guys have a good day bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
