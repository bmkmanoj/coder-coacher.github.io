quick tip from programmer to programmer
as far as what you should do and
shouldn't do is if you're trying to get
your foot in the door as a programmer I
just I just kind of thought of this I'm
not even sure how legitimate or valid
you know this point is but one of the
things I want to mention is any sort of
programmer if you're spending the time
and you're not going through the
computer science route and you're trying
to get into the industry and say you're
teaching yourself it's probably
advisable that you have some sort of
Stack Overflow account that you're using
not only to just you know to ask
questions but also to answer other
people's questions to try to build up a
score I don't actually contribute nearly
enough but I do have my actual user
account which goes by my real name which
a lot of the you know top users do use
their their real name like even the
Python creator Guido van Rossum is on
here so you can see if you type him in
here so even you know the Python Creator
is going by his real name so when we go
and we look at the users on on this site
I mean some of these top users I mean
these are some of the best programmers
in the world and there's really no way
of denying it somebody like um you know
John skeet here I mean this guy knows
more c-sharp and Java than than anybody
I could possibly imagine possibly more
than the guy who created c-sharp himself
so I mean he's just you know super
genius but he goes by his real name and
I have a point here behind that in just
a moment so the bottom line is when you
look at you know these guys like all
these these top programmers not all of
them use their real name some have like
an air of mystery about them which is
really weird like there's this one guy
that contributes to the WebGL community
and he's obviously like on the next
level of genius and he doesn't actually
use this real name which I find
interesting but a lot of these guys that
actually spend a lot of time helping
other programmers I mean they have name
so anybody in c-sharp knows John Skeet I
mean the guys doing tutorials and he's
writing books and stuff like that and
he's also the the top you know he's
approaching 1 million points on
stackoverflow which is gonna be a record
but he's clearly in the lead and then
you have like Alex Martelli he's also a
writer and author of several Python
books and he's big in the Python
community same with Martin Peters here
as well and I mean both of those guys I
mean top level geniuses so my point
being behind all this is that you should
have a Stack Overflow account and you
should have it in your own name now that
being said when you're a noob and you're
just starting out you're gonna ask a lot
of probably very unprofessional or very
you know noobish questions so it's you
know I'm of the opinion that you should
probably have a second Stack Overflow
account one that you ask dumb questions
on and the other one that you're using
to actually build up your profile and
your score under your real name because
you know that may end up coming back to
haunt you I I don't I have heard of
actual people getting asked on their
interviews and what their Stack Overflow
of scores so I haven't personally run
into that but I've heard of that so it's
really not even that big of a deal but
but to be honest with you like I don't
ask dumb questions on this profile
anymore because this Stack Overflow
community can be vicious I mean if you
have something like I mean you could be
like an expert Python guy and you ask a
dumb C sharp question and next thing you
know you got like 10 down votes and
people calling you an idiot basically
and you know their own way and nobody
wants that under their own name because
then you feel like you have to defend
yourself but if you have a second
account where you just ask questions I
mean you don't care what these people
think you don't care what they if they
don't vote you or not so I think that's
beneficial so anyway my next point is
that you probably want to go ahead and
make sure that you get set up on github
I don't have a lot of activity on github
either I did write this project actually
known that that project I'm sorry I
wrote 1 because that project didn't work
for me but I wrote it on Django easy
avatar which really needs to be improved
a lot but I wrote it for a simple use
case that I had and then I didn't make
it really extensible and now if I got
downloaded a bunch of times and I'm not
sure if anybody's using
or not but I have you know at least
contributed the Django project before
and stuff like that so it's always good
to make sure that you do have some sort
of github profile and then you know
focus on trying to contribute to the
project even if it's you know minor
things like you know like updating like
maybe spelling that might be messed up
on a website or something like that all
that source code is gonna be in github
and you can contribute to all of it so
before you can even do that though you
have to make sure you learn the ropes of
github and how it works and and how
repositories work in general so it's
something that you would definitely be
able to benefit from if you go into some
sort of production programming
environment because you're gonna be
using some sort of stores source control
to work with other developers so github
is a good way to just get your foot
right in the door there if you're able
to get involved in like a project like
say you're a Python guy and let's look
at like so say you're a big Python guy
and you're a Django guy really and then
you have an Django rest framework right
I'm not sure if it's gonna be able to
find this here but so Django rest
framework right those guys I'm Christie
right so he wrote this Django even
contributed like 10,000 or 12,000 bucks
or something like that so that he could
update his own library to make it more
compatible with the newer versions of
Django
because Django didn't really have a
great rest will API tasty pie was the
other one and that one was actually last
I heard actually I jumped ship a couple
years ago on at least a year ago or more
because apparently it wasn't actually
set up to work with Python 3 at all and
and the author had no intentions on
updating it so I'm not sure if that's
changed or not but there was a concern
in the jank of community that we weren't
focusing enough on a restful api so that
gave rise to Django rest framework
really taking places and number one but
it needed an overhaul so it was such an
important project that Django is
mentioning it on their their home page
Django is used by obviously you know
billion-dollar companies out there from
my Pinterest Instagram and all the other
stuff and this guy Tom Christie I mean
he essentially could get a job anywhere
once because I mean all he's got to say
is I wrote Django rest framework and
anybody's gonna hire anybody that has
anything to do with Django or Python
he's gonna hire him now I don't know how
long this guy's been programming but I
know he's good he's got to be to be
where he's at but there's no reason why
you can't make yourself like an integral
part of this particular community I mean
you have to read the source code you're
gonna have to hack away you're gonna
have to break it on your own to really
understand it but you know say you're
able to contribute and you'd become one
of the top contributors it doesn't
matter that you didn't write the project
you could still be like I'm one of the
core developers of you know Django rest
framework with Tom Percy or whatever and
this is just an example but it's getting
harder and harder for self-taught
programmers to get out there and get
their foot in the door but these are the
ways they actually can can get that done
now anybody nowadays can can set up a
blog or website or WordPress site and
blog about this and that and that's just
not going to work anymore if you build
websites from scratch maybe you have a
beautiful-looking blog I mean that might
be a pretty good credential but you know
nobody cares about a bootstrap template
that you're using and some sort of blog
or something like that it's just not
enough anymore so this is all just my
advice on how new aspiring programmers
might be able to take advantage of some
of the popular websites and tools out
there to help them get their foot in the
door all right well that's about it
that's all I got to say tonight so
thanks for watching guys have a good day
