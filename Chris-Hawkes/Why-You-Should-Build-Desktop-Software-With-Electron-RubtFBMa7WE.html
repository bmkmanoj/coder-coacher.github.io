like wait that's sorry it's like
sticking up anyway that's what happens
when you don't even look at yourself in
the mirror before you do a video and you
realize that your hair so sticking up
everything anyway so this this video Joe
which IG gives a good comment here he
says what are your thoughts about on wwp
F and you develop a WPF so WPF is like a
desktop solution for dotnet so c-sharp
net you can do it the C++ or any other
dotnet compatible language but WPF well
let me just say my new view of
background stats for Windows
presentation foundation so he's asking
if I've ever used that it's basically
the successor to WinForms which was what
we used to use back in the day well
before I was a programmer so I say we as
in you know programmers in general but I
didn't really do too much window
WinForms development it's a major
nightmare but WPF is definitely the
successor on wind forms if you're going
to be using Visual Studio and c-sharp
and kind of Microsoft's tooling and it
uses the example front-end language
which was like an XML layout type of
language very similar to if you've ever
done Android development where they kind
of use a similar type of thing so you
know there's some there's definitely
some learning curve there anytime you're
building a desktop app like that for
distributable software then you need to
you know run into you run into
situations obviously where you have to
have a lot of multi-threaded programming
so you're not blocking the main UI
thread so it can be to be fairly
difficult I think to create some
software so the question was have I ever
used it what do I think of it I think
it's just fine WPF hasn't really been I
would say like actively developed in the
sense that Microsoft is doing anything
more than just kind of supporting what
they already have for everything I'd
hear about WPF is just kind of like
nearly they maintain a small team that
just kind of about you know updates and
does bug fixes and releases and security
patches and things like that but as far
as I know they're not really like
focusing a ton on trying to you know to
extend that but I could be wrong as far
as the dotnet core is concerned
what they're doing with the open-source
side of that equation so there's a
question of boils down have ever used it
and the thing is yes I have a couple
years ago probably 2013 maybe 2012 I had
actually written some some automation
software that could automate your social
networking sites like specifically
Pinterest was one that was kind of
cropping up and I built its bot where
you could I literally log in it would
just start following and pinning and
linking you engaged like a bunch of
followers and stuff like that I thought
I could like sell it for gold bucks for
people that wanted to automate that
process and one of the things I ended up
running into and this is kind of a side
note nothing to do with WTF is number
one that the idea was a terrible idea
you never want to build products that
violate Terms of Service or anything
like that it's a good way to get sued
number two the when you run into you
know distributable software especially
on a dotnet I even done in Microsoft
technologies I ran into the situation
where like you have to basically buy
like certificates almost like SSL where
you're like certifying that you're a
trusted software provider cuz back then
it was like Windows 8 and one of they
was flagging the software every time you
try to download because I didn't have
like you know the official channels
approved from my company to build a sell
software and stuff like that so that was
one thing that I was really bummed about
when I was showing a bill distributable
software and realizing that I basically
had you know pay off companies to say
hey I'm legit and all this stuff because
otherwise you're then out sitting on
post your host your cell phone you know
people would get those in those messages
hey this software can't be trusted blah
blah blah and nobody you know trusts
that sort of thing obviously and it
doesn't look professional so that was my
main experience with WPF but as far as
you know building and executable like an
MSI installer so I could just you know
you have one file you download and you
double-click on an install on your
machine and everything I did I use WPF
for that and I think to them that works
fairly well so what do I recommend
though these days and honestly the thing
that I think most people should try to
be using it for for native desktop
development like if you're still trying
to build distributable software is this
chromium embedded project because this
allows you to you
you know the chrome engine to take
advantage of JavaScript HTML CSS for
your UI so if you have any sort of web
development experience you can use this
chromium project to build some really
cool stuff and when I say really cool
stuff like for instance Spotify so if
you were to download Spotify on your
desktop computer whether it's Mac or
Windows you're going to get they're
actually using the the chromium project
for further UI look and feel now as far
as some of their proprietary code base I
understand that they're still using a
lot of C++ and even assembly language
and certainly that but the actual UI and
stuff that you're actually interacting
with on your machine is mostly the
chromium the HTML Javascript CSS stuff
which is really good and another thing
too is like on top of the chromium
project is this electron project so this
is something that I'm definitely
interested in it's using node but it's
also using chromium so once again you
can build native desktop applications
using something like this and familiar
technology like JavaScript HTML CSS it's
it to handle some of the shittiest parts
of UI development which like I said
winforms WPF is all it's a friggin
nightmare trying to get all that stuff
working correctly at least in my opinion
now I've never been a software
developers it is and like you
distributable desktop applications and
things like that so maybe just being a
web developer I naturally gravitate
towards this sort of thing but electron
like this is definitely something that
you want to check out in addition to
that one of the most popular products of
late really the last couple years is
something that I definitely recommend
that you guys check out as well in fact
I want to create a slack channel for
mine for this YouTube channel so I can
communicate with you guys via slack but
slack is a great product for
collaboration and communication amongst
teammates you can even automate your
build processes and things using slack
but the slack desktop application is
also written using electrons so that's
pretty sweet so you can definitely build
some some very successful installable
software that you can distribute and I
don't know man that that's definitely
something I would
check out personal something I plan on
checking out that said dude slack man
sometimes that that Joker just crashes
on Windows Man um but hopefully that has
nothing to do with chromium I said oh
I'm not sure but either way man I would
definitely prefer that route then you
also have well really that's that's
going to be it that's where I'm going to
leave this video in these are these
examples here so let me know if you've
got any questions or anything make sure
you subscribe vote up my videos
appreciate it and you guys have a good
day okay hey guys so a lot of you asked
me how do I get my foot in the door to
become a programmer and I just want to
take a moment to mention dev Mountain
coding boot camp is a 12-week intensive
course that focuses on the technologies
of the here-and-now for web development
some of the things that they're actually
teaching in the Suevi course is geared
to get you into the industry by focusing
on things like jQuery nodejs react
angular how to use github so a lot of
the things that you're going to need to
do as a developer as soon as you start
they're going to be teaching you in this
and this coding bootcamp in the entire
goal is to be able to get you into the
industry within 12 weeks so if you guys
are interested in learning more
