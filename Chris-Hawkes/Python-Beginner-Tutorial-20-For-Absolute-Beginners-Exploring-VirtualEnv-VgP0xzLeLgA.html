want to now focus our direction on
something a little bit more a little bit
different if you've ever done
development in modern day web websites
like anything if you're using nodejs or
really you have these package managers
and and with node ecosystem you have the
NPM which stands for node package module
or manager or something like that and
what it is is it's it's the ability to
be able to reach across the web grab
some code install it to a file somewhere
there's two options that you have
essentially anytime you do that number
one is that if you just use your package
manager which in Python the package
manager is called pip P IP then it's
going to install things globally by
default so what does it mean when
somebody says globally and why is that
considered either good or bad the the
what there's there's basically the
global location of where Python is
installed on your machine nowadays I
think on a Windows machine it's gonna be
like CC users then you have stuff like
it's in a weird really weird spot it's
no longer on your normal spot I think
it's like AppData local I'm just
guessing here actually so moving out
there programs are pretty uh programs
Python three five so it's all the way in
here so here's this lib I think this is
it actually it might be here okay this
is probably it so if you go lib and then
cite packages this is all the Python
modules that I have installed globally
so for whatever reason I install Django
globally I did pill which is a image
manipulation and then there's a few
other a few others here so look at this
big ass directory where all this stuff
is installed now if you installed on
Windows and did the default location
yours is going to be in a similar spot
as well and if you did pip install for
instance Django it's going to install it
in this location now why is that bad
that's bad because depending on which
version of Django you need if you have
two projects that use Django and one's
using Django 1.5 and another ones using
the latest version of Django which is
1.10 you're only going to be able to
have one globally installed Django and
and if you start sharing modules between
projects you could have projects that
clash there's going to be things that
older like for instance one time I had a
django 1.5 site it was either one point
five or one point four and I went to
updated to Django 1.8 and I spent like
weeks having the website down while I
was spending you know free time trying
to think fix all the that was
broken because of the the update so you
want to avoid mixing and mashing
projects so why am i mentioning this and
the reason why is because virtual
environment was created to solve this
issue and this was something that I
really struggled when I was first
getting started with Python development
I was like ah you know screw that I
don't want to do virtual environment it
doesn't seem like I need it I'll just
have everything and so globally but you
want to avoid that because just like we
do in the nodejs and the modern web
world we want to avoid mixing and
matching our modules and stuff we want a
nice clean environment it's actually one
of the reasons why if you've ever heard
about docker docker is because when you
go to install or remove one Python
project from one machine to another or
to some sort of cloud environment
everything's all broken it doesn't work
but docker tries to create this
self-contained thing and they call it
docker because you have containers
everything's all self-contained and it
just works no matter where you put it so
virtual environment is is built in that
same sense that when we create a virtual
environment we're going to have an
isolated set up so let's go ahead and
look at projects and everything I have
so far as inside of my Python for
beginners folders from your first file
second file and what we're going to do
is we're actually going to create a new
new folder inside here which I'm going
to call a virtual env example it's kind
of a long name yes I know but I just
want to make sure that we do have that
separated now I can open this you can
see virtual environment there's nothing
in there so what we want to do is first
things first I want to open up the
command prompt look I have a project
called mother F isn't that funny so I I
want to open a command
to that location so let's go ahead and
open up that I will say CMD inside here
in windows and that opens up to command
prompt so now if I say virtual a and V
and it's all one word and this is
actually installed by default with
python 3.5 and I think any Python 3 for
that matter we're gonna say this could
be whatever this could be called your
mom it could be called your dad your dog
it does not matter what it's called
I typically call it E and V which is
short for environment I don't know why I
just do that but I always call it that
that way when I transfer a project from
one location or another I know that my
virtual environment is called env
the second thing I do is I say no and
that's two hyphens no - site packages
and what this means it's all in one line
even though that's on two lines there
it's all one line you can see so even
though so what this means is that if you
don't declare that flag when you're
setting up your virtual environment if
python things said that there is a an
ability to be able to share a globally
install package it will go ahead and do
so but it's still a good idea just not
to mess with it just say no site
packages and then when I press ENTER
this is going to set up our virtual
environment and it's going to put it in
the folder that I was in when I executed
so obviously we were in this virtual env
example folder and that's where it's
installing the example environment and
I'll show you once this thing is done
but by default it installs PIPP which
allows you to install weel files and
stuff like that which is something you
learn about later but now if we look
inside this virtual environment example
we have this env folder and look inside
here we have Lib and then site packages
so now instead of that long directory of
where we where Python was installed our
machine our packages that we install are
going to go right into this site
packages folder which are all going to
be local so let's back up here and we
need to do something with our virtual
environment in order to be able to use
it so if I just say dur to look at the
directory you can see
envy is there so we're gonna see the
interest env now if I do a derp there
you can see that there's a scripts
director and we need the CD into the
scripts directory and then once again I
can do a door and there's this activate
so in Windows I can just simply say
activate now I want to I want you to
keep in mind on the left hand side here
where it says see : watch what happens
after we say activate and we press enter
you can now see that we have this
preempted env which tells you that you
are in the env virtual environment if
you name this thing your mom or your dog
or whatever it would say your mom your
dog whatever you decided to name your
virtual environment but here it is it's
telling you hey your virtual environment
is activated so now my dog is whining
now when I say pip install it's going to
install it locally to that that
environment and it's not going to put it
globally so if we said I think selenium
might be a package that we want to mess
with here so let's try two pip install
selenium IDE on't even know if selenium
is the right valid name for it it looks
like it is actually so this is reaching
across the webinars installed selenium
all right so now let's go ahead and I
want to open up the directory go into
env go into Lib go into site packages
and let's see low and behold there is
selenium you have the distribution file
which is the actual folder that got
downloaded across the web and then
here's the actual install so this is the
source code for what Python selenium is
and we'll get into that more later but
this is the way that you want to install
and manage your project so if you have a
complicated Python project you probably
want to first things first set up a
virtual environment yes it is optional
if you feel like this is too much of a
headache to deal with I would suggest
that you try not to think that way
because that's the way I thought for
literally years and it ended up biting
me really bad multiple times and now any
time I setup a Python project whether
it's a Django website or a flask website
or whatever I always put it in over
environment alright guys thanks for
watching and please subscribe and please
upload the video thank you bye hey guys
so a lot of you asked me how do I get my
foot in the door to become a programmer
and I just wanna take a moment to
mention dev Mountain coding boot camp is
a 12-week intensive course that focuses
on the technologies of the here-and-now
for web development some of the things
that they're actually teaching in this
12-week course it's geared to get you
into the industry by focusing on things
like jQuery nodejs react angular how to
use github so a lot of the things that
you're going to need to do as a
developer as soon as you start they're
going to be teaching you in this and
this coding bootcamp and the entire goal
is to be able to get you into the
industry within 12 weeks so if you guys
are interested in learning more
information about Deb mountain coding
boot camp just check out the link in the
description tab of this video thank you
for watching and have a good day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
