going to be talking about the best new
programming languages to learn in 2017
so I've talked about best languages in
the past and a lot of times that's
dominated by the industry dominate
dominators you know languages like C
sharp and Python and JavaScript so this
line or this list is going to focus on
languages that are not more than 10
years old so even though 10 years seems
like a long time for programming
languages it's really not that long
we've been using C since the 70s and C++
since the 80s and Python since the 90s
and Perl since the 80s are like these
languages don't they take a long time in
order to get adopted and things like
that so when I say new languages if it's
in the past 10 years it's still
considered new by most standards alright
so let's go ahead and get into the list
here so first one is number ten is elm
and elm is as their description a
delightful language for reliable web
apps generates JavaScript with great
performance and convert a small part of
your app to elm and embedded in
JavaScript so essentially elm is a
purely functional language that was
created by a Harvard ph.d and believe
was created in 2012 minutes it's
starting to game on the gained a lot of
steam I talked about in the past it's
got a pretty devoted following and you
know check them out for more information
next one is cotton so this works within
the Java Runtime so it's interoperable
with a java virtual machine so it is
also it can be used with like a Eclipse
which is a very popular open-source
integrated development environment you
use to write code and debug your code on
the Java platform
number eight is Julia a high-level
high-performance dynamic programming
language for technical computing with
syntax that is familiar to users of
other technical computing so the syntax
is very similar I here to like a Python
so I've never actually met with Julia
myself that is something that I didn't
want to look into I've been hearing a
lot about Julia lately
number seven is hack it's a programming
language reconcile the fast development
cycle of a dynamically typed language
with the discipline provided by static
type checking while adding many cottons
many features commonly found in other
modern programming languages so when
they talk about you know static typing
so it's like you know having to declare
your ends and things like that things
that you don't have to do actually in
JavaScript or Python but hack is
actually created by the guys over at
Facebook and Facebook is also
responsible for the react react popular
react project for client-side web
development as well as their react
native stories Android iOS and Android
app number six is typescript and this is
a JavaScript preprocessor type of
language where you're writing in is
essentially a very JavaScript familiar
type of syntax but it has type safety so
in JavaScript you don't actually know
sometimes what type of parameters are
being passed into your function we're
just by looking at functions that takes
in a parameter a and B you don't know if
a is an int or a string or whatever you
know that's all just it would type
scripts you actually have to declare
well actually it's optional but the idea
is that you want to declare those types
so it makes it a little bit easier to
reason about your language it was
created by Mike Microsoft and been
around for a few years I believe that
created somewhere in 2010 or 2011 number
five is closure closure as a dynamic
general-purpose programming language
combining the approachability and
interactive development of a scripting
language with an efficient and robust
infrastructure for multi-threaded Pro
so closure is a functional programming
language you hear a lot about functional
languages functional languages are
getting more and more popular because of
our multi-core processors that aren't
built for you know the straight
processor speed is the processor speeds
actually being being essentially divided
in the multi-core so that you can exceed
a typical single processor speed so if I
explain that right basically computers
of the old day use that one processor
nowadays they have four but you need
programming languages that are capable
of using all four of those cores at the
same time and a lot of our older
languages just weren't built around that
type of mentality number four is a lick
sir elixir is event dynamic functional
language designed for building scalable
and maintainable applications so it's
actually used in conjunction with the
Erlang programming language which goes
back to a lot of like telephony systems
like telephone systems that have been
very very reliable over the decades that
have been written in Erlang elixir is a
language of functional language built
essentially on top of that runtime
number three is Swift it's a
general-purpose programming language
built using a modern approach to safety
performance and software design patterns
so with Apple Apple created the Swift
programming language to make it easier
to write software specific to the Apple
ecosystem so you know Apple uses a lot
of objective-c and some people had some
complaints about Objective C being so
difficult to learn and Mapple was
looking for a more simpler type of
language and that's kind of where Swift
came about just a few years ago number
two is go and this is arguably the
coolest logo I think that in elixir for
some reason jumps out at me but the
Gopher is you know go or go lang it's a
open source programming language that
makes it easy to build simple reliable
and efficient software so this is
considered to be like a systems level
language it's built with concurrency in
mind
and that said it was it was created by
Google to replace a lot of their
existing infrastructure that was written
in Python and C++ and go is a very it
it's a language that is definitely
picking up a lot of steam and it's great
for things like web servers and any sort
of concurrent based programming that you
may need to do and number one is rust
rust is a systems programming language
that runs blazingly fast prevents take
faults and guarantees thread safety so
rust is also built with concurrency in
mind variables are immutable by default
meaning that they cannot be changed once
they've been declared rust makes it so
that you have to program your
your-your-your application in a way that
has concurrency in mind and makes it
very difficult to actually step on your
own feet or trip over your own feet
things that you know to have been
complained about with the go line
language with concurrency with its go
routines and channels and things like
that
they say rust almost makes it to the
point where it's it's very difficult you
have to go out of your way to kind of
screw yourself over with a concurrent
based application rust was created by
the guys over at Mozilla which are
responsible for the Mozilla web browser
Firefox and they've been an industry
leader with a lot of code and and
improvements that we've made it along
the way so both are very very reliable
languages well still don't go lying in
rust and then you can for swift in there
as well but I think you know of the
three languages you know the top three
are definitely industry contenders
because they have major backers behind
them which includes Apple Google and
Mozilla alright guys so that's my list
let me know what you think if you guys
have other suggestions or anything feel
free to leave a comment and take care
guys make sure you subscribe bye hey
guys so a lot of you asked me how do I
get my foot in the door to become a
programmer and I just want to take a
moment to mention dev Mountain coding
boot camp is a 12-week intensive course
that focuses on the tech
oh geez of the here-and-now for web
development some of the things that are
actually teaching in the Suevi course
it's geared to get you into the industry
by focusing on things like jQuery nodejs
react angular how to use github so a lot
of the things that you're going to need
to do as a developer as soon as you
start they're going to be teaching you
in this and this coding bootcamp and the
entire goal is to be able to get you
into the industry within 12 weeks so if
you guys are interested in learning more
information about Deb mountain coding
boot camp just check out the link in the
description tab of this video thank you
for watching and have a good day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
