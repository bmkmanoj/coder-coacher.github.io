answering a question and I've actually
been meaning to do a video on this for
quite some time because I've a few
people have asked this before but um
Swift PvP here says hello Chris I've
been watching her videos for a long time
but only just recently got a channel to
subscribe got a channel to subscribe I'm
not I was wondering how do you protect
your HTML Python website from being
hacked please were play as soon as
possible he meant reply but and he said
thanks so thank you for asking the
question I appreciate it I always loved
these questions that way I can have some
sort of idea for a video without having
to think too hard but this is something
that I've thought about for quite some
time and ultimately it all boils down to
one well there's a few things you need
to do a number one you should be aware
of being able to you should be aware of
things like cross-site scripting you
should use a framework that understands
how to prevent a lot of that stuff from
happening like django has built-in CSRF
protection to prevent you know one of
the most common hacking at you know
attempts it out there your cross-site
scripting is essentially where if you
have HTML or a template system or
something like that sword on your file
system that a hacker can breach it and
then they can inject little pieces of
script that is redirecting customers to
other sites and stuff like that so you
get these you know these rogue 301
redirects or and then they go to you
know rogue websites to download software
or you know obtain users information and
stuff like that so but many of the
frameworks they have all that stuff
built in a no ASP or NBC net and also
Django has all that stuff built in so
you want to use a framework especially
where you do have a lack of of major
understanding when it comes to hacking
and stuff like that so I'm not a big
hacker or anything like that I don't I
don't try to hack into other people's
stuff but I do have like a basic
understanding of some of the more
prominent hacks that occur out there any
time you're doing any sort of like
stored procedures which are like actual
raw you're you know saved sequel
executions
typically stored procedures allow you to
you know right and in a safe way so
you're not just allowing any sort of
crazy house sequel command to just be
entered into your database you know on a
whim so you use stored procedures in
order to you know make sure that you
only interact with your database on us
in a particular way you know like delete
star from you know draw our drop table
or what you know you know you don't want
to allow any sort of sequel command to
go through into your system that is
written by somebody other than yourself
and then you know things like you know
Django once again they have a built-in
object relational mapping so you're
pretty much communicating with your
database in a django specific way which
you know isn't going to allow you to do
ridiculously dumb things with with
sequel commands where you may not be a
sequel expert there's ok so then there's
also just you know don't do stupid
things don't allow like you don't don't
allow a user to enter in a bunch of HTML
characters and stuff like that without
actually escaping it and don't just
store that stuff into your database and
then redisplay it into your template and
market is safe so that django renders it
as actual HTML because once again then
you're just allowing the cross-site
scripting it's you know to take place so
you should like try to escape any sort
of HTML characters when you're storing
it into a database when you're reedus
playing it back you know you want to
display other people's HTML and Cyprien
code and stuff like that and you know
don't so that way it's not treated as
actual HTML and more like in text
content so those are just a few of the
basic things I could probably do an
entire video series on the stuff that
I've learned along the way that you
shouldn't do if you're dealing with any
sort of credit card content or anything
like that you obviously want to enable
HTTPS it's something that i just
recently did for my hipster cold website
which I'm I wouldn't say I'm proud of
I've actually done it before but this
time I actually did it through engine X
which before I did it through a patchy
but you can see I went and went down
here and I enabled this out this Komodo
secure thing so it list stuff about
basically you pay money to a company
what the hell were these people call
so it's a it is one of the cheaper ones
basically I don't plan on doing a lot of
you know significant you know
transactions on the site I'm not storing
eight weeks credit card information or
anything like that so I didn't go out
and buy the most expensive as a
self-certification that I could find
maybe one day I can afford that but I
know some of the bigger companies are
using like verisign and they're paying
like ten thousand dollars a year for an
ssl certificate where some of the
cheaper ones that should be just as good
for company of websites and Michael
hundred thousand or less they should um
you know that they should be fine with
just a ten-dollar I think it's Komodo is
will not come on god damn I don't know
names sheet that's what it was named
chief so I want the name she even bought
their ssl certification you have to do a
bunch of stuff where you end up creating
a certification key and all the stuff
but anyway you have it enabled on HTTPS
so you can see if I request this this
page if I request an HTTPS then when you
look over here you know what I have to
actually fix that I just noticed
something but what it's doing is when
you know what okay I said what's going
on here alright so what is going on is
because I don't want the forward slash
anger is actually redirecting it to the
name and to the you know the regular
domain which doesn't have the /i need to
fix that oh Jesus alright so I did it
like four times i guess i was typing it
wrong but either way I need to fix that
redirect problem because that's weird
but you can see now it's requested
through https so if you look at this
content here any sort of data that's
going from the client meaning the user
to the server is now going to be
encrypted so if somebody was able to do
like a man-in-the-middle attack or you
know start sniffing out traffic on a
public network or something like that
that happens to be using this website
that data is going to be encrypted so if
you're on a public network you should
never be logging into your bank account
and stuff like that because people can
steal that data that's being transmitted
across the wire because it's not
encrypted and then they can you know
obviously obtain your your credit card
information or your login information
stuff like that so you should always be
careful on public networks but HTTPS
allows you to one additional step of
security there and then here's the final
golden rule with you know what I've
learned with you know having my
hack before because actually I did have
my my account hacked one time the golden
rule to all of this stuff especially you
know okay the golden rule guys is that
you just back your stuff up all the time
you backup your databases all the time
and don't just back up to the same
database you need to have a new database
backup for like pretty much every single
day for the month before you start
regenerating you need a backup all your
data so you should have you know
multiple those terrible terabyte storage
things where you're taking your your
local hosted website have that backed up
have the entire server backed up and
then have you know definitely the
database because the database can really
screw you over if you end up getting
hacked in that but you you don't want to
be subject to somebody who does hack
your and then lock you know either
demand a ransom or something like that
it's much better just wipe your server
you know install all your back on
there and then and then you know upload
your database again so that way before
the breach occurred now detecting the
breach is always a problem if you start
dealing with a lot of credit card data
and sylvia day you may want to pay for
network monitoring that that's something
that is emerging but it's not something
that I would be able to afford at the
moment another thing too is that when
you're using payment providers i like to
use payment providers that don't require
that they have to store that credit card
transaction on my website because then
you have to be depending on the country
you live in you have to there are
certain standards that you have to take
when you're dealing with the customer's
credit card data I don't remember what
the standards are you have to look them
up but I know in the United
states that there are rules and
requirements you have to abide by when
you're dealing with the storage of
people's information like credit cards
and stuff like that so or at least maybe
if it's not an actual law or something
it's like an ethics thing that you
should be doing but I'm not once again
I'm not one hundred percent sure about
that and as far as credit cards or
concern I have no desire to put those on
my website but those are just a few of
the examples that I can think of that
would hopefully try to keep you guys out
of trouble yeah I mean so that that's
about it I could probably do an entire
video series because now that I'm
thinking there are other things that I
can mention as well so i'll probably do
that in another video but anyway guys
let me know what you think thanks for
watching and have a good day bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
