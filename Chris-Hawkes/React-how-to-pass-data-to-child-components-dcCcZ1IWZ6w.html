right so I want to make sure that we're
clear on something between in the last
video we talked about props and we
talked about state and that state is
responsible for keeping track when
things change and if something is
immutable meaning it cannot change and
does not need to be changed then you
want to display that as a props now
everything the data generally if you're
managing state you want to try to manage
that at the most outer layer of your
component as possible in my particular
case i'm managing state on my comment
box which is the main package main
component and all the other components
it inside the comment box it consists of
a comment list and then you have the
individual comments that comprise the
list list gets put into other comment
box here and you can see that the data
is being given to it from state Ajax
call here like get initial state is
making sure that the data is never null
that it always exists so it's setting it
here and then it's calling the start
we're making the edge Ajax column and
I'm getting the response and then you
can see it's setting state here and then
taking what we initiated down here and
it's assigning it the data coming back
from the server dot comments and my
particular case top comments is being
represented by Jason and you can see
here like this is the jason blurb that
would come back and comments where the
hell is it
here it is right here so this is all one
comment here there's going to be two so
this big blob of things there's there's
two comments coming back alright so
anyway that data is being assigned to
comment list comment list is right here
and comment list is then going through
each element of comments which is this
mapping function and it's building a
comment it's building actually a
variable which is going to hold a bunch
of comment objects in it and then you
can see it's actually going to present
all those comments that are stored in
this variable down here so hopefully
that's not too confusing it does seem a
little confusing to be honest with you
but try to bear with me so here's where
it's looping through every single
comment and that data I just showed you
there's two comments so there's going to
be two of these created stored in this
variable displayed in this comment list
which then gets displayed when this main
outer component is rendered to the
screen which is done down here okay
alright so moving on what we need to do
is inside of our comments since it has
access to this this comment object so it
loops over each comment there's two of
them and it handles it one at a time and
the one at a time is this comment right
here so in our actual HTML container
that is being returned by this component
we're going to create our variables that
we're going to pass to the child which
is comment right alright so to do that
you can in my particular case I have
what's called a blurb and I'm just going
to say blurb equals comment blurb and
then I remember comment this is the same
thing in comment right here and then
blurb is part of the comment object that
I showed you guys in the
json data just to show you here is blurb
see blurb blurb is all this text right
here okay we blurb is the actual object
identifier so we're saying blur equals
comment doubler and then we're also
going to create another one which is
going to be the author so we'll say
author equals comment dot added by got
user name actually no I'm not gonna do
the author yet because I'm going to get
into that in just a moment here alright
so let's go ahead and now that we've
assigned blurb this comment object
that's being created can now reference
the blurb variable that we just created
and to do that we use this got props and
we talking about before blurb alright so
now let me go ahead and show the example
and I'm actually a moron guys sorry this
needs to be wrapped in the curly braces
alright guys so when I see this thing
get rendered you can see the two
comments this is that large blurb that i
had just pointed out it's a pretty large
blurb and then the second one is right
here testing so both of them are
printing correctly now in that Jason and
the next will actually no I'm going to
do this in the next video in the next
video i want to show you how to do an
if-else statement in react because we're
going to run into a problem that i'm
going to explain in the next video I'm
going to keep these on to the point you
notice I don't discuss two different
complete or completely different topics
in one video but you're going to see in
the next video that down here added by
has this object inside of it where I can
access the user name of the person that
added it but this first comment when we
look at it the added by searched
Yeah right here this added x equals null
so I'm going to show you how to get by
using an if-else statement and react in
the next video alright guys thanks for
watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
