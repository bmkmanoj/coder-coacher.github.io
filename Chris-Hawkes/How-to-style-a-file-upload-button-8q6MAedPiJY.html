to show you how to style an upload file
button if you'll notice an upload file
button is displayed natively by
whichever browser a user happens to be
in and there's actually no way to style
it beyond well there's really no way to
style it it's similar to a radio button
a radio button it displays the same way
all the time so it's a common question
that one wonders how to actually style
something like that so what you have to
do is you have to actually give it to
input IDs because one you're gonna
display them one you're gonna hide and
the one that you're gonna hide is the
actual file upload button but the what
we're going to do is add a little bit of
JavaScript so that when you click on
that button you're actually clicking on
the hidden file upload button so that
way you can style the button on top of
it any way that you want and it looks
like an upload file button and it
operates the same exact way so to give
you an idea on what I'm talking about
it's actually pretty simple we're just
gonna say input we'll give it a class
name and I'll call this display none and
we'll give it an ID and we'll call it
file type equals file which means file
upload size equals four this is actually
the only way you can size a file upload
button is using this standard HTML name
we're gonna go and name it file and then
that's that input button now what we're
gonna do is this is the button that
we're actually going to show and we're
gonna call this upload button type
equals button class equals we'll just
call it button as well value equals
upload file so now if I go ahead and run
this application
so when we run it you can see that we
have the two files side-by-side now what
we're gonna do is go ahead and actually
hide this choose file button because
this is the standard upload and then
this does nothing so what we're gonna do
is we're actually gonna make this
operate this way so the next step here
let's go back to our editor alright so
what we're gonna do is we're gonna add
some style to go ahead and hide the
display:none so let's go ahead and add
that class now I'm assuming you were
gonna put this into sort of some sort of
external stylesheet I'm just keeping it
in the same file for gravity or breva t
brevity makes make it easy basically
right so we're gonna say display:none
now let's go ahead and put some
JavaScript at the end of the file I'm
gonna go ahead and do some jQuery here
document ready not ready function what
this is saying is um Java scripts
waiting it says wait till the page loads
then go ahead and and try to operate
okay so let's go ahead and say variable
interval function
Wow
what do we call this we gave it an ID
file so is her file dot HTML
top value okay
alright now let's go ahead and close
that off and fire the other function
I say upload button for our ID got on
click function
file dot click
set interval interval function 1 1 a
return false let's close off our jQuery
statement all right let's go back and
fire this application and see what
happens before we fire this up I do
notice that we have one issue here the
comma needs to be replaced with a
semicolon and now let's go ahead and
start this to see what we get
all right so as you can see here we have
the upload file button which is being
displayed over top of the actual file
upload and the styling that we can apply
to the button will appear as if we're
styling the file upload button the
JavaScript we're using is causing the
button to have the same same
functionality as the file upload so by
clicking this you can see that it
launches the file upload option so just
to give a brief example on if you've
ever tried to style the file upload
button you can see here that like I can
change the color of this pretty easily
just by going back to my application
here or my editor so I can come up here
and for my upload button I can give it
some additional style in fact I'll just
leave it as a class button I will say
background color and color
so we're basically saying trying to turn
it white will get rid of the border to a
border:none and border-radius 30 pixels
all right so this should round our
button make it look pretty nice and let
me go back to the application and if I
reload the page you can see that it is
now using the button style so it's
pretty sweet it's an easy way to upload
obviously we want to change the width
padding put some border in there
whatever you want to do and you would
want to add CSS for hover so that it
turns into a little mount a hand pointer
when you go over top of the upload file
button but that's that's a good way to
go about styling a file upload button
