top 10 programming language as I had
mentioned c-sharp and mainly I wanted to
just kind of move away from the same
list that I had the year before because
I had JavaScript as number one and 2016
in the 2017 I picked c-sharp and a lot
of people like balked at that and I
understand a lot of people think I'm a
Microsoft fanboy which isn't true but
one of the major reasons why I picked
c-sharp is one of the top languages of
2017 was because of xamarin and zamarons
this product that was actually created
by a SAN francisco-based company several
years ago so I think was four or five
years ago the xamarin was created it
actually had a lot to do with the mono
project so the mono project goes way
back into open source I was actually a
guy named Miguel de Casas a developer
who was also I believe self-taught from
Mexico originally and he was a big part
of the entire mono project which was
about taking the dotnet framework and
making it work on Linux and Mac and
things like that so they gave rise to
his Ameren and then xamarin just started
you know rising in popularity but the
problem was am room in my opinion was
number one it wasn't free because they
were a company that needed to make money
and then number two the you know sam
room was pushing their own xamarin
studios but an earlier in early 2016
around February or March Microsoft
bought the xamarin studios and actually
merged it into their latest version of
Visual Studio so xamarin where it used
to be expensive and cost a lot for
developers to be able to use it it's now
free to a certain extent so if you're a
business and you're trying to make money
you're going to buy a business license
but if you're an individual I think an
indie developer you might have a lesser
I'm not sure we could look at the
pricing here but I know that this is
actually wrapped into the visual studio
community edition which Microsoft made
free and that's another thing another
reason why I picked you know Microsoft
is making a lot of changes in the
development world in order to stay
relevant Microsoft's a huge company
they're not going to just go and fall by
the wayside they they have more money
and more revenue than even Google so I
mean we've seen some of the crazy
acquisitions
it was Skype and that was a long time
ago obviously but you know they burped
they purchased just recently LinkedIn so
merging with xamarin they're working
very heavily with unity and unity engine
is one of the best game engines that
I've experienced as far as you know
being friendly to developers and noobs
like myself so you can see xamarin
studio still has their own studio which
was being pushed but everybody kind of
uses Visual Studio at least in the.net
c-sharp world and one of the biggest
benefits of xamarin is the fact that you
can write your mobile applications in
c-sharp and it's relatively close to
native so a lot of people be liable it's
not native and you're not you know you
you um basically they'll say if you're
not writing native you're never going to
be able to make is as good of apps and a
buddy of mine was actually mentioning
that that xamarin I mean it has some
pretty legit applications that you
wouldn't really expect to be created
with xamarin so if we just look at a few
of these things like if we look at
gaming you can see skulls of the Shogun
was created and this is actually a game
that I've seen but you know actual you
know games are being created on this
platform using xamarin just basic
applications if you go to this website
as Amerind comm forward slash customers
you can see all the different
applications that are actually using
Zamar including Cinemark which is a
humongous movie company a movie theater
chain in the United States so a lot of
major companies are using xamarin it's
not just some sort of fly-by-night
product and to me I equate this as being
like like JetBlue I mean major major
companies are using this application or
in this this setup so they're writing
their mobile applications in c-sharp and
using the the xamarin framework they are
releasing to Android and iOS and all
that stuff and and it runs relatively
close to the hardware so relatively
close to native also at a very minimal
fee and another thing is you know the
c-sharp language is actually a very well
designed language it is very very suited
for large development and I'm talking
millions of lines of code hundreds if
not thousands of developers and that's
what c-sharp was was mainly you know
built for so I don't know being a guy
that likes Python and a guy that likes
Perl guy who spends most of his time
writing JavaScript these days I think
c-sharp is is a pretty nice language the
only downside for me is that when I
compared c-sharp asp.net framework
number one I think Django is a better
framework than asp.net I just I like
Django and everything it does better
than ASP but beyond that it was a simple
fact that I can get a twenty dollar
windowed host and get a website that
gets two hundred thousand visitors a
month on a Django application running
Python where if I would have hosted on
Azure using c-sharp granted the cloud
may have been a little bit faster and I
could have had some elasticity for
making sure that you know I have server
setup in China and everything like that
which a lot of those benefits to cloud
provides however for a specific you know
an individual developer that's running a
content-based application that never
makes any money you know it's not really
a suitable option and even to this day I
feel like it's not a very suitable
option for me so when I created hipster
code earlier this year that could that
website you know gets roughly I would
say probably a couple thousand views are
not views but couple thousand visitors
at most a week and you know it just it
cost me nothing and and I do it on a low
note shared host and so the defining
financial reasons is why I really don't
ever choose a dotnet or Microsoft
platform another thing too is the
licensing for something like sequel
server is not nearly as attractive as
something like Postgres or my sequel so
it's not all good with Microsoft but the
reason why I'm talking about xamarin
today is just simply that I haven't been
involved in any side projects and prod
were really since hipster code I think
it's because I've also been so busy at
work and also this channel takes quite a
bit of my time and the kids are back in
school and everything so just a lot of
they're not a lot of time I think and
also I would say that overall hipster
code was uh was somewhat of a
I guess I didn't really find the success
that I was hoping to find there so grant
and I I didn't you know I pretty much
stopped pursuing it after I spent a
couple long months trying to get it off
the ground the motivation to continue to
try to expand it which really any sort
of startup takes that you know that
constant motivation and work and effort
and I just I just don't have it so if
anything I'm very just I'm satisfied
doing what I do during the day playing
around on the side and also doing the
shoe Tube channel I think that's that's
quite a bit of effort that already takes
to do that so I don't know and but what
I'm talking about tonight is that like I
sat down tonight and I said you know
what I want to I think I'm gonna learn
is Ameren like I want to get this I want
to go through the headaches because this
is it's going to be a headache this
isn't something that just works in fact
last time I tried xamarin I was like
running into immediate problems so even
just getting everything set up to
initially start creating some basic
Android applications I found to be
relatively involved and you know the
motivation wasn't there but I think you
know it's something that you know mobile
apps are going to continue to have their
place responsive web design doesn't
solve the mobile first problem I mean
having a much more native approach to
your your mobile app where you can
download off the Google App Store I
think is just a much smoother experience
so when it comes to like using like
hotel bookings I'm going to download
hotels calm the app or I'm going to
download Priceline or even the Expedia
or TripAdvisor I could go to the mobile
application but the mobile application
I'm sorry I could go to the web
application on my mobile phone but the
mobile you know application seems to
actually provide me a better experience
at least for the most part some of the
times though I think it you know it
doesn't have some sort of feature that I
need on the website and that's somewhat
disappointing like I would say the
YouTube application and there's also a
YouTube creator app and it doesn't have
it's missing like half of the things
that you need to do with YouTube which
are only available on a desktop so
that's one of the downfalls I think of a
mobile app but other than that I mean we
need the convenience of mobile apps
and that said xamarin is a pretty good
option when it comes to delivering
something like that you can obviously
see if you go through all these
customers that that xamarin has and the
fact that Microsoft just recently
purchased them made this stuff free made
it free with Visual Studio the Visual
Studio code is actually one of the most
popular coding editors is actually
really taking a lot of thunder away from
the atom editor but on like my Python
tutorials I did earlier this year that
was done with the Visual Studio code and
and it's just a much much easier
experience I think than dealing with
atom ATO em editor so there's just a lot
of lot of reasons I think of why c-sharp
is poised to be a continuing you know
presence and in the development
community at least in the 2017
alright so that's really a but um just a
few other things you can see pinterest
and slack are also using it so a lot of
reasons to use Yammer and I'm going to
probably fill you guys in in a couple
weeks let you know where I am on the
process of trying to learn some of this
stuff but this this seems like where I'm
gonna actually focus my attention
probably if you know at least over the
next few weeks maybe a few months and
see if I get anywhere on it but anyway
guys that's really all I got tonight so
thanks for watching please subscribe
please vote up the video I appreciate
your support and have a good night bye
hey guys so a lot of you asked me how do
I get my foot in the door to become a
programmer and I just wanna take a
moment to mention dev Mountain coding
bootcamp is a 12-week intensive course
that focuses on the technologies of the
here-and-now for web development some of
the things that they're actually
teaching in this 12-week course it's
geared to get you into the industry by
focusing on things like jQuery nodejs
react angular how to use github so a lot
of the things that you're going to need
to do as a developer as soon as you
start they're going to be teaching you
in this and this coding bootcamp and the
entire goal is to be able to get you
into the industry within 12 weeks so if
you guys are interested in learning more
information about Deb mountain coding
bootcamp just check out the link in the
description tab of this video thank you
for watching
