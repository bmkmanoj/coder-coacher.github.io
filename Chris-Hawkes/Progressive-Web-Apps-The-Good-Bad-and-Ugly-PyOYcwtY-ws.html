bane of my existence is it's having to
debug things like iOS devices that I
don't actually physically have it's one
of the biggest pain in the asses I think
that most developers well from what I
experienced I have to deal with and the
reason why is because many companies
don't want to go out there and buy a
physical device for every new device
that comes out and hits the market
because for a while there we didn't know
if it was gonna be Amazon's you know
tablets or Apple's tablets or
Microsoft's or Google's or anything so
you know that you fast forward today we
still have the kind of the same similar
problem you could probably say well I'll
just target the s7 you know Samsung has
7 iPhone 6 and or it might even be seven
now I don't know but you know just focus
on the major devices for testing but but
the reality is is that you have all
these different people that are using
your website and they're using the
website not a mobile app but they're
using the website which is like a
responsive website which responsive web
design was like the the rage word and IT
at least web development IT for probably
2012-2013 and everybody just thought hey
if we use media queries and we make
their the website responsive it's just
gonna magically work on all these
different devices and they won't have to
download an app and all this
and we don't have to maintain iOS apps
and Android apps and Microsoft apps and
everything but the problem is is that a
lot of these responsive web design
websites you know they suck right I mean
even look at some like hipster code a
website that I created myself a lot of
this this responsive design nature of it
and just so you guys know what
responsive is we need to shrink the size
the actual style layout changes like you
get to a certain certain size here you
can see the logos kind of change it's
smaller the menu gets dropped down so
this is a you know approximately what
you're looking at on a mobile device
right here so you're looking at
something similar to this the HTML CSS
all that stuff is what makes you know
that it really it's media queries which
give an alternate CSS style based on a
physical width of the other device
that's viewing the website and that's
all fine and great but the issue I think
comes into play because once again
companies can't go out and buy every
single device especially smaller
companies
and even larger companies have to you
know they have budgets and things that
they have to abide by as well and
they're not going to be in a hurry to go
out there and get a physical device so
every single developer can you know test
they're responsive code across all the
different browsers so to fill that void
we have things like well before even
browser stack and I probably should have
said like okay so if you ever wanted to
view your website and look at hipster
code here so if you ever wanted to view
your website and responsive format first
things first is we Chrome press f12 to
open up your developer console then then
dock this thing at the bottom for
goodness sakes so you don't need that on
the side like that it looks retarded no
offense to uh wonder if I should edit
that out are you allowed to say that
anymore I don't know other way um so
then you look at this and if you go over
to this left hand side you can see it
says toggle device toolbar so this is
the way that you want to actually view
your responsive site you're probably to
refresh it and then I'll show up in the
responsive format but this is much
better because then you still have the
full the full layout down here you can
still modify styles and things so if I
want to go over here and I start messing
with this text I can start you know I
can start manually messing with it
things like that but um before we
actually had things like like browser
stack we had forgot the name already
I've said before we had those we had
these emulators man and they call them
emulators but they weren't really
emulators all they were doing was
physically changing the the way the you
know the layout or the width of the HTML
page so that it rendered into there it's
responsive mode and people be like oh
look I'm looking at it and this is the
way it would look on a responsive device
even though you're looking at it through
Chrome you're not looking at it through
Safari iOS 5.3 blah blah blah you know
so there's like a major major difference
between the way these engines are
rendering pages in Chrome in a
responsive mode and in iOS so it's like
well how do you test oh I can go to
browser stack and browser stack gives me
the ability to run my code locally
and as long as browserstack can can
access your website meaning that you
have to deploy it somewhere for them to
be able to access it then they can go
ahead and they can run their little
features and run your website and their
emulators and you can get stuff it's
very slow very buggy very very
frustrating
the alternative to browser stack and
there's really just two that I know of
there's browser stack and then you have
sauce labs and these two guys are
probably in my opinion like two of the
top ones when it comes to this you know
providing this testing product and
everything but they're both buggy man
they both barely work unfortunately and
it but but it's the best thing you have
though so if you do not have physical
devices to test on this is the next best
thing that you can do to actually test
on these you know these actual physical
devices so you have to deal with you
know the the latency the lag the low the
slow loading the unintuitive user
interface the lack of being able to copy
and paste although there is a little
hack to be able to do that with browser
stack I know but it's just such a pain
in the ass because you're probably well
Chris it's no problem to go ahead and
just use browser sack yeah it's a little
bit slow whatever but at least don't
happen to buy the devices well you're
right about that but the problem is is
that most companies are operating behind
a corporate firewall and they have their
own network that all the employees are
connected to they usually have intranets
and things like that so you're not going
to just be able that say hey
browserstack hey hit up my locally
running IAS Express web server that I'm
running from visual studio or or from
something else like browser stack needs
to have a public-facing website that it
can actually access so that ends up
creating major major headaches for IT
firms because you're like ok I have my
own intranet my firewalls and I can
access things but browser stack can't so
now what I need to do I need to look at
using like a tunnel or I need to look at
actually have setting up an external
environment to deploy my code to so that
browser stack can then access it and
these are just things you know we have
to do in this day and age so if you ask
me like something that is just right for
taking and hopefully browser stack or
somebody else figures it out but there's
just god
a better way there's got to be a better
way than browserstack unfortunately I've
been dealing with browserstack in this
you know this hackish way of testing
since about 2012 or 2013
and I think browserstack was like brand
new at that point so browser stacks
still around obviously it's 2017 clearly
there's a market there for user testing
so if you were looking for creating a
product or something like that then
there is a market there my question is
like how how hard would it be to get
some sort of virtual machine that we
could use for iOS I mean iOS is usually
the biggest bottleneck like with the
Android a lot of different I mean
emulators can can can emulate the
Android environment relatively well and
then even where we can't we have things
like you know like with Eclipse or even
with with Visual Studio code and things
like that there's different Android
emulators that we can use obviously the
Android SDK is cross-platform so we can
download the Android SDK and start
writing and using Eclipse in the
emulator there - to test our our Android
devices but with iPhone it's completely
different ballgame man like the iOS
Safari doesn't run on Windows right so
it's like you're you're kind of in a
world of hurt man when it comes to
trying to test iPhones and things like
that and this all this goes all the way
back to like you know 1982 and or 1984
really when the Macintosh was being
created and and and you know during the
entire design of it they were trying to
keep it all like you know black box
magic don't want the developer having to
deal with being able to modify their
their operating system and things like
that you wanted to provide all the
batteries included for their end user
and and clearly it's done very well for
Apple and the mainstream audience that
has gotten into tech but it clearly
wasn't you know the ideal thing for a
lot of developers especially hacker
types I'd like to to build and tinker
with things but I don't know man you
fast forward all the way to today
decades and decades later and you still
have this kind of closed off closed
source kind of thing that we
have to deal with where it's like we
have to have a physical device to test
on and if you if you actually asked for
my suggestion like if I was giving a
suggestion to a company absolutely buy
an iPhone
or whatever the latest version of iPhone
is maybe even buy an old shitty iPhone 5
as well and then go out and get you know
an s7 or si si whatever the new new si
Samsung phones gonna be and and then
just kind of go from there I mean maybe
have a tab or two but nobody's saying
you have to go out and buy 20 30
different devices but what we're saying
is you probably should buy four or five
if you're an actual reputable company
that cares about whether or not this
 is actually going to work on
people's devices or not and and it just
seems like so like i and it's not it
just seems like it's something that like
we we have a hard time justifying where
it's like a bug can cost you millions of
dollars you know just for not doing a
code review or writing a unit test or
something like that and it's like the
money that you're saving by not buying
physical devices you're definitely
losing and you know customer
dissatisfaction tech errors and things
like that that go undiagnosed and things
like that because nobody knows what the
problem is because they can't even test
on it just a bad situation really so I
think that on the entire market itself
yeah really it needs to be the status
quo that's like hey I'll be a developer
I'll make I'll make cross cross platform
websites that work on all the different
devices and and it'll be responsive
it'll work well but I need to be able to
test it and if I can't test it then I
can't test it you know and in a
productive way then I don't know man P I
think people are just kind of shooting
themselves in the foot and companies are
shooting themselves in the foot trying
to save a few dollars all right guys
thanks for watching this video by the
way I'm looking for additional sponsors
and everything so patreon man this is
hurtin this is hurting real bad but I do
want to thank the six patrons that give
me seven dollars a month that's pretty
awesome at one point I think I topped
out at about 30 but I understand what
people you know people on the money or
whatever but you know if you do have the
money you can contribute a dollar a
month or something like that that would
be helpful because honestly I don't have
time to be to be looking and dealing
with a lot of different sponsors and and
I could tell you right now that I've had
like 10 or 15 different conversations
with with sponsors and most of them do
not come
fruition and the ones that do are
typically not even worth the effort that
is involved in and even working with
them even one exception to that would be
dev Melton which I find to be you know
that's my favorite sponsor but you know
Deb Mountain I've been working with them
for about a year there's no count and no
there's no no telling you know what
their budget situation looks like or how
long they're gonna be able to do that
and I just kind of fear that like maybe
the motivation is not gonna be there if
I if I'm not if I'm losing if I lose
that mountain I don't have any sponsors
I'm just doing YouTube I'm not sure guys
there's just there's not going to be as
much motivation to do videos it's not as
much as I do anyway I'll probably you
know maybe once or twice a month or
something like that but yeah just that
is the reality
just today Eli the computer guy now said
that he's leaving YouTube because of the
the current ecosystem and and I'm sure
Eli is feeling you know pressure from
people like myself and you know that
have come along and but he's been doing
that game for eight years I've been
doing it for four we're all in this rap
game and you know there's just there's
all kinds of you know there's newer
upcoming developers so maybe you guys
are like Chris can hit the road that's
fine and we'll just pick up on the next
guy that comes along and and I'm sure
that a lot of people would be perfectly
fine with that and and maybe even be
happy for that but I'm just trying to be
real with you guys that I need to make
more money on this channel so either it
needs to be through sponsors or patreon
but neither one of them is working very
well at the moment unfortunately so just
being real with you guys alright thanks
for watching have a good day bye hey
guys so a lot of you asked me how do I
get my foot in the door to become a
programmer and I just wanna take a
moment to mention dev Mountain coding
boot camp is a 12-week intensive course
that focuses on the technologies of the
here-and-now for web development some of
the things that they're actually
teaching in this 12-week course it's
geared to get you into the industry by
focusing on things like jQuery nodejs
react angular how to use github so a lot
of the things that you're going to need
to do as a developer as soon as you
start they're going to be teaching you
in this and this coding bootcamp
the entire goal is to be able to get you
into the industry within 12 weeks so if
you guys are interested in learning more
information about Deb mountain coding
bootcamp just check out the link in the
description tab of this video thank you
for watching and have a good day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
