if you guys have been getting the emails
or getting contacted I'm curious I've
been getting some emails and I know of a
few people have been getting emails hat
and that or at least one other person
said are not a few people but that it's
from the like MongoDB organization
essentially the you know the company
that's behind MongoDB or at least you
know be now these sales consultants that
work for the company they're an
aggressive Bunch man though they'll come
out and they'll try to you know
obviously reach out over LinkedIn I'll
you know easy stuff like that but then
they'll also look up and find your
corporate email and start sending you
like all this stuff like you make
decisions for a multi-million dollar
company or something like that I don't
know man whatever it is like you can
definitely see MongoDB has kind of grown
up into this like business professional
commercial elite option for your data
solutions and I guess that's good that's
good to see if you guys haven't used
Mongo before I would definitely
recommend it sometimes I get sick of the
sequel relational database model where
you have to have columns and tables and
then you want to add some new columns to
your database table then you have to
deal with migrations and and all that
other stuff yeah there was stored
procedures and schemas and with with no
sequel though there's none of that
like with MongoDB you could have one
let's say you're saving a book and one
book could have a title and an author
and you could save another book and save
it in the same like a table essentially
and the second one doesn't even have an
author now that that could be
detrimental depending on how you built
your app because if your app expects
that data to be there and it's not there
that's a problem but with no sequel and
MongoDB it's awesome because you have
this flexibility basically to do
whatever the hell you want like you're
like especially as you're developing it
saves so much time because you're like
well I need to collect this piece
of data so that you just go ahead and
add it and you starts you know saving it
in your collection your data objects
when you're saving to mom at DB so
anyway MongoDB is is definitely still
the future no sequel is definitely going
to have a future I think you know over
the next 10-15 years or longer I mean
who knows sequel has been around since 1
to 60s or 70s so but MongoDB is
definitely going to be an alternative
option I think for especially a lot of
smaller shops and smaller webdev shops
and things like that so if you're into
like you know building apps for
customers consulting things like that I
think Mongo could be a really good
solution for a lot of smaller companies
it's not going to be what Google uses
obviously for their needs and things
like that but anyway so yeah you can see
like Mongo definitely grown up I go to
download' and I'm greeted with this new
website layout where it's like solutions
and like I have all this stuff so now it
looks like I'm on like a Microsoft site
or something but anyway no I do check
out MongoDB it's definitely a good
product I'm actually going to be coming
out with a tutorial with MongoDB as well
I know I keep talking about tutorials
that I'm not creating but I do plan on
actually releasing a dotnet core with
MongoDB tutorial series but maybe
somebody will beat me to it or if they
haven't already who knows anyway guys
thanks for watching have a good night
