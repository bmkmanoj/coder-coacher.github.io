we're looking at is major projects that
have been used or they used Python the
Python programming language as either
the primary source of language to do
most of their daily routines or to run
like their entire stack so I could list
like literally hundreds maybe even
thousands of different applications or
companies that use Python in one way
shape or form but this video is more
about who uses Python extensively and
and how did Python actually get their
project you know off the ground so a lot
of people try to say that Python is not
a real language it's a dynamically
interpreted language it's not as fast as
a static language like C++ or something
like that and all that is actually true
in the sense that Python is not fast
however you can develop very quickly and
when we start talking about micro
seconds for a dynamically language
compiled language to a statically typed
language like C++ where Python makes
memory management all that stuff it you
don't have to worry about that with
Python where you do with C++ so the
amount of development time that is
decreased using something like Python
more than makes up for the fact that
it's not as fast as something like C++
or even c-sharp or Java for that matter
and most of the times if you if a
project Python is being used for the
project and speed it's not necessarily
an issue to the point of what it would
be like with video games and things like
that
however we we will see in this video
that Python is even used for video games
so the fact of the matter is python is
good I mean all those naysayers that say
Python is bad I say ha and no and that
is a wreck it Ralph reference um so
python is good it's a great language
it's not going to be the best language
for everything out there but then again
there is no one-size-fits-all perfect
language for all the different projects
that you want to build out there but the
fact of matter is don't believe what you
hear about you know Python being slow
and all that other stuff python is most
certainly fast enough to get the job
done for a lot of major companies as
we're going to see in this video
so first up Google's entire stack when
it was first getting off the ground in
the 90s all
way until the early 2000s was
exclusively in Python and we're not even
talking about modern-day Python we're
talking about old-school Python Python
has been around since like 1990 and was
still a relatively new language when
Google decided to use it and the entire
original Google search engine and
everything else would the way that the
Google company operated was completely
written in Python
once speed started becoming a major
major factor they started rewriting a
lot of those libraries in C++ but they
still use Python extensively and if it
wasn't for Python we probably wouldn't
have Google so that is definitely the
largest company that has embraced Python
now one company that I should also
mention that honestly I didn't add to
this slideshow is IBM IBM has also been
a contributor to the Python language and
an early adopter as well but I forgot to
mention them so next one we have the
website discussed at one point discussed
with serving something like 8 billion
users a month so disgust is a commenting
forum but the entire comment uses the
Django web framework and it allows you
to take a piece of JavaScript code and
just plug it right into your website so
there was at one point it seemed like
every website out there was using
discuss as a commenting platform there's
still quite a bit of sites using discuss
but it's all written in Python and using
the Python Django web framework to be
specific next we have Dropbox drop boxes
entire stack was written in Python
they're actually starting to use some go
from what I understand now however they
even hired the Python creator guido van
rossum away from google where he had
been employed for at least five or six
years before that so he now works at
Dropbox full time and Dropbox was
definitely using a Python stack and
still does quorum a popular social
commenting website where it has a lot of
a lot of like real professionals that
are commenting it's almost like a reddit
but a little bit more professional when
it comes to maintaining you know who can
comment and how comments are being
folded up and things like that so it's
very similar to reddit but it's
definitely
Python website next we have Pinterest
and unfortunately I don't have my
Pinterest image here that's kind of
weird but Pinterest is obviously a big
website here's another one reddit calm
right at everybody I'm sure it's heard
of it by now but reddit is definitely a
very popular website next is Mozilla at
one point Mozilla serves something like
500 million requests per day or some
ridiculous number like that or maybe
that was a month I don't remember but
all I know is that the Mozilla plugins
website is actually all written in
Django as well using Python the next is
of the PI the programming language of
choice with the new Raspberry Pi the you
know computer chips that kids are
embracing for electrical engineering has
pill a Python built into the chip and
already installed so that kids can start
writing in Python to integrate their
Raspberry Pi into whatever it is that
they're trying to make with it
next is the website the onion the onion
is a very popular website and literally
I don't have the exact figures but we're
talking about millions of users go to
the onion and it's a news based website
and it also uses Django
we have Instagram another django python
website and Instagram definitely uses
Python for their their front-end YouTube
is a huge user of Python so that is
awesome to know as well Python now with
YouTube obviously they are owned by
Google but they are still a separate
entity at one point YouTube was its own
company which got acquired by YouTube or
I'm sorry Google which I think was in
2008 but YouTube makes heavy use of
Python iRobot is is using Python for
actual robotics so that's pretty sweet
Yelp one of the largest websites when it
comes to actually rating businesses and
restaurants across the world Yelp is
completely written in Python the
original BitTorrent client was actually
written in Python so all the pirating
sites out there they use things like
utorrent for
our pirating movies - software -
whatever the original BitTorrent was all
developed in a Python technology and is
still you know made use of bye-bye
Python so Python hackers actually
contributed to the BitTorrent client
which we've now seen be used to pirate
pirate software on an astronomical level
Python is also used for games
so one game EVE Online is actually like
their entire server system is all tied
together using Python which is pretty
cool this is a very popular online game
Python also has the Panda 3d and it's a
gaming framework so Disney used it for
their Pirates of the Caribbean game
which was a massive online multiplayer
game kind of sucked but still it was
very cartoony and I mean it worked good
it just was you know as a crappy game a
lot of games suck but that Nets didn't
really necessarily have anything to do
with Python however I will mention that
you know even though there's a couple of
games that use Python in one way shape
or form like Python is not really the
type of language that you would use to
make games I mean typically you're going
to be more confined to like C or C++
because you do need that massive speed
and when we start talking about you know
thousands of second of requests per
second Python is dynamically interpreted
it's not compiled like like a static
language so it there is a definitely a
speed factor there when it comes to
whether or not you need to you whether
or not you should use Python if speed is
a major major issue if you're doing some
basic text crunching or scraping like
Google does like scraping data from one
page to the next
Python most likely fits the bill for
that type of thing programmers can write
the code very easily and quickly in
Python and the speed difference is
hardly noticeable to a typical human but
once again once you start amplifying
that by thousands of requests for
millions of requests a minute you start
to see where speed does become an issue
when you compare Python to something
like C++ so those are just some of the
websites out there and I just wanted to
say that you know those are some obvious
some major brands out there that are
using Python Python is also the most hot
language now and as an introductory
programming language in IT schools
around the world which includes Carnegie
Mellon MIT Stanford they're all using
Python it's free it's open source it
runs on Linux it runs on Mac it runs on
Windows and it just it just makes it
easy so it's all user contributed it's
been around now for going on three
decades
yeah 90 no wait note yeah so we're going
on two decades actually but still it's
been a long time and Python is deftly
not going anywhere at this point it's in
the top ten its firmly embedded in the
top ten programming languages out there
there's a lot of jobs out there for it I
didn't mention some of the data Sciences
divisions but a lot of like
bioinformatics and just you know data
sciences machine learning Big Data is
all intertwined with Python so python is
actually one of the go-to languages when
it comes to machine learning which is
going to be a huge factor going into the
future when you combine machine learning
with big data and you know scripting it
all together using something like Python
so anyway guys python is definitely good
language to learn it's not the number
one language when it comes to enterprise
development not compared to Java or C
sharp but if somebody tells you that
Python is a shitty language then they
have no idea what they're talking about
anyway guys I appreciate your time and
thank you for watching you have a good
day bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
