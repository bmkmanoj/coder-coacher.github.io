want to do is um use the free sublime
text editor it's free for evaluation
purposes for as long as you pay on it
you know your evaluation is necessary so
you can download a copy of it what we
need to do is we need to install a
project called Babel which actually
takes your JSX code and transfers it
over to JavaScript automatically without
any sort of hassle so in order to be
able to do that you need to open up
sublime
I'm using the latest version so as of
this date September 5th 2015 it's the
latest version and you're going to go
over to preferences and then go into and
click on package control and then you
get all these different package control
options that you need to select from so
we're just going to say install package
and click on that and then we search for
Babel and you'll see that it takes and
uses the latest ACMA script
6 and transfers it over so go ahead and
just click on that and over through the
install process and you can see down
there not sure if you could actually see
it or not but it flash that it was
installed successfully alright so now
that that is installed one of the things
that this package does is if we open up
a file I'm gonna open up a JSX file that
i've been working on and it's a
humongous file here and it actually
looks like it didn't really do anything
because I already had in sublime the
just sublime JSX
plugin installed so it has like propers
you know highlighting and stuff for the
JSF syntax and format and everything and
a good example of that I mean go down to
like this area where we're using JSX
now one of the things the plug-in will
do now is if we have something like
improper gave tag like here we have give
let's just say class name and instead of
this would be the proper way so proper
class so that works just fine but now if
we went ahead and we did like a common
mistake where we don't have the actual
quotes you can see that the highlight is
that it's now highlighting the incorrect
code so there's a problem
and it's bringing your attention that
this is not going to compile as valid
JSX and that's actually what the babel
sublime package that we just installed
is doing so that's one of the benefits
of actually having that installed
all right guys um so hopefully that is
somewhat helpful to you and it's gonna
not just you know the example I gave but
it there's a lot of different examples
that people make like mistakes that
people make in JSX which you don't know
what the problem is until you actually
write the JSX code compile it and get
the javascript error from the compiled
JSX or yeah yeah and you're just looking
at your like oh where's the problem well
with this plug-in installed the babel
sublime plugin you'll now be able to get
you know that information much sooner
and before you try to compile it and
realize that you have a problem down the
line alright guys thanks for watching
