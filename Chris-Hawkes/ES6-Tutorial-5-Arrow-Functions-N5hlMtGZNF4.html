this video we're gonna be looking at the
new arrow syntax and the arrow of syntax
is a new way of actually describing
functions and they're really no
different than the old way so it's
learning the old way first and we're
gonna say a variable old way equals
function and then we'll just say it
alerts a little world all right and then
we'll call a little way
I never go we call the old way sorry my
phone was out it was my right now all
right now we're actually going to create
the new way with the arrow function is
we're save our arrow function equals and
this is where we actually do this open
and close parenthesis and then we use
this little lambda equal sign and then a
greater than sign and then we do our our
curly braces and anything inside the
curly braces that is actually the return
you know what is being executed the
function body and we could say hello
from all right so let's go ahead and
execute this one as well and you're
gonna see that based on the old way and
the new way that there isn't really much
of a difference if any difference at all
hello world hello world from an arrow
function or hello from an arrow function
all right so both of those just output
it just like they would but so what we
you know what are the benefits of the
arrow function well it's a little bit
more concise because not to spell out
function but you do have to use these
weird symbols and things like that you
can even omit the the open and closed
parenthesis and pass in an argument so
if I said you know what let's just call
this art so I could have an arc here and
I could say you know I'll just output
the arc and now when I call this
function this is a mother-effing are
alright and it's going to be that's how
we actually pass in a variable so this
is a mother-effing argh now one thing to
note about the arguments that we pass
into arrow functions is that you can't
pass into this way you can't have art to
this is not going to compile it's going
to it's going to cause problems but you
can wrap it in parenthesis and be able
to do that means they are plus r2
and this is our one of what a space
there this is our two
so this is r1 this is r2 so that's how
you pass multiple arguments to the arrow
function let's get rid of this old
function here now let's take a look at
what babel did to our actual arrow
function if we look at this and we look
at bundle you can see that this is what
babel is actually doing because it's
finding an older version it actually
takes it just like we had it before and
it just creates an an older style of the
function hey guys so a lot of you asked
me how do I get my foot in the door to
become a programmer and I just want to
take a moment to mention dev mountain
coding boot camp is a 12-week intensive
course that focuses on the technologies
of the here-and-now for web development
some of the things that they're actually
teaching in the Suevi course it's geared
to get you into the industry by focusing
on things like jQuery nodejs react
angular how to use github so a lot of
the things that you're going to need to
do as a developer as soon as you start
they're going to be teaching you in this
and this coding bootcamp and the entire
goal is to be able to get you into the
industry within 12 weeks so if you guys
are interested in learning more
information about dev mountain coding
bootcamp just check out the link in the
description tab of this video thank you
for watching and have a good day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
