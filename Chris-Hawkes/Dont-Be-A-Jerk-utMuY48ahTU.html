comments every now and then but like
here's a comment of a typical jackass
who thinks he knows everything this guy
night born he's like why the does
he use jQuery for everything and it's
like look night born you dumb I
have a video that was posted from
December 31st 2014 so I was actually I
posted this on on New Year's a New
Year's Eve it's funny so yeah 915 days
ago it's like dude 915 days ago what
were what was everybody using I mean
were you even a developer back then like
one of the things I guess I want to
caution on this video this is going to
have a purpose at all is that on you
can't understand everything in IT and
only jackasses think that they know
everything so some of the most newbie
idiot programmers you're going to run
into are some of the most ignorant ones
because they're the ones who have never
been around the block enough to
understand what we do day in and day out
also men big shout out I love these
comments it's simple programmer
traversée media so that some of these
very easy were to actually follow my
channel at spread it's pretty funny
hell no ain't going nowhere these
haters you know I am dealing with some
haters right now though man because I
had that dumbass cringy as video of my
daughter and all these you know these
these troll lab bastards like it's
literally like half the people are like
oh I thought it was a good video the
other half of the people are like dude
you're the worst father ever like it's
not even half I mean that's a that's a
stretch but they're like these these
opinionated well yeah it doesn't
matter though I mean you're always going
to deal with these trolls and and I even
have a lot of a 10 year old son who was
like he's like that you're letting the
trolls win because my daughter didn't
even want me to take the video down but
I ended up taking it down anyway just
because it was drawing some of the worst
 from the just deepest
darkest crevices of the internet and I
don't know man I'm not going to I'm not
going to take it to the next level or
whatever but you know luckily in the
United States and
nevermind I'm not even going to bring it
to a level that I want to bring it but
it's oh it's okay so yeah what you know
where where we going from here man
you're going to deal with assholes
everywhere you go there's going to be
people that think they know the answers
to everything one of the things that
I've actually had to work on myself was
trying to act like I you know I don't
basically trying to make sure that I'm
not trying to you know make a makeup
stuffer or try to convince myself or
something that I that I don't know to be
true and the for instance like thinking
that I knows a solution to a problem
without actually investigating it first
because a lot of times it's really easy
to be like well you know the code I just
wrote it should work like I know it was
working out tested it you know this way
and that or whatever and then you might
immediately suspect that it's something
else and maybe even you're three or
you're you're educated stance like you
you think you even know that there's
like a 90% probability that the problem
rest somewhere else it's much better to
go in and be professional and then make
especially if you're explaining to a
boss or something like that you're going
to say hey you know I'll definitely I'll
take a look at whatever this problem is
and I'll get back to you in just a few
moments and just take the time to like
debug your code properly make sure it's
not something that's on you before you
like you know put blame on somebody else
basically what I'm saying is that there
have been times in my past where I look
at like I would be approached with a
will Chris well you know what isn't this
right away is it this there's this
problem and it may have something to do
with something that you wrote and I'll
be like what if I like I said I can have
like a 85 90 percent certainty that it's
not something that I wrote and that it's
probably related to you know something
else and you just want to make sure that
you're always like I guess cautious
about taking a stance of trying to claim
that you know something to be true when
when you may not know what you're
talking about it also
long story short there's just don't be
an asshole hey guys so a lot of you
asked me how do I get my foot in the
door to become a programmer and I just
want to take a moment to mention dev
