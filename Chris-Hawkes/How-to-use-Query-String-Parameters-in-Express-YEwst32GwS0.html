I have my my lookup file which is uh
basically they're the routes file for
most VC type frameworks and I'm using
nodejs here and what I want to do is I
want to create a lookup so a URL that I
can request and then pass in some get
parameters to then pull some data based
off that get parameter and then return
it back to the user so I'm gonna go
ahead and put it here I have this lookup
digest file so this is just my route I
have one that's already here I'm gonna
go ahead and copy essentially what's
here right now so I'll just copy what's
here and then I'm gonna change the
actual route so what I'm doing is I'm
bringing in a module here which is my
state's module and that can be found
right here so it's just it's a bunch of
data basically in fact I'm not even
bringing in my state's I'm sorry I'm
bringing in my places which is right
here and this is a lot of different data
about different places that are in each
state so what I want to be able to do is
pass in the actual state so that way I
can use my module here to figure out
which States being requested and then
pass it back I just did a switch
statement there might be a prettier way
of doing this but basically I'm just
looking at what's passed in and then
I'll return the actual variable which is
just a JavaScript a JSON object that's
going to be returned probably a better
way of doing that but for right now
that's just what I did so let me go
ahead and I'm gonna name the I'm gonna
name the actual URL so you're gonna do a
domain and then for slash get places and
then pass in the query string of
whatever place that you're looking for
in my particular case let me go ahead
and instead of logging we're gonna go
ahead and send back this information
right here so whatever you're sending
back here you're gonna actually put it
inside the parentheses of the response
dot send which is right here so what
we're going to be doing is we're gonna
be using this places object that we've
imported using nodejs and then we're
going to be calling the get place
function
which is located up here so there this
this particular module only has one
function assigned to it which is gate
placing it's just gonna take in the
state and then figure out which state to
return so what we need to be able to do
is be able to get the query string
parameter from this URL which the user
is going to be passing in and it's
really simple because you have this
request object that gets built for you
or passed in automatically for all these
routes using Express J s and all we then
need to be able to do is we could just
say variable state equals request dot
query dot and then the name of the
actual query string parameter that
you're going to assign so we're going to
say request I'll create out state and
before we even try to do this we'll
leave that in place but let's go ahead
and say console dot log and then we're
going to log in this variable that we
just created for the requests query
string State so for right now let me
just sum I'm gonna get rid of this part
right here just because I don't want it
to distract from what we're doing all
right so I'm gonna remove that real
quick and all we're gonna do when we
start the server is we should be able to
see the result that we're looking for
which is gonna be the querystring that
gets passed now just keep in mind that
where this is located in the application
if I go to my app you can see that
assigning my lookup to the forward slash
lookup so anything to this lookup to get
to get places I would need do you know
my domain forward slash look up forward
slash get places and then pass in the
query string so to do that it would look
something like this so here's the local
domain I just mentioned look up get
places and then we pass in the query
string test so if I go ahead and I look
at my my debug server you can see that
we're actually logging you know the
tests that we passed in under the
the state query string parameter so now
we can go ahead and just remove this and
we can just simply say in fact we don't
even really need any of this let me go
ahead and I'm gonna put the places get
place back and really all we need is a
request out query dot state and you may
want to do like you would want to
normally do like a null check because
you don't want to try to look this up if
it's null or something like that but um
we could just simply pass that right
into the the module function and then
that way let's go ahead and run this you
always have to restart your server when
you're making changes like that so if I
go ahead and I say test this isn't going
to return anything which is fine it's
not gonna throw it error it just simply
doesn't return anything so if I said
Virginia City I get all the Virginia
cities back or I have every state in
here so I'm Maryland anyway you can see
it's quick it passes back the jason so
that is how you deal with query string
parameters and note in Express alright
guys thanks for watching please
