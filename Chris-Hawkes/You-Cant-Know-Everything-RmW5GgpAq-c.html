this is a prime example that sometimes I
put out videos that I just aren't very
good I made this video over the weekend
schedule day and I'm like I knew it was
airing tonight and I'm just like man
like I really I can just tell sometimes
we're like and not all the time but like
sometimes I'll do a video and I'll be
like man don't really not feeling it I
really like and sometimes I actually
delete videos in fact I have a lot of
content that I've deleted that I've
never even uploaded because I've had
time to kind of you know look it over
and figure out whether or not I want to
release it this flexbox versus bootstrap
one was like kind of like grasping at
something I think it was rushed and and
I'm certainly not an expert on the the
Flex box or anything but somebody did
make a good at they point out a good
point that the bootstrap for latest
version of bootstrap is using flexbox
anyway for its great system so flexbox
been around since 2009 bootstrap 4 is
now using it this video sucks and I'll
be deleting it and you know that's it's
kind of like it's just kind of the way
things sometimes work man I actually do
videos like twice a day try to every
other day
and I have contractual obligations as
well so sometimes like I say you know I
want to talk about some subject but I
just don't necessarily have the time or
the effort to make it as good as what
I've wanted it to be and this is serving
one of those cases so it's also a
shining example of how nobody can be
like a true expert in and everything
these days like I spend a really long
time really most of my time doing all
just like it really javascript so
there's a lot of es6 and nodejs using a
lot of micro frameworks or so doing a
lot of API development things like that
and not doing a ton of architecture I
would say like I want to actually do a
little bit more architecture
architectural work
I think I'm expanding my skills quite a
bit actually what was the really last
year so I I just continue to grow and I
think every programmer will continue to
grow but the one thing I've noticed is
like we surround yourself with
we're better than you or at least as
many of them are better than you
you learn the most that way you truly do
so
another thing too is like when you're
around passionate developers like
there's been jobs that I've had where I
wasn't like surrounded with passionate
developers that they spent time reading
the blog studying the latest and
greatest and things like that and and
when you're around that entire you know
group it's like you find out it's
impossible for you to know and to keep
up on everything so it's like it's a
constant struggle you just gotta let it
roll off a roll of your your back is
that the same role if your back your
sleep I have no idea anyway another
thing too late today I was I was like
talking to somebody who was like oh I
didn't know he was kind of he was kind
of trolling me a little bit because I
already know Python was uh was strongly
typed and I'm and then he he like
forward a plate on Wikipedia and he was
like and he talked about how it's like
such a multi heard on object oriented
anyway he pointed out the the basic
thing of a Wikipedia which like he gave
him the impression that no pythons not
statically typed technically are not
side of the dead but strongly typed in
technically Python is both strongly in
dynamically typed so like is Python are
not strongly strongly typed and I'm a
little bit tired today so it's
dynamically typed in the sense that you
can actually have you can change the
value of something so x equals one you
can then change x equal to you know a
string or something like that but and in
some some languages you can't do that
instead in that sense it's considered to
be dynamically typed so a better
explanation is probably used a girl
Stack Overflow from somebody who knows
this better than I do but they spied on
it is they strongly dynamically it's
strongly and dynamically tied that's
very confusing like JavaScript a weakly
typed language
and in fact JavaScript if I run this you
can actually say so if I said I could
say x equals test x equals x plus 1 and
you can see that it didn't give a
that you have a number and that X was
actually a string it went ahead and
combine those two and that's a good
definition of what a weakly typed
language will do it like it implicitly
converted the number to extreme because
it felt like that's what you need it to
do it's not like as a brain just it's
designed that way it's weakly type now
Python you wouldn't go do that you would
have to cast the number to a string and
be you know explicit about that
conversion so and in that sense Python
is considered to be a strongly typed
language because the dynamic typing
means that at runtime objects values
have a type so the actual value as a
type so in this particular case you know
X isn't a type of the actual value of
the part so this is a string type and
this is a number type and says that as
opposed to static typing more variable
subtype so and this static type language
X has the types of X is defined as a
string and therefore you can't change X
to a number once it's setup with type
unless you cast and with Python though
it's dynamic in the sense that you can
go ahead and assign X in value because
the actual type is within the actual
value and not the variable anyway that's
confusing but nerds like to have those
kind of discussions where in that
particular case and I'm usually not like
the encyclopedia encyclopedic type
programmer like I don't like really get
off on like the inner workings of
programming languages or anything like
that but I dunno you know I decent
amount just being around the block for a
time or two and I was always I happen to
be right in that argument so I'm usually
or sometimes will not race
and whatever but anyway it's just the
point is like nobody knows everything so
also I was having some conversations on
earlier today without with selenium I've
actually done quite a different a few
different projects in my life and
hopefully I don't like this video too
long talking about some of the stuff but
in a nutshell I've done some some and
some interesting and interesting things
with programming to try to drive traffic
to different websites and things like
that so one time I had a one of my bit
well my biggest SEO success I ever had
was a blog that back in the day was
called a new post and I was running the
same from like the psalm right over even
one euro was a long time but and I ran
it for like you know the summer and I
was writing blogs for like everything
under this time from my pop culture to
like science science stuff and
programming stuff and all kinds
different things and on and the articles
were very unique in the sense that I
could share them to reddit because I was
just writing about things that I thought
were interesting so I was able to drive
a decent amount of traffic that way and
all of a sudden like Google started
giving my site a lot of a lot of search
engine traffic so literally like it went
from you know a hundred people a day and
they all decided to jumped up to like
you know 500 600 people a day and a lot
of that was just coming in from Google
so a lot of people call that at least
I've heard that Google sometimes when
they're dealing with a new site will
give you this thing like this honeymoon
period or they call it the Google dance
where Google's trying to you know see
how well people like your stuff and
everything I was also sharing a lot on
like Reddit and see my reddit back in
those days was a little easier but
needless to say I was getting on like
probably around a hundred thousand views
a month or a hundred thousand visitors
or so and I ended up turning it over to
a product review site because I realized
as I started introducing products from
like an Amazon affiliate then I started
getting paid money now I actually have I
have affiliate things on my own website
let me show you an example so like in
this particular example I have this link
so if somebody clicks on this link and
it takes you over to Amazon if anybody
buys anything from
for the next 24 hours then I get a
commission on it and based on the amount
of people that violate what they bike if
you sir sell a certain amount of
products and your commission goes from
like an abysmal 4% to like 5% to 6%
things like that and you can make you
know some money I've never had too much
success with it but once I started
realizing that I could make money and
this was even before I was a developer I
needed I needed money I didn't have a
whole lot of money at the time I wanted
money and I was kind of greedy about it
so I took the website and I started mill
like building it into like a product
review website where I was doing reviews
on things that I knew enough about but
like not necessarily like unboxing
review so basically those the reviews
were in a nutshell they were complete
and utter garbage so like it was
complete like nobody's going to
find a needs out like real value in it
but I was able to convert that traffic
into a lot of money and to the point
where like there were certain days that
I'd make over a hundred dollars just on
Amazon and then I'd make like $30 on
Google advertising and things like that
so I was actually making money and I was
like ah this is great this is great and
then all of a sudden I get you know from
you know five hundred people a day or so
on the Google searches it goes from
there to just absolutely nothing so
either the dance ended or Google was
like hey this site you know this site
sucks it's not offering anything unique
or anything like that so that that in a
nutshell is actually why I've learned
that you can ruin a good thing by trying
to be over aggressive with you know with
money with products that everything else
and even my case like with sponsors and
you know trying to push products like I
had a company asked me if I would do a
product review on from light bulbs and
things like that and it's not something
I'm interested in doing even if they
were going to pay me like 50 bucks and
give me some free light bulbs like why
would you guys find any interest in that
whatsoever but at the same time you kind
of have to balance things it's like well
if somebody's going to offer you five
hundred dollars a month to mention their
product and it happens to be you know in
programming and things like that and
things that people might find
interesting you know it's difficult for
somebody to be like hey I'm not going to
take them
I mean basically so yeah also so my so
like I suppose for the right amount of
money but I don't feel good about it
that is until that cash is in my bank
and I'm buying something that I wanted
to buy then then I feel really good
about it
just getting out but that website man I
ruined a lot of hard work because once
Google essentially and they never
blacklisted me so it's like say that
they they concern me a spammer site or
anything like that when I reached out to
them they're like oh you're not
blacklisted but if you're not on page
like 1 or 2 and Google you might as well
be on page 500 of my book because most
people will just go to that first page
of Google results we're not going into
multiple pages and for that website like
everything went from being on page 1 or
2 to like 500 or not not found at all
and and they completely control your
destiny so if you don't play by their
rules then then you're never going to
succeed and then if you do play by their
rules sometimes you'll never succeed
there either so it's a difficult road
but I can say that the number one thing
that I learned from that entire thing is
that you can ruin a good thing like
everyone to website that had some decent
traffic would have made probably $1,500
a month
on a pretty consistent basis and
probably has potential to make quite a
bit more than that and all that hard
work was completed just completely
vanished because it was you know turned
it into a site basically hey guys
so a lot of you asked me how do I get my
foot in the door to become a programmer
