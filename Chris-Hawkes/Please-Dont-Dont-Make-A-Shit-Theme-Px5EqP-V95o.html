screaming at me like my eyes just want
to jump out of my head and slap myself
in the face for whatever reason this is
what people used to do a long time ago
with their websites they had like oh
yeah let me do this cool blue font on
top of a back a black background this
dark black with bright white colors it's
absolutely terrible obviously this guy
likes to the dark theme much better but
please don't do this in fact this is the
first major what like I would normally
not even go to this site but obviously
there's a pretty good project for the
node the node framework that's out there
for trying to do authentication stuff
like that but this this is so ugly I can
barely look at it and just to give a
brief I mean it could be so much better
like if I just went and I said let me
inspect this and we'll go ahead and go
over to the body and here's a black
background I'm grab a little photo click
or eyedropper will make it somewhat
white then we go ahead and look for
anything that has the font I can just
right click on the font here instead of
this bright white here we go it looks
like i just changed at the black oh
that's so much prettier
you see how much better that looks and
this isn't even the white like in fact
if I put this actual white background
and probably look even better
oh that is so much better I wish this
guy would change this website though
because honestly it's just it's terrible
please don't put black and white
together and when you're trying to
display font that's a bad idea so just a
to give you guys a heads up I mean so I
haven't been working on really much of
anything to last like really couple of
months because I put a ton of work into
like well not really ton but I built
some some stuff in the hipster code and
all that and and that was somewhat of a
learning experience because I had to
integrate like stripe and this other
stuff into it which i plan on expanding
on that site eventually but right now I
just I don't feel like working on it but
you know since that time I haven't
really you know dunno a lot so I've
actually been doing a little game
programming and now I'm jumping back
into node i looked at angular 2 for a
moment and i just realized that there's
so many pieces that are not ready for
that you know at the moment so i'm just
going to hold off on angular for right
now until angular 2 is a little bit more
up to date now i'm also in the process
of trying to make a node.js framework
and yet another node.js framework right
but the thing is is that i don't know
what to call it i'm actually thinking
about naming it after my dog which is
named after a band because i'm just not
that original and it just seems fitting
for some reason I mean the Django web
framework was named after a rock
guitarist I believed in Django Reinhardt
the Python programming language was
named after Monty Python I believe and
that was just you know some weekend
project that guido van rossum had done
over an extended holiday vacation and so
basically all these weird names you know
so people what's base RJ I like why name
but anyway that might be what its name
is right now that's temporarily where
it's being what it's being called on
github and it's probably it's really
more of a learning experience for myself
in fact I'm gonna have another video
where i actually just show it for you
guys but what I'm trying to do and
no it's going to take a lot of work and
everything but I'm trying to mold it
after Django see one of the reasons why
Django is such a great platform is that
right out of the box you have an entire
entirely working administration
administrative authentication and
authorization website so all that code
is already made for you so if you need
to establish groups and assign people
groups and specific permissions for
within those groups and then also be
able to have them you know signing into
the website through authentication and
all that it just it makes things so much
easier the fact that it has a built-in
object relational mapping for querying
your database all those things you know
take a pretty decent amount of time so
with this this bayside framework that
I've been creating when ojs it's like
this completely bare bones like there's
not even a templating engine in fact
it's um the way I was originally going
to do it and I was going to say you know
what it's not going to have any sort of
database it's not going to have a
template engine so I gave any of that
stuff you basically create all that
yourself and it would do a few things
like you know Jason parsing and you know
basically it was it was the meant to
serve as like a complete just restful
api and then you just use something like
react or angular on the front end and
build it in a single page app but then I
started thinking that you know what you
know having those features that Django
provides it would be so much it would be
awesome if if no dad something like that
now I know that there are some
opinionated frameworks already out there
for notes so if you know by all means
use those or whatever because honestly
I'm just learning as I go along so some
of the stuff I'm doing is most likely
pretty terrible as far as a repository
is concerned I'm not a big github guy in
fact most of my repository you're
dealing with large code bases and other
developers and things dissolved within
the Microsoft ecosystem which is team
foundation server and with TFS it's
completely different than the way it
does it so yeah I'm actually teaching
myself get some of the stuff on github
as well as trying to build a framework
and node and I'm not a node expert but
anyway that's that's what I'm working on
here and then
point in this video's please don't ever
put a black background with bright white
font on top alright thanks guys have a
good night</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
