hey guys what's up it's Chris so I
realized that most of my viewers like
watching me scrape stuff and it seems to
be the best thing that I've been able to
convey I probably don't do the best job
at it but I am I'm not like a
professional teacher or anything like
that so hopefully there are you know
some of you that do find my videos
helpful so I appreciate that and that's
what makes me keep doing it and I wanted
to touch up on this whole selenium thing
I don't like the way I did the last
three videos it was like a three video
process so I'm just going to go ahead
and show you how I'm going to attack a
particular problem that I'm dealing with
so I'll just show you just an example on
how you might do something so anyway
that's what this entire project is going
to be just a sample of what you may do
like it's just kind of a made-up
situation so here we go the first things
first I'm going to go ahead I'm using
Visual Studio but I'm going to add a
Python class you just do that however
you do that with your Python editor I'm
going to name this I'll name it I'll
just name it get playlists okay
and here we have a class
all right now that we have our class
first things first I'm going to import
some stuff here I hope that we're going
to use all of the imports here but it's
just something that I tend to do because
I usually know I'm going to need at
least a few of them I did have some
questions in my previous videos and why
imported certain things and didn't use
it and ultimately it was just because I
was saving files overtop of other files
and I didn't really take out the imports
that I no longer needed but we're going
to import re for regular expression
module and then we're going to do
mechanize because I will need to fill
out a form and then we're going to be
using selenium so it's going to be from
selenium import webdriver import time
and then from selenium we have to
explicitly import certain things that we
plan on using to help us out so from
selenium dot webdriver
dot common Keys import keys and then
from selenium that webdriver common got
action chains import action chains
and from selenium dot desired
capabilities and port desire now we may
or may not use this one but just in case
all right so what I want to do is I need
to get in this example say like we
wanted to get the top songs from like I
had an example here of them okay so I'm
going to go to Billboard
all right so let's go to Billboard top
rock songs
so first things first we need to say
that this is the URL that we want
selenium to grab so we're going to copy
that URL and then inside of our class
we're going to create a method and we'll
just call it define will say get top
songs and what with the parameters that
the method takes is itself which is
whatever men whatever object is calling
it calling this method itself so it's
just a thing you have to get used to and
then it's going to accept at this point
let's not accept anything we'll just
call it so we'll even say just so when
our program is running we know what it's
doing we'll say print working billboard
and then let's go ahead and open our
browser with webdriver
so we'll say webdriver got will say
Firefox so we'll open it with Firefox
you can use Chrome Internet Explorer
which I don't recommend Firefox or
there's gonna be another alternative
that I'll go over in a bit but what
we're going to do now will say browser
dot git and then this is where we're
going to put in the URL that we pasted
or that kind of a copied so we're going
to get that now let's go ahead and times
sleep this is what we're using the time
module it's sleep for five seconds so
that we give the page enough time to
load okay
now let's just go ahead and take a look
at the page that we're trying to scrape
here so if we're trying to get the
number one song what we need to do is we
need to try to figure out how we can do
it because you can normally say you can
right-click and inspect element in
chrome and when you do that you
right-click you could say copy XPath and
paste but you see that as is note here
so that's going to be a problem so I'll
explain why that's a problem because you
don't really want to deal with absolute
pass when it's expats that you're
dealing with so let's say just so I can
show you what I'm talking about let's
say top rap so let's look at the top rap
songs and we'll compare that XPath with
the number one song for this list
so we right-click the elements a copy
XPath is assuming you're using Chrome
and when you notice that has these notes
so there's no way that you can predict
what the nodes are going to be and
things like that so that is not a good
way to scrape that song now what we need
to do is we need to look for something
that we can identify and you can see
that this thing says up here
ok look at the span class here a span
class chart position and then it says
pushes position static it looks like it
doesn't if we go down not everyone has
that exact same span but most of them
have or actually all of them have this
span class chart position now this
second class that gets called in is
different on different items and I'm not
really sure the significance of that we
could look into it more but it's not
really important to me all I need to
know is that this span class chart
position I need to find that and that
lets me know that we're at the one
position and then I need the next h1
element which is going to be the song
title so when I if that's what I want to
get what I would do is I would search by
XPath so let's say title will name a
variable title equals and I'll say
browser dot fine element by XPath and
then in here this is where it takes a
lot of getting used so I'm still trying
to get used to expose myself but you can
call in these two forward slashes
because if you had one forward slash it
would basically mean it basically starts
from the top of the Dom tree and works
down so it incorporates like every
element but if you have two forward
slashes and it goes directly to where it
finds this this actual item I guess
without including all of the elements
and maybe I have bad on
standing up how that works but the
bottom line is that you want to start
off with these two forward slashes and
then whatever item it is that you're
looking for some people you'll see they
do this which means anything but um or
the dumpsite will do this which means
any item that matches that in this case
we're saying any span that matches this
and we're going to put a square bracket
next to it and what we're going to do is
say contains and then after we do that
we need a parentheses and then an @
symbol and class now you can do ID as
well if it were an ID that we were
dealing with in this case we're dealing
with a class
so we're saying class and then we're
going to do a comma and a space and then
this is where we put the text that we
found and if you remember correctly it
was chart position and then we're going
to close off our parentheses we're going
to close off our square bracket and then
we're going to say forward slash text
and when you want to do the text you
actually need to say open and closed
parenthesis and then what we're going to
do is we're going to say we're going to
another contained statement here so
we're going to say the text contains and
then here we're going to give it a dot
symbol which means that it can be any
element but we know it's an h1 actually
but we're not an h1 uh we know it's a
span element what we're saying is
contains because we could specifically
say like bear with me I'm actually going
to computer I apologize I just try to
watch how I'm doing here I'm going to
get into that in another video because
that's going to be a little bit too
confusing but anyway we're going to say
we could have a variable here but
instead of doing a barium I'm just going
to hard-code a number in here and we'll
just say number one because we know that
the number one position exists there and
then what we want to do after we do that
we're going to close off our square
or parentheses or square bracket and
then we're going to do one more element
in the XPath and we're going to say get
the following h1 and then close off the
statement and then just say dot txt so
that's a big XPath statement but what
we're saying is find that span class
where it says chart position and there's
multiples so it's going to find the
first one starting at the top of the Dom
tree and it finds that first one and it
says in order for it to know the first
from the second from the third we
actually explicitly say and then find
the text within that span tag that
contains the actual text 1 so I mean if
the span class contained Chris Chris's
tutorial we could say Chris's tutorial
or whatever but in this case we know
that the span class that we're looking
for contains one so we'll say get the
following h1 text and then we'll say
print title so let's see if this thing
works I'm using visual studio so I have
to set up this class that we just
created as the start up class so I'm
going to right click if you're using
visual studio you just say set a start
up file another thing to since we have a
class we actually have to instantiate
the actual class and make an object from
that so if you don't know object wearing
a program this is a good little tutorial
to access the class and its methods we
need to create a class object so we'll
say my class object equals and then
we'll say get playlist the name of the
class open and close parenthesis now my
class object is an object made from get
playlist and I can access its methods
now which is get top songs all right now
we can run the program
and you can see so we know what our
programs doing in case it gets hung up
or something ATS saying working
billboard
one frustrating thing about selenium is
it's not the fastest thing in the world
all right so sorry I mean a gummy Cola
so you can see that it found radioactive
which is the current number one rock
song right now and that's it so it
worked exactly the way that we wanted to
so if we wanted to store that those
contents ended like a database or put in
the blonde or whatever we could do that
if you want to get the top ten songs you
can even programmatically put that in
there and say something like x equals
one and you can put a while statement
here while X is less than eleven meaning
while it's you know ten or less
we'll say this and I can say so this
will say string X because X is an
integer and it's not going to work with
a string since we're concatenating this
to the string and then as it's going to
the loop it will print a starting with
number one it'll print that and then we
need to make sure we're adding one to X
so that it's counting upwards so if I
save it and I'll run this
you know like I said selenium is not the
fastest thing in the world I mean
there's been a lot of complaints about
how to speed it up and one of the things
that you can do to speed it up is that
there's a direction being moved in to
where you're still essentially using
selenium and selenium capabilities but
you're actually doing it and without
actually pulling up a browser so they
call that headless so there's certain
things called a phantom JavaScript Ghost
dot PI Casper and a couple of others
that are going through this entire
process without actually pulling up a
web browser so it's a lot easier or at
least it's a lot quicker it's actually
not easier because you can't really see
what it's doing so this thing normally
doesn't take this long I don't know why
the hell it's hung up like that but it's
still just it's the goddamn page that's
taking forever to load
all right so that took longer than what
I would say it normally takes maybe just
right now with it might be peak traffic
or something I don't know
but the most of what you were waiting
for there was the page to load so let's
go ahead and try another thing real
quick just to see if we can make it a
little bit quicker so I'm going to close
this and one thing that you can do is go
to Google and let's look up fantÃ¶m
JavaScript which is really just phantom
jus and you see this headless webkit for
Java Script so you just download it here
I've already downloaded it what it does
it gives you a zip directory and you
unzip it and then you just place it
anywhere now where I placed it I placed
it in my C colon and then in projects
and then down here and this projects I
put phantomjs now phantom J ass this is
literally just what was in the zipped up
directory so literally you just pull
everything out of that unzipped
directory and you just put it in this
new directory that you created so you
not to install anything now when you're
calling when you're calling a phantom
JavaScript you're not going to be
calling webdriver Firefox instead you're
going to be calling webdriver dot
phantom Jas and then in here instead of
just opening closed parenthesis you I
could actually give the path to where it
can find that phantom that thing I just
showed you this phantom Jas application
file it has to know where that is at so
you have to give an absolute path to
that and then you'll see the second so
now this should run without actually
having to pull up the browser so let's
test this
so as you can see it's still not the
quickest thing in the world but that was
probably ten times quicker than selenium
so do you know just some of that well
it's still somewhat selenium but it was
ten times quicker than actually having
to pull that up in the browser so that
is definitely an alternative you might
ask well why not use phantom JavaScript
for everything well the phantom
JavaScript I can tell you that the
goddamn click functions don't work right
and this at least using Python in this
Python selenium I can't get the goddamn
thing and click on anything so I have to
actually create like a click script so
that this thing knows how to actually
click a link and things like that so I
find that very inconvenient and it's
something that I'll probably make a
video longer pretty soon but if you're
not actually clicking on links and
things like that then I would say that
you know phantom JavaScript is
definitely the way to go and you can
even use both I interchangeably within
your program if you do decide to
actually pull up another browser or you
want to request another page and you
want to kill the current session it's
just simply browser dot quit so you want
to get into habit of doing that so that
we don't have like 15 browser windows
opened up which will be slowing down
your computer so I'm going to go ahead
and finish this video here hopefully
this is a little bit better of an
explanation on how you can scrape Ajax
sites with a selenium and also with the
headless selenium using phantom
JavaScript and it would please subscribe
thank you for watching have a good night
