last video we installed Python 3.5 I
showed you how to open up the Python
editor that can't and it comes with the
Python installation called idle some
people in the Python community that you
know they Brian oh yeah Python has that
idle and it's an editor and it comes
with it's free and all this crap
there's editors for free all over the
internet nowadays so even some of the
paid editors like you know the really
expensive ones like Microsoft's Visual
Studio or even the resharper guys who
did PyCharm they even have free versions
as well but um what what I want to do is
I'm just show you an issue that has
sprung up with three point five and
trying to run idle and I'm using Windows
8.1 so I'm not sure if this is just
something set up and messed up on my end
or what but every time I open up the
idle and the way that I showed you guys
in the previous video it actually locks
up and then becomes completely
unresponsive where I can't even in the
tasks I can't do anything and you can
see that you know this is idle and I
just can't close it so it's ridiculous
um as far as I've been able to figure
out I have to actually restart the
machine so what we're going to do
instead and the reason why idle is is a
really not very good editor anyway and
the quicker we can actually use a more
industrialized editor you know to a tool
that you would most likely find at a
workplace and you know certain things
like autocomplete and all these advanced
features that typically paid editors
have that is all free and available on
an editor called Adam which is an open
source project meaning that it's just
it's free completely because it's the
entire code base that makes up the
program was just created by people
volunteering their time some programmers
just like you and I just contributing
and making a product and to be honest
with you it's pretty cool some of the
tools that it has and I'll just go ahead
and explain really quick like here's one
of them that looks really nicely or
really nice it's the Python tools were
Adam and like I said Adams completely
free so you can download it for when
those Mac Linux and you can see here
that's doing like some autocomplete
that's what I was telling you where it
automatically finds what it is that
you're trying to type and has the
automatic formatting so you can see that
seems like a cool tool and it's also
saying goes along really nicely with
this autocomplete and I really like
autocomplete and Visual Studio so this
autocomplete saves a lot of time from
having to type out stuff so it prevents
missed typing and stuff if you just make
use of it as much as you can so anyway
the quicker we can just you know as
programmers if you're just starting out
to just you know jump into an
environment like this instead of using
something like idle that's been around
for you know god knows how long at least
probably 10 years or so and hasn't
really advanced too much and in those 10
years so anyway guys are that is the
decision that I'm making going forward
with the tutorial however if you don't
want to install this you can still do
your coding an idle assuming you don't
have 8.1 and the same problems that I
have where you can't close it once you
open it but you can actually write all
your code and this editor if you want
but it's just not very good like I said
so anyway guys let's go ahead and get
started with how we install and setup
Adam for our Python installation alright
guys so in order to get Adam installed
let's go ahead and head over to the
website where we need to go I'm on
Windows I'm using 8.1 so I'm going to
use the Windows installer however I'm
going to also provide a link not only to
this page but also to another page where
you can see all the different source
code versions for the you know Apple um
free if you're on a Mac or Linux so most
of you guys are probably on Windows so
this is where we're going to go to
install so let's go ahead and click
download there alright now you guys
might get this message to Adam set up
that Exe just I'm disregarding that I
mean you can do what you want with that
but Windows has this thing like if you
don't pay a bunch of money and get your
your software signed off on by like a
Norton company or some other sort of
antivirus company which cost hundreds of
dollars then Windows gives you their
users like this untrusted thing because
um
you know they do it as a means of
protection at least that's what they say
anyway I think they do it for money but
that's just my opinion so anyway that's
it's quite annoying with that so anyway
it's going to go ahead and put that in
your downloads folder so from chrome I
can say show in folder and then we'll go
ahead and run the setup and it does a
little cool thing here so this will take
a few minutes and I'm going to be just
pausing the video so I don't bore you
guys if my computer is slower than yours
alright guys so after Adam is installed
you'll see that it does create a desktop
icon for you that you can just double
click and Adam is going to remember the
last project you have and we're going to
get into how we structure our projects
and everything but for right now this is
actually going to be holding a holding
I'm sorry opening some older projects
that I have because I've already had
Adam installed and it remembers that so
if I want to remove those folders in
case you have anything to say remove
project folder and I'm going to go and
close these files so it doesn't confuse
anything alright guys and so what we
want to do is first install autocomplete
Python here and this is the sum package
I was showing you guys earlier where
it's going to try to automatically
figure out what it is that you're trying
to write in Python and it can make
things a lot easier now one of the
things I haven't really researched is
whether or not this is going to work in
the latest version of Python in the
open-source community sometimes we can
be plagued with bugs but it's not really
going to deter our tutorial too much if
this doesn't work so let's just hope for
the best and see if it does ok so the
first thing you doing Adam is you want
to want to go over to the left-hand side
and click file and then we're going to
go to settings and settings most likely
we'll be on this screen but you're going
to go down to install and then we want
to put in the name of the package which
is autocomplete Python and if you click
enter or click on the packages button in
this single search and autocomplete
Python should be the first option it has
like 33,000 downloads so we're going to
go ahead and try that so just click
install
alright guys so that is now installed
now let's go ahead and discuss how we're
going to use Adam and how we're going to
run our programs in this tutorial what I
want to do is I want to use Adam to
write all our Python code but then I'm
going to use the command line and it can
be the command line whether you're in
Mac or Linux or Windows in my case it's
Windows but we're going to use the
command line to actually run the Python
program that we wrote in sublime so a
Python program is just a file just like
an image is a file Python code is is you
know it can be multiple files or it can
just be one single file with a bunch of
Python code in it so really our project
is just going to consist of where is it
that we're going to be storing our
Python code so let's go ahead and
discuss that now I'm going to go ahead
and for this tutorial series I'm gonna
open my file explorer and I just have a
tendency to put my project files inside
projects so let's go ahead and create a
new folder and we'll call this Python 3
5 tutorial and then all the Python code
is going to go inside of here so let's
go ahead and look at what we're talking
about we can close our settings now if
we want to click X and close that out
and what I'm going to do is create a new
file so go to file new file now one of
the things that Adam does and I am not a
hundred percent I don't use Adam all the
time to be honest with you I typically
use visual studio but Adam will go ahead
and create this new file but it has no
file type extension associated with it
so this thing doesn't know if it's an
image it doesn't know if it's a text
file it doesn't know if it's a Python
file doesn't know anything so there's
probably a way I know that you can
associate file extensions or do some
settings and things to get it to open up
every file as a specific type of file
but you know we might be writing Python
files we might be writing other language
files so I don't really want to
associate any new files opened as a
Python file so long story short when we
open this new file and it's called
untitled let's go ahead and just
immediately save it so we'll say
control s and then we're going to save
it to that new folder that we just
created so python 35 tutorial and we'll
just call this first underscore program
and then you want to give it the
extension file type so you're going to
say dot P Y all Python files are going
to end in a dot py unless it's compiled
Python then you can see you'll see
py C so if it's compiled Python file if
it is dot py c but you're typically just
going to be using dot py files which is
short for Python and that's why
everything in the Python world is PI
whatever even though
nough pi is typically P ie in English
language but um pi so python whatever
but you guys know what I'm talking about
and just to give you a quick explanation
of what a dot pyc file is because you're
going to see when you run your python
scripts that sometimes the Python
interpreter is going to create in an
identical file so say an our case our
file is going to be calling this
actually got a race um we're going to
call it first program dot py you'll see
when we run it python will create a new
file called first underscore program vyc
and all it is is actually compiled
bytecode and by code is like machine
level language like low level machine
language quick you're not going to deal
with that stuff but it's made
automatically and those files can be
loaded quicker than pi files but they're
not necessarily interpreted or run
faster than the dot py files so anyway
that's the long story short you really
don't need to confuse yourself whether
you're not going to be using it but in
case you're like why the hell did I just
get a py C file here that's all that is
you can even erase it if you wanted to
all right so let's go ahead and say save
to create our new and first Python file
so you'll see its first program dot py
now because it's now a Python file Adam
knows that it can use syntax
highlighting that's specifically built
for the Python language what I mean by
that is there
certain keywords in the Python language
like print that we're going to learn so
print you can see the different
highlight formatting the syntax
highlighting that's called syntax is the
actual code that you write are the
coding style and editors are now smart
enough to know different languages have
different types of syntax and then they
change the colors of certain parts of
that you know those language keywords to
make it a lot easier to read make it
prettier and everything so that's what
is what it means when somebody says
syntax highlighting so that being said I
want to go back to the way we're going
to structure this tutorial every program
that we write we're going to use Adam to
write it in the Python code and then to
execute it we need to open up a command
prompt so I'm in Windows I'm going to
open up the command prompt it doesn't
have to be an admin but I'm just doing
that anyway and then I'm going to CD
into the directory where my project is
stored so we put this in the Python 35
tutorial and then you can see that the
first program that py file is there now
one of the things that might confuse you
guys and hopefully I'll be smart enough
to remind people in case they jump into
this tutorial and you know without we're
starting from the beginning is that I
have two versions of Python installed if
I just type Python it's going to find
2.78 which is Python 2 series this
tutorial is all about Python 35 so I
need to be able to differentiate which
version of Python I'm using I have
python g7 used in much more places right
now so you know maybe I should just
change it over and change python 35 to
be python the default Python and then
change my python 27 to be different you
know the spelled out version I may do
that in future videos but for right now
when we run a Python program we're going
to be running it like that at least I
will be but most likely if you just have
one version of Python you just simply
need to say Python and then the name of
the file that you're trying to execute
which what do we call this first program
is what we call it dot py so you can see
that it actually didn't do anything but
it
she did run your program there's nothing
there because there's no code but that
did successfully run with the version of
Python that I installed which is Python
3.5 so anyway guys that's a lot of
talking but let's go ahead and discuss
you know how to create our first Python
program just so you know python is
interpreted from the top to bottom so
meaning code up here is going to be
interpreted before code down here it's
going to be interpreted left-to-right
meaning that if I have code over here
it's going to go top down and then left
right so this will always be read before
this so that's you know just simply put
programs get a lot more complicated than
this but just know that everything is
executed top to bottom left to right and
it's pretty much like that in any
language I've ever heard of
so that that being said let's go ahead
and use that print keyword that we
talked about earlier just to write our
first program using atom and I'm using
the command line and then I'm going to
go ahead and in this video and in the
future videos we're really going to
start getting into the Python language
but now that we have a unified way of
building our programs and running our
program the sound hopefully it'll be a
lot easier for you know brand newcomers
to the Python language so let's go ahead
and use this Python special keyword that
says print and then in parentheses
that's what these things are called
parentheses you're going to say in
double quotes hello world and the reason
why is because going back to like the 19
probably 50s or 60s or 70s or God knows
when that was the first thing that was
ever taught and written whenever you're
teaching somebody how to program you
simply say hello world to the screen
there's been times I've tried to get
clever and like cuss and stuff but I'm
going to be a little bit more
responsible here and just you know go
with the typical hello world to run our
program let's pull up our command prompt
and we're going to do the exact same
thing that we did before we're going to
save Python
except I need to say 35 you know what in
future videos I'm actually going to
change that I'm going to change my
default Python to the Python 3 series so
I do not have to do that because I'm
sure this is going to computers you guys
but I apologize for this one particular
video I have to do Python 35 you don't
so I'll press ENTER and you're going to
see that it prints out hello world not
very impressive but you actually should
be impressed with that because that is
you couldn't get any easier writing any
sort of program to be able to do
something like that
believe it or not there's quite a bit of
code that goes into even having anything
know enough about the computer to say
hey I need to print something out to the
screen well what's the screen what's the
command prompt you know the computer is
already doing so much internal stuff
that we don't have to deal with and
that's why python is an easy language to
learn all we did was simply write print
hello world in parenthesis and it
printed out to the screen a lot of
languages are you know similar in the
way that that works but python is is
definitely one of the easiest as far as
just being able to jump in write a
program and get it executing it's not
very impressive and you might even
wonder why well what the hell would a
program need to write to the screen for
but pretty much every program in the
world needs to be able to print and it
could be things like monitoring bank
statements and it's printing to the
screen alert messages or logging or you
know any sort of any sort of feedback
that you're going to get from the
program you're pretty much going to use
the print function so it is an extremely
important thing and it seems so basic
but it's something that is used over and
over again in programming languages you
have to be able to print things to the
screen and as we get into the tutorial
series and getting into the much more
advanced stuff I mean I'm going to
second-guess anything like this you know
just by oh yeah definitely that you know
print function in every single language
is definitely an important feature so
that's why it's a key word it's a
special word in Python and you can never
override that
or you never want to anyway you would
have a world of hurt if you ever did so
anyway guys thanks for watching this
video I apologize we can't really do
this in the idle editor it's better that
you jump into atom learn this way learn
it you know more production type tool to
help you even jump into the Python world
alright guys thanks for watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
