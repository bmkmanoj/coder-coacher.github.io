we looked at class inheritance which is
a really important feature of
object-oriented programming and not just
with Python but with a lot of other
programming languages out there with
Python though it also offers the ability
for multiple class inheritance which
languages like C sharp do not allow for
so it is a feature with Python that's
actually extremely well like the fact
that you can have multiple class
inheritance and in this video let's go
ahead and take a look at how we would do
something like that so we would say
class c just like we did before and it's
really just simple guys I mean it's it's
you know just just like this that's all
it is right so we just put in the name
of the classes that we want to inherit
from and this could be on and on and on
and on for all these different classes
that we want to have there's really no
limit to it one of the gotchas though
with something like this and let me go
ahead and just print this method will
say this is a multiple subclass
and if I went ahead and I instantiated a
new object down here we're going to
stand instantiate the sea object which
inherits from a and B and then we could
call my object dot multiple subclass now
this is not going to work and yet and
the reason why it's not going to work is
that one of the gotchas that I just had
mentioned is that when you're doing
multiple class inheritance you can't
actually you can't have B which inherits
from a also be called down here because
you're going to end up confusing Python
you're going to get an error message
saying because pythons not going to be
able to figure out which method to call
because b could overwrite a method on a
since its sub classing a the child has
the ability to overwrite it and that's
just one of the things I was going to
touch on in a future video but this will
cause a problem with multiple class
inheritance if you try to actually call
in something that already subclasses
something else that you're also calling
in so let me go ahead and just so just
remove that then we'll remove a from B
so this will not subclass at all and
this would actually compile and just so
you guys know let me go ahead and just
run this real quick so you guys can see
that this will not work so it says
cannot create a consistent method
resolution so what pythons complaining
about is it says hey I don't know which
class is the you know the important
class because you said so class from
this but then this says the subclass
from this but you already said too so
class this down here so it doesn't know
if you want to do the original a or if
you want to do bees a and B has the
ability to overwrite a which will see on
a future video so basically just don't
do that don't you you really shouldn't
run into this too often but the bottom
line is you don't do it you're not going
to compile it's not going to work so if
we just went ahead and removed the sub
classing of b and go ahead and call this
and then this would now work
so you see this is not going to work out
we probably should have said this will
now work so hopefully I'm clear on the
error there as to why that wasn't i
wasn't going to work since B was already
inheriting from a now just so you guys
know if we went ahead and did something
like this where we had another class y
and a class c that inherits from why and
then we wanted to call why and here this
would work just fine because you don't
have any sort of conflict clashes or
anything like that so so this would
actually compile and work just fine so
you can see so hopefully you guys
understand multiple class inheritance
and where you might be able to slip up
and in regards to how you create your
classes and how you choose to inherit
and subclass so anyway guys if you have
any questions feel free to leave a
comment and please subscribe thank you
have a good night and by</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
