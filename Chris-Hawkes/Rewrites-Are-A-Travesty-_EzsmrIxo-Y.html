doing a video tonight and I wanted to
just kind of make sure I mentioned you
guys again because I pick up some some
new viewers and sometimes I lose time
along the way and everything but I can't
read all the comments man I try to but I
can't do it
like it's impossible it's straight-up
impossible so alright so one of the
things I guess I'll talk about in this
video is that dude rewrites are always a
travesty like straight up I've seen it
firsthand the work I've done companies
I've worked for major corporations
you've seen it with oh I don't even
mention this is on hacker knows like
there was this article I was reading and
they were talking about this whole
rewrite thing they've read it just got
another two hundred million dollars in
venture capital funding they're worth
like a billion and a half dollars
something like that and that you know
now they're going to go ahead and they
rewrite their entire site from the
ground up and kind of rebrand the entire
thing so we're going to get like a whole
new UI and you know read a few eyes but
it's not very good like it's all looking
it looks like you know older style web
kind of like Craigslist is very very
plain right it's not as plain but it's
kind of an ugly sight basically but we
know how read it works like we've we've
been using reddit for what ten years now
or something
so if Freddy goes and they rewrite their
entire thing they're going to probably
learn the hard way from companies like
like if you look at failed rewrites like
just off the top of my head I can think
of like that whole Windows 8 disaster
like when Windows decided to do away
with a startup icon and all that stuff
and oh yeah you can just usually swiping
actions on a desktop and nobody's going
to mind all that you know that was a
complete disaster where even the guy the
main guy that was in charge of designing
that product ended up having to get let
go and all this stuff and you know
granted Microsoft was just looking for a
scapegoat at that point he was just like
most people hated Windows 8 and then
like you also see the same thing with
website site with Digg Digg
completely redesigned itself lost all
traffic reddit actually gained quite a
bit from that I mean you also have
things like slash data to rewrite and
work out for them but people don't like
to have to complete
the relearn things you know like if we
look at like Facebook for the most part
if Facebook went ahead and they like
completely rewrote everything and all of
a sudden like you don't have friends
anymore they're called like your best
buds or something like this you got to
go to some menu to go find and also
nobody's going to want to do that like
time is time it's precious man time is
precious even time you guys are watching
this video right now and you'll be like
Chris why do you click bait why do you
clip it on the top 10 videos well guess
what top 10 videos that's what I do I'm
I click bait but time is precious man
like people like that content so I
provided people people like what they're
used to but nobody wants to have to
relearn something to do the same task
like we learn how to use a product and
we don't want to relearn how to use it
every every two to three years the
problem is though is that you have
companies like Apple that came along and
with its curved icons and it's slick
layout sleep UI UX and everything you
know they were able to beat everybody
else in the competition we came down you
know iPods smartphone tablets even now
like the best tablet is the iPad but
they kind of like they wrote the book on
that so then other companies see what
they're going and they want to rewrite
and they want to oh yeah now we're using
curved edges so we need to go ahead and
rewrite the entire website and use
curved edges the hope the whole thing is
like it's all just a big old disaster
but the problem isn't really no problem
you're trying to solve a problem you
don't have and that's instead of making
the website better or faster look a
little bit nicer maybe rescan it or
whatever rewriting it from the ground up
doesn't usually take into consideration
like all these pitfalls are your an end
up running into you like I mean there's
going to be certain parts of the code
there where it's like there's going to
be business rules and things that you
have no idea why something is doing what
it's doing and then you won't know why
it's doing what it's doing until
eventually you go to change and go into
production all of a sudden you realize
like you know you're losing millions of
dollars a minute or an hour or you know
even worse or maybe not as bad but the
point is like there's so many edge cases
that are in large complex code bases
that you don't want to write this stuff
over and over again if you don't have to
I print for instance one example I can
give you from my own personal
experiences like I had a movies
website that had probably about 50,000
pages of dynamic content probably movie
started movies might have even been more
than that actually a lot of different
blogs and things like that there was
like reviews there was all this
different stuff it was a complex
relational database that consisted of
all this data it was running Django at
that point I think was Django 1.5 and
might have been 1.4 actually and all I
know is that I ended up going to I went
to upgrade it and I was looking at all
his legacy code and I was looking at it
I'm like man like I just don't know
what's going on here and I wrote the
 thing and I didn't know what was
going on like years later and I didn't
want to have to take the time to learn
somebody hey let me just rewrite it let
me just rewrite to say well guess why
you fast forward a couple years later
new movies doesn't exist that site
doesn't exist instead of me just keeping
what I had and working on it making it
better I decided to rewrite the entire
thing and lo and behold I never finished
it and I have a product out there not
even a product I don't have abroad I
don't have like I rewrote the
entire thing and I've got about halfway
through that process and was like whoa
this is way too much work and and
because I was an idiot I ended up
basically that's that that's another
thing always use version control man
instead of get learn how to use git you
know you learn from somebody like
anybody else I don't care if you learn
from me or from anybody else learn how
to use git you need to have a version
control system but new movies I'll tell
you straight up man it's version control
system was on my hard disk and it was on
a computer that I think is downstairs
but you know what I don't care enough to
try to get the old code back but the
point is is that I couldn't easily just
retract my old code base and get
everything working again I tried to
upgrade Django I tried to rewrite
everything it didn't work out very well
and now there's no website because a
rewrite is always harder than then it
first looks another thing to is even if
you do rewrite something yeah this is
fantastic UI you're using it you have a
nice designer who got in they use the
right colors they use the right images
and everything it looks great all of a
sudden you roll it out to your product
you realize you have 50% less efficiency
than you did before may
it's because you did 90 million lines of
JavaScript code all bundled into a
single page app and there's all kinds of
crazy-ass runtime exceptions and
everything
never there there could be some of that
or it could just simply be that your
your design just didn't agree with the
type of customers that you had or like
that people would just didn't want to
have to relearn how to like and log in
to their health insurance you know to
review an explanation of benefits or to
pay a bill or something like once again
we just our time is limited and I think
for those reasons rewrites almost never
work at least from the ground up manages
it should be like incremental rewrites
you know keep out the existing website
don't try to change things drastically
for no reason things and another thing
and I've seen this in production as well
and I've seen it in real life I mean I
want to say production is that there's
it's so often that you'll see people
make decisions on a whim without actual
user testing and you know real thorough
analysis of what they plan on changing
they think oh I think it should be
worded this way or I think it should say
this or it should do that and like don't
even take into consideration the fact
that okay we have this five step process
and play now you're saying hey we don't
need step three and that we're going to
like you know we're going to assume step
three instead of maybe you know asking
them directly or something like that we
can just assume step three and but it
may be you know what if you remove that
one step you know of this broke-ass
process where nobody knows how to use
your website anymore and that's just
kind of one example I know that's very
vague but there there are a lot of
different times though that I've seen
where people have changed things just
because they feel like that you know
that is the right thing to do and and
really that's the job of the analyst you
know the business analyst or their
systems analyst to say hey you know we
think you can do this or do that or
project owner if you're if you're in the
agile methodologies and everything like
that so the thing is though is IP
rewrites are always a disaster it seems
like you never really have the desired
result I'm trying to think of any
rewrite that I've ever seen where I go
to a web site it's completely different
from what I'm used to and and then I've
been happy with it like I can't think
that people are not had
you would change like its it's like it's
like a rat like if they didn't if they
if they masters of the maze and they
know where the cheese is at the end of
the maze like they don't want to learn
that bitch over and over again you know
like they're happy just going through
the little maze getting their cheese and
or give their cocaine or whatever it is
and then they're good but I mean with
users and website so family we spend
millions upon millions of dollars
redesigning something to have less
efficiency more more stacktrace areas or
when you're really more exceptions and
everything and and the thing is like
you're probably well do if you don't
upgrade then you're going to end up you
know look at my Craigslist or something
well it in a way though if you look at
like how successful as Craigslist been
as well as you know something like
Wikipedia right I mean those are two
sites that are very very basic but we
don't have I guess what I'm trying to
say in addition to all this is like I
don't look to the browser as like some
sort of main like source of inspiration
I'm not going to the browser I'll go to
a YouTube video and I'm looking at the
YouTube video and I'm mostly immersed in
that kind of a thing you know I'm
looking at there you know the actual
talent that is you know that sing or the
choreography or whatever the video you
know that is like you know but I'm just
viewing a video on the browser it's like
so do I really need YouTube to be
rewritten so that I can view a fricking
video on the browser probably not so I
don't know man that's just kind of my
solitude all right have a good night
guys
take care of bye hey guys so a lot of
you asked me how do I get my foot in the
door to become a programmer and I just
want to take a moment to mention dev
