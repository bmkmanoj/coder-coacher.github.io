next video and in the past video what we
did we were looking at our website and
we need some work it obviously looks
ugly as hell none of this you would want
in production probably if you're just
playing around like like I have been as
far as like just trying to explain the
concepts and I think it's fine but the
fact of the matter is I'm not a UX
expert so although I know CSS and HTML
and JavaScript it doesn't mean that I
know how to design and I know how to
pick color schemes and all the other
stuff so that said I'm gonna go to the
start bootstrap website and download one
of these simple tutorials which looks
really good I mean it's good enough for
me I'm probably gonna pay for an actual
professional image to use as a
background that fits my my website
scheme but you know as far as this it's
very simple I'll just keep the you know
the actual color scheme and everything I
kind of like it down here on the
portfolios I will actually you know
change the content over to the tutorials
that I'm featuring and then we would
obviously update some of this other
stuff that we don't really need in here
like the team and all this stuff so
anyway it's completely free which is
nice so I can just click download it'll
download here and you're gonna need to
unzip extract all this all this stuff
actually we're gonna extract let's start
with all this all these folders let's
extract it to the static directory so a
new post post static I'm gonna say yes
to all so it will overwrite everything
that is there because it's probably
going to be including jQuery and
JavaScript and all that stuff next I
need to extract the index over to the
templates folder and it's going to
already have an index there I'm going to
overwrite that so if I go to my index
you can see that we don't have any CSS
or anything none of it is found but
we're now referencing this new tutorial
or this new template so now we need to
go into the template itself so number
one we're going to copy the entire
contents of this page I'm just going to
delete it all and then I want to
actually edit the layout page so I'm
going to grab everything by ctrl a and
press control V and I'm going to
bootstrap theme all the way to replace
everything that was there so let's go
ahead and update a new post and where
all this static stuff is right we're
gonna have to go through the pain
staking process of saying you know
static and then putting so basically you
have to do that over and over again
anywhere there's an image every anywhere
there's a CSS file crap so for all this
stuff that is referenced you know so it
like this CSS file is obviously located
in the static CSS folder so we have to
go through and we have to update that
for everything so if I went ahead and i
refresh now
Oh since we cleared out everything we
need to extends in our index here so
we're gonna do the extends like I've
showed you in the previous videos and
then we'll say layout layout HTML
all right so now it is complaining
okay and we've also run into this
problem before too we need to say load
static files in order for that static to
work load static files this trips up a
lot of people by the way so it's good
that we're kind of reiterating over this
all right so now you can see that's done
wonders we're still missing all the
images and everything but that's why you
would have to go through the entire
template and paste this drunk anywhere
these images are found and all that
other stuff so like if we go down like
here's an image right here and just out
of curiosity I'm hoping that okay yeah
that'll work
alright so I was trying to make sure
that I didn't name my folder images but
that's fine so you see we have to do
this for every single image inside the
template but I'm going to actually pause
this video and do it without you guys
having to watch it because that would
probably drive you crazy but you can see
the images that are now being found are
the ones that I updated for static so
I'm gonna go ahead and do that so we
have all the images showing up alright
so I just went through the tedious
process of updating all that stuff so if
i refresh it I should have a more
accurate looking template for what we
downloaded all right cool so that is
mostly that is mostly done okay
all right now we can go through the
process of updating like our copyright
so I'm getting text right now
so here's the start bootstrap let's go
ahead and put the name of the website
and then well the tutorials like we've
shown before that was a tutorials page
and then there's gonna be the blog's
page I'll go ahead and put the contact
page on here
and for now I guess I'll just put the
about page now the way this thing is
actually set up is that it's supposed to
like scroll down to you know whatever
sort of ID is on the page but I'm not
gonna have like the entire contact and
all that stuff and be on the page like I
really feel like I don't want all this
stuff on one single page
okay
all right now I need to minimize all
this stuff down here because most of
this stuff is going to exist inside the
actual main page or the index page so
basically the header and everything I
want to get the comment so basically the
header all the way down to the footer
we're going to cut that out of the
layout and then I'll put that in the
index page but since I'm putting it in
the index I need to actually have it in
a content tag so I'll say block content
and then paste all that stuff in there
and now I need to actually have a block
content inside the master layout page
remember every block whatever you name
it whatever block you have it needs to
have an end block so now we should have
the same exact result except we broke
something oh and the reason why is
because this is the same exact error we
need to say load static files on the
index page now one thing to keep in mind
is that if you are having if you have an
extend statement at the top that always
goes on the top no questions asked
it never deviates away from that so load
static files is going to go underneath
that and while I'm in here I'm going to
have a block for the title
and it might as well copy this title
page of the title tag
so that I can make use of template reuse
I want to have you know all my titles
have new posts in this pipe sign and
then space and whatever sort of custom
title is going to be on the page so you
can see the index is the actual homepage
so we'll say home so when we refresh
this and you look at up here in the top
new posts and then pipe home so any page
like contact or about or whatever is
gonna have its own name there alright so
let's go ahead and add a few more pages
that we're going to need for this
application so we're going to have a
contact at HTML
really I can just say control see I'm
gonna copy oh that didn't work
oh whatever all right so let's go ahead
and add a few more things so we need a
contact about that HTML
we're gonna need oh you know what the
reason why I can't copy it is because
it's running that's why before we get
too much further in here let's go ahead
and actually copy everything from here
from our index page and we're going to
go into the about page we're going to
paste this will change the title to
about and then we need an end block down
here
and I'll just make this as a placeholder
for right now and really since this is
going to be on its own page we need to
put everything inside of a container
that way the content will be centered
and it's not like a hundred percent wit
and we'll add a P tag all right so this
is basically a good standard so I can go
into the contact and I'll paste this I
will change this to contact us and I'll
say contact us and instead of this what
I'm going to do is I'm actually going to
paste the contact form from the index
where it's currently sitting I can't
search if it's minified with the hell
alright so here's this contact section
we're going to take that entire thing
out and we're going to put it in the
contact HTML page
all right for now let's just add these
two pages so anytime you add a page in
order for it to be found you have to
update your URLs to find it so we're
gonna add two more listings for our URLs
list so this first one is going to be
called contact and this one's gonna be
called about and then we need to say go
to the contact view and go to the about
view if I go to the views here just
gonna copy the index and change this to
contact we're gonna get rid of the
tutorials we don't need a query our
database for anything affecting get rid
of that entire thing and we'll use the
contact template and then we'll do the
same thing for the about alright so now
both of these should be reachable except
the site's not running
all right so now it's running again
let's go ahead and try our contact page
all right so the contact page worked but
it looks like we do have a yeah we have
a typo in our extend statement obviously
which means since we copied the contact
to the about we have it in both of them
so let's go to let's see oh yeah look at
that I'm missing my my curly brace why
don't you guys tell me that you guys
were probably like ah dude you're
missing the curly brace and I can't hear
you all right
that looks like shiz night um well
probably cuz it's in a container for the
contact page so I should take it out of
the container possibly and I probably
don't need a header either
oh yeah that's much better
all right sweet won't worry about
sending emails and all that stuff later
on alright so now if I go to about that
is also a mess so it looks like
everything based on this entire
is there an About section here it's a
client's team know about look yeah there
isn't about okay so I'm gonna take the
about out of the template and also put
it inside here and I won't put it in a
container it seems like everything with
this theme for the CSS and all that
stuff to work instead of a container
just use it a section ID it can be
whatever ID want but it should be a
section and then you can see the section
contains containers and it just seems to
work well with the overall theme of the
site now this there's like a timeline
thing that's kind of sweet the only
problem with my timeline is it's like
one day so it's not gonna work too well
maybe I could put when I was born and
then when I started this channel yeah
you know I'll probably do something like
that
be silly about it I guess it looks like
I'm missing over there now what the hell
it's kind of weird
I wonder if the other pages do that
because that's jacked up
hmm all right I'll mess with that bug
later but that's definitely jacked up
okay also a new post is not going to the
homepage like it should let's go ahead
and fix that so if we go to our layout
and let's search for a new post
well that's this thing man stupid anyway
this H ref here we want it to just be
forward slash so it'll go to the root
directory and while we're at it let's go
ahead and add our privacy and the Terms
of Use so just like we did before we're
going to create some new templates so
we'll add a new item terms add HTML I
would I put it in the layout damn it I
can't drag it out of the folder when
it's running
alright so terms and then I need to do
privacy policy and for now
for now we're just going to make it like
super simple
in fact I won't even put any content
here we'll change the title terms of use
and then in privacy we'll change this to
privacy policy now there are free
resources out there that you can use to
actually generate a proper Terms of Use
that actually has the legal jargon and
stuff based on the type of site that you
have so I would definitely check that
out my sites not running again while
this thing is running let's update our
URLs and our view is also so just like
we did with you about god dang it
copy this line and then um privacy
privacy terms and terms
and then go to the views and we're going
to copy this and just like we did before
we're gonna do that for the privacy and
the terms
so now if we went all the way down here
we clicked on the privacy policy it's
not found because it needs to be
restarted but when I restart the server
it'll be found it'll go to those new
pages so you need to generate some
content for those pages so that's about
it for right now guys I think this video
is definitely running on the long side
we need to make a lot more changes to
this but I want to go ahead and start
you know I'll get into some more in the
next video this is way too long alright
guys thanks for watching please
subscribe have a good day and bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
