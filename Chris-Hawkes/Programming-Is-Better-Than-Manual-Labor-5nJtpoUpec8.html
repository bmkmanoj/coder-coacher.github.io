to you by template monster and they have
a new your web studio in seven weeks
that they're trying to get everybody to
sign up for so if you guys could please
check that out the link is in the
description tab below yeah it starts on
the 17th of April so make sure you guys
get signed up alright guys so what is up
let's talk about distractions at work
I'm not sure I just feel like talking
about it that's how my YouTube career
works but so in this video I'm going to
talk about just simply distractions and
actually one of the reasons why I like
working for companies that allow work
from home is simply because I can write
better code faster from home I don't
have as many distractions like a lot of
people say that they don't want to work
from home because they do have
distractions and I and I guess I can
understand that if they have kids
running around things like that but in
my case like my kids will be at school
and I'm at work and I'm in my home
office like it's quiet it's great you
have your dog there's nobody crunching
on ice behind you that's actually
something I've dealt with before like
I've had like my career goes back
obviously to even before coding so yeah
distractions in the workplace our job
I've said before when you have to deal
with stress from home and you come in
you have to code and that's a very
difficult thing that's something that I
try to be as cognizant of as possible
like when you're working in enclosed
quarters like you really need to invest
in like some Bose headphones and and
just kind of be mindful of people around
you it's really it's it's amazing the
office etiquette that you have to learn
going into an office workplace
especially considering the fact that I
used to have completely different jobs I
used to be a carpenter's helper when I
was like 17 and all I had to do was just
lift wood everywhere and and the job
completely sucked it was always cold and
we got up at the crack acid dawn I have
to go to some like build some McMansion
out in the middle of Northern Virginia
somewhere but yeah it was freezing cold
but there was just this one guy like
yeah he would come in every day like his
work ethic etiquette was on a pay day on
a Friday he would go out and spend all
his money with
on crack and with I guess horse quite
crack whores or whatever that he was
doing it with and then he would come
into Monday I come in on a Monday
completely strung out but this dude was
like the the number one carpenter that's
what I was exposed to right out of high
school but anyway like the office
etiquette is much different and you know
being mindful I think of other people
that you work with is pretty important
and you do learn that so clearly that
one guy didn't learn that he shouldn't
smoke crack and like he's the kind of
guy who's really never gonna be in the
office but I don't know why I mentioned
him I just for whatever reason that kind
of jumped him in my head when I think
about all the different like terrible
jobs that I've had going back and some
of the clowns that I've had to work with
throughout my life that guy was a huge
clown now he was a very skilled
carpenter though I mean this dude was
anybody was fearless too so I was afraid
of heights in fact like I hated being up
high and everything on but I still would
get on ladders and get up there and work
and everything but I hated it but this
dude like he would be definitely putting
his life on the line like on a weekly
basis and everything so the employer
definitely liked him and that's why he
put up with it and he didn't really care
like I said yeah it was just a complete
mess of situation but the blue-collar
construction field you compare that to
like to the white collar office it's
like a night and day difference and much
rather taking a white collar job for
sure like for sure but definitely
appreciate the skills and I think you
Millett II and humbleness that you learn
from blue collar stuff is also come
pretty awesome it really you know
there's a balance a lot of you guys that
are in the white collar field that
really I feel like some of you guys
probably didn't do a whole lot of blue
collar stuff but when I was in in that
fit so I did a shitload of blue collar
work I mean I was a truck driver while I
drove around Northern Virginia in DC for
four years almost delivering
refrigerators and like stoves and
everything like that but I'd have to
carry like that stuff up without you
team of people that I have to carry
refrigerators upstairs and things like
that and I was in my late teens at that
point but but that that's what I did and
like that you know that job sucks and it
wears you down and wears your back out
so all the people are like go up to suit
in a DOS school doing blow you know it's
like get your ass up you know what I
mean and stretch when you're on the
phone there's things that you can do
from within the office the kind of
combat like the dangers and everything
but when you're a carpenter and you got
to like get up there and Heights and
everything and the freezing cold
sometimes they're ice and and and
terrible weather and everything and
usually they don't work when it's that
way but you still have ice and morning
dew and everything and an early morning
construction site but the point is is
that you know it's like a night and day
difference when we're talking about the
dangers of typical blue-collar like
construction work compared to what we do
in the office it's a complete joke if
anybody that is in the white collar
field that that's unless you've had that
experience with doing those jobs
and then you know you've sat at a desk
for the last 20 years and you're like oh
we're straight you know I did that I I
really think that breaking your back you
know I 35 you'd still have you be you be
bitching that you didn't have a
white-collar job at that point you know
it's like anyway
we just have to be happy we all have to
be happy with what we have and to be
honest I'm like I'm very happy with
where I'm at like I've done those crap
jobs I've learned a lot from them I
didn't get paid much for them I was
breathing asbestosis like probably doing
all kinds I definitely doing some
insulation jobs on a couple of occasions
where I've one time we weren't even
wearing masks and like by the time we
were done like my lungs were just
hurting so it talked about that
before you know you like or really
that's why I don't complain about the
whole sedentary lifestyle of a
programmer I mean it's it's there's
things you can do like I said you can
even probably get standing desks and
things like that in your workplace if
that's I would imagine that's available
to you and if it's not you could
probably pay out of pocket to get it
done so that brings up another point I'm
gonna have a new sponsor I want to show
you
a product that I've been testing out but
anyway also guys big shout out to Simon
he pledged to $5 so he's actually giving
me five dollars per month to support
this channel which is awesome I mean
like I just bought this new mic about
three weeks ago and this cost me
like seven hundred bucks just for the
basic setup and I already had some of
the stuff plus I'm still missing another
piece a component that I need to buy
with ya so that's about all I got guys
make sure you subscribe vote uh
appreciate all those likes and
subscribes and all that stuff you guys
have helped me almost get two hundred
thousand I'm not sure where I'm gonna go
from there took me forever to get 100 so
I think when I finally hit that
milestone I'm just gonna retire I'm just
kidding no but thanks guys I appreciate
everything you've done for me and
hopefully I can keep growing all right
