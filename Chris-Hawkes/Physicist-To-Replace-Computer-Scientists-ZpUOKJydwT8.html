from Bojan or Bo Jan and I'm sorry if
I'm saying that name wrong but he was
asking me to comment on this article
that Wired had written and this article
was actually released yesterday but move
over coders physicists will soon rule
Silicon Valley so the argument being
made by this wired article is
essentially that physicists with PhDs
are coming in to come the computer
science industry especially in Silicon
Valley and essentially taking over all
the jobs that older Dumber coders that
weren't that aren't physicists used to
do and it also touches on the fact that
it's it's argument is already kind of
 in a way because physicists
going back into computer science you
know date into the earliest you know
essentially the earliest versions of any
sort of integrated circuits and embedded
systems that we've been dealing with in
all the programming languages that come
across a lot of them have been started
by mathematicians and physicists
including Dennis Ritchie which it
mentions in this article who in created
the C programming language so yes I mean
do we have physicists moving into the
programming arena yes we do because that
it's a very lucrative market there's not
very much there's not very many jobs and
academia and and so many of the older
professors apparently are staying in the
job for much longer so it's it's very
difficult and look at even Einstein
right I mean Einstein was a physicist
and ended up you know having a hard time
getting any of his papers approved that
he was submitting off to the different
journals and things like that I'm not
even sure exactly how that that industry
worked at the time but essentially he
was being rejected all over the place
for jobs as you know as being a teacher
and even associates to professors that
were already embedded throughout Europe
I mean Einstein couldn't even find a job
so he ends up taking it a job in the
Patent Office and and coming up with a
special theory of relativity which gave
way to the general theory of relativity
well he was working as a patent officer
so the physicist being in the computer
scientist is writing PHP crud apps or
even a dotnet asp.net Crudup I would
imagine they're going to be bored out of
their freaking mind
there's going to be a certain amount of
data scientist jobs that are going to
exist and they're going to be probably
very good
it's for people that are that have that
physicist back rather have a strong
mathematical background and for instance
when I said that you have to look at
different markets that you're in to
figure out what you know the what the
the the what the technologies are that
that people are looking for so for
instance in DC there is a lot of Python
jobs in the DC area but a lot of it is
defense spending and they are data
scientist types that are looking for you
know Python machine learning in advanced
mathematics like and that's what they're
using Python to do so you know for the
self-taught Python programmer like
myself you know there's probably some
you know basic web content sites and
things like that that might be looking
for a full stack developer but you know
as as somebody that's probably trying to
build a new neural network using a
ton of math and the Python programming
language they would be looking more
towards probably the PhD physicist
that's looking to make more money and an
enter a you know a a market that has a
lot of opportunity right now but it's
not really something new and like I said
this has been going on for decades so am
i concerned about losing my job to a
bunch of PhD I mean we've had a we've
been in a PhD luck for quite some time
in fact the amount of people getting
PhDs for quite a while now has exceeded
the amount of work available for people
you know with that sort of education
level so the problem is is why would you
want a PhD in physics writing something
that a self-taught developer can learn
on YouTube that that's a big question I
think that needs to be answered
now we can always over over engineer
things to the point where only a
physicist might be able to understand it
but then you're just going to get your
lunch eaten by somebody who comes along
and does it smarter faster and and more
efficiently because then we're going to
be able to pay a bunch of people that
learned how to how to do this on YouTube
or went to a coding bootcamp or
something like that to be able to do
what you're paying a physics guy to be
able to do now if I were a company that
had a lot of money like I said in the
data sciences science fields if I'm
working for SpaceX or something like
that you know there clearly there's a
much more of an e
for a physicist and and and most
companies are going to have that need
but are they going to just fill their
ranks with a bunch of PhD candidates
that couldn't find a job in academia I I
don't think that that's going to be the
case I think that I think eventually I
think it's really nothing new we've
always had to compete with with PhDs and
I've worked with some people that had
some advanced degrees master's degrees
and in fact there was at least one
person that I worked with that data of a
PhD and I worked on the code that he was
writing and I mean I can tell you some
of this stuff you know just because you
have a master's degree in computer
science doesn't necessarily mean that
you're a better JavaScript developer
than some newbie who's been doing it for
a couple of years because I've seen
firsthand people struggle to learn newer
technology so so motivation is key I
think to to being able to stay
up-to-date and to be able to compete
with some of the Brett at the best and
smartest people in the world so you know
don't let something like this get you
down for me I'm not gonna let it get me
down I've always had a chip on my
shoulder anyway because people my whole
life have told me that I'm not good
enough or that I don't make enough money
or that I'm never gonna go to this elite
school and sometimes you know they're
right but you know that I I'm not gonna
let you people try to destroy my dreams
and when I say elite schools and things
like that there's a certain amount like
I didn't do well enough in high school
that was on my own accord and things
like that so that's probably a bad
example but the fact of the matter is is
I I've been I've been treated poorly
throughout my life at different times
and I used those things to you know just
chip away a little little notch in the
old shoulder there to to try to compete
you know because because you are going
to compete no matter where you are
you're going to be competing and there
are some really bright people in the
computer science industry and some
people are very very good at
complicating matters making themselves
look good getting themselves in the
positions of power based off of their
knowledge and things like that and
that's just that's not something that's
new but hopefully physicists coming into
the computer science department at a
much greater clip will actually create
some better projects and we all
advancing I mean there's been advances
but as far as if you look at physics
itself how much has it truly advanced
since say the 1970s you know up and you
know from Einstein's day all the way to
like the 60s and 70s it seems like they
were coming up in discovering new
particles and you know they had new
theories and things and they and there
was all these new new discoveries that
were being made and now you know we
still make discoveries you know I'll
read an occasional article on
entanglement nobbut obviously
gravitational waves and things like that
that Einstein predicted 100 years ago I
have recently been in the news but but
overall for the last few decades physics
hasn't been moving along and I think the
clip that physicists would want it to be
moving along at because it certainly
isn't creating a ton of new jobs and
things like that and yes computer
science has always meshed with physics
and and it's going to continue to do so
but once again if I'm going to be
competing as a business owner and I'm
building probit crud applications which
let's be honest the majority of the web
applications out there are transactional
right they're transactional work
somebody's updating some information
they're getting some information back so
it's basically create read update and
delete and and if you're going to be
paying a bunch of physics or former
physics professors and physics PhDs to
do all that stuff I think you're going
to get your lunch eaten by a company
that's like you know what I'm gonna go
ahead and outsource some of this work
over to maybe India which they know they
already do I'm going to then I'm gonna
hire some some newer bootcamp graduates
maybe and and have them doing something
that I can pay them to do for 50 grand a
year instead of paying a hundred and
thirty for some advanced physics degree
so that will never really go away in
that regard like supply and demand
dictates what's going to happen in this
industry and that's just the main reason
why I don't think physics degrees will
just eventually replace all computer
scientists this is a clickbait type
article which everybody's guilty of
doing it whenever you're relying on
content and clicks like including myself
I'll do some clickbait said every now
then in fact you guys called me out on
it but what are you gonna do you know
what I mean if the channel wasn't
growing and if you weren't making money
then there would be no motivation to do
videos and continue to grow the channel
that's just the way the world works all
right finally guys this video is
sponsored by my sponsor Death Mountain
coding boot camp they have 12 and 16
week courses that focus on technology
that's in demand right now which
includes angular react node Jas they're
going to teach you how to use git
instead of actual projects you're going
to work directly with instructors it's
an on-site course so it's very rigorous
it's there's gonna be a lot of code
being written their goal is to get you
into the market as a junior developer
upon completion of the the 12 and 16
week courses so check out dev Mountain
coding bootcamp date the link is in the
description tab below and guys make sure
you subscribe and also vote up my video
if you would please I appreciate all the
support and you guys have a good day bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
