video we're gonna be looking at how to
get Django up and running with Python
3.5 one of the good things about Django
is that it does support Python 35
last I checked with flask it didn't it
support I think three three or three
four may have been the most support that
he could get in and it didn't work I
actually tried to run it with Python 3.5
and it wouldn't work so some of these
libraries don't officially have official
support for everything but they at least
work like Python requests and stuff but
with a flask it doesn't work at all as
of like a month ago so let's go ahead
and um let's put up a console here and
we're gonna use our Pip statement like
we've done before and we just say pip
install Django and Django is actually
already installed here but if not you're
gonna see that install as a bunch of
stuff all right now one thing you're
gonna want to run is the Django admin
command so just run Django - admin dot
py and see if there's any sort of
hesitation hopefully you get this if
everything is installed correctly you're
gonna see that you get all these um you
know these different commands here so
the next thing you want to do is you
actually want to go to a a directory and
we have Python there's no 35 tutorial
I'm putting everything for this tutorial
series inside of this folder and we'll
go ahead and create a tango project
inside of here which is where we've been
marking out of this entire tutorial
series so what we can do to get started
with Jen ago you need to actually create
a Django project so you're going to use
the Django admin dot py commands jangle
- admin - up UI start project I'll just
call it test
oh yeah because there's test files in
there Scot damn it we'll just call it
tutorial alright so if we go ahead and
do a door on the directory there you're
gonna see that we have a tutorial
directory and if I actually refresh my
where's the refresh
all right no I'm just as they include
and project
I sees what's going on I sees that
alright nevermind so that this is a
we're not gonna access it from that
folder okay so just pull up a file
explorer guys I'm not even gonna try to
explain that Visual Studio issue right
there it's not important right so we got
we got place on three five tutorial and
here's an in that tutorial file so
pythons gonna come with this managed
file that's important and then you got
the settings URLs whiskey ein it ein it
we haven't gotten to that yet that'll be
in a later module module tutorial videos
that we have all right so for now let's
go ahead and I'm gonna open up another
Visual Studio real quick so that I can
actually access the Django file the
Django setup because while we're waiting
for this to load I'll explain what the
issue was Visual Studio only keeps track
of files that I say specifically need to
go inside the project so those are
inside of an additional folder inside
the Python 35 tutorial folder under my
projects directory and the Django
installation is going to sit inside of
there not the internal file that Visual
Studio is using for this separate
project so that's why I need to visual
studio instances so I can go ahead and
open up this Django project so I'll do
that and say Python 35 tutorial I'll
just grab this tutorial joint and open
it
alright so the manager is very important
manages how you can actually run most of
your Django specific like maintenance
issues like so if you're going to be
sinking a database or installing a new
module that your Django websites gonna
be using you're gonna be using this
managed file and you don't want to mess
with it you don't want to lead it you
don't want to edit it or anything
whiskey is important because whiskey is
the protocol in which Python is able to
work using basically HTTP and webserver
so whenever you have a web server
it's interfacing whether it's Apache or
nginx or whatever it might be it's it's
using the whiskey protocol so every
Python website application is going to
have some sort of whiskey file and on
Django has this whiskey file here so you
want to keep that intact because
whenever you do deploy to a production
environment with a server you're gonna
be certain point in your app a cheese
server or whatever it is to this whiskey
file it needs to know where it sits and
it's going to sit inside the main module
of your project so with a Django project
your project here is called tutorial
because we set its start project
tutorial and it creates a module called
tutorial right and then any sort of
additional modules you build will be in
their own folder so hopefully I didn't
make that all confusing ok we'll get
into that more but here's the settings
file guys settings file is basically you
can think of it as like your dashboard
it tells you where all your important
stuff here is like you have this base
directory this global variable that's
using the OS module to point to wherever
your agenda installation is so that way
you don't have to have this long spelled
out path like projects forward slash you
know folder slash folder you know all
that crap your secret key normally I
would hide this from you guys but I
don't really care but that's something
that you want to keep to yourself a lot
of web applications have that is just
like a basically just uh there's extra
security measure the allowed hosts when
you go to production you actually need
to specifically inside this Python list
and give all the domain
names that you're allowing you could
just simply say dot and that allows
everything but you don't worry about
that until production and there's plenty
of documentation on Django's website or
on Stack Overflow for getting started
here here's your debug you're gonna set
that to true Python has a built-in
debugger to help you when you mess
things up it'll kind of you know print
out the line but those are the type of
things you don't want to be visible to
somebody that's seeing your project that
might have you know malicious intent
so you want to make sure that that is
turned to false in any sort of
production environment and then you have
your installed apps these can be
considered they're part of the Django
core apps that come with Django so
you're gonna build apps that you add on
like you might have a polling app or you
might have a banned app that that shows
all the different bands if you're doing
a music website or you could be like a
game app that is responsible for showing
all your games or whatever Django is
very modular it it it just promotes this
modularity where you build individual
components and then use your Django
settings file to kind of integrate all
those components into one particular
project so that way components can be
shared and they should be reusable so
any sort of component you build you're
gonna add that to your installed apps
but these are Django core components now
one of the best things about Django
compared to any other web framework that
I've used is that it has this built-in
admin and I've been using Django for
over five years now and the admin is
still like just friggin awesome after
five years even there's still nothing
better than that not wood no not with
ASP none of that stuff here's all your
middleware shite and you're probably
gonna just want to avoid messing with a
lot of middleware but it has a lot of
security mechanisms already built in for
you and when you're just getting started
with web Django is gonna protect you
from yourself so you don't make any sort
of major disasters you know especially
if you start taking in credit card data
and all this other stuff
Django also has a template engine so if
you've ever heard of Jinja or Jade
mustache handlebars and I could go on
forever those are all template engines
Django has their own template
it's pretty badass compared to all those
other ones the syntax to me is much
better than like Jade however I'm a big
react fan so I'm starting to get into a
like a lot of isomorphic JavaScript
which means that you can use react as a
template engine so Django can actually
execute react code on the server and
pass that down it's going to be faster
than the Django template engine I use
that with a node set up currently and
I'm very impressed with react as a as a
template engine so we're not gonna get
into that right now and then down here
you have these template context
processors just leave all that stuff
there it's all very complicated
here's your whiskey application leave
that database it's gonna come with
sequel Lite out-of-the-box sequel it
actually comes with Python by default so
what that is is basically like a very
minimized text database for very small
websites it's probably good enough but
if you're gonna have any sort of large
website you're gonna need to use my
sequel Postgres cool sequel server
Oracle something like that django comes
with all of that stuff all you simply
need to do is just say dot my sequel
instead of sequel Lite but because
you're using super-late by default it's
going to actually create a sequel file
using the sequel Lite technology and it
can be used in production like I said
but it's just it's not very robust for
large-scale websites now you have all
the static stuff we're not gonna even
get into all that but for right now
let's go ahead and just run the project
so now that we've kind of gone over that
let's go ahead and do that now has the
admin enabled by default your URLs we'll
explain that a little bit but right now
let's go ahead and go into the tutorial
folder that's the name of our Django
project and now we need to say Python
manage that py start our run server I
think it is I haven't done this in a
while locally
yeah Brun server so if everything goes
well you're gonna get this starting
development server and it gives you this
address so that if I pull up a browser
and I go to one to seven and then I
think it was eight thousand is the port
if I go to this localhost address you
should be able to see congratulations
there's your first Django powered page
so that's pretty awesome that it works
now if I go forward slash admin it
actually has a built in admin system
which is cool but right now you don't
even have a super user created because
you haven't you haven't set one up yet
so one of the first things you do when
you have a Django project if I want to
kill the server I do control C and my
command prompt and that will kill it and
what I want to do is just run Python
manage that py and then run make
migrations and then we'll migrate
all right so by calling migrate for the
first time that did not work as I
expected it so are they they've changed
this a little bit since I've been
involved so the old way was sinc DB and
I know that they're supposed to be doing
away with that but I'm not sure this
would used to always be the way in
Django how you actually create your
Super User so it looks like it's still
the way so I know that they're doing
away with that as far as um migrations
in the future you don't want to use CTP
but for the first time when you're
setting up your database you do want to
do sync DB and this thing's going to ask
you it says you have Django's all system
which you know allows you to log in and
log out on us up and says you do not
have any super users to find you want to
create once your gonna say yes and then
you give it a username so I'm gonna call
mine Seahawk and then you can give it an
email address if you want and this thing
Django will notify your email address of
problems and stuff like that if you
provide one and then here you just want
to go ahead and create a password verify
it and now you have a super user created
so if I go ahead and I restart the
server the Python management people have
run server now it's running and if I go
over to admin I can go ahead and put in
my new super user name and password and
I've now logged in so Django comes in
with this awesome authentication system
where you have groups right now there is
no groups but what you can do is you can
create groups assign certain privileges
to that group and all users instantly
that will be under this users table so
you can see this user that we created
have staff status it's a super user so
if I clicked on this joint he has
permission to do everything and what he
can do is if there's multiple you can
actually update your first and last name
in here too if you want
but all your users are going to be able
here's your groups and then all your
user permission and users are going to
be inside of here so if I went ahead and
as an example we'll go ahead and add a
user right so we'll call this man like
dumbass right so we had this dumbass
user and he has a pass where I'll just
say test one should test one two three
test one two three so I created this guy
right and um if I go over to users I now
have Seahawk and I have dumbass right
but dumbass doesn't have staff status so
you see it doesn't have that if I click
on that guy though you can see he has an
update of this first or last or email
address but you'll be able to see that
information if he has it actually hashes
the Algar the password for you so it's
encrypted so if anybody actually gains
access to your database it's um it is
protected they would have to actually
decrypt that information which a lot of
standard hackers can't do so you can see
that this person has active status but
he doesn't have staff status or super
user status so you won't be careful we
really probably only want one super user
maybe two if you really trust that
person but what I can do here is I can
specifically say that this person has
access to add users change users delete
users so you can individually give
permission so I'm using this built in
off system so the amount of programming
involved I'm going to delete this guy's
since we don't need them
the amount of programming involved for
you to be able to do this kind of stuff
out of the box is what makes Django
really good most websites need that
level of authentication if you wanted to
do that on node using like Express or
something like that good F and luck
because it's going to take you a long
time and a lot of expertise to get
something like this up and running so
for noobs that want a robust you know
tried-and-true framework Django is
pretty awesome and you guys might be
like well Python and note is cool and
all this stuff
I like note I'm actually doing a website
and node right now which is this website
I'm working on which is really cool it's
fast it's fast and everything but
there's no reason why Django can't be
for really large sites like Instagram
com is written in Django Pinterest is
written in Django we're talking about
sites to have like you know millions of
hourly traffic so
I'm not sure why that mother F my
websites phone slow anyway you guys get
my point Django is definitely fast and
if it can power websites that have
hundreds of millions of users or even
billions of hits and stuff like that you
can definitely scale it to your needs so
that's that's that guys um so well and
the Django video here at Python 3.5 and
that's how you get it installed set up
and working alright thanks for watching
