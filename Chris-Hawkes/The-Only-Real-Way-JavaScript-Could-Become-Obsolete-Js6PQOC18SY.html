question from one of the viewers Nathan
Williams he says Chris Hawkes
webassembly is an awesome progression of
JavaScript and actually indicates a
major nail in the coffin for non
JavaScript code for web development if
you could easily or can easily build a
node app that utilizes web assembly
libraries to run complex computation
just by calling the library from your
normal JavaScript code what use would a
web developer have for any language
other than JavaScript there'd be no
reason to build complex apps with
anything but javascript in the web
platform anyhow that seems to be the
obvious purpose of web assembly not to
kill JavaScript but to make it the only
language needed for serious development
so web assembly guys in case you have
never heard is a new community effort
that's actually coming together from
major companies like Microsoft Apple
Google and Mozilla and there's other
people involved as well but they're
they're coming in they're trying to find
a faster way to get the browser to
render basically compile code to to be
able to compete with them with basically
C and C++ level of being fast so you
know so we'll be able to run games and
3d applications and the browser much
more capably so we're using this thing
called the web assembly which is a short
for it well wasum is like the shorthand
name for which is the compile down
almost machine level code or I guess it
could be considered a machine level code
that would be executable within the
browser so what that means is that a lot
of the JavaScript that we write these
days is all about Dom manipulation
document object model so grab this div
you know get data from that day replace
it with this you know make an AJAX call
and bind data you know like we're doing
a lot of that with the JavaScript world
and and for web assembly to replace that
functionality I think it's you know
rather unlikely in the short term really
and when I say shorts are maybe even in
like 10 years I don't know how long they
would
for no webassembly to to really be you
know pushed in that direction I think
more focus is going to be almost like
you know when you have like the canvas
app or where you have the WebGL running
inside the browser that instead of WebGL
being run by the JavaScript runtime
it'll be run by and compiled down to
this wasum web assembly code and that'll
be executed so like any sort of gaming
and things like that would just be you
know a portion of the web page that's
being executed by most likely JavaScript
now where the the interesting thing
comes into play though is that there's
been a lot of pushback in recent you
know years basically on on the direction
that we've taken with the JavaScript
community and I think it really all
bought it relates to me it starts with
you know things like basically nodejs
being a silver bullet in order to
replace everything from Ruby on Rails to
Django and stuff like that and then we
find out that meteor is a silver bullet
that's better than anything that we've
had to date and that you know like
there's this this hype machine that is
like stronger with JavaScript and other
languages and it turns out none of that
stuff is really true and they all have
their own shortcomings and things like
that just like any other you know its
traditional web development and it may
not be sleek and cool and things like
that it's still it's all about getting
the job done and we're finding that some
of these newer tools don't get the job
done any better than anything that we
had you know ten years ago
so there's been a lot of you know
JavaScript push back in that regard and
really I think things spun out of
control when angular 2 came out or was
announced and angular 1.3 had just been
released and I mean people invested
millions of dollars in time companies
probably invested billions if you look
at the industry overall and the angular
project it was very exciting it was
popular everybody was using it you were
an asshole if you didn't use it and then
all of a sudden you react comes out so
Facebook releases react and things were
a little bit easier to deal with and
then angular because angular as soon as
you started getting into this any sort
of decent level of complexity you really
realized what a piece of you were
dealing with
and that in and it became very very
difficult to manage just like with any
web development or any sort of complex
programming where you have a lot of code
being written and a lot of going on
behind the scenes it gets very very
difficult to deal with and in angular 2
I think I think the angular community
was very I think they were concerned
about the direction that react was going
in with the reusable components because
if we look at what Google was also doing
Google sponsors the angular project but
they were also coming out with a
competing project which was called
Google polymer which was all about
reusable web components with its own
built-in CSS and JavaScript and
basically self-contained components now
the issue with that was that it wasn't
supported on anything and you had to
install all this polyfill stuff but when
react came out it was released by
Facebook they had you know basically
said hey we've been doing this
since 2011 and we already have web
components in here you can use our
virtual Dom and and just when it came to
Dom manipulation like react made it much
easier now it's time in the Sun was not
for very long before we moved to es6 and
then we started using you know
class-based components which really is
no not much different than the regular
stuff but people are like you know what
it's that you have components
managing States so now we want to have
you know shared state across components
so we had you know level of complexity
like Redux in to the to the to the
matter and this is all just kind of
explaining you know the ecosystem of
JavaScript and the fact that nothing
ever seems to get you know it's time in
the Sun for very long you know bow or
grunt baby babble webpack like you
could you could talk about all these
different these libraries and things and
all that seemed that it just seemed like
it just got kick-started with the
angular 2 things so anyway there's a lot
of talk about we need something better
we need something a little bit more
maybe types a if we need something
that's built a little bit more for
object-oriented programming for you know
traditional class-based languages
because classes don't really exist in
JavaScript I know there
future specifications you know they will
but right now it's just syntactic sugar
for prototypes and the the thing so
javascript is getting better there's no
question but people have been calling
for a replacement to JavaScript for a
very long time and we looked at that
with either the dart Jas and some of the
other things that have been attempted to
replace you know JavaScript out I don't
foresee webassembly doing away with it
but who's to say that you know what
they're like you know Python syntax is
great so we're gonna write a new Python
like lot in a language that compiles
down to web assembly and since it can be
ran in the browser and not only we're
just gonna do process intensive
compilation for like games written in
C++ engines and things like that but
we're gonna also write the entire Dom
the Dom functionality that javascript
currently works with and it's all gonna
run in this web assembly so I'm not sure
you know I don't think that that's the
direction at this time but I mean that
would be you know that would be the the
scenario I think that ends up saying you
know what JavaScript was something we
used to use but now we use javascript
you know who the hell knows I was going
to make up some sort of clever name but
nothing came to mind anyway we could
call it whatever the hell we want and
and maybe it's not JavaScript anymore at
that point it's something else and then
it compiles down to this this web
assembly so you know by by finding
another compilation you know within the
browser because right now why is
JavaScript popular it's not because it's
a great language and has all these great
features it's popular because it's the
only damn thing that runs in the browser
I mean it's the only thing that runs
inside the browser so it's the only
thing that you can target that's going
to work on an iOS and it's going to work
on an Android and Linux desktop and a
windows that like because we all use
HTTP and we all use web browsers and you
know that thing has brought a lot of
unity that we've always been seeking so
you're gonna say well why wouldn't we
just support JavaScript in blah blah
blah well once again it really boils
down to the intro
to these companies how much money does
Microsoft make I mean they make over 20
billion dollars every year just in
profit so they're gonna push their their
dotnet run you know ecosystem with their
c-sharp language they bought xamarin for
mobile apps and things like that they
don't want C sharp to become irrelevant
you know tend be replaced by JavaScript
they'd probably be looking to build some
sort of c-sharp web interface to you
know web assembly where Google might do
the same damn thing with you know with
golang and and Mozilla is gonna do the
same thing with rust and I mean who
knows what's gonna end up happening
there but I don't foresee all these big
companies just holding hands and saying
hey you know we love JavaScript and we
you know we know that it has some
shortcomings but we're building this
website as soon as we have another
standard that's gonna be followed I
really feel like these languages you
know the new languages are gonna spring
up that are gonna work towards that new
unity because right now there's been no
unity besides the JavaScript runtime and
even that is questionable because it's
not interpreted the same way across all
different browsers which gave rise to
things like jQuery and yes the the
browser is getting better or Java
scripts getting better to do things that
jQuery did for us but it still doesn't
work in a lot of browsers and if you're
targeting anything from like IE 10 down
below you still need to use some of
these tools that make your life easier
so just because you have babel and
imports and doesn't mean that the
browser supports it so anyway it's just
a lot of food for thought there and the
the modern you know will web assembly
really be oh well you know it will web
assembly replace javascript kind of
thing so i'm good question keeping
coming thanks Nathan
all right bye
hey guys so I've talked about this a lot
deb mountain coding boot camp they are
my sponsor they're one of the reasons
why i'm able to do these videos and they
offer a 12-week intensive course that
teaches you the technologies of the here
and now they're gonna focus on a lot of
things that are actually being used and
websites things like jquery and they're
gonna be using stacks like nodejs the
12-week intensive course is to try to
give people in the job market so that is
their entire focus we've all we've
talked a lot about on this channel
whether or not a college degree is worth
it i'm not the one to be able to answer
that question for you i absolutely think
that college degrees are great
especially in computer science i never
want to convince somebody to say that
they shouldn't do that you know
obviously schools like Stanford and MIT
I'm you know I'm I'm an envy of all
those graduates however there is you
know the bulk of developers that don't
necessarily need to be the MIT graduates
to actually have success in the
programming world I think I speak
relatively well for for that type of
person and with coding boot camps we're
seeing them you know try to offer more
Skills more modern-day skills because a
lot of times when you're going to a
computer science course and a major
university you're learning technology
that's already outdated by the time
you're learning it with dead mountain
and coding boot camps like what dev
Mountain offers they're focusing on
really what is hot right now so and they
also focus on a relatively you know a
small set of skills in order to make
sure that they are teaching you what you
need to know in order to be productive
in a in a workplace environment so make
sure you guys do me a favor do yourself
a favor check out the link and the in
the description tab below for more on
dead mountain coding boot camp thanks
guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
