second video this view j/s tutorial in
the last video we looked at how to
install few J s and this one I want to
focus on two-way data-binding because
this is one of the features of UJ s it's
one of the features of why angular blew
up everybody
it kind of blew their mind that you
could update data in one spot and have
it updated in another spot and really
it's not using anything spectacular just
JavaScript that makes it happen you
don't even need a full fledged library
to do it but it does it comes included
with stuff like VJ s and angular and I
just want to go ahead and show you guys
how that's done here and what we can do
is underneath this message that we have
here we're going to say inputs and then
VJ s uses these custom tags so it says
like V model which is completely custom
tag and we can say message but this
actually needs to be the data that is
being that is being updated in two areas
so the interesting thing is that when we
start typing into message is going to
display actually as part of the input
and the input is just an actual tag in
HTML that you can type text into so
after making that change if we open this
up in our and in our Chrome browser you
can see hello if UJS is actually being
displayed and that's because that is the
default message that we say down here
but because we said V model and we
passed it the message we allow this
value to change and it's going to update
the model message as we type into this
input and normally you would also say
something like type equals text because
you can have different types like
passwords and such but this is going to
dynamically take the message data and
update its value with whatever you type
in here so if we look at an example here
let's refresh I said testing so it's
actually updating as we type them right
now they're right next to each other
obviously but you could have this piece
of data all the way down here or
updating is you know some sort of
profile as they type or something but
ultimately that is what it's considered
two-way data-binding you type in one
spot or you're at you're messing
in one spot and it's updating in another
spot in real-time right away alright
guys so in the next video we're gonna
look at how to look through a list and
view j/s alright guys thanks for
watching bye hey guys so a lot of you
asked me how do I get my foot in the
door to become a programmer and I just
want to take a moment to mention dev
Mountain coding bootcamp is a 12-week
intensive course that focuses on the
technologies of the here-and-now for web
development some of the things that
they're actually teaching in the suevi
course it's geared to get you into the
industry by focusing on things like
jQuery nodejs react angular how to use
github so a lot of the things that
you're going to need to do as a
developer as soon as you start they're
going to be teaching you in this and
this coding bootcamp and the entire goal
is to be able to get you into the
industry within 12 weeks so if you guys
are interested in learning more
information about Deb mountain coding
boot camp just check out the link in the
description tab of this video thank you
for watching and have a good day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
