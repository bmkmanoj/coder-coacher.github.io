talking about react and the reason why I
want to talk about react is 16 version
16 was just released so 16 actually
makes a lot of reductions to the actual
overall file size a lot of people
bitched about react being too big too
large of a project you know too much
stuff going on under the hood but
they've actually completely rewritten or
they're they're dipping engine which
basically react components have their
own state so the state is is responsible
for making sure that if anything changes
in the state becomes stale that
everything gets rear-ended and so that
way you know it's very very responsive
looking so and it does it all you know
basically just you know automatically
because of the way that the code basis
is created so with with version 16 being
out react is definitely a frontrunner
probably if you ask me I stand it's
probably because I've been writing react
professionally for well over a year in
fact I've actually taken a few months
off of it
and I already feel like I'm out of the
loop on react already but with react I
think it you know when you look at the
the major contenders you really boil it
down to angular react and view it at
this point and I think react has has
every every other one of them beat when
it comes to just really like
productivity when it comes to
documentation larger community I mean
there's just there's a lot of there's a
lot of community backing behind react
one of the reasons why I'm making this
video about react is there's been a
problem with the react library since
Jump Street and what that problem is is
that they had a BSD license which
basically says hey you're free to use
this for commercial purposes
non-commercial purposes whatever you
want to do but it had this little clause
in there and this bsd clause that they
called it the patent plus clause and it
said that if you ended up you as a
representative as an individual or as a
company like you if you went and sued
facebook or any of its subsidiaries for
any reason react has the ability we're
not really react but facebook has the
ability to pull the copyright on react
and it says that hey you're allowed to
use this as long as you don't sue us for
patent infringement now big companies
sue each other all the time over patent
you know patent disputes and and really
just a lot of you know tedious
things that their companies deal with
day to day they sue each other for and
sometimes they do it as a strategic
advantage because maybe they have a
larger amount of cash you know cash flow
to be able to fund the lawyers and
things like that but you know clearly
companies are competitive with each
other and it's not out of the ordinary
for companies to actually get into
disputes like I can think of a you know
a major insurance company that actually
got into a major dispute with Google
back in like the early when Google was
just getting started and it was
basically about how Google was was
charging customers to display search
results and they were displaying search
results that basically the case it
surrounds this it basically said hey an
insurance company had a problem with the
way that Google would allow somebody to
take say you have an insurance company
I'm called Acme insurance and what
Google was doing is they were saying hey
you know joe bob's insurance company can
advertise with Google and they can use
the keyword for Acme insurance and when
they and they'll pay like four dollars a
click for whenever anybody searches for
Acme insurance joe bob's insurance ends
up you know on the top results and
really and there was a case brought and
and it went all the way to the Supreme
Court in the United States because
Google said hey we're allowed to do that
and that's my main Google you know uber
billionaires right but the the regular
you know the basically the insurance
company was like no that's not right
like you know we paid for that branding
we paid for that brand recognition and
if somebody's gonna search for that
brand like our brand should damn well be
at the top of the results not you know
not some other not no no not our
competitor but anyway the insurance can
be lost at that case and and Google was
deemed to be on the right to be able to
do that so it's still you know arguably
I can see both sides of that equation
but that's why we have a Supreme Court
in the United States that kind of
sometimes you have to make these
decisions and these decisions don't make
people happy like there was a comic one
time for Calvin and Hobbes and I
remember
Kelvin was was in a bad mood so he was
negotiating with I think it was uh it
was his neighbor Suzie darkens and and
they were like it was about their their
project or something they were working
on together I think
but either way like you know Calvin was
like in a bad mood so actually now I'm
getting two comics uh that one was where
he was basically saying that nothing
helps a bad mood like spreading it
around but there was another situation I
had the one I was referring to actually
was where Calvin was was was up
basically getting into a negotiation
with another person and both of the
people were upset with a deal and they
say a good negotiation leaves both sides
unhappy and that really speaks a lot of
you know but this speaks volumes if you
really think about it you know a
negotiation should be a center ground
it's something the United States can't
really seem to do in the political
landscape you know we can't find any
middle ground anywhere but um you know a
good a good compromise will leave both
people you know yearning both sides
yearning for more and that's how you
know it was a good deal but anyway
that's kind of what what I was what got
brought to mind here so the reason why I
mentioned that story is because the the
issue the problem with react and it's
been that way since I first got involved
with the react which I think if you look
back at my my earliest videos it's
probably 2014-2015 where I was first
starting to teach how to integrate react
with with Django and they had this you
know like this patent clause in there
that basically said if you sue us or any
of our subsidiaries for any reason
whatsoever then we revoke this you know
this ability to use our product and
that's a major problem because a lot of
you know a lot of inexperienced
developers or inexperienced business
people will be like oh well it's no big
deal I'll just rewrite my code into
something else should you know push push
come to shove and I have to make that
decision well that it's not as easy when
you're dealing with literally code bases
where you have entire organizations you
know hundreds of developers working on a
product and they spend years on it
you're looking at a price tag of
anywhere from like thirty million
dollars to maybe maybe a hundred million
dollars for you know basic you know
redesign reskin you know redo of a
website if you're gonna try to go
the react direction so and that was a
major major problem for a lot of major
you know for a lot of major companies
that could end up getting into disputes
because it's not even just Facebook like
I mean oh we're just you know just like
when you look at Facebook you're like oh
well Facebook's social network probably
you know if I'm in insurance or I'm in
banking it's probably not very likely
that I'm gonna get into a patent dispute
with them but the thing is is Facebook
has the ability to buy all these
different companies and stuff so you
know they they own oculus and they own
whatsapp and they own Instagram and all
this other stuff so it's like you're
dealing with a lot more than just what
the social networking company is that is
Facebook you're dealing with everything
that they own and everything that they
could own in the future so the problem
with that BSD license it was always an
issue and like I said was an issue since
Jump Street I remember when react first
came out with that BSD license clause
that people had a problem with it but
rate and Facebook basically said go
yourself you know we're gonna keep it
and and for the most part they did and
they were able to get away with it for
them for the longest time well fast
forward to just a couple weeks ago
really was probably a month ago now the
Apache foundation which is responsible
for web servers in the United States the
United States the entire world I think
something like 60% of all web servers
are still probably Apache I know I use
Apache for my hipster code website and
you know the Apache Software Foundation
has been like the leading vocal group as
far as I can you know when I think of
open-source organizations like probably
the first company I would think of as
the Apache organization so or the Apache
foundation so they ended up just
recently like a month ago said hey we're
revoking any react stuff from this
codebase like you cannot anything that
that has our license attached to it that
says hey you know this is good from the
Apache foundation you're allowed to use
it anything that has react involved in
it
no-go not going to work because they
said that license is going to cause
problems for people and not just for
people but for companies and you're
talking about you could be you're
talking about hundreds of millions of
dollars in certain cases like if it it
push came to shove like I said so nobody
wants to take that risk for a you know
even if it's a good codebase you're not
going to take that risk you're gonna go
with angular you're gonna go with view
you're gonna go with something
with a more standard bsd or MIT license
or don't be a dick license which is one
of my favorites but that's that that is
what basically apache says hey we can't
we can't get on board with this react
thing because of this license that was
about a month ago and then like a couple
weeks after that wordpress which still
powers a ton of blogs man even though
it's PHP WordPress foundation say hey
we're gonna any word drop and react as
well so like you cannot use reacting
WordPress stuff we're not going to
support it because this license is going
to create problems for our end users so
Facebook still with that information you
know they they they thought about it for
a bit and they said nope we're not going
to change it but then just yesterday
they announced that they are finally
folding in with version 16 if we look on
github they have now changed the license
finally after all these years they
finally changed it to an MIT license so
that's what this video is about that's
what the story is about I'm trying to
keep you guys informed I've been
involved in react for many years now I
think this whole BSD patent license or
plus patent license wasn't was a major
headache and it was a major headache
when you when you work for an employer
and you're trying to say hey you know I
think we should use a product as it's
great but like there are implications
beyond just being a developer you know
anyway you can't just you can't just
recommend software that has those kind
of gotchas and the license that could
end up costing a company not just
millions but you're talking hundreds of
millions of dollars in certain cases now
Facebook probably doesn't want to pull
out all stops unless they absolutely
have to but if they get into a billion
dollar lawsuit with another company
you're damn well right yeah you then
well know that they are going to revoke
that license and they're gonna be as big
of a pain in the ass as they possibly
can be now
when Facebook first came out with react
they probably didn't know how popular it
was going to be react is very popular
because it's probably the closest thing
to the web component standard you have
to kind of look that up separately but
web components is basically html's
approach say hey this is how we want to
have unique and can and isolated or you
know abstracted components basically
there that are
isolated and they have their baked in
CSS and JavaScript things like that well
react kind of created that already like
you know couple years before the web
component standard was officially
solidified so the fact that Facebook
kind of created their own web component
basis time even you know using their
virtual Dom and their their react engine
and everything they they were basically
like they were the first to market with
it they did it well you know it's it's a
pretty decent product but a lot of
people jumped on board they really liked
it I personally think what am I talking
about here I personally think that react
or Facebook really didn't know how
popular react was gonna get and then
once react started becoming a household
name where you're literally talking
about okay I need a client-side
framework I'm gonna go with react or I'm
gonna go with angular I'm gonna go with
you those three and really like I said
react leads all three in my opinion once
they kind of had that market share and
that was still with their BSD plus
patent problem they still were able to
gain that market share because I think a
lot of like I said inexperienced people
probably don't actually see the writing
on the wall maybe or maybe they just
don't care or never you know think it's
gonna affect them but for whatever
reason react they did you know become a
front-runner and I think now that my
that Facebook knows that it's a a
front-runner and not just in you know
the web space but you also now with
reactive er and react native for web
development or a mobile app development
I think Facebook is now changing their
tune to the point where it's like hey
you know we probably could have
protected ourselves and some you know
off-the-wall lawsuit with patents that
cost us you know lots of money every
year but let's do the right thing
because we have a good thing going for
us and we can be a open source market
leader because let's let's be honest
like Google polymer have you ever heard
of Google polymer I mean maybe you guys
have heard of it but nobody's using it I
mean that's Google's approach to web
components everybody is using Facebook
or Facebook's react not not Google's
polymer nobody ever so it's like they've
already kind of won and they're making
the right decision here they really are
even if it costs them you know 50
million dollars in the long run
for some sort of lawsuit that they can
you know pull out some sort of defense
on you're still probably more than
making up for that I think in brand
recognition being an industry leader and
open source and just getting people on
board with the whole face book way of
writing software so anyway this is good
news for react people companies that use
react obviously and I am going to be
coming out with a react tutorial that's
probably gonna be the next tutorial
series that come out with and it's gonna
be pretty full-featured as well like
it's gonna be like I plan at least in my
own mind at this point
I plan to map this out pretty well and
and to be relatively in-depth as well so
they like if you finish my tutorial
series and it will be free I'm hoping
that you will literally be able to mate
you know get a job writing react code
for a company and being able to use
react and wanting to use react and your
latest projects so that's my goal with
this tutorial series I plan to come out
with you in the next hopefully a week or
two alright guys thanks for watching me
