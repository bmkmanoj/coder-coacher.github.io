so in this page it's a rough around the
edges page that is strictly for
administration purposes mainly for
testing and things and I have it
restricted to just turn it off from from
you know the public to be able to see
but in this example I wanted to show you
guys how to do an AJAX loading animation
and what you need is a gif image gif and
there's actually a free location that
you can go to free I'll just call it
Ajax loading I'm not sure yeah here it
is
alright so this site I'm really good
site Ajax load info you can go ahead and
just pick any style that you want and
once you get it you're gonna download it
and it's simply gonna be an image so
once you have that image uploaded to
your website or locally and whatever
directory you store your images for your
website what we're gonna do to add a
loading animation is it's actually very
simple but this is the page that we were
looking at and what ends up happening is
we're gonna call this we're gonna click
on this anchor right here which calls
this JavaScript method and this
JavaScript method is called need rating
list it's down here it just simply goes
to Django and queries my database and
gets me all the movies that I have that
don't have ratings and a lot of this
stuff I actually touched on in a
different video but like that it's just
gonna return a JSON object but you see
here when the function is called the
first thing it does is it says Ajax
progress dot show now what is that okay
so Ajax progress is right here I have an
output div which is where my response is
gonna go but I also have this Ajax
progress which holds a message that says
please wait and then it shows it holds
an image
of my Ajax loader which is what you just
downloaded from that website assuming
that you did that now you're gonna want
a style on this that that hides it by
default so if we look at my CSS file you
can see my Ajax progress is display:none
by default so it whenever we have it on
there like it's not going to show which
is the way we wanted but the first thing
we do when this function is called is we
say show it so jQuery will then take off
its hidden attribute it will show and by
doing that it'll show the whole thing
spinning around spinning around next
thing it does it makes the Ajax call and
while it's doing this Ajax call until it
actually gets a return success message
it's gonna continue to show and show and
show and then look here after we append
our response object to the div container
up there we then just hide it again so
that's really all you need to do to show
a loading animation if you're making
like an ajax call I'm using Django so to
give you an example of what this looks
like we're gonna go to the page and I'm
just gonna click on this link and you
see our little please wait loading
animation and then it gave me a list of
movies and an AJAX JSON object so that's
how you have a loading animation thank
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
