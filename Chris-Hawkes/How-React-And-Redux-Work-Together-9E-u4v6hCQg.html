this video I want to focus more on the
essentially how react communicates with
redox and also there's a few interesting
concepts that need to be understood and
regards to how this when there's jsx
code which is really just JavaScript
gets rendered there's different ways
that you can call functions a lot of
times you don't want functions to be
executed when the code is being rendered
but then sometimes you do so I'm going
to get into that all of this video and
hopefully this will be able to help you
out a little bit now this project by the
way is very it's very similar to what
we've been working on the past we still
have our app the app contains our an
object but really it's a component
called band which has its own actions
its reduced or its store and all this
stuff is the same so here you can see
that i have this render and then there's
the sub just disregard just dispatched
across we'll get into that in just a
moment but essentially this is just
rendering a basic container with a title
of a band called bayside which is best
rock band in the world right now so if I
looked at our template that's actually
rendering all this just ignore all this
other markup this is all part of the
bootstrap template that we're using but
here you can see bayside is being
rendered by reactor to j sx code so what
I want to do is I want to create a on
click event which is going to end up
getting cold and I want to explain just
a few things so when you do an on-click
event it's actually camel casing which
means the second word is capitalized so
you want to capitalize the c there and
react knows that of this is a click
event so you know do something fire some
sort of function or something and let's
go ahead and create our function here on
our class object and we're just going to
call this stand clicks and you're going
to stay so this is just an a function
web page you click the band name so this
is just going to alert to the screen
that they click when they click it now I
want to show you something that's going
to be somewhat interesting
we need to use the disc value so that
we're referencing is this is the context
of the band so band is executing this
function if we said this stuff and click
and we call it as a function what's
going to be interesting here is that
this code is actually going to be
executed when the code renders which
means any time the dom up dude GBC you
click the band name well you didn't
click the band name so click in the band
name doesn't do it it just loads I just
fires the function on load and that's
typically not what you want you want the
the execution delays and when they
actually click on the object at hand so
let's go ahead and change this and we're
going to use something that is learning
is the arrow function which is a new
feature of the es6 code that valve will
compile to older versions but it allows
by using arrow functions they
automatically find the disc function to
two hours it is not a bind to this to
the function so you don't have to do it
manually because a lot of times you'll
see things like this you're going to see
this stuff and click top-5 so you'll see
that sometimes and by this I bands like
that line is finding this which is the
band object to this function throw five
reference console dot log it's not going
to be no
so now if I click it you can see you
played abandon but let's go ahead and
look at the console here so that we can
cube with screen laws you could get its
undefined why is it on the time because
we actually didn't ask this to the barn
function trophy past this it will not be
on the front so let's go ahead and take
a look at that now you can say that as
deep and objects that's typically what
you want it to laze execution and you
see a lot of react code that's written
in that way but we don't have to do it
that way anymore we don't have been
manually fine to this context the arrow
functions live in yet six does out for
us also it's important to understand
these this context and the disc keyboard
within the JavaScript language is very
very unique to JavaScript and and it's
very confusing so I would recommend you
go to Mozilla documentation just simply
search mozilla this and try to read all
about this this is more advanced
JavaScript or at least you know
moderately advanced JavaScript stuff but
essentially this can change so you saw
that this was undefined but when we find
this which means you know this is
binding it to this function so that it
won't be undefined and that's actually
you know what we were doing and one of
the things that we had to do but once
again we don't have to do that with a
new era function we can actually just
say you know what we're going to say
arrow functions this band click and we
also don't have to call it as a function
because we don't want we want to delay
execution
so what's what happens now
we might have an error one second
yeah I have a complete typo so the arrow
folks are by the way it's just a short
way of saying hey return that so it
needs to be in curly braces here and the
initial outer curly braces are just
telling jay effect hey I want you to
execute raw JavaScript from within the
curly braces so these two outside ones
are basically saying that and then these
these inside Jersey arrow function it's
anonymous barrel function i just
returned this van click so once again it
will find our this business value to the
function for us automatically without us
having to explicitly type all that out
I'm such an idiot so we also need the
curly braces and this time this is the
difference between if we wanted it
executed right away we wouldn't actually
tell it to return a function the way
this is being done so that's all we're
doing is we're saying on click you're
going to return this function and once
again because we use an arrow the arrow
function is going to bind this floor so
let's go ahead and refresh this we click
and now it's finally work and it
actually execute the code and you can
see that this is not undefined so it's
just fine okay so now how do we pass in
an argument well you could do the same
thing so we could say you know what
we're going to pass in an argument to
this and we can pasture in the argument
here we'll just a base size and really
you can make it much more dynamic than
that but we'll pass in this argument so
do that
although we didn't actually log or
console will just alert instead of you
click will alert the name you can see
that we're actually passing in a value
now and for the most part you're always
going to want to use this new arrows
function syntax instead of binding
because it's just it's just better it's
less let's go do seduce you see we're
passing in the argument to that function
now let's look at how do we actually
update our redox state with this value
that's being passed in and what we're
going to do that we're going to do that
now so one of the things that I'm going
up here at the top is I'm actually
saying import band action from actions
but I don't want to do that because if
you look at actions you can see that
it's actually importing this function
but the thing is is that I could have a
ton of different actions I mean there's
going to be probably fifty hundred
actions or maybe not that much but there
could be a lot of action so you don't
want to sit in for each one of them at
the top in order to be able to use them
so what we're going to do is we're going
to take import all which a star as
action from actions that way we can call
them directly now the interesting thing
is that if I went ahead and I'm going to
once again console dot log this let's
take a look at what this is and what it
has attached to it when we log it to the
screen so you can see band and when we
look at props you can see okay I got
props down in here okay that's cool and
then you can see that you have state
that is there
now another thing too is that you can
see that we have attached to our props
is this Catholic thing that's actually
old we don't want to pay too much
attention to that so I'm going to change
some of the code down here that I don't
actually want it to do this whole map
dispatch the prob dispatch is what Redux
users in order to actually execute these
these action creators and instead of
this entire map dispatch to props I'm
going to get rid of all that stuff
because I actually don't need to use it
right now so by me getting rid of all
that stuff if i look at the disco on
band you can see that under props
there's now that this dispatch and
dispatch once again is what i actually
use in order to get my action creator
back so what is the action creator it's
the object that gets returned from our
action which is really just it's a
function that gets called that returns
an object and then the object is sent to
the producer and the reducer understands
what to do based on the type of action
that's being taken as well as what
values are being passed so we can update
the state all that shit is very
complicated I understand sorry so let's
go ahead and now from within this band
dark place we can actually call our
actions directly so I can say this prop
action and then i'm going to i'm sorry
this stop raas got dispatch not just for
dispatch and i'm going to say actions
which we imported up here and then i can
just simply call the action name
directly which we have band actions
someone say copy
and then band action takes an argument
but I can pass their names which is
being passed to the function which the
values right here so I call the function
then it's called The Dispatch which is
part of redux and then it passes the
action creator the name so then we go to
our actions you can see here name names
being assigned to the name property of
the action object that gets returned fan
click is going to match within the
reducer here it's going to update this
state which is band name which is
currently empty on load it's going to
update it with a name that we passed to
it if everything goes wrong so let's go
ahead and before we do all this stuff if
you've been following along at all these
in previous videos you know that we have
the Redux tools that can monitor our
state you can see fan name is empty
right now so when we click on this dome
and actions going to be fired which is
going to call the reducer which is going
to update the state with the band name
and you can see all that stuff actually
occurred right there so that's actually
a much more short and way of being able
to call your dispatch function without
having to deal with this whole confusing
map dispatch to props bullshit and then
you know it's flying into the kinect
function and all the stuffing and
connect is actually part of the react
readouts project as far as his readouts
isn't associated just with reacts but in
order for the judah mess well that's
what you know reactor e Doakes was was
doing with it you know connects function
in order to find this dispatch and
anyway you don't do weed all the mess
with all that just just it's easier to
do it this way to call your your action
creator it's just directly with dis da
prata dispatch and once again use your
arrow functions do you don't have to
find
and then obviously if you wanted the
execution to occur right away like let's
do an example real quick of a situation
where you may want to have something
fire right away what if I said you know
what dynamic dynamic height and this
this just simply returned windows enter
enter enter height x 27 5 so this will
be this would return a value that's
seventy-five percent of the available
height for whatever browser is being
returned so that's actually what we want
to do and I'm going to just have an
image inside here it's going to image
source equals unless you
I'm just like to copy a public image on
the web which are non commissioned and
creator support an example and this will
be the image and what I wanted to do is
I want the wit to be or the height of
the image to be dynamic so I can
actually say height you know this Scott
dynamics height and then executed as a
function so that way when this renders
its going to call this function which is
going to get the inner height of you
know the available heights go x point 75
which will get chubby black stone the
available space we're turned and then
that gets assigned to this height
attribute on the image so let's see if
that works for it all right you can see
this was wi % available height because
we have all this crap open but let's go
to refresh it you can see as much it's
much bigger so if you wanted dynamic
values that javascript can render you
know on the fly like a lot of times we
use CSS and things like that but
sometimes we need a you know if we want
to truly immersive experience like we
can actually be much more creative using
javascript to get it available highs in
which to be able to restore it and
resize things you know based on the the
user's device so 75% you know it so like
CSS media queries is usually looking at
pixels and things like that as opposed
to the actual amount of and usually it's
in regards to wits and things like that
but anyway there are creative things you
can do with something like you know
dynamic dynamic determining of the
user's width and height and stuff like
that alright guys so I know that a lot
of this stuff is relatively complex but
once again I mean I would say that the
whole react redox environment is it is
complex because there is a lot of stuff
going on them you obviously have web
pack that's building and fondling
everything that you need there's you
know the j sx learning curve there is
the es6 learning curve with arrow
functions there's also just simply the
learning curve of
more advanced concepts like theirs is
this very as a desist finding and how
that can sometimes change or be
undefined and you know the way that
react can delay attribution where you
say hey I want you to return you know
this function when you click it not you
know not fire the function when you
render there's so much stuff and then
obviously this is the actual redox
learning curve of actions and reducers
and things so none of this stuff is very
easy guys but I can tell you it's in
high demand I get a lot of people that
reach out to me based on my react
knowledge because a lot of companies are
using this react stuff they know that it
can provide value although it is very
you know difficult to debug sometimes
but as we get more and more into this
series I do plan on getting into some
advanced concepts including how do we
use visual studio to debug node we're
going to be getting into like source
maps and how that can actually help us a
great deal when it comes to debugging
within the browser will get into more
about the unit tests down the road but I
actually want to get more into the
components first and and there's just
there's so much to actually cover with
this type of stuff here one of the next
things that we're going to do in this
video is our this series actually is
going to be using presentational
components also something that react has
that they're pushing a lot which is
their prop types so that you can
essentially create components with
things called prop types that ensures
that values being passed to the
component match what it is that you want
it to match so components can obviously
have strings that are passed to them but
if you are expecting a string you don't
want an object or you don't want to
function being put on with prop types
react has the ability to be able to you
know control what it is that's being
passed to the components so that way you
know that you're not going to have these
unexpected results and things like that
so a lot of stuff to cover guys they're
not and hopefully if you stay tuned to
this series you'll get up to date on all
a lot of this stuff alright thanks and
make sure you subscribe take care bye
hey guys so a lot of you asked me how do
I get my foot in the door to become a
programmer and I just want to take a
moment to mention
dev Mountain coding boot camp is a
12-week intent of course that focuses on
