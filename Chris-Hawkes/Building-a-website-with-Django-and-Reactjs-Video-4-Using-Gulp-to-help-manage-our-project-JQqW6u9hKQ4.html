access to our restful api we need to go
ahead and install a couple of tools that
is gonna make our development life a lot
easier
the first tool the most important one is
the gulp and if you hear a lot about
package managers in JavaScript they're
becoming more and more popular as these
client-side frameworks like react and
and node and other other things angular
become more popular so having a package
manager makes your life easier and we're
gonna be using gulp so gulp what it
primarily what we're gonna use it for is
for minimizing our CSS and JavaScript so
we had gone over the development
structure of our of our website that
we're building right now and we have a
static folder that's being served by a
server that's well equipped to handle
static content so we have all the stuff
we could find in one single static
folder like our CSS or JavaScript our
images will eventually be added in fact
they should be there so it's going to
upload our images to this directory and
what I want to do is I want to create a
another directory on the server which
we're going to call build and build is
what's going to end up storing
what the
this thing's giving me a problem for
some reason there it goes I don't know
what the that was that was
FileZilla just not working and just
crapping out so I restarted it all right
so I created the build folder and inside
this build for I want to create the
files we're going to use in production
which we're gonna have images jf CSS and
that's good for right now alright so
let's go ahead and download that again
so now locally build has all that crap
and um see here alright so to be able to
install gulp what we need to do is we
need to go to our directory where we
want the gulp modules and things to sit
and which is gonna be our static folder
and so we had talked about before and
I'm gonna go ahead and run a command so
I don't know miss type it but we're
going to type a few commands here
actually
we're gonna go ahead and install gulp
first and we're gonna use our sudo
command and then NPM install now if you
don't have MPM install what you need to
do is you need to actually install
nodejs nodejs comes with NPM if you've
used Python like pip install or new get
with c-sharp NPM is like the same thing
but it handles on installs a lot easier
so we're going to run the sudo install
gulp and then to - saved up so hopefully
you guys can see that and I'm gonna
change the settings just so you guys can
see a little bit easier
all right so let's go ahead and run this
command and that's going to install golf
for us now there's a couple of modules
um since we're gonna be using gulp to
minimize our CSS and also our JavaScript
we need to install two additional
modules which we're gonna do that by
saying gold so sudo npm install save dev
and then gulp uglify and that's gonna be
our JavaScript minimizer and then we're
gonna do more time for our CSS so I'm
going to go to the write command
it's this one so pseudo npm install'
save dev and then space sculpt minify
CSS alright so now that we've done that
let's go ahead and we need to create a
javascript file at the root of our
static directory which we're already in
that now I'm gonna do that with our
sublime text editor here so I'm going to
create a new file I'm not going to argue
in a new file and let's go ahead and
save this as and it's gonna go in the
static file of our music folder and
we're gonna call this a gulp file
jas all right I'm gonna go copying some
statements here cuz I don't want to
misspell anything so for starters we
need to be able to use go up in our
called a file so we're gonna bring in a
variable named gulp and we're gonna say
require gulp now we're gonna do the same
thing to use our minify CSS library that
we just installed as well so we're gonna
call that minify CSS and we're gonna end
up requiring go up minify CSS and we
just installed that so hopefully that
makes sense and then we're gonna also
use our uglify for minimizing our
javascript the idea is that in order to
keep things sane we want to be able to
develop in JavaScript in a standard
development folder which I just put it
in the static JavaScript folder and
that's where I'm gonna store everything
when I do react code and stuff like that
but when I want that to be minified when
it's delivered to the customer anytime I
can shave a few megabytes or kilobytes
off of a transfer if you start having
thousands or millions of customers it
makes a huge deal so you want to minify
your CSS meaning remove all the
whitespace and condense it all down into
like an unreadable format but the
browser can read it it's fine it's less
it has to download so it makes things
quicker but it'sit's a pain in the ass
to have to take a file if you've done
you've worked on it and then I have to
minimize it and then upload it and do
all this crap and it's much easier to
just add the the single command type you
know minify and then
gulp handle the minification process and
take it from your development folders
and then put it into your build folders
and have you know your production
environment point into your build so
hopefully that'll make more sense once
you start messing with minifying your
own stuff and have it uploaded on a
headache you'll realize that gulp is a
huge benefit alright so first things
first we're gonna go ahead and create a
gulp task which is going to handle the
minification of our CSS now there's a
similar project I have for movies but
I'm gonna change this to music since
that's what we're working on but what we
have here is we have go up saying minify
CSS is the name of the task and then
it's a function so the first thing is
going to do is it's going to go to a
directory that you choose and by using
the star dot CSS it's going to find all
the CSS files that are in this directory
and then it's going to go ahead and
minify them using the module that we
just installed up here and then it's
going to output the minimize file to an
outputted build folder which we've
declared in our static folder you guys
saw me do that at the beginning of the
video so that's going to be our minimize
CSS task now let's go ahead and do the
same thing for our JavaScript
I'm gonna change this again
all right and now in order to call
multiple tasks with a single command we
want to lump these two tasks into a
single task that we're gonna define down
below and we're going to call the task
minify so go up that task minify and
then you feed it a list and the list
just consists of the two tasks that we
just created here and there could be 15
of them if you wanted but we only have
two so at the single launch of minified
over on both of these tasks now in order
to see this thing in action we need to
go ahead and create a fake JavaScript
file so we're just going to put this in
our regular build and JavaScript folder
so that's going to be on the standard
JavaScript folder and we'll just call
this test file a s and here I just want
to put some comments
all right so here's um you know just
some standard comments but pretend that
this thing is like a huge file or
whatever and we want to see that this
thing gets minimized and in order to do
that let me go ahead and upload that so
on the server you'll see that the
javascript file is there and we also
have the build folder is empty and if
everything goes well when we upload our
gulp task file will run the command from
the static folder and if everything goes
well take this javascript file and it'll
put it in the build directory under the
java script and everything will be
minimized
so let's go ahead and see if that works
so go to your shell wherever your static
folder is and make sure you can see the
gulp file there so we're gonna run a
command gulp and then minify and if you
remember that minify is the name of the
command that we use to add meta file
right there all right so let's go ahead
and run that
all right so you can see that it
actually ran both of them minify CSS
uglify and let's see if it actually
saved to the folder hopefully there's
not give me any permission issues or
anything so if I go into my build and my
JavaScript and there it is so I refresh
that and you can see that the text files
there it's 40 kilobytes and let's look
at how much it was before it minimized
if you see it was 101 so it actually
reduced it by more than half so it's
good I know I'm downloading the build
directory and we'll take a look at it
locally and you can see all that stuff
just got condensed into one tiny line I
took out the comments and everything for
us because that's not needed for a
production environment so it's a very
very convenient way of just by simply
installing that module creating a
command line that can take all the dev
stuff and then put it into a production
environment so in our Django website
we're simply going to be pointed to for
any sort of you know customer base or
anything it's gonna be pointing to the
the build and we'll probably do like an
if statement like if my admin username
is you know logged in or whatever
deliver the you know the development
version but all the other customers can
get the production version which is
minified knowledge stuff so makes things
a lot easier so that is how we're gonna
use goal and that's really there's a lot
more that go can do in fact you can
minimize your images like reduce some
file sizes of them and things and that's
actually easy we might end up doing that
in a later video it's something I did on
my new movies website but golf was great
for that actually lumped it into the
same task but for right now for what
we're doing we're just gonna have the
minimize CSS and minimize JavaScript
which will make things a lot easier so
now let's go ahead and move on to the
next big tool that we're gonna use and
that's actually going to be Bower and I
actually want to do a separate video for
that because I don't want to lump these
two and into the same video but Bower is
gonna handle a lot of our libraries and
things that we're gonna use like react
jQuery and I'll explain more of that in
the next video
alright guys thanks for watching bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
