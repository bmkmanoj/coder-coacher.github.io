be responding to a question from one of
my viewers he had reached out to me
about a week ago and he has a series of
questions basically it's a huge
paragraph of questions about a situation
and he's reaching out to me for advice
and I told him you know I would like to
respond to him and asked him if it was
okay if I could respond in a video
without using his name because I don't
want to mean to put people out there
like that I don't want to embarrass
people or make things even worse on them
or and this is something you know
obviously it's a private question and
and he has no problem with me talking
about it publicly so I'll be you know
forewarned here that I am NOT like an
employment expert I'm not even an expert
in this industry my route a lot of you
guys know my history the fact that I
told myself to be a programmer I managed
to get my foot in the door and I've you
know pretty much excelled since I've
gotten my opportunity and IT but I never
went to school for it I never condoned
that a lot of people do go to computer
and go to computer science schools get
computer science degrees bachelor's
degrees master's degrees and I
definitely don't want to try to give
people bad advice on what to do with
their careers
but you know that said I think a lot of
people just kind of reach out because
you know they they they want you know a
human connection basically they they
want something maybe more than you know
just maybe a thread response from an
anonymous user online or something like
that so I definitely appreciate whenever
any of my viewers reach out to me and
ask me personal questions like this and
even though my responses may not be the
best I hope that it can help them maybe
it can help other people and I'm kind of
going off of the cuff here so this could
be just you know a terrible idea
and I hope that it's not but I can't
make any promises all right so a bit of
a background about this guy is that he
apparently went to college and he got an
associates degree and he actually went
into the IT field because of a
suggestion from his aunt I suppose that
you know she had told him that
IT programmers they make good money and
that it would be a good industry there
always be demand for it so apparently
that that was enough to sway him and
going down this path to get that
particular degree so he said he majored
in computer information systems and
ended up finishing in 2010 now he said
that he failed most of his math classes
in a four-year college and didn't get my
degree because of a low major GPA
apparently was below 2.0 I don't know
many classes he took but that could
obviously affect so if you if you just
took a few classes when you're working
on your four-year degree and you fail
you know what how many of them two of
them I would imagine you have you know
somewhere around the 2.0 grade point
average so depending on how many classes
you took I mean I don't know that that
would be the end of the world you know
it's certainly not great but um I don't
be too hard on yourself about that
really so anyway so basically this guy
and he's out of Brooklyn New York and he
can't find a job he's basically low he
wants to know whether or not he should
go into a career as a Quality Assurance
QA tester or whether or not it would be
better to work with databases now one of
the things he mentions about QA is that
that's actually where he's been looking
recently so in New York City he's trying
to find a QA career some sort of
entry-level position I'm assuming and he
hasn't been able to get a job and
there's a few times that he was able to
get a job apparently he's been fired 5
or 6 times so alright let's first talk
about this all right so one question at
a time he says is IT a relevant career
because as you mentioned in one of your
videos with all these jobs being
contracted and as you know a lot of
these jobs are being filled with h1
visas and some are moved to overseas so
unfortunately you are correct in the
fact that a lot of the the QA software
testing is being shipped overseas and a
lot of yeah a lot of major companies are
doing that so from what I hear maybe
most if not all of them are
actually doing that unless you're
working for some sort of US government
contractor that does not allow you know
non-american citizens to actually work
on the applications and I think you're
gonna see a lot of that in the QA field
but I got to tell you this isn't just
necessarily specific to just the IT
industry so the IT industry of late has
been feeling a lot of heat from you know
these h-1b program where companies are
actually asking for the world and
applicants you know this is apparently
the game that they play they'll ask for
you've got to be a pearl ninja with with
CSS 3.0 I got an overreact you get a no
JavaScript you gotta know gulp and all
these other different projects and
they're asking for like these you know
perfect candidates and that way they can
say that they can't fulfill them in the
United States and then you know they
seek to try to bring in h-1b applicants
who you know obviously don't fit that
that same criteria either but they can
at least bring them in for a much
cheaper salary and then they can also
treat them you know differently than
what they could with a normal American
citizen and what I mean by that is that
some of the h-1b s they're contracted to
the companies that actually hold their
their visa so you know they're willing
to work massive amounts of overtime
they're willing to get paid less money
and then that obviously puts pressure on
the American worker because you know
you're competing with somebody that you
know is you know that hard-up or they
would be willing to accept those
circumstances so you know in the IT
world we're definitely seeing that
especially with QA things like we're you
know just simple testing of software you
know you have developers that are
writing software you have analysts that
typically work for the business that are
actually writing the requirements that
the developers then use and good
developers and good enterprise
development dictates that the developers
should be unit testing all of their code
so then once everything's unit tested
you have you know this end-to-end
testing that needs to go on which they
call regression testing and a lot of
that regression testing doesn't take
intimate knowledge of the business and
it doesn't take intimate knowledge of
the system you're simply
testing you know does a plus B equals C
and a lot of that work can be then
shipped overseas and it's not like it's
easy they actually have a difficult job
and it's very mundane and it's it's very
repetitive and it's certainly not
something that I would ever want to do
personally but there's ultimately a need
for that every company has a need for
that and unless you're a government
contractor or something like that there
is a lot of QA work that's being pushed
overseas so that is a huge issue because
that's not even the h-1b issue that's
even worse that's jobs being pushed
overseas and you're not and and what you
know what remains of the QA industry in
the United States and I'm not intimately
familiar with it but I would imagine
that you know those jobs that remain
there's gonna be quite a bit of demand
from American workers that still have
that experience you know that they can
provide those services because you're
you're ultimately competing with wages
and salaries that you know from from
Indians across the world which is
obviously much less than in the United
States in fact I actually read that all
across the board when it comes to
salaries in the United States that you
know like the UK and things like that a
developer out of London might be making
like seventy thousand maybe they make a
little bit more of a the price that the
cost of living in London is ridiculous
and just as expensive as anywhere in
like San Francisco or New York City
whereas salaries like if you compare you
know United States salaries in Silicon
Valley or Washington DC or New York City
you're talking a hundred and twenty one
hundred and thirty thousand dollar a
year senior developers you know whether
it's JavaScript C sharp or Python a lot
of the guys are making one hundred and
thirty thousand dollars a year in this
industry and then the cost of living is
not that much different from a place
like London no just recently I was
reading about how Canada is experiencing
a huge brain drain to the United States
because a lot of their developers are
actually working remote for when the
ones that choose to stay in Canada a lot
of them are working remote for US
companies and getting paid less than
what they would in the US but it's still
more than what Canada Canadian salaries
are paying so and then you have even
worse than that is the Canadians coming
across the border into the United States
and taking United States position so
Canada obviously doesn't want some of
their best and brightest IT to come to
the United States but basically the
United States salaries are extremely
high right now and it's another reason
why you know companies look to try to
save money and I say shave or save
whatever you want to call it but you
know they're saving dollars by shipping
some of their QA testing overseas and
having you know Indian firms do that for
them so ultimately that was your
question is there pressure and
absolutely there is and I have a picture
of Donald Trump here so you have a lot
of this political turmoil in the United
States right now where Donald Trump is
basically you know supposedly trying to
put American jobs first and all this
other stuff and I'm definitely not
making any sort of political arguments
or anything like that but this guy has
certainly caused a lot of controversy in
the United States with the h-1b program
and now it would seem like most
candidates whether or not they're on the
Donald Trump side or they're on Hillary
Clinton or whatever side they're there
acknowledging that the h-1b program is
not helping United States wages or
salaries in the United States when it
comes to the IT world so your second
question was is QA a good career path or
something in database so I think I kind
of answered that where I said that I
wouldn't want to be in ku way QA maybe
how easier to get in an entry-level
position assuming that you're not
competing or they you that there are
some companies that still do QA over in
the United States but when I'd rather be
in database so I'm absolutely I'd rather
be an expert in Postgres or sequel
server or my sequel a DBA makes a lot of
money and there's always going to be a
demand for good debate a good database
workers including you know no sequel
might be something that you're
interested in as well may be used to try
to specialize in like a MongoDB type of
situation or maybe look at big data if
you can get into that big data is a big
buzzword so you look like Hadoop or you
know or Cassandra or some of these other
these other projects that are all about
parsing humongous amounts of data
definitely not the easiest thing to get
involved in but if you could put
anything like that on your your
resume I think it would help you wrote I
worked as a data analyst but couldn't
hold a job and got fired five or six
times and I went into that path because
my aunt told me to so I guess I'm
concerned also that you may not like
programming I mean you got into a
programming field because you thought it
would be a good industry to get into and
maybe you don't have that passion for it
so now I guess I would ask do you really
like programming do you like ITT like
computers you like sitting behind a desk
and staring at a screen all day do you
like to have to think logically and if
none of those things are true then and
then ultimately you you may not have
picked the best career path and and you
know I hope it's not too late I don't
think it's too late for anybody to
change their career path but obviously
you did get a two-year degree but that
doesn't mean that you can't use that as
an advantage to try to do something a
little bit different I mean whether it's
you being some sort of you know an
artist or working at a museum or doing
something that interests you there might
be something else out there in life that
makes more sense to you to me I was
actually working in all kinds of
different things I was a truck driver at
one point and I've done all these you
know terrible jobs and I've always
wanted to be a programmer I always
wanted to have a white-collar job and
you know I went out and I obtained it
but it was always something that I
wanted to do and even knew after doing
this now for five almost six years I
still love doing it
and I still like learning and I like
trying to become a better programmer so
I would just question what you know how
content are you at being a programmer is
that's something that you really want to
do whether it's QA or database
development or you stayed I ended up
failing most math classes in a four-year
college but I can I can tell you I'm not
the greatest at math I math obviously
takes a lot of a lot of time and
practice if you don't math you're either
right or wrong so and then you also have
to have building blocks in order to get
to where you're trying to whatever
you're working on there's ultimately
some sort of building block that it took
you that you needed to know and have
under your belt in order to to solve
this next more complicated problem so so
I guess I would question
you pass the math courses that you
needed to pass for your two-year degree
but then you ended up going to some
four-year college and then ultimately
you couldn't pass the math courses and
you fail them and and then you I guess
dropped out so I don't know how quickly
that happened but I can tell you that a
lot of programmers they don't need to be
excellent at math if you're doing game
programming then you probably have to
have a pretty good understanding of math
but for the most part if you're going to
be web and managing databases or website
stacks or even QA I don't think you need
to be an expert at math especially when
it comes to college math like calculus
and things like that I mean you don't
see a lot of that in the IT world as far
as having to crunch you know these
complex algorithms at least none in the
web programming world now as far as why
you failed I mean if you were trying to
provide for your family or you lost your
job as you've stated you've lost several
jobs working in QA jobs have been
shipped overseas or moved out of town
and though you know that's a lot of
stress that one has to be put in that
you're being put under and if you're
going to college with all that stress on
your plate you know maybe that has
something to do with you know the
struggles that you were experiencing and
maybe you know it doesn't reflect how
poorly you are at a math student it's
just was your your situation at that
point in time in your life and and then
maybe you should try to retake those
math courses that have you stumped if
you think that that would help you now
you also stated my math skills aren't
that great but the good news is is that
if you do want to brush up on your math
skills there's actually all kinds of
free resources for something like
mathematics that where you can get up to
date relatively quickly so just to name
a few of the math resources that you
could go to Khan Academy is great I
think for trying to be able to provide
interactive quizzes all this stuff is
completely free but they have all these
different math subjects from algebra 1
geometry and all you know all the way up
to linear algebra and everything so
definitely a lot of information you
could tackle there for free if you want
something a little bit more formal you
have Coursera which as
offering free mathematics courses you
know like from even places like Stanford
here's you know this stuff's a little
bit more involved but it's also free if
you just want the basic fundamentals of
the class itself and not have to have
graded material and things like that
even math comm is actually very good at
explaining some of the basic high school
math and college math and then you also
have sites like this I excel whether or
not you want to pay a few dollars but
this is actually a very very good site
and I know it looks very kiddush and
everything but this is a very good site
when it comes to trying to get up to
up-to-date on your at least high school
level math it looks like even some basic
college-level math as well but I love
the interactivity of this site but the
problem is but this particular site is
it's not free so anyway there's all
kinds of free resources that you can
tackle to try to get your math skills up
to date if that's what you feel like you
need to do now you also mentioned I
should have mentioned before because I
said I didn't mention your age but you
were 30 years old you're still young you
have a ton of time you can get your
career back on path I mean you even have
an associate's degree in computer
information systems already you have a
leg up on somebody like me except for
maybe the the longevity of a single
employer but you've also had you said
six or seven years of different IT level
jobs mostly as as a QA testing and in
development so I mean I would think that
you need to get your your resume out
there now if you're using your real name
as your your Google handle I did a quick
search on you and I could I found your
resume online through some site but what
I didn't find is I didn't see you on
LinkedIn so I'm not sure if you're on
LinkedIn or not but I think that you
should be I'm you said you're in the
Bronx New York so I didn't find anything
on you there and I don't think that's
revealing too much about you because
there's what 11 million people in New
York City but yeah definitely try to get
your profile out there indeed.com has
the ability where you can post your
resume
and you might get some spammy IT
recruiter type stuff but honestly it
sounds like that wouldn't even be a bad
situation for you right now because even
if it's a recruiter that just tries to
grab anybody they can they may have some
contacts with some companies I can try
to get your foot in the door you
mentioned that there's about a hundred
applicants probably for every QA job I
actually feel that way for probably
almost any IT job out there I think that
even people that are already like like
if I even put myself in this equation
and I said hey I want to go out and find
the job I would think that it would be
difficult for me I would have to send a
lot of different resumes because I don't
have a computer science bachelor's
degree I don't have a master's degree I
don't even have you know 10 years
computer science or IT professionalism
so I think that it's probably a struggle
for most people that are trying to find
it if I'm work in this field unless you
have some of those really highly valued
credentials from you know Stanford or
any other Ivy League or top-tier school
so I would not have that I would not let
that get you down but definitely set
yourself up with your LinkedIn even
though I've always felt LinkedIn is
somewhat worthless that at least still
shows that you have a professional
resume online so that people can find
out about you trying to blog about IT
because I mean it sounds like and this
is one of those things that I'm
concerned about because you sound like
you don't really like IT and if that's
the case then this may not be the career
for you but if you do like IT and
especially being in QA or even two
databases you should definitely try to
expand your knowledge on these these
systems and then talk about them you
should blog about them create your you
know create your own YouTube channel if
you can but start building this online
presence that shows that you actually
you know know what you're talking about
you have a lot of experience in IT and
that this is what you you want to do and
I think that that may help also there's
things like github so if you are a coder
and you actually want to get involved in
any sort of coding like that you should
definitely have a github profile or
bitbucket but at least one of those
we're
you know you have something that it
shows where you can get where you do
actually write some code and then beyond
that you know maybe you know maybe try
to set up a your own website I mean you
can buy your own domain for ten you know
ten or fifteen dollars and you can put
up a static website with just you know
some basic pretty looking HTML and CSS
that shows hey this is my profile and it
has your gallery they come and I'm in QA
I've had you know all this experience
over seven years don't talk about the
bad stuff make sure when when you're
talking about yourself don't don't focus
on any sort of negative focus on the
positive what you bring to the table
yeah you may be a bad at math right now
but who cares a lot of people are bad at
math and being bad at math doesn't mean
you can't test software I mean that's
that's ridiculous if you're writing a
physics engine that might that might get
in the way but um you know right now
don't you know don't focus on a bad
focus on a positive and I think I think
you can probably turn this thing around
because you're only thirty years old I
didn't even start coding till I was 28
and I'm 34 now and yeah I I worry about
my future as far as you know making sure
that I always try to stay up-to-date on
technology and that's just kind of part
of what it is involved in being in the
IT world but also and not just focus on
negative for yourself like I mean don't
focus on the negative of like h1 B's and
and job competition either because I
don't think that's going to help you out
at all so anyway you start there see if
the math the free math resources out
there can help you out
set up your public profiles go to
indeed.com upload your resume make sure
your resume looks good and only focus on
positive things in your resume don't say
that you struggled in math or talk about
your GPA or anything like that if they
ask you about your GPA then tell them
but you know I don't know you need to be
forthright with all this information
that you're terrible at math I mean I
don't think it's keeping anything from
from them either but ultimately you're
selling yourself and you never want to
you know put anything bad bad about
yourself in a positive light if there is
bad stuff that about you maybe you or
you don't take criticism well or
something like that you need to find
ways of trying to convey that in a
positive way
that shows that you know you're working
on it you understand that about yourself
and that that you can be coached and
that you can get along with other people
and all this other stuff so there's all
kinds of stuff you can do but out that's
what I would do initially and I hope
this advice is good because honestly
like I said I'm not an expert in any of
this but I definitely think you need an
online profile because I didn't find
hardly anything on you so anyway thanks
for watching thank you anybody else who
found this or if you're in a similar
position where you can't find the job
you're trying to get your foot in the
door and you know maybe and maybe some
of this stuff is helpful for you but I
think ultimately we all live in a social
world now and your social world should
speak for what you do especially if
you're an IT anyway guys thanks for
watching have a good night bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
