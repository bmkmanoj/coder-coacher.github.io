day and the life of Chris Hawkes this
video I just feel like rambling and
talking about stuff so I'm going to talk
about the fact I'm about to hit a
hundred thousand subscribers pretty soon
I'm at ninety five thousand now or close
to that some something like that last
time I checked and that is awesome so
thank you guys for your help in getting
me there I know it's taken me a long
time to get to 100 thousand but you know
what are you gonna do so this video
there's all kinds of different things
like I said I'm gonna talk about and a
rambling type format I do need to go
ahead and touch base with you guys every
so often I have to reach out to you and
just let you know I get an overwhelming
amount of comments and questions and
things of that people are asking me and
I've been so overwhelmed that certain
things like I just can't even respond to
them over the last like six months so
I'm doing the best I can on that but I
just want to make sure you guys know
that I'm not being rude I'm simply just
overwhelmed and you guys are probably
what Chris how many questions
and things yeah and it's really there's
no like specific amount that I could say
every single day but you're talking
about like 700 videos and 700 thousand
views or something like that last month
so that is just simply four views that
got viewed in a particular 30-day
stretch and then those generate
questions and comments and things that
have to be sifted through and then you
get the questions and concerns and
everything that reaches directly out
through your email through the channel
and then I get stuff from like sponsors
from companies asking me to work for
them from companies asking me if I know
people that want to work for them and
other youtubers asking me to interview
and stuff so just no offense sorry guys
 I can't handle it I'm trying to
do what I can
it's not like I'm trying to turn down
money but right now I'm just a little
overwhelmed but that's just that's just
what we do so I'm gonna answer a
question that a lot of you guys have
asked me whether or not I think AI is
going to take our jobs in the near
future and the answer to that question I
think is is the answer is no I've read
some articles about Google coming up
with some artificial intelligence
machine
techniques to create a bot that
basically creates its own API so
basically this artificial intelligence
robot or machine learning code bases
creating the API instead of the
engineers so immediately everybody was
like I look Google's already doing this
 like it's going to completely out
kind of completely replace this and
things like that I don't I don't really
think so kind of like with the
self-driving cars one day we're gonna be
there we're not there right now as far
as artificial intelligence like
completely learning how to do things
better than we can like basically
creating a solution to a problem better
than we can clearly a solution can be
programmed using machine learning and
things like that but to actually just
like have an artificial intelligence
machine machine and just basically say
okay build me a laptop or
something like that's just not that's
not feasible it's not it's not something
that I've seen anyway I would be very
very surprised so I'm not concerned
about it but that brings up the point of
are we getting too many people flooding
into the market whether it's boot camps
or college and things like that or there
are too many people entering into the
market and IT a lot of people will tell
you there's too many people overseas
whether it's in China or India that are
bringing over massive amounts of talent
or just competing overseas and that
programming is now just like it's
definitely a competitive a globally
competitive industry and it's not going
to get any easier and with all this this
increased workload you know or workforce
are we going to see less demand and I
think the answer that is probably yes
and no so with so I don't want to get
into politics or anything like that but
yeah so I'm not even gonna get into
politics h-1b and all that stuff clearly
competition is good and in many cases in
most cases competition is good so I
don't see myself being replaced by
overseas developers and things like that
I feel like I'm not the best programmer
in the world but I I'm definitely a
senior programmer I've had other people
tell me like I'm a great programmer I
don't think I'm a great program I think
I'm a decent programmer but if you're a
decent program
then I don't think you should have any
worry at all about your job being
replaced by some you know person whether
they're in the United States assuming
that's where you are or they're in some
other country just keep trying just keep
like in my last video you keep working
hard you're gonna get there focus on
technologies that are right in front of
you focus on technologies that are going
to get you a job or that are that's
going to complete a project for you so
that you can get a job with that not
everybody wants to be a developer though
so I understand that and one of the
interesting things about this channel is
that there's a lot of people here that
aren't necessarily computer programmers
they don't want to be a software
engineer they don't want me a software
developer an engineer they'd simply want
to use coding to be able to apply that
to their business and I'm in find ways
of being able to make money with me I
was able so and I've seen other people
learn programming simply as a hobby to
assist with other hobbies so a lot of
that sky is falling mentality it can be
brought into the self-driving cars like
a lot of people said ok as soon as we
saw self-driving cars with Google and
some of those ugly cars that were like
the first models that I had ever seen
come out everybody thought like okay
we're not gonna be cars anymore like
insurance companies are going I'm gonna
go out of business
eventually that stuff does happen like
you see the printing press there was
obviously massive amounts of jobs that
involved the printing press and that
goes out of out of date eventually and
those jobs end up getting consumed and
and sometimes just completely done away
with but like basically society is
always going to find a way of being able
to create more demand and I think with
IT the demand is like it's non-stop I
mean there's there's always some website
out there that's using some newer piece
of technology not even just a website
there's always some library piece of
code that you're using some newer newer
standard newer library newer concept
whatever sometimes just reinventing an
older concept that we kind of forgot
about or really didn't forget about but
just didn't really widely use it and we
kind of reinvent that wheel and we use
it but the thing is is that we're
constantly reinventing so we're weak we
have to relearn stuff all the time and
I've said that that is a bad thing
sometimes because it means that we
constantly have to learn but the more
you learn the faster you learn
and as long as you can devote some time
to learning it's best to have a job that
actually pays you to learn and provides
you know at least a few hours a week for
for self-study and stuff like that some
jobs do some jobs don't I would
definitely recommend you try to find the
jobs at Dube that way you're getting
paid to learn and not you know devoting
all your time away from your family and
things like that to learn how to code
but basically the fact that that IT and
technology changes so much like I'm not
concerned about us reinventing how to
build a view model you know what I mean
like how many times have we
decided that we need to recompete Lea
reinvent how we're dealing with view
models you know like but anyway yeah so
we're gonna constantly do that and and
and we can do that all day long because
honestly like I can go in there and I
can learn just as well as other people
most people anyway some are going to be
smarter some are gonna be Dumber like
you'll find where you fit in that hole
that whole scheme and be careful I guess
saying smarter and dumber some people
are smarter and Dumber just depending on
the day of the week it is you know what
I mean like I've seen some people that
have said some of the dumbest things and
like I'm like dude has this person ever
programmed a day in their life like what
they just said doesn't even sound like
they even know what a computer is I get
just terrible things but then you know
depending on the day of the week like
maybe I don't know but basically that
same example of the person I'm talking
about I've also seen him write some
excellent code things like that so it's
like whoa so yeah the self-driving cars
everybody thought we were going to
completely see an entire industry go out
of business but then just recently uber
had a self-driving car that actually
killed some lady in Tempe Arizona so
uber is now pulling and pulling in on
their their robotic or self-driving
vehicle program and it looks like
they're going to end up scrapping that
after this because this this isn't the
first time a problem has it has occurred
but this is definitely the most serious
accident involving ubers robotic vehicle
project and in this poor woman being
killed in Tempe Arizona now with
technology and IIT specifically
people asked well do I go to college I'm
never gonna be able to answer that
question for you I would probably say if
you can go to college go to college
because most companies aren't gonna hire
you without that college degree now some
are going to take the risk
most companies once you have experience
and like in my case I started my own
business and created my own websites to
create that that experience to show to a
business to get my first job and then
from there I was able to get a lot of
you know education in the workforce and
then once you have that that that work
history down like you you just you're
good to go but but a lot of you guys
will ask me if you go to college or not
and and the thing is is like I think
that going to college is gonna get you
it's obviously going to give you a much
easier time finding a job in the stem
field once you graduate I've also talked
to many IT managers who will say that
you know the college college degree
doesn't prove anything as to whether or
not you can code but it does still
lessen the risk of hiring somebody that
completely doesn't know what they're
doing which happens quite a bit and the
average person being placed in an IT
position in the United States I think is
somewhere around $20,000 or so for a
company that's about what it pay it what
company has to pay to pay recruiters to
find IT talent to bring them in and to
and to get them started basically is is
anywhere from a twenty twenty to
twenty-five thousand I believe somewhere
around that on average but that's why
companies don't want to hire the wrong
people so if they're gonna be able to
lessen their risk of hiring the wrong
people by just going with the college
degree criteria then it's a little bit
safer for them but it doesn't
necessarily mean that they're gonna hire
better programmers and create better
products but yeah so I can understand
both ways but the thing is that that
sucks with with colleges is just how
expensive it is in the United States I
have a good friend of mine who went to
college to become a lawyer so she was
going to college for about ten years and
she's looking at two hundred forty
thousand and student loan debt so
granted low interest rates on student
loan debt but that's an astronomical
amount of debt that somebody had to
accrue to just get a
to be able to get their foot in the door
and that's one of the major benefits of
IT versus something like medical or
legal and legal you got to pass the bar
in order to be able to practice law
medical you obviously have to have
different certifications depending on
what sort of health field you're going
into with IT you don't have that now you
have all these people with their college
degrees that scream that that we should
all be like either unionized or try to
have some sort of you know criteria and
certifications and but once again
the technology changes faster than law
and it changes faster than the
healthcare industry and we don't need
jackasses like that being at the
forefront of this industry trying to say
that we need to treat IT as if it's the
same field as a medical or legal field
and I think that if that ever does occur
number one software developers should
unionize probably immediately I would
think because like 50% of software
developers out there according the
stackoverflow they're stackoverflow 2018
I think was 53% of developers or
something like that didn't have a
college degree so you're talking about
almost like I think was fifty-three
fifty-three percent and I could be wrong
but either way you're looking at roughly
50% of all the developers out there
don't have a degree and some of those
developers that don't have a degree or
some of the best I've ever worked with
one of the smartest guys I've ever
worked with is an architect I mentioned
him on my channel like a month in a
month like a year and a half ago but the
dude went to school for art and he's one
of the smartest developers I've ever
seen
I'm very pragmatic his his he's always
you know using and operating under the
kiss philosophy which stands for keep it
simple stupid never tries to use the
latest greatest libraries and things
like yeah unless there's an absolute
need you have to convince him of why you
need to do it and then every once in a
while like it'll rub somebody the wrong
way because they can't use their
framework or library or whatever but the
dudes almost always right he doesn't
miss deadlines and he's paid as
an architect by a multi-billion dollar
year revenue company to be able to make
some major decisions because like I said
like his uh his decision-making skills
are just top-notch like when it comes to
just like almost everything
does the way he implements it it's
always just a very very simplistic
approach I would say to programming and
those types I think are relatively rare
in this field and anyway I've worked
with a lot of brilliant people that he's
definitely wanted he's probably the most
brilliant person I've ever worked with
that can take a very complicated subject
and then make it very very simple simple
enough for junior developers then to be
able to take and understand it and and
then build off of it so anyway that's
just my thoughts like please don't let
we don't need these people in our
industry trying to say that like we need
to be treating IT and stem as if it's
the same thing as medical or legal field
so that's my opinion if you don't like
it I'm just kidding
all right guys take care have a good day
take care so this video was brought to
you by a dead mountain coding boot camp
they're a boot camp that is based out of
Utah but they're also in Texas in
Arizona now and they have very good
reviews so make sure you guys check them
out the link is in the description tab
below they offer courses in web
development iOS development UX or user
experience design Quality Assurance and
just a few other ones in fact they're
even getting into Salesforce as well now
so they're continuing to adapt their
courses based on what the market needs
are and major companies are hiring some
of their alumni so make sure you guys
give them a look they have great reviews
and thanks for watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
