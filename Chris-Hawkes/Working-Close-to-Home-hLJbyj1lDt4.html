just want to take a quick moment to just
kind of the with you guys but
one of the basically it's awesome to be
a developer right now really is uh it
seems like for whatever reason like jobs
or just job opportunities everything or
just flying around but I'm also like I'm
happily employed and I'm doing some what
I feel like is some some really fun work
working with some really smart people
and there's just a lot of perks man from
everything from you know the wages to
like to where you work to the hours you
worked as the people you work with the
stuff that you're doing that the you
know the challenges they face day in and
day out you know even some of the newer
technologies um pretty exciting so
whether you're in like angular review
JavaScript I only really speak to the
whole you know front end side I say
JavaScript I'm in react but I only speak
to the whole the real web developers I'm
not doing a lot of data analytics or
anything like that but man being a web
developer like right now is definitely
hot I don't see that changing anytime
soon so like once you have your foot in
the door the opportunities we're just
going to continue to come staying
up-to-date I think is um it's something
that will always be like a challenge but
depending on the type of person you are
it's really not to be that big of a deal
like for me I don't think it's gonna be
that big of a deal I I do plan on
actually moving closer to my employer
sometimes like when you have commute a
lot lot of people are commuting any not
in and out of the city you know and if
you're doing an hour each way you know a
day then you're looking at roughly like
32 days of your life that you're
spending in traffic or just you know on
the road going back and forth so if you
can you know cut that commute down to
two 30 minutes or twenty five minutes or
you know let's just say 30 and keep it
simple then you know you've just freed
up 16 days of your life so if you're
like that's 16 days that I just freed up
that could have been stuff that I'm
doing on the side like you know I could
be doing like hobbies or even if I
devoted that that 16 days of you know
effort towards actually like learning
new things so um if you're going about
16 full days you know that you've just
saved in a year
and you do sit you know it's that's
obviously 16 times 24 I don't know that
I'll kind of my head but if you do that
math there that's a lot of hours that
you can devote to learning so that is
something you definitely want to
consider when you're talking about being
a programmer and having that commute so
a lot of people are working in major
cities because that's where a lot of the
tech jobs are but basically I would say
the things that I've learned you know at
least over the last six months of
getting this new job and having to
commute a little bit further is that
that is a major sacrifice you make and
that it's something that like I I don't
see the benefit of actually living so
far away so if you're in Silicon Valley
then you know obviously $150,000 is
basically like 70,000 and you know some
smaller city like Charleston South
Carolina is probably even less than that
actually but a lot of people you know
they're like well I can't afford to live
in Palo Alto or you know I'd to share a
bedroom with or you know a couple
bedroom apartment with five other people
and and and I'm paying in a two thousand
dollars a month I mean that's like
that's totally not not beneficial and
it's just crazy but then there's other
cities where it's like well Washington
DC you can get a job in DC and you're
like man I could make 110 120 thousand
in DC but I can't really afford you know
a big house and things like that you
know so people make those sacrifices
where they're like okay I'm going to
make 120 but then I'm going to move 40
miles outside the city and then you want
to a traffic in you're like man I'm
spending an hour hour and 10 over 25
somebody works for an hour and a half or
more each day and as a programmer that
is like to me it's even more
unacceptable than other professions
because you know you can use that
additional time and do everything you
need to do to make sure your remaining
up-to-date on the newest technologies
and everything else to to make sure that
you're can you continue to be marketable
but you know there's just there's a lot
of really good things I mean like dude
free lunches like I mean just depending
on the locations that you're working in
like it's just it's it's definitely a
lot of fun like I I can say that being a
developer at this point has been
the right thing to do and I don't see
that changing I really don't I know for
a fact though that certain companies in
fact companies that I've worked for in
the past major one Geico
yeah they've gone through these these
these trends where like they would go
and they'd hire a bunch of contractors
or you know h-1b visas or outsource a
lot of work and then you know every once
awhile they would pull back and they
would like you know and like reevaluate
you know what they're doing like so it
seems like they're not the only ones
that do that but they're like these
these trends that companies have and
it's it's it's hard to explain but I
guess it's different from team to team
but some companies find that benefit
where they can save money by outsourcing
or you're bringing in cheaper talent or
even just you know bringing in you know
highly paid contractors to do things
instead of having associates work for
them and then they kind of get into some
growing pains or they realize it's too
expensive and they can't really get the
results that they're looking for then
they you know they start hiring actual
associates that work for the company and
then other times you know they they pull
back from that as well you know you know
I think I can get better deal so it kind
of ebbs and flows I guess and it seems
like for whatever reason there is like a
noticeable uptick in the amount of
opportunities that appear to be within
the United States right now at least it
feels that way to me you know but
there's the amount of people that are
reaching out and you know talking about
opportunities and not just simply like
job opportunities as well but also like
hey we want to work with you know
consulting opportunity taking you
promote this product like there's just
all kinds of like buzz and activity and
things that are going on in technology
right now and I really think it has to
do with you know a lot of it really just
has to do with with you know somewhat of
an improving economy where we continue
to be more and more tech focused and the
technologies are changing so fast it's
very difficult to find people that can
fill the bill to be able to build the
software that you want to do so
remaining up the data is hugely
important and really the takeaway for
this video is just simply that being
closer to your job is going to make that
task a ton easier so all right guys
