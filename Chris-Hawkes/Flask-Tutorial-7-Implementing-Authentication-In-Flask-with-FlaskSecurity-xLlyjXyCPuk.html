this video we're going to get a little
bit complicated with what we need to do
with our application and we're probably
going to make some changes one of the
hard parts of dealing with a micro
framework is that it's not opinionated
on how you do anything including
authentication and session management
and some of the more complicated aspects
of web programming some of the problems
we're dealing with authentication is
storing and encrypting passwords just to
name you know one complicated feature
and there is something out there that a
lot of people were using called flask
login which is great but it's completely
unattended and how you actually
implement your logic like setting up
your user tables trying to mate you know
maintain like what a particular user
status is because every website has a
different different idea on whether or
not you know one of their users is
active some people some websites allow
cookies and stuff like that for
authentication some allow people to
authenticate through like Olaf and other
tools through third parties and
everything so you could go down you know
and pave your own way with something
like flask login which definitely does a
lot if you didn't have a helpful plugin
like this but we're actually going to
take it a step further and use a project
called flask security and from what I've
seen I've actually never used this
project so this is going to be my first
time of trying to implement this so I'm
sure I'll make a few mistakes along the
way in this video but we just want to go
ahead and get this installed and see if
we can get it running and it looks like
a very healthy project if we look at
github there's over 57 contributors
seven hundred seven hundred and two
commits including as recent as last
month so that's always a good sign when
a project has a lot of support like that
and hopefully with this video and more
flask websites out there that you know
they'll be able to get even more support
on github now you can actually see a few
of the requirements for this this to
work is it's going to have to have all
of this stuff right here but then you
can also see it needs to actually use
some sort of object relational mapper so
if you've been following along in this
video we already have
Flass sequel alchemy already installed
and in working so we should be pretty
good with all of the the necessary
dependencies so things are going to get
ugly with the existing code base in
order to get this thing working and
actually once we make the changes to
this I'm going to go ahead and post it
up to github so that way we have
differentiating code between what we're
about to do now compared to what we had
before so we're going to have to get rid
of things like our database table and
we're going to use the one that's
actually recommended for flask security
and if we go to the website here you can
actually get a copy of the the code that
we're going to be trying to implement
which is located at this URL so first
things first we need to go ahead and
install flask security so go to our
command line and then we're going to run
pip install flash security and then it
wants to install flash sequel alchemy
but we already have that so it's good
just oops flash security
and you can see it says building wheels
for collected packages like security the
flask login flask mail flask principal
flask WTF which is like a forms handler
so it's all kinds of projects that are
built around flask that this thing
needed because it is opinionated which
is good because we don't want to have to
reinvent or reinvent the wheel here so
it went ahead and installed all these
dependencies so we should be good to go
now let's go ahead and import the
necessary things that we will need from
this new library so underneath the
render template import statements that
we have let's go ahead and paste this
end from flask extension security import
security sequel alchemy user data store
we definitely don't need that
forward-slash there
so I'll just keep it all in one line I
don't really care about that
all right so now we're going to go ahead
and get rid of this entire user class
here this is our old database model so
we're going to get rid of all that and
we're going to paste in from the website
all this content and I'll provide the
link to this application that we're
actually building in the description so
you guys can obviously copy and paste
that or you can pause the video enough
to write all that crap in or just go to
github and grab the latest
alright so under that we're going to go
ahead and setup our flash security
and then we're also going to add a piece
of code that's going to be executed just
one time and you can see it's given a
decorator that's what these ad symbols
are they're considered decorators
they're basically just wrappers around
Python functions so that they get
executed before the actual function this
thing actually says app top is for first
request so this will only run one time
when we fire up the server and I'm going
to go ahead and just put so we'll just
put a helpful email with a password and
now the one issue that we have is that
in Postgres we already have a user table
so we're going to have a conflicting
user table that tries to get created so
we want to make sure we go ahead and go
into our database and delete our table
we can just say delete or drop and now
we have zero tables inside of our
database again alright so we made a lot
of changes we're going to go ahead and
write ooh fire up the server and see if
we've run into any problems
and we are running so that's a good sign
let's take a look at the database and
see if anything got written to it so it
might actually be where we have to go to
the page in question for this thing to
trigger there's definitely not going to
be a user name in our profile page
anymore but by going to that page and
refreshing it triggered this wrapper
function that we had decorated before
first request to fire so if we went back
to our database you can see that we now
have the three tables that it created
for us role role users and user so
that's all good let's go ahead and clean
up the index function since it's trying
to reference stuff that isn't there
anymore like this user name in fact we
can just simply change that to something
that is there like we have instead of
user name we go by email and that's
usually a good idea a lot of sites have
just you know register like login with
your email address that way it's unique
and people don't forget it
so I could say email right so go down
here I'm not going to grab all users
we'll get rid of that in fact we'll get
rid of all this crap don't even worry
about because that's not going to be in
the index function it's not a good place
for it so let's get rid of all of that
and then inside of our template for
where's our template
we're going to get rid of all these
template tags
okay so there's the first thing a few
things we need to do number one let's
get rid of this entire method that says
app before first request because we
don't want that trying to be executed
multiple times since it would try to put
duplicate records in a database which
would throw in an error we made sure
that the email is unique as you can see
here that way you're not going have
multiple people with the same email
address registered to the site and Flass
security actually comes with a lot of
forms and everything that we need which
is really helpful for like logging in
registering forgetting password doing
all that other stuff but there's a few
things that we need to add to our
configuration in order for that to take
place
number one they they handle security for
us by using CSR protection which is
called crush site forgery and that's
actually one of the major forms of
attacks that happen which is considered
cross-site scripting or XSS and this
will actually handle the security
mechanisms for you now you're going to
set a secret key and you probably want
to make it some long weird thing that's
that's you know meaningful to you but
we're just going to have you know the
default super secret since everything is
exposed on this website it's still
running locally it's not on a production
server somewhere but your secret key has
to be set and that's for CSRF security
to work and then the next thing you need
to do let me see
so I think we should be ready to just go
ahead and restart the server now and we
should be able to navigate over to like
register we know what we're missing one
extra step I thought we were one second
we need to set one more config
underneath of our secret key and its
security registerable equal true and
that's actually going to use the default
forms that are available inside flask
flash security so let's restart this one
more time and you can see we now have
the register form so as you can see this
hour already has a login form and all
that stuff so that's that's helpful that
we don't have to actually create these
views they still look like crap because
we don't have anything you know
decorating them or anything like that
but we'll get to that in the future now
let's go ahead and try to log in with
the user that was created when we
initiated Oh what the hell did I just
hit when we just created the user so
let's go over to we created these tables
if you remember we did actually create
an object and I gave it like my email
address I think
test 1 2 3 and let's go ahead and just
say yeah there it is okay so that's the
email and then test 1 2 3
sweet and we can save it and by default
it's going to re redirect to the root
directory which really looks silly
because we have a form as our root
directory in the next video we'll go
ahead and try to clean that up a bit but
we now have working a working website so
in the following videos we're going to
look at how to well I'll do this in the
next video we're going to adapt this
profile page to number one make sure
that the person is logged in in order to
be able to view it and then also be able
to pass in the data just like we did in
the last video and we'll go ahead and
we'll display everything the way we were
so loved to update the user name to
actually query by email address instead
I think that would be the best way to do
it we could do by ID of the user but
I'll figure that out when we get to the
next video all right guys thanks for
watching have a good night bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
