went ahead in or in the last video we
looked at how to actually get reactant
running and and we got it running in our
application but now we want to move on
on to redux which is going to be using
hand-in-hand with our react application
and in order to do that the first thing
we should probably focus on is actually
our actions file which is redux specific
and actions are just simply objects that
that are created that that tell redux
what to do so the best way to get into
this is just by example of coding but
we're going to create a new file in the
same directory where app Das is located
and just to keep everything all together
we're just going to call it out action
CAS and this is going to be very
relatively simple I suppose and we're
gonna say action creators and the the
action creator basically it's a function
that returns objects that's all it is
and the object is used by redux to say
okay what action got fired and what data
got passed with that action and then
redox is just going to end up taking
that inside a thing called a reducer
that we'll see in another video and it
updates the global state and that's all
reason of using redox is simply that you
have this whole global state and it's
immutable so that you can it's purely
functional in the sense that nothing
should be mutating your state so that
you always get predictable results and
that's really the entire basis behind
redux so we're gonna say export function
and we're gonna have a function that's
called counter actions and this even
this export and stuff is all probably
new to you guys with the new JavaScript
and how it's all kind of intertwining
with the nodejs ecosystem but we're
gonna just simply return one object for
right now and it's gonna be it has to
have a type so actions within redux
there's one requirement they don't have
to pass data
but the object has to have a type
attribute because the type attribute is
what tells redox of what to do so in
this case we're going to have one action
object
I'm sorry action function that returns
objects and it's only gonna there's only
one that's going to be returned for
right now which is called add so now
that we have this this counter actions
add functionality we then need to move
on and create the reducer file that the
action is going to notify when something
happens so in the next video we will
create our reducer file hey guys so a
lot of you asked me how do I get my foot
in the door to become a programmer and I
just want to take a moment to mention
dev Mountain coding boot camp is a
12-week intensive course that focuses on
the technologies of the here-and-now for
web development some of the things that
they're actually teaching in the Suevi
course it's geared to get you into the
industry by focusing on things like
jQuery nodejs react angular how to use
github so a lot of the things that
you're going to need to do as a
developer as soon as you start they're
going to be teaching you in this and
this coding bootcamp and the entire goal
is to be able to get you into the
industry within 12 weeks so if you guys
are interested in learning more
information about Deb mountain coding
boot camp just check out the link in the
description tab of this video thank you
for watching and have a good day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
