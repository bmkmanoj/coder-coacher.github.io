redux debugging much much easier with
the Redux dev tools and it's actually a
Chrome extension so you should be using
Chrome probably to be debugging nowadays
it's the best tool out there for any
sort of complex JavaScript debugging but
react Redux dev tools is actually it's a
fantastic product really that extends
the browser and what you're able to
debug using Redux and and really you
can't live without it once you start
using it so one of the things you need
to do first you go to the Chrome
extensions you can go directly this link
and I should mention it in the
description of the video hopefully all
remember to do that if not try to remind
me the so I already have it added so
once you have it added though you would
think that if I right click so if I look
at and I say inspect element and you're
gonna get this redux panel so if I
clicked on redux but you can see no
store found but you're like well why the
hell is that because I have a store and
if you've been following along all along
you know that our Redux store is set up
ok but we need to pass in an argument
and if you actually went to the github
page for this redux dev tools extension
you can see that it's telling you this
needs to be added basically the comma
where it's looking for a couple of
objects that are attached to and really
their functions or functions objects
whatever though but they're attached to
the window object which you can see that
the Chrome extension is doing so we need
to add that to the store so where we
actually do our constant store here
right before the closing parentheses go
ahead and just paste in and make sure
your comma is there and you're pasting
in these two additional comments here
for it to look for the store so if I
save it
make sure your your web pack is
listening because this is gonna rebuild
it and then if we go into and we we've
refreshed the application you can see we
now get the redux tool that's working
and what's cool is that like I can view
the state from here so you can see we
have this global counter we have the
routing State so this is all the states
for the path name if I were to change
the path name to test
and we look at routing or I go back to
stage we look at locations before
transition path name test and just any
way if you wanted to like kind of look
at some of these factors and everything
I don't really know too much about you
know the routing part of the reactor you
gloat you know the reactor outer project
but you can see that if we were to
increment the counter and let's go back
to this page I can go ahead and I can
look at the state here so if I start you
can see it updating in real time you can
also see the calls that are being made
so and trying to I'm actually messing
with this I probably should have tried
to hello so you can manually call your
type actions because remember actions
and redux are just JavaScript objects
that have a type which is the the you
know the requirement of an action object
and redux and the type says add and
right now add if you fire it manually
from the tool as you can see it's
actually calling so as your state gets
more complex you can actually manipulate
your state inside of here but you can
see any way it also has different things
for testing everything like that too so
anyway guys make sure you definitely
install that tool because it'll make
your life a lot easier alright make sure
you subscribe vote up and share please
have a good day bye hey guys so a lot of
you asked me how do I get my foot in the
door to become a programmer I just want
to take a moment to mention dev Mountain
coding boot camp is a 12-week intensive
course that focuses on the technologies
of the here-and-now for web development
some of the things that they're actually
teaching in the Suevi course it's geared
to get you into the industry by focusing
on things like jQuery nodejs react
angular how to use github so a lot of
the things that you're going to need to
do as a developer as soon as you start
they're going to be teaching you in this
and this code
boot camp and the entire goal is to be
able to get you into the industry within
12 weeks so if you guys are interested
in learning more information about Deb
mountain coding boot camp just check out
the link in the description tab of this
