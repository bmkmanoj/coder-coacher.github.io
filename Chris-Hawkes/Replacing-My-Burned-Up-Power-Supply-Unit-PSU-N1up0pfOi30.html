HP Envy I bought a new graphics card for
this joint and you can see the graphics
card is here it's like a gtx 960 and i
actually tried to I had to pull out a
PSU from one of my older systems that
broke but it's just this cheap Corsair
thing I actually bought it online at
Walmart for like 20 bucks probably
shouldn't have done that it's supposed
to be a 500 watt I'm assuming and this
thing the graphics card should only need
to take I need a dedicated power but it
should only need to take about I think
450 watts but for whatever whatever
whatever reason this thing appeared not
to be able to survive or be able to
output the necessary power because all
of a sudden I was using my computer I
have two screens and they both went
black at the same time and then I unplug
the computer hard reset and then try to
turn it back on I thought maybe the
graphics card blew out so I tried to
hook it up to the built-in graphics down
here instead of the newer update which
is right here and it still didn't get
anything in there and then when I tried
to power up on that there's a HP Envy it
just was completely like the first time
had tried to power up you could hear it
a little bit and it was nothing and then
after a while I tried it again and there
was just literally no power so I'm
assuming the PSU is is fried for
whatever reason so that kind of sucks so
that said what I'm gonna do is I need to
start unplugging all this stuff so down
here this is where the actual power is
gonna plug into the motherboard so I'm
going to unhook that and then we have
this big old thing down here so and you
don't unplug that alright and then
so all this stuff has to come out too so
I'm gonna unplug this piece from the
hard disk drive and then I might as well
unplug this from the actual graphics
card this stuff should have been
probably tied together a little better
actually I can tell you a lot better
disconnect all this stuff and then final
thing is the the cd-rom drive here so I
need to unplug this and it looks like
all the powers out now there's some
screws in here that that need to be
taken off I believe all this crap
once I gonna set this down so then you
just have the four screws on the back of
this joint that need to be unscrewed
actually I'm gonna do flats
you
and so sickos inside this thing should
just pull out now you don't you don't
want to manhandle these things but
there's a tab down there if you guys can
see this tab down here it needs to be
pushed down I'm gonna set the camera
down now we're gonna look at the
replacement that I bought and this was a
zoom out a little bit so this is this
replacement is a thermal take and when I
went to Best Buy it was only like 70
bucks and the other one was a Corsair
which is the same thing this thing
didn't even last one year this Corsair
that I bought here so I'm hoping the
thermal take is a little bit better it
gets better reviews alright so obviously
the person whose purse is at this back
side and with the fan it's gonna go on
the bottom
alright that's such way so you can see
that just fits right in there so you can
we got alright now we need to start
dealing with all the wiring so we know
that the big thick wire here first
things first goes down inside the
motherboard also make sure you
desensitize any any sort of static
electricity you have in your body you
can just touch the metal frame actually
but just make sure if your skirt in your
ass across the carpet that you touch
this rain before you start touching the
inner components of your computer you
could end up
sending a electric charge through it and
messing it up alright so it's a little
bit hard to get in there but you should
hear a little tiny click as the father
piece stops in the place next let's go
ahead and I grabbed this because this is
gonna plug into let's find a part that
plugs into the graphics card which is
right here I believe so now one of the
interesting things are gonna notice is
that this piece appears to be too big
and it has even labeled on their CPU so
you can see this is the CPU cooling fan
and the CPU power supply is there but
you're like this has six piece or eight
pieces instead of four but it actually
splits so just take the one that is uh
that is labeled CPU and then you can
plug that in down here and two are they
see can you switch and you'll hear that
that plugs right in all right now the
same thing goes with this unit here you
can see that my graphics card only has a
six prong so it has the X to the two
prong there these are universal adapters
but we just need one of the the four
prongs and those will go inside here so
you can see it's the extra PCI plug so
that's good now we're having a lot of
extra stuff hanging around in here we're
gonna try to tie together as far as the
best as we possibly can
now the only other two things we have
with the SATA cables and those go on to
the hard disk drive here alright so that
plugs in it was kind of a painting panel
alright and then we have another one
here but then you also have the extra
one over here which I'll probably show
is this extra one to reach over to the
virtual cd-rom drive which I'm going to
sit down the camera again alright so the
best thing you can do with all these
excess wires is to try to gather them up
as tightly as you can bundle on well
don't don't try to crimp any of them but
then you're going to take the tie strap
that I gave you and just try to make
sure it's not in any way of the fan or
anything down in here and then you're
just going to tire strap it now make
sure you enter all four of the screws
that we have from the previous
replacement make sure you put them in
all four slots all right so now that we
have all that stuff back assembled the
moment of truth isn't every when you
actually go to try to plug it in and
turn it on I'm actually gonna leave the
case off because if there's any sort of
wire Sordo promise on my dad you should
immediately be able to smell it and also
could be a fire too
alright so we flip the switch on now
we're gonna try to power up the unit
so we have power so you want to make
sure so you can see the CPU fan is on
it's actually spinning down there you
can snow inside the unit because I
actually burned up by a hard disk drive
one time everything smells good
the only thing I wish I would have
bought let you guys know is I wish I
could have showed you what it was doing
before I got it working but here you go
we now have power and nothing caught on
fire so that's good alright so that's it
we're back in business this mug is
working we got both the graphics card
working and probably that's a much
better PSU for the graphics card update
that I have which I don't even have the
box I don't know what I do with it but
like I said so GTX 960 I paid like two
hundred dollars for it at the store I
probably overpaid for it but it's
alright anyway guys thanks man overnight
buy him</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
