with web development these days I am
completely unmotivated to mess with
anything JavaScript related right now I
don't know that I've ever felt this way
so in seven years of development I would
say that the actual ecosystem of the
JavaScript community is so bad
that I no longer want to come home and
actually work on the latest JavaScript
 really so it's not like
entirely bad and I think some of it has
to do with being busier a little bit
more stressed out just dealing with you
know day-to-day responsibilities not
just at work but also at home and and
also dealing with technology that just
isn't very good so when I look at the
current state of es6 and react and
JavaScript and and I'm looking at all
the tools like babel and web pack and
all the different versions that we have
of those flavors and NPM and the node
modules and all this other that
we deal with it's just not fun anymore
not like it used to be with programming
in Django some of you guys have actually
shared an article which I also saw in
hacker news and I really think it was a
great article and I understand the guy
was trying to be somewhat humorous but
the bottom line is that it is partly
supposed to be humorous it's it's
definitely stretching the truth and you
know in certain areas are really just
kind of exaggerating certain areas but
then there's a lot of truth to it and I
think the truth is what hurts so the
article was written on hacker noon by a
Jose Edwin Naga sorry if I'm not saying
that right but no the dude I mean just a
genius article I think here and and when
it was also listed on Hacker News and
had a really highly got voted answer and
I've shared this with a few of my
co-workers people I've talked to and
then development community I know that
you guys have also shared this with me
and I appreciate it
this article is just absolutely
hilarious when it comes to hey I just
want to go ahead and make an AJAX call
bind some data and maybe put it in like
a table and all of a sudden now with the
modern state of web development we have
all these different tools and things
like that and I understand what a lot of
you guys that love JavaScript and what
you're gonna say is you know this is all
overblown it's over
right but I don't really know that it is
because honestly my latest setup is is
using your redox and I'm using yes 2016
or yes 2015 so really I have to then use
Babel and I'm also having to use Babel
polyfill and if you npm install babel i
think somebody mentioned here it's got
40,000 files just in Babel which is
actually transpiling your modern-day see
our modern-day JavaScript that doesn't
even run into the browser into a into a
form that actually works but then you
have to use like a module bundle or like
web pack and then now web pack you know
the fact that it bundles everything in
the one humongous file is not good
enough so now we need to have multiple
dependency bundles and things like that
so that's gonna be like the new flavor
even beyond that like you know if you
have an MPA you run an NPM update you
have all these different dependencies
and it goes through and starts updating
your stuff next thing you know due to
the you know NP the nature of NPM as a
package manager library is just an
absolute mess so how often do you to MPN
install something and you don't have the
right version so you're looking on
github trying to figure out you know why
somebody's weekend project is clashing
with you know 14 other dependencies that
you have that you didn't even know that
you were installing you just have an NPM
install option a and then next thing you
know you got the entire alphabet
downloaded so it's just like I said it's
just not very very pleasing and another
thing too is I see people using some of
these tools for the wrong reasons like
people are using and finding reasons to
use redux when you don't need it
so why are you using it you're just
creating more of a hassle for yourself
and anybody who has to clean up your
 and down the road so you know it's
just like in the number one rule with
something like redox if you don't know
if you need it don't don't use
it that should be like that should be
the number one rule and they should
phrase it that way but they say if you
don't know that you need Redux then
don't use it or that you probably don't
but I like the way I say it better
because I think it rings mid rings true
and hopefully will get people's
attention so the other day I was talking
about you know what am I gonna be
working on well really I haven't worked
on anything in probably four or five
months but
I just haven't had the motivation beyond
you know coming home and doing this
channel and then just you know dealing
with the current like like I'm literally
on the bleeding edge of JavaScript and
it sucks and and I just don't want to
come home and do more of that and I
think that that in a way it's a little
bit concerning because I don't think I'm
burning out or anything like that I just
simply think that I've seen where we
were seven years ago I've seen where we
were three years ago and then you know
and that you know 2 years ago and then
one year ago and even one year ago it
feels like it was so much different than
it is now and I can certainly speak to
that with react in 2014 compared to
writing react now if you're trying to
you know cater towards yeah yes 2015
those days before Babel and also they're
both I think was just a lot more it
was a lot simpler and I guess I just I
someone miss it and even though I knew a
lot less about web development back then
it was still a lot more exciting so that
brings up the the issue and the point
that I thought about where maybe it's
just that I've seen where we've come
from and I've seen you know where we are
now and I think that it's and
maybe I'm just an old crotchety person
or something like that so there is that
possibility and I don't necessarily hate
all of these tools but I just I guess I
hate you know the amount of amount of
work and requirements and everything in
order to just get working just
basic simple implementation setup and
and maybe it's just maybe it's just
older developers like I said because I
know that some of the newer people some
of the people in JavaScript feel that
the community is absolutely fine but I
like the Python community much better
than I like like JavaScript community I
definitely like C sharps community
better because c-sharp releases a lot of
older engineers many of them are like
not trying to be bleeding edge they
literally just want to get the job done
find the tool that can get the job done
and go home spend time with their
families with their boats with their
dogs and things like that because isn't
that what's you know life is about
ultimately it's cool to tinker with new
toys but when we're creating so much
extra work to have an inferior product
it just doesn't make any sense and what
do I mean by that okay let's look at
nodejs nodejs
I like nodejs for simple websites
definitely for
based a synchronous you know you know
readable you know writable AP is and I
think nodejs is is a great tool when it
came to actually having to deal with
authentication and needing a full stack
framework I chose Django because it's
much cheaper than asp.net and also the
fact that it's just much more robust and
it's been around the block and it's not
trying to be this bleeding edge
now note is not necessarily a framework
right so you just get the bare-bones
implementation but if you use something
like Express or meteor you're jumping
through more hoops and what I have to
jump through with just getting a Django
project up to date so so case in point
of a shitty website that I think that
the company really spent you know ton of
money trying to produce a cutting-edge
bleeding edge website and it's literally
inferior to almost all the other ones
that I've seen and that is Walmart calm
Walmart calm was being praised as like
an oj s website they use node and they
use all this javascript and everything
and they're using the latest javascript
that site doesn't work I
mean just yesterday they lost the TV
sale because the website didn't work I
ended up going to Best Buy
I was also shopping on target both of
their websites are much much more usable
than than Walmart calm and and another
thing okay well maybe this to just
Walmart calm right well I can tell you
LinkedIn sucks ass to I mean that if
we're if you compare that to something
like a Google website like a YouTube or
even I'm not a huge fan of Facebook but
I would even say that Facebook with PHP
and everything is better experienced in
something like LinkedIn now with with
Walmart calm it was just an
exceptionally piece of crap you know it
was and the reason why I mentioned that
actually is because not only they lose a
TV sale from me they also I hadn't
visited it multiple times because I was
literally trying to save some money and
I hate Walmart I hate shopping there but
I do shop there you know what I mean
there it's the convenience it's open 24
hours I can get electronics in the night
so I don't want to bash Walmart or
anything like that but I went to the
website on my phone and I go to look at
TVs and literally nothing was pulling up
so my god maybe the site's down that
happens all the time so then I go in and
the couple hours later I log in from my
computer and as I start like getting
into and I start browsing the site quite
a bit using the latest version of Chrome
on a Windows 10
shayne the site literally starts it it
really started starts going to a crawl
and it wasn't my internet I have FiOS
Internet it's fast and I was checking
other sites as well but then it started
doing weird things like I'd click a box
and nothing would happen you click a box
like twice and then I refresh then the
box checked when i refresh so it's like
there was just you could tell it was all
kinds of JavaScript on top of JavaScript
and it was hacks on top of hacks and and
granted the developers at Walmart are
probably very very good and they
probably get paid one hundred and forty
thousand dollars a year we've created
these hurdles that we now have to jump
through where when businesses just want
to sell products make money and profit
and instead hipster trendy JavaScript
developers have created all these tools
and that we now have to jump
through in order to have a worse
experience in my opinion than what we
had five years ago and and this is a
total rant video actually I didn't even
think it was going to turn into a
complete ramp but um I like getting this
off my chest I mean I'll be honest like
I've seen redux be used and
implementations that react was capable
of doing a year and a half ago readouts
is supposed to be able to synchronize
your state and they're like a global
state so if you have multiple components
especially multiple components that
might be interacting with api's and
things like that you're supposed to use
this a mutable state because it's cool
to be a mutable and functional program
where everything should be immutable and
that's too but this this whole
immutable state between you know redux
to all these components can share their
state everything like that I've seen
people have individual redox States for
each individual component that they're
creating and nobody takes a moment says
hey what are we doing here you don't
need a state manager for individual
components and when react have that
capability out of the box like what are
we doing if you have to have a very very
complex UI like I said where you have
multiple components that might be
interfacing to multiple different api's
and things like that then yes they maybe
should have a global a global state and
in the mutable global States probably
good there's benefits there but even you
know the the Redux tools and the hot
reloading also I'm so sick of hearing
about that it doesn't work I'm half
the time
and it's just so unnecessary but now
that I have that off my chest I know
that these developers are good a lot of
these guys are developing these
libraries or they're better than I am
and I'm perfectly fine with with saying
that but I guess where I'm bitter a
little bit it's just simply based on the
fact that I come home and I don't want
to do any mini website development it's
just it's not fun it's not cool I have
all these different ideas and I almost
feel like it's a requirement that I
start killing and tinkering with all
these newer toys in order to stay
relevant and and I think in the back of
my mind I know that that's what I'm
going to end up doing once I get my
motivation back I'll continue to start
tinkering with some of the latest tools
and I'll probably continue to scratch
service with this thing and that thing
and not really get anywhere but I do
that in order to you know make sure I'm
staying up-to-date and I stay employable
and all this stuff and but maybe I'll
choose not to do that so maybe I'll you
know maybe I'll do that I guess I
haven't really thought about it too much
because I'm not sure that you get
anywhere and I've said before you jump
around from one thing to the next you're
not gonna get any better as a developer
you're gonna have all kinds of scratch
the surface you know really superficial
knowledge of this and that and you might
be able to have a decent conversation
with it over a few beers with a couple
of other coders or something like that
but as soon as you start getting into
like the real implementation details
then I think that's where you're gonna
end up falling short if you're jumping
from one thing to the next so I
personally feel like at the moment
number one I don't feel like doing a
website development but if I did I would
probably stick with jQuery and I would
probably use maybe view j/s maybe I
don't even know if I would use that
basically whatever I use it might even
be knock out I don't give a what it
is but it needs to provide benefit and
it needs to provide noticeable benefit
right away and and I may not you know
what I may not even use anything that
requires that I have a bunch of config
files and like that in order for it
to work or that I have to transpile it
in order to be able to step through it
on my browser I'm sick of all that and I
think that direction needs to change in
fact now even more
I've thought about you know whether or
not Babel or typescript is the answer
but I actually might welcome the fact
that Microsoft is running typescript
because I feel like javascript is the
inmates running the asylum and at least
with something like typescript you're
gonna have some some casual direction
and yeah it may not be you know using
the latest evergreen browser standards
for es 2016 plus or something like that
but I can live with a little bit more
boringness in my life I know that anyway
guys thanks for listening to this rant
please subscribe and thank you for your
support bye hey guys so a lot of you
asked me how do I get my foot in the
door to become a programmer and I just
want to take a moment to mention dev
