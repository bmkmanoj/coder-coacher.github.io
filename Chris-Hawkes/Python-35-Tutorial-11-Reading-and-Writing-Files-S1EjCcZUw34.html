we're looking at how to open a file in
Python 3.5 and just so you know how the
project is laid out here I have this
solution file which my editor uses and
that's that cool looking you know dark
editor that I'm using to run the Python
scripts and everything and so the entire
tutorial and all the files are sitting
in this directory here so it's just in
my projects and I have a Python 35
tutorial folder so what I want to do in
my Python file is we're going to figure
out how to open it up so we're going to
actually write some code here we're
going to create an actual file object so
in file object is important in Python
because just like a string or an integer
or a dictionary there is a file object
in Python so in order to create one we
need to identify first okay what file am
i dealing with so typically you could
say F or for F for file or just say file
or file name I will just say file equals
and then here's the important part you
want to say open because what we're
doing is on we need to give it a
location inside of to you know double
quotes of where to open up the file so
and keep in mind it is case sensitive
on Linux I'm not sure about a Mac but
Windows is not case sensitive so this
doesn't match case but it doesn't matter
for windows and I didn't need to do the
seek hole and all that I can
just do forward slash so just keep that
in mind as well so I'm looking at this
saw this folder here and the folder
exists so it's not going to throw any
sort of errors or anything like that and
what I want to do after the forward
slash of the folder I'm going to say
mofos txt and let's go ahead and just
show you an error let me see if I should
show you an error for something um yeah
I'm not going to it alright so the
second argument in a file is whether or
not you want to actually create one if
it's not there which means you pass in a
single string which is a W a lowercase W
for right
and I know that's weird but you'll get
used to it that means right alright so
yeah just the w-4 right and let's go
ahead and actually say filed and we can
use a method that's attached to this
file object and we'll get into
object-oriented programming in a little
bit but we're referencing a method on
top of the file object which is just a
built-in Python object and then here's
what we're going to say this is some
frigging text if everything goes well we
run the program this thing is actually
going to go ahead and locate this
directory it's going to create this file
since we've said hey this is the file
name and then it's going to say the W
means go ahead and create it
if it's not there and if it is there it
says okay I'm going to overwrite this
sumbitch and replace this anyway so that
could end up biting you you want to be
careful about that I'll show you that so
this quickly ran if we go over to our
folder we can see the mofos file is
there and then there is no text now the
reason why that did not show up is
because of string buffering and what and
everybody's system might be a little bit
different on that like if you actually
exit that program in there there's a
good chance if you're running it from
something other than visual city or
Microsoft you may have actually had the
text in the file but if you don't have
the text in file it's always a good idea
to actually close off that string buffer
and just say file dot close so you
always want to close the file
Python usually on closes automatically
but it's still good to explicitly close
it in this case with on Visual Studio
running it it makes sure that that
buffer is closed and it actually writes
to the file so if we run this thing
again and we pull up the file you can
see that this is frigging text and let's
go ahead and add some more to this file
i'ma press ctrl save to actually save it
because now what we want to do is
instead of writing it what we want to do
is say file dot read and we're going to
do this in a print statement so anytime
you do a print statement you need to
actually have you know anything in the
print and in parentheses and we're going
to do file dot read and open and close
parenthesis is actually going to take
this entire file read it into memory and
then display it on the screen another
thing too is we want to actually take
out the W since we're not going to be
writing to the file otherwise it would
go ahead and overwrite it with an empty
file so you can see that it went ahead
and just read the entire file so that's
actually how we read a file in Python
now if I didn't want to actually read
this thing into entire lines what I
could do is I could say for F and file
dot read
I think it's read line yeah it's a read
line all lowercase open and close
parenthesis we could say print F I mean
really I'll say this is a line plus F
and I'm just in case we didn't get into
string concatenation we're taking two
strings and adding them together into
one print statement here so if I went
ahead and I ran this program it's
actually looping through each letter
that is not good it's because of a type
of actually show this again what it's
doing is actually reading the first line
this is some friggin text and it's doing
one letter at a time which which it can
do so you actually once they read lines
in the bed that was my fault all right
so we did that this is actually going to
go and loop through every loop through
every line in the file and it's going to
print out you know what we told it to
print
along with what is actually there so
that's how you process a large file
because typically if you have a file
with like 80,000 lines or if it's like
you know eight Meg or even a gigabyte
you know file or something like that you
can't read that bitch in the memory
because you'll end up running out of
memory or at least like just slamming
the performance of your application by
saying hey just read this thing one line
at a time for processing if you if
you're able to do whatever sort of
processing and processing you need to do
you know line by line it's always better
because it's not gulping that entire
thing into a memory chunk so all right
guys that is that is how you actually
open a file in Python and read a file in
Python actually know what let's not end
it there let's go ahead and real quick
show you how to add
to this file what we want to do if we
want to add to what is there we're going
to actually pass in a for a pin and that
means don't write over what we have here
and we can say file dot right this is is
adding more to the blah blah close that
off we're going to go ahead and close
the file so that way it'll definitely
write and let's go ahead and run this so
it runs it and if we go over to the
python tutorial looking mofo we're going
to have this new text down at the bottom
now here's where bites you because
you're going to be lonely I'm writing
this and like okay I just spent like an
hour grabbing all kinds of data putting
into this file now I'm going to add I'm
going to add one last line and pretend
you spent like a month trying to grab
all this data or write some big big
project report or some like Daniel a I
just need to have one line to it and you
go ahead and forget to do the append and
instead do a double you watch what
happens here
so this runs you just wiped out
everything you had before and now you
have this new line and you can't get
that bitch back like it is gone like
there's no going to your recycle bin and
undoing that python wiped it out it's
never coming back so be very careful on
that you know what it is that you're
trying to do because it's it's
unforgiving if you do the wrong thing
alright guys thanks for watching please
