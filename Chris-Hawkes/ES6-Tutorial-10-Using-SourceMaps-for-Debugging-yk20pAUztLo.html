gonna be telling you about one of the
most important features of es6 and
literally this is look this is literally
the most important feature I think for
any sort of modern JavaScript that every
developer should know and having their
arsenal so this is something I didn't
really discover for a long time and I
know it seems kind of stupid or whatever
I'm not ever claiming to be the best
developer in the world I'm really not I
try to be up to date but I'm simply not
so source Maps is is something that has
been out since the html5 specification
it's taken a little while for tools like
babel or web pack to be able to get them
up to date and also for browsers to be
able to to use them but chrome has the
ability to use what source maps to your
advantage so if you want to read about
source maps you can go this html5 rocks
article about it
and learn all about it there but I'm
gonna teach you everything you need to
know in order to be able to use it and
with Babel it makes it very very simple
but I want to explain why this is so
important so let me go over to the we're
gonna go to like say the react project
on github now if you look at a lot of
modern-day JavaScript that's being
written and you know actually I'm going
off the top of my head so I'm going to
know if this is gonna be the best
example or not but let's just see so
here you have react component so you can
see it's using these require statements
which is like node.js module importing
and things like that so obviously this
project is being compiled just the way
that we're using babel to compile our
code and it's being you know brought
into this you know this you know react
to JS file that we end up including into
our project but react jessa as itself as
a project is much greater than that it's
it's much more complicated it's spread
out all over different files they have
builds and unit tests and things that
are being written on it but with source
maps what it gives you the ability to do
is it actually gets you the ability to
step through your code before it turns
into the then compiled like have you
ever tried to step through a react code
like when it is not even minified
even unmanned affiliate code it can be
very difficult because reacts being run
through stuff that cleanses it and it's
es6 is being changed to older versions
of JavaScript so even you know the code
that you write when you're trying to
debug it in the browser it's different
than what you wrote so source Maps gives
us the ability to actually debug es6 the
way that we write it and and that's why
I said it's it's extremely important so
if we look at what's going on here let's
let's run this this command here just
the way we have and just so you guys
know when we're doing an NPM run babel
we're two chillen to run first and we're
outputting bundle j s and then we're
saying - w which stands for watch that
way we don't want to keep running this
command every time we change our file
and it takes this first and it compiles
it to an older version of JavaScript and
it's bundle and you can see this the
compiled version is quite a bit
different than what we wrote over here
so wouldn't it be helpful if we could
actually debug what we wrote over here
then then this because it gets a lot
more complicated when you have a file
that has 25,000 lines in it and a bunch
of different projects so source Maps
gives us that ability and it's as easy
as doing this we're gonna press ctrl C
to stop this watch and all I have to do
is say - - source maps so now what this
is gonna do it's gonna work the exact
same way but if we look at the folder
structure we're gonna notice or if you
look over here we're down this bundle
dot J's map file and it looks really
weird its cryptic you don't have to
understand what it's going what's going
on there but what I want to show you is
that if we go to our our page here and
we inspect we look inside of our console
let's just refresh this so you can see
all that stuff is outputting the way it
was in the earlier videos but if I go
over to sources and I look inside you
know this bundle so one of the things I
want to make sure you guys have this
enabled if you go over to Chrome and
click these three buttons and go down to
settings I just want to make sure you
have
enable if you scroll down you should see
enable JavaScript source Maps this has
to be set to true and if it's not you're
not gonna actually be able to do this
now if i refresh watch what happens yeah
so you can see source map detected so we
actually want to be able to see that but
we're not gonna be stepping through a
bundle file the goal is to be able to
step through you know this this class
file in first even though first isn't
even associated you can see if we
highlight over it says from source map
so first isn't even remember we didn't
even include first into our HTML page
but the source maps are finding first
and it's basically being being able to
map the code from bundle to first so if
I like refresh then you know I hit this
breakpoint in first and once again
that's that's yeah I'm I have to be
careful cuz like hitting f11 on my
computer ends up shutting off my
recorder but let me go ahead and just
step into the next call and you can see
okay and now I'm stepping out in here
and now you can see the arguments passed
into the subclass
super hasn't been calls I'm gonna try to
step out of that but once again
indeed the benefit of a source map is
the fact that you're able to step
through this code without actually
having to go into the compile so so like
those VM files are part of like the I
think Chrome and the way that Chrome is
executing the JavaScript I think a lot
of that stuff happens in memory but the
idea is that you would be able to put
breakpoints on certain areas like this
console log statement and if you refresh
it
I guess that one got overridden though
on a second
yeah the first print name was overridden
that's why that breakpoint didn't get
hit but hey you know once again it's a
it's a beneficial thing that you're
getting able to step through because
especially when your code gets very very
complicated and I've been able to do
this also with react and redux and a lot
of the es6 that i'm writing and react
and redux it makes it so much easier to
build a step through alright guys so
that's really all I have about source
maps in es6 let me know if you have any
questions and thanks for watching make
sure you subscribe and you guys have a
good day
alright hey guys so a lot of you ask me
how do I get my foot in the door to
become a programmer and I just want to
take a moment to mention dev Mountain
coding boot camp is a 12-week intensive
course that focuses on the technologies
of the here-and-now for web development
some of the things that they're actually
teaching in the Suevi course it's geared
to get you into the industry by focusing
on things like jQuery nodejs
react angular how to use github so a lot
of the things that you're going to need
to do as a developer as soon as you
start they're going to be teaching you
in this and this coding bootcamp and the
entire goal is to be able to get you
into the industry within 12 weeks so if
you guys are interested in learning more
information about dev mountain coding
bootcamp just check out the link in the
description tab of this video thank you
for watching and have a good day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
