question from areata i should always try
to pronounce the name before i actually
start the video but anyway here's her
name right here last name a car and he
says how much money have you made with
new movies what was the traffic like at
its peak can you do a video answering
these kind of questions if you don't
mind thanks ok thank you for comment and
so new movies guys if you go to the URL
for new movies I don't even know that
it's out but there might be some sort of
placeholder stupid thing there right now
but um new boobies I actually took it
down because it got to the point where
there wasn't I tried to I have a lot I
had a lot of ambition with a site
originally I learned it into that why I
built in 2012 because I was learning how
to do responsive web design so in 2012
that was like one of the major buzz
words everybody was talking about
responsive so I created this new movies
website and it was responsive and i
showed you know some of the people i
worked for him i look at all the stuff
i've been able to do and i was basically
paving the way in a relatively new
industry i thought at least you know for
the people that I worked with just to
kind of show hey this is you know some
of the ways that we should do things so
that was the main reason for the website
and I thought oh I like movies and I
like talking about movie so I can I can
do this sort of thing and that said the
the movie website at its peak in like
the summer of 2013 i believe it was
right around i think it was right around
the summer of the year after i actually
started it because I definitely started
and 2012 you know I might have started
this in 2013 actually I think myself I
believe in the summer of 2014 actually
is what it was because the site had been
out for like a year that's when I was
pushing it like hardcore and I was like
I mean doing a lot of like Reddit and
everything and just trying to share it
and I was writing articles and all kinds
of student different stuff and and after
like at his peak of its SEO and
everything the website had peaked at
around 250,000 p
or so a month and to date until this
YouTube channel new movies was the most
successful website I've ever had as far
as actual traffic and in here in this
video is just a screen capture of what I
was actually showing I don't remember
why I did this video obviously I was
talking about where I was hosting it but
this website like the pagination here
for the movie actors and stuff like that
was using react some of these little
buttons were dynamically there so that I
could edit it and it was doing Ajax post
to my django backend and all the stuff
so I was trying to I was learning a lot
about basically you know building
restful api s and sending data back and
forth and using react for state
management and things like that so that
was that was definitely on its peak so
250,000 visitors how much money did it
make but I don't remember specifically
but I can tell you that the ways to
monetize this website there were there
were quite a few I had linked up with
Apple iTunes so itunes is not just
somebody that just accepts everybody
like you have to have a pretty
legitimate website you know the terms of
service privacy policy all the stuff you
look like you're at least trying for
them to work with you but I went through
all that effort so I had linked to them
so we're talking about Apple iTunes
Amazon I was an affiliate to like
Fandango for movie tickets I even had
been invited to like the press stuff for
the Oscar Awards I'm not invited to the
actual ceremony but to get like the
press packets and stuff like that for
all that stuff so I felt like that was
kind of cool because I was getting a lot
of information about movies that were
upcoming and everything at one point
there was actual movie director for this
calvin hobbes documentary that i
actually had reached out to for the site
that was pretty cool as well so then
there was also like I said hey I don't
know if I mentioned amazon and then
adsense like so google adsense for
displaying ads and stuff like that so
250,000 people from what i recall the
site never made more than like a hundred
and fifty dollars in a month the site if
you factor in the fact that i was paying
like
twenty dollars a month to host it
endless amounts of time to maintain it
to write you know not even just like the
database code and the Django code and
the setting up the servers and firewall
rules and using responsive web design
and implementing react like if you would
have counted actual developer time a my
goodness like it would've been like a
fifty-thousand-dollar investment at
least but it was a good learning
experience but a big fat waste of a
waste of time when it comes to monetary
value one of the things that you'll also
learn and what I learned the hard way is
that just because I like Hollywood
movies like for me personally i watch
more movies than I do TV I don't even
watch TV I'll watch an occasional
sporting event but I don't really watch
TV for the most part if I do watch like
a video like a television series when my
wife or something like that we usually
will like a binge watch type of thing on
like Netflix so that way we're not
dealing with commercials and all that
stuff and we can just kind of run
through a season it within like a you
know week or so and and to me I just I
don't have a lot of time for TV so I
watch a lot of movies because I can just
plug in a movie and I don't need a whole
lot of background on on this and that or
have to plug in at a specific time and
all it's tough to watch a movie or watch
a TV series but um yeah I just thought
that you know because I I knew a lot
about movies and actors and actresses
and stuff like that I would have a fun
time writing about it and I didn't have
enough passion in order to keep
something like this going because it
just to me it wasn't worth it at all
like I mean it was it sits and what is
what is the end goal it's here like what
are you going to end up doing with a
site like this are you going to compete
with IMDb highly doubtful IMDb was
started by a handful of people when it
first got successful but it was sold to
Amazon I believe that estimated value
was like 300 million at the time now
it's probably a billion-dollar platform
but if you want information on a movie
like Who star is where did it get film
like some of the bloopers are like you
know special facts about you're never
going to beat a site like it look like
IMDb it's just not going to happen you
can't just steal your data
stuff so unfortunately a Content site
like this with so much competition in so
many different avenues for people to go
down to get their information like
you're just never going to succeed no
matter how pretty the site looks and I'm
not even trying to say that at this
point that the site was pretty because
it certainly wasn't I wasn't like a UX
expert or anything like that but there
was it was still a lot of work that went
into like you know tapping into the
YouTube API and to play the trailers to
the movies and stuff like that I mean
there was a lot of a lot of F report
into it but eventually the site started
getting out of date like the the movies
update or scripts that I had been
writing and stuff like that started
getting out of date needed to be worked
on and the stuff was inappropriate and
like I was dealing with with robots
automatically commenting and stuff like
that and just a lot of little things
where I was like dude I don't have
enough time for this and I just ended up
pulling it off because in a sense it
even though I had done so much work and
I have been proud of certain features of
it here and there it was not it was uh
it was not worth the effort and then
once she stopped maintaining it then it
just it starts to look like more of a
negative than a positive I at least in
my mind so I took it down maybe one day
I'll put something back off but anything
that I'm going to do in the future with
a movies related site it has to be
entirely content driven by the users I
mean otherwise it's just simply not
going to work and if it is um and it
can't just be like an encyclopedia of
movie information because it's just a
saturated tapped out market that that
it's just never going to work and
another thing too that I realized is
that on an SEO standpoint SEO is search
engine optimization I might go through
and write about some movie and I would
get a decent amount of traffic on this
blog article or that blog article but
then as soon as like some new update
came out maybe for this new movie or you
know that was that I was talking about
and had any sort of credence on search
engine optimization a website like
Hollywood Reporter would come in and
write
article I'd be gone you know I wouldn't
even show up on page one or two and if
you're not on page one or two on google
and you might as well be on page 100 cuz
nobody's going to find you but that
would end up happening any even beyond
that and like a movie industry look at
stuff like the LA Times The Washington
Post they have their own movie critics
and they're talking about movies like
that it's everybody talks about movies
even on a sports talk radio they'll talk
about movies so a niche like this is a
terrible niche to get into it was it was
definitely not something I I realized
rather quickly that it wasn't going to
make any money but at least I enjoy
doing it and I learned a lot while I was
doing it so that was a good question i
actually like talking about that huge
failure on my part from a monetary value
and you're probably disappointed with
the fact that i only made like 150
dollars a month at its peak but that's
the truth so anyway guys take care bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
