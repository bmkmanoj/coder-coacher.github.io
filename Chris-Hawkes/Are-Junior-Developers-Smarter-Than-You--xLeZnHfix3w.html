webcam webcam on this one I got a good
question no it is is out that one I just
decided to address once again I
apologize if I don't answer your
comments sometimes it might be like a
week or two and I'll try to get back to
you but sometimes guys I just say they
get I did a thing where like I'll try to
read every comment you know the new ones
I get for a day but then sometimes I'm
like you know missed like three or four
days and there's just no way that I can
go back and like start going through all
that stuff but I still try it but if I
didn't respond to you there's a good
chance I've read it and and there might
be just as good of a chance that I
didn't read it at all but uh but I try
to read all of them is what I was trying
to say so any when I try to read all of
it my chair is making a ton of noise
anyway so this is a question that I want
to answer though is that somebody asked
me to write have you ever worked with a
junior developer that was smarter than
you like so that actually this happened
a few times actually I've worked with
with newer deaths that I just know that
you know had more exactly not even just
know where does our junior devs the
question specifically was junior does
you know whether or not I've run into
them that were smarter than I am and and
I would say that I I think that I have
it's impossible to say for sure because
somebody might seem very you know smart
witted or whatever no I don't I don't
know what they were studying in college
and and if they're they could have been
programming their whole lives you know
I've only been programming for eight
years so it's difficult to say but
there's certainly kids that I've worked
with a member a guy that I worked with
from University of Virginia and he was
actually an intern and he was working at
an internship with a place that I was
working on and also with another place
was like a medical provider and you know
he's doing all the stuff on his side and
everything and I remember one of the
things I really liked about him was that
he's doing down net and c-sharp and
everything but at the same time he also
did a lot of Django stuff on the side
and he was one of the programmers few
programmers I've worked with
professionally that even knew you know
Django was or a let alone had experience
with it so but just you know working
with that guy that he was very he was
very smart very quick to pick up on
things one of the so guy named Jean that
worked with just recently this guy is
like ridiculously smart now he was
he was a manager but I guess the point
I'm trying to bring up really is that
you're going to run into juniors and you
run the seniors you're just gonna run
the people that are smarter than you and
then there's going to be people that
think that they're smarter than you and
they're disasters and you have to work
with those people as well there's people
that this wasn't really part of the
question but I'm going to address it
anyway there there have been people and
there will be people that you work with
in your professional life that that
don't like you and that you do not like
them you know and it's just it's just
the way things way things are like if
you look like somebody like you know
Bill Gates and Steve Jobs like why did
they hate each other they were business
partners they were doing things together
well you know there was some you know
there were some competition there
Microsoft emerged as the piece and the
dominant PC maker but Steve Steve Jobs
had many reasons to dislike Bill Gates
but the CEO at the time when Steve Jobs
got out stood out of Apple in like 1985
or 1986 like he never talked to that guy
not one single time again for the rest
of his life and the guy still alive now
Steve Jobs obviously passed away in 2011
but he never talked to him again for the
rest of his life so it's interesting I
kind of I'm touching two different
subjects here but like there are people
that I absolutely despised working with
like absolutely despise them just don't
like them and I think that's just I
think it's normal
honestly and just like it's normally
you're going to work with some junior
developers that have more of a raw
intellect than you do you know they just
grab and grasp things faster than you do
and some of that stuff can be like you
know honestly just you're just the
changing of the tides or just like those
weather I really feel like and I'm sure
other people can relate but there are
days where it's like I'm just knocking
stuff out of the park man it's like you
know just one after another I'm just
hitting things out of the part
everything is going well and then
there's days where I'm trying to learn
something and I just can't get it
I'm not grasping it and there's a lot of
things I think that can play into that
like maybe maybe you didn't get enough
sleep the night before maybe I you know
too many beers over the weekend maybe
you you know got into a fight with your
wife or like you're dealing with some
stuff with your kids or there's finance
you know there's all these different
things I think ken can go into you know
how somebody's perceived and how you
know how smart at least how smart
they're perceived to be because you know
we all we all can't be like on our toes
and at the top of our game each and
every day like there's gonna be days
where we know that we're going really
well just like even with sports players
you know they go into slumps and we all
do the same thing as well one of the
things that I've done recently as I
walked away from programming for like
almost two weeks I literally didn't do
any programming hardly at all for like
two weeks and it's all good but then I
started missing it like I started you
know getting back into some things and I
don't work as much as I used to anymore
but I don't know man like God sometimes
like being smart about certain things is
also not not being you know just
consoled by the fact that somebody might
be smarter than you were doing a better
job coding than you are
maybe be a better leader best thing you
can do is really just you know brush off
the the naysayers and the doubts that
you have and and just try to do your
best I think to not worry about
something like that but yeah no question
man there are people that I've worked
with are smarter but then on the other
flip side of the equation there's been
times that I felt that as a junior
developer that I was smarter than some
of the senior developers that I was
working with but once again it's all
relative there as well so it could just
be the technology said that you're
working with you don't know the type of
business professionalism that this
person may have just say if you're
working with him for a few weeks that
you don't know somebody well enough to
really know what they bring to the table
you know you might be able to say hey
they're struggling with some es6 syntax
so they can't grasp this react stuff
very well but that doesn't mean that
they're not a great like dotnet
developer that they they're not a good
sequel developer or anything like that
so it's really difficult I think to
gauge how smart anybody is but you know
just overall I get that sense you know
for
certain people say oh I feel like I'm
probably able to grasp stuff a little
bit better than them and then not as
good as some of the other people - but
certainly though one of the things on
that that you will deal with in the
professional workforce is that you're
going to deal with people that you've
worked with you have to have a
relationship with that you do not like
or that they do not like you and the
best thing you can do is just try to get
out of that situation I would say you
know as cleanly as possible you don't
just quit your job or something like
that but you try to gracefully find
direction and avoid certain people and
that that's just a reality unfortunately
on there there are people that have
worked for that would not want to work
with again and I would make it you know
make every effort possible to not have
to do that so just I guess man that's
just life though man I've had some some
shitty bosses and everything not just an
IT but you know even before I was a
programmer and everything alright guys
