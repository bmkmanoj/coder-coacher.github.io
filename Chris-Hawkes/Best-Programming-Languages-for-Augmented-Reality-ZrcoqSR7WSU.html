augmented reality and if you're looking
to get into something that is on the
ground level I would say never leaving
ground level at this point because it
has been going strong for a couple of
years now but I really think augmented
reality is going to be something that
isn't going anywhere anytime soon and
there's multiple examples of like you
know just recently how we've had you
know so much success within the
augmented reality sphere and like one of
them is did you know the Pokemon go
obviously was a complete like people
still love it I still work with people
to play that game and and it's cool yeah
it was a little gimmicky or whatever but
you know the fact of the matter is
you're having apps now that are
interacting with your real environment
and that is what an augmented reality is
so if you're using your phone and then
it can display you know 3d things and
maybe even if you're in like a specific
area I could give you historical facts
things like that but it doesn't you know
too much more I would say cool manner
like when Mark Zuckerberg the other day
was giving a demonstration where
Facebook where they're kind of copying
off of snapchat and what they do with
augmented reality was showing how to
like fill up a room with water and with
M&amp;amp;Ms and things like that in or with
Skittles but the way that we're doing
that is because obviously they had a lot
of artificial intelligence involved in
the technology that was looking at an
image and figuring out you know aspect
ratios and things of you know where the
floor is where the walls are and then
you know being able to use that
information in order to then you know
add obviously layers upon layers of
whatever sort of an ingredient you want
and that takes a tremendous amount of
work obviously because artificial
intelligence is still in its infancy but
clearly photo recognition is becoming
something that is you know very very
very popular I would say and just it's
coming a long way like you look at
snapshot you can open your mouth it
obviously can detect your eyes your head
your mouth and it doesn't matter you
know what would what race or or create a
race creed what we know what I'm talking
about basically it doesn't matter if
you're big you're slim you know whatever
it's
they're smart enough to recognize where
your eyes are when your nose are when
your mouth is and everything so and
that's pretty impressive especially you
know considering the fact that is like
almost the entire entire like thing that
is snapchat I would say I'm sure there's
more to it than that but from what I've
seen that is like the you know the most
the coolest thing about snapchat in my
opinion so very similar to like Pokemon
go and everything so like the question
is though how do you actually get into
programming and getting into this
augmented reality sphere and and that is
where things I think are a little bit
trickier because there are different
augmented reality platforms out there
one of them being this Oh wicked shoe
that I found so you can start messing
with augmented reality through a
software development kit which is going
to save you obviously a tremendous
amount of time because a ton of research
and everything that's already been put
into this and it's an SDK that you can
use and then capitalize on but the
problem is that because things are so
much in their infancy and so much money
has been poured into augmented reality
plus there's such a strong demand for it
it's ridiculously expensive for
developers especially you know newbie
developers to just jump in and actually
build a builder product and then start
making money with it but I think
eventually we'll get there that's why I
would advocate you know trying to to get
in now and start understanding the
basics of augmented reality and what
languages are best to use with it and
things like that that way when prices
start dropping down you're still going
to have a tremendous amount of knowledge
and and leverage in order to be able to
you know make your next product and
everything but these are in Euros which
are even more expensive than the dollar
at least the last time I checked and
this is way more than I could pay
probably for a project that isn't ever
going to make me any money now the good
news is is like you know unity engine is
starting to support augmented reality as
well and unity engine is much more
geared towards beginners but if anybody
has ever tried unity in your beginner
program you know it's still not an easy
task it's very difficult but with unity
there is um there is the fact that you
can start building for augmented reality
and everything so here you can even see
that they're mentioning
microsoft's hololens which is possibly
going to be something that could be cool
it could be another Microsoft flop but I
think you know I think it looks okay I
really do it's it's kind of weird that
we're going to go around wearing our
headsets and everything but and the fact
of the headsets are like thousands of
dollars somebody could easily jack you
four for your headset if you're just
walking down downtown Richmond like I do
but but if you here in a safe
environment and like you're in like a
classroom or something that's it if the
technology comes down and everybody's
able to wear this and we're able to
learn and like you know a fully 3d
immersive kind of world around us which
is a little bit more convenient I think
than possibly a full virtual reality
experience I mean there's definitely
potential there it really is Google
glass clearly failed we'll see what the
hololens does but anyway going back to
the unity engine they have something
called this boot forea which also does
not listen any pricing which is you know
enough to make you probably concerned
that thing that's probably very
expensively here it's some sub pricing
and everything but you know 499 one time
per app that's not bad actually in a $99
a month per app you have to see what all
the stuff comes with because that's just
for the consumer level and not
Enterprise enterprise don't list the
price so if you're like a business
trying to utilize some of this stuff
probably going to be spending millions I
would think but all right so yeah but
beyond that like what are the best
language is now with unity because it's
easier you could use C sharp or you can
even use JavaScript I would recommend C
sharp with with unity just because
there's more there's more examples with
C sharp on unity than there are with
JavaScript but you can see you know C
sharp is a development language it's
built on top net which is Microsoft's
runtime environment so you can actually
use Python Java on a bunch of other
different languages that all compile
down to this what they call a CLI within
the dotnet infrastructure but c-sharp is
the most popular language that's use for
that but you can use that with unity it
makes it much easier because what is the
the alternative really when you're
looking at like the core of these engine
you're looking at languages that are
written in like C and n C++ so if if
you're going to get into like the core
of the language it might be a good time
to learn C because that is ultimately
what is making these these augment and
frame SDKs and everything a reality even
more so than than Java and C plus I'm
sorry Java and c-sharp hey guys so a lot
of you asked me how do I get my foot in
the door to become a programmer and I
just want to take a moment to mention
dev Mountain coding boot camp is a
12-week intensive course that focuses on
the technologies of the here-and-now for
web development some of the things that
they're actually teaching in the Suevi
course it's geared to get you into the
industry by focusing on things like
jQuery nodejs react angular how to use
github so a lot of the things that
you're going to need to do as a
developer as soon as you start they're
going to be teaching you in this and
this coding bootcamp and the entire goal
is to be able to get you into the
industry within 12 weeks so if you guys
are interested in learning more
