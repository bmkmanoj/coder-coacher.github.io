learning experience to try to get mono
game up and going I am going off of a
tutorial that I had found online by RB
Whittaker wicky-wicky comm which seems
to be a pretty good source for I'm
trying to get everything up and running
so let's go ahead and make a new project
in our Visual Studio 2010 and if
everything went well well we should
hopefully have something with XNA in
here
I may have to restart this all right so
I would restart a visual studio and the
XNA game project is there so we're gonna
go ahead and create a new Windows game
4.0 and I'm gonna put it in the projects
directory and I'm just gonna call this
the first content game I guess all right
so now we have this so we have actually
two projects in our first content game
which is the Windows game and then you
have like this content this is the
reason why we're still using XNA is
because of this first content game
content this is the content pipeline and
it's the thing that's not available in
mono game at this moment all right so
basically all the resources for our
games are gonna go inside this thing and
we can create folders in here so we're
gonna add new folders existing items it
accepts pngs and bitmaps and other
things like sprites and stuff so that's
where all that stuff is gonna sit and
that's the reason why we have this
project whenever you add files to the
content we just want to simply build our
application by ctrl shift B you'll see
down here build succeeded I mean that's
all that's required and it'll do what we
need it to do with our images all right
so I have a little art program up here
and I'm gonna go ahead and just make a
sample image so that we can add that to
our game and test this out just gonna be
a simple 500 by 500 pixel and
not sure whether I took forever but
anyway we're going to add some text to
it what in the hell
all right I see why I was freezing up
every time we had this thing at like 500
inches that would be like a 4 gigabyte
image might change that the pixels
just do 500 pixels by 500 pixels and do
that now we're gonna put this song
there's some text change the color of it
to white let's do this dark red a little
weird our first game
highlight this we can see it
I almost looks like a crime game or
something so let's go ahead and save
this image and I'm gonna put it on my
computer this piece you see sharp
projects
I'm just gonna save it as a JPEG call a
test image all right so now go into our
content project here and we're gonna
right click on the first game content
say add an existing item and if we go
back a couple of directories we should
see our test image we're gonna go ahead
and add that in here now go ahead and
press control shift B okay and this
thing now that it was built it should
output the image file so let's go find
it so you see here is our first game
this that's right
all right so it's actually if you go in
the first game content here your first
content game go in the bin 86 debug
content and then here you see the test
image X and B so that went through that
whole content pipeline and basically
consolidated that image down into
something that our game can now use all
right so now that we have something that
our game can actually use we're gonna go
back to Visual Studio 2012 and if we go
ahead and right-click on our content
folder we're gonna add an existing item
and then we're gonna go to the 2010
project in the same location all the way
into content say all files we're going
to add this XMP file now once we do that
we actually have to right-click on this
and go to properties and then where it
says build action none actually need
copy childhood directory that's where we
want to say copy always and really we
might be able to do that here no I can't
damn it alright so that's gonna kind of
bloat up to do that with every single
image but alright so that is obviously a
hassle to have to work around whenever
you're doing game development but
hopefully it's temporary and eventually
the content management can all be
handled under one project but that's
gonna be probably the most one of the
more tedious things they're gonna have
to do with game development hopefully
but then again I'm not a professional so
I don't know alright so now we're gonna
go ahead and try to load this image that
we just copied in there into our game
and this will be making a pretty big
progress so we want to go to our load
content method and not sure if we do it
before or after the spray batch I guess
it says to do use this to load and game
content here okay
all right so I'm here we're going to say
texture 2d image equals content dot flow
you know texture 2d and then here we're
gonna say the name of our file without
the extension so we say testing image
okay I suppose it would help if I
actually spell the name of our image
right it's actually test image I
actually thought the instructions said
without quotes but it actually needs it
in quotes which makes sense and once
again I apologize I am still new to this
and I mean this isn't semantically
correct we need to get rid of the
greater-than less-than sign all right so
that is how you load an image and also
if you have you can have multiple
directories inside your content if you
want to break things up into more
organized structure
I'm just keep in mind that you would
keep your you would have to put the
directory in here but you don't need to
worry about the file extensions in mono
game so we're gonna go ahead and kill
this this video here and I'm continue to
move on with our progress in the next
video
all right thank you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
