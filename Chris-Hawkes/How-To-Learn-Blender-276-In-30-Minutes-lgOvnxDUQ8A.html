going to be looking at blender here and
I'm going to do this all in one video
and this is the first time you've ever
used blender it's going to be difficult
I'm going to tell you that right now
blender is not the easiest program to
use in fact any 3d program out there is
gonna be difficult blender is awesome
though because it's free it's open
source you can use it for commercial
projects and I know what you're thinking
or at least some of you guys are like oh
I can go to piratebay I don't get the
latest of 3ds max or I'll get you know
some other five thousand dollar 3d
program well guess what they have
copyright protection built into their
models that stuff can be detected just
go with the free version guys do the
right thing and if you're going to go
with the free version you might as well
support you know the indie community to
build this blender project up so that it
can start being used by more powerhouse
production studios so that way you guys
can start getting jobs with blender as
opposed to having to learn Maya or 3ds
max any of that other crap blender is a
good program and it's in fact it's
pretty amazing considering it is
open-source so anyway go to blender org
download it for your system this thing
works on Mac Windows Linux I'm on
Windows 8.1 once I install it
I'll have it available on my pin it to
the Start screen here on the Sun dumb
look in Windows 8.1 interface and I'm
just going to go ahead and click on
Blender to open it up and it's going to
run some scripts and everything and then
blender is going to open up and it's
going to have a splash screen splash is
that first screen that it kind of gives
a little promotional type of thing
you'll be able to see any sort of stuff
that you've built in the past and also
this thing will save the last user
perspective that you have so let me just
go ahead and I'm going to try to switch
this over to the default I see
because your screen is actually going to
look a little bit different than mine
all right well we're not going to worry
about that for right now let me go ahead
and close this out
all right guys sorry about that so this
is this should be about what you see on
your machine and let me just go over the
interface real quick on the left hand
side you're going to have all these
little tabs right these are called
little little tabs and they have little
options inside there and there's a ton
of them to deal with one of the main
ones you're going to be looking at
you're going to be looking at the tools
because that is translate translate is
like moving stuff like that and then you
have like a rotate where you can
actually spin your object so if I have
rotate selected you can see it's
spinning and then you have scale which
is going to make it bigger smaller let
me grab the entire object too and let me
go ahead and just get rid of this so if
we delete the start off square and we go
over to our create tab create is going
to give you all kinds of what's called
primitive objects and primitives a weird
word but it just basically means like
caveman first to come along you know
what I mean like just kind of think of
it that way like cavemen were before us
so it's kind of like you know the start
of something you know what I mean so
that's what I think of when I think of
primitive and I'm probably the only
person that thinks that way but maybe
you guys understand what I'm talking
about but anyway here's the object it's
a primitive object it's a cube it's not
a square because a square is not
three-dimensional cube is actually
three-dimensional so that's what that is
so let's go ahead and figure out how we
move things around right so if your
object um is selected and you're in
object mode you're going to actually be
able to move the entire object and when
I say object mode look at these
different modes that we're going to deal
with down here really we're only going
to deal with two for this video we're
going to deal with edit mode and object
mode but for right now just think of
object as you select entire objects
right because the cube is made up of all
kinds of different lines and geometric
possibilities and if we select object
that's going to grab all
what comprises or what is you know that
cube so anyway that was probably
terrible explanation but you guys
understand what I'm talking about I'm
assuming so that's how we move it and
you can move it by using these arrows so
that arrow goes up and down this arrow
goes left and right and this goes
forward and backwards and this is
considered to be your 3d view so if
you're like oh I don't want the 3d view
well you have all kinds of different
views that you have that from your view
menu down here on the bottom left so if
I set view I can look at the left hand
side or I can look at the right hand
side or I can look at the top or I can
look at the camera and that's the actual
camera that's in the screen on the
screen so we're not going to deal with
that too much right now because that's a
little bit more advanced so let's go
back over the top now another thing too
is you can use the number pad so if you
have your number pad on your key back
keypad you can type like number seven
number five actually changes it to the
top view seven actually changes it to
the other top actually and if we want to
go back to the view perspective just go
ahead and click on your view and go back
to view perspective ortho and then you
just want to change your angle and the
way you do that is you actually use your
middle mouse button and that's going to
be able to rotate the object either
three to know 360 or up and down and
you'll be able to change your view if
you want to zoom in you just scroll the
mouse wheel to scroll in or scroll out
if you do the middle mouse wheel and do
this turn kind of thing or up and down
this is called orbiting and that
orbiting is another word you're going to
get used to because it's called your
orbit and then your zoom and then you
have something called pan so if you hold
down the shift button in the middle
mouse button you can then drag the
entire thing left or right or up and
down and and that's called panning so
the bottom line is that you're going to
be using a lot of zooming a lot of
panning and a lot of orbiting and you
need that to be able to to get around
your shape another thing too is when
you're trying to line up objects
perfectly that's where you're going to
go over to the view and you're going to
change it to the top and the bottom and
all that other stuff the next thing we
want
learn is that in blender you can have
multiple views which is really crazy
just by going over to this top right
corner where you see these little like
diagonal lines in the corner if you
hover over it you can see that the mouse
turns into a normal mouse cursor and
then it turns into a cross like a white
crosshair if you then click and drag
it's going to bring in a new screen and
the reason why that's beneficial is
because you can then say I want to
change this view because right now this
is called perspective view where you're
looking at like a full three-dimensional
perspective view and maybe I could
change it to the top right so I'm
looking at the top on this left hand
side and I'm looking at it from you know
the regular view perspective on the
right hand side so you can do all kinds
of cool stuff where you're trying to get
a lot of you know precision in your
geometric shapes and everything by using
multiple screens at the same time
another thing too that you're going to
end up doing more often than not is that
like in this case since we're going to
be doing some UV wrapping and stuff
we're going to if you want to change the
actual screen because right now this is
just sure your 3d view I can go over
here and right now we're under 3d view
right and there's all these different
things like timeline graph editor
dopesheet
UV image editor which is what we're
going to use and a few other things too
so we're not going to get into all of
those but let's go ahead and open this
up as a UV editor and we'll get into
what a UV is in just a moment but you
can see like I have this entire screen
now I don't even need that entire screen
for my UV so what I can do is I can go
over to this crosshair and I can drag it
down instead of left and right and this
will actually grab a new screen so on
the bottom I can have a UV editor and
then I want to change the top over to
something called a node editor and the
reason why is we're going to we're going
to see why we're going to do that pretty
soon we go to actually texture our
object so here we go I'm here's our
square right and let's go ahead and
learn about the different ways that we
can view this square right so right now
this is just a plain 3d object and it's
going to start by showing it all filled
in in color now what if I wanted to see
through the square if I wanted to see
through
it I would press some not not xx will
actually delete it but if I press Z it
turns it into the wireframe mode so I
can actually see through and see what's
called on these are called edges these
are straight lines are called edges
where edges connect are little dots
called vertices and then what makes the
actual exterior of the object
I'm Scott excuse me what makes the
exterior the object is called a face so
those are three things you absolutely
must know edges and vertices in face
faces like the flat wrapper around your
box edges are the structure of your box
and then vertices are like the structure
points welded together and those are
just little dots and that's all there is
to 3-dimensional programming that it's
just those are the key elements and they
all make up unique shapes so all of your
modeling is going to be done with either
edges vertices and faces and it's going
to be done by actually changing out of
the object mode where we currently are
right now so this is the object mode and
that's why we're able to manipulate the
entire object and when we move things we
move the entire object if we want to go
into edit mode we can go down here and
go into edit mode or you can click tab
tab is the shortcut shortcuts are
something you don't have to learn in
this video because they're going to be
confusing but it is something you want
to learn because you're constantly going
to change tools that you're using and
shortcuts are for everything and and you
can use them for everything so now we're
in edit mode right so we can change the
actual structure we could you know
change individual vertices edges or
faces in this structure so let me show
you what I'm talking about if we go over
to this these little boxes down here
they're gonna be a little bit hard to
see on the screen but you can see that
that's the vertex remember I was saying
the little dots and if we want to so
let's click with the left mouse button
right which is the normal click button
and then we're going to click with the
other mouse button which is the right
mouse button to actually select what
actual vertice we're trying to select so
you can see that now that I have
precision on that one particular
vertices so if I go to actually move
this stuff I'm moving one vertice to
change the shape of the object
if I wanted to actually select multiple
vertices I would press control and hold
it down and then another left click
mouse button to actually select two at a
time now say I had a ton of vertices
that I wanted to check at the same time
this is where we are going to have to
use a keyboard shortcut which is the
letter B for boy and that's called box
select so when we do that you get these
little this little graph and I can
actually click and drag and grab all the
vertices in this object and because I
grabbed all the vertices that means it
comprises the entire object so it's
typically wouldn't want to do that and
I'll give you another example of
grabbing like half of the vertices so
let me go back over and deselect what we
got here so I'll select B for box select
I mess that up if we mess up you want to
press control Z which is like that for
pretty much every single application out
there so control Z will actually go
backwards so you see the box to like
grab both of these vertices so if I go
ahead and move it out I can I can really
change the shape of my my object now say
I wanted to actually edit an entire edge
the edge of the straight line so I would
go over to this new tool which is edge
and then once again I'd select it in the
same way and I can adjust them in the
same way so now we have this
crazy-looking shape so that is that and
then the final thing is we're going to
look at faces so if I go to this final
thing this is the face and this is like
I said the wrapper around your jungeum
you know geometric object and that will
actually move the entire joint so those
are your main selection points there now
let's go ahead and look at let's go
ahead and look at what happens when we
actually want to delete this face so I
would go over to the face I have this
particular face selected and if I just
press the lead on my screen it's going
to give me the option do I want to get
rid of the vertices which are the dots
the edges which are the
to the face and I want to do the face
and now you can see I can see inside my
objects that deleted the face now you're
like oh damn I didn't mean to do that
you can either press ctrl-z but let's go
ahead and learn a lesson about how you
can actually add a face to an object you
add a face to an object by selecting the
edge mode and then you select one edge
that you want to connect to and then the
other edge and then you just simply
click f4 Frank or fubar or the f-word
and you press F and it will actually put
that face between those two edges and
that's in some 3d applications that's
considered that's called bridging I
don't know if they call bridging and
blender but that's how you actually
connect to two vertebra edges together
to build a face all right so we added
our face back right so that's good now
let's look at the little circle the
little ball that's right next to the
edit mode and if we change that you can
change it over to wireframe and like I
said there was a keyboard shortcut for
that which was Z or I can do solid which
is what it normally defaults to or I can
do a bounding box not really sure why
I'd want to do a bounding box at the
moment I'm not like a 3d expert or I can
do texture and this if I actually had a
texture applied to this then it would
actually show up here and then there's
the material so if there's actually a
material applied which is like a UV
material that would show up and then
rendered is like okay what does this
joint going to look like if I actually
you know publish it put it in a movie or
put it in the Unity game engine or
something like that in this particular
case you know it's objects and it's
going to look prettier and like a 3d app
this thing is a little bit splotchy or
whatever so it doesn't look that bad in
real life but it does give you a good
idea on what kind of a model that you're
looking at so so that's good now let's
go over to these things on the right
hand side right so we're not going to
get into all of these things but you
have a bunch of different options I
don't want to confuse you here but one
of these is your material right and your
material is important if you go to the
this ball right here this is your
material view and this is going to give
you the option of being able to like
color in this object so let's just I
have this one particular face selected
since I'm in edit mode I can go over to
make sure the material is selected and
then I can go over to new so I can press
+ and then it gives me this empty
material and it's a Lambert type I can
change the different types to it and
everything I can change the intensity
and there's so many different options
there and it takes a long time to master
before right now we're not going to
worry too much about it but we are going
to change the color of it so I'm just
going to go ahead and change that and
now if I go back over to this white ball
and I go back over to let's see what it
looks like with the texture on it you
can see that I'm showing the object with
the texture now so that's pretty cool
and if I wanted to see it in the
rendered view this is what it would look
like and you can see it's kind of shiny
that's some of that specular that's on
it you can see that shininess someone's
going to look better in unity but you
can see that that has a actual material
applied to it so let's go back over to
our texture mode real quick and I'm
going to go ahead and remove this
material so I can just go over here
where this material is in the box and
this will actually show you all the
materials that you have selected and I
can just click subtract I should be able
to anyway so let me go back into object
mode so I just changed it from edit mode
to object mode I'm gonna see if I can I
don't mean to do that let me get rid of
that so then you can you can delete the
material you may have to be an object
mode actually didn't realize that but
just go back into object mode and delete
it alright now we're going to look at
another crazy useful feature which is
available in edit mode so if we go back
into our little object selector we're
going to go back into edit mode and I
want to grab the face so I'll grab the
face and then I'm gonna grab this face
and I want to change the view
mode so it goes back to solid so we can
see what the hell we're doing and I have
this one top face selected so if I have
it in edit mode and I have the face
selected on the left hand side of your
tools panel see this is a creating
here's the tools if that is selected you
can click this thing called subdivide
which is really cool and it will
subdivide the object because this will
give you more precision like if I wanted
to just you know make a hole inside that
object I could delete those faces and
now I have this hole like this gaping
hole inside my object now it's like some
sort of piece of duct or something I
have no idea but you see what I mean so
ctrl Z to undo that so definitely
grabbing face and using the subdivide
tools that is hugely important okay and
I'm going to undo the subdivide now
let's go ahead and look at a complicated
part of 3d and that's called UV wrapping
UV wrapping is a pain in the ass it's
actually taking a three-dimensional
object and basically putting wrapping
paper around it but the wrapping paper
is like you're drawn out you're drawn
out object so it gives you the you know
the real look and feel I mean the way
graphics are so graphics are so
realistic nowadays because they're
taking real images and real textures and
they're applying it to three-dimensional
objects and it makes them look very real
and it's a difficult process it's hard
to master and the problem with doing it
is that you have to find a way to what's
called unwrap your object and let's go
ahead and see if I can do it on a simple
demonstration of that so we're going to
go back into object mode so I can delete
the entire thing and I'm going to shrink
this a little bit so we have a little
bit more room I'm going to go over to
the create and I'm going to create click
on so we'll just do we'll just do a cube
and UV unwrapping
I'm going to have to give you guys a
visual image because this was very hard
for me to actually describe so the way
to describe it is at a square box when
you're looking at it is going to be a
horrible looking square but your square
box looks like this right that's
horrible but you know what I'm talking
about when you cut this thing out you
need to find a way to be able to say
okay I'm going to have to cut this and
this and this so that way the entire
three-dimensional object can unfold into
a flat look and feel like what you see
here and this is a hard skill to do like
this is a simple box but as models get
very complicated it gets very difficult
to be able to what's called finding a
seam and in determining where to cut
that object so that when it lays flat it
lays flat in a way that you can make
sense of it so we're going to look at
how we do that and we do that using
something called a seam so we need to
make sure that we're in edit mode and
we're going to go and select this object
right and I want to go into edge mode
because what we're going to be doing is
we're actually going to say where this
joint needs to be cut and we'll look at
a few different options here so let's
first go ahead and and see what happens
if I select the entire thing so if I
select the entire thing and I can do
that in a keyboard keyboard shortcut by
saying I'm just hitting a a I'll also
deselect so if you just deselect and
click again and select and then if we
say you for unwrapped we could say
unwrap and it'll unwrap this UV and it
actually what it did is it took all four
sides of this thing and just laid them
on one UV side so there's no way that
you could actually say I want this side
to look like this or this side to look
like that basically if I did something
to this UV on that you see down here and
this is in the UV editor if I put like
an image on there that image would
appear on all four sides and that's
probably not what we want we want our
box to have like you know some sort of
label on the side and a label on another
side and
you know labels on the other side so
this particular UV unwrap isn't going to
work for us at all so what we need to do
is we need to find a way of actually
getting the UV and we do that by marking
a seam of how this thing can unfold so
let's let's see if we can figure this
out so we're going to say we're going to
go ahead and mark so grab this first
edge make sure you're in your edge
selection down here again and that
you're in edit mode and you're going to
grab that edge and we're going to hold
down shift or click it doesn't matter
and I said shift or click I meant shift
or ctrl and we're going to grab a couple
of these and see if we can unwrap it
this way
we'll grab it down here and I'm holding
the middle mouse button orbit around and
I think that might work I'm not a
hundred percent sure we're going to take
a look I'm not very good at this seaming
thing what we need to do though is we
need to press ctrl e and then we're
going to say mark scene and what that
does is if we deselect you'll see that
the seams now marked with these red
lines now let's go ahead and select all
the edges again or we actually go to
face mode so select the face mode and
then hold our press a to select
everything and then we're going to you
to unwrap again and now that wasn't the
perfect unwrapping but you can see that
now we at least have all the different
sides of the cube that are laid out in a
unwrapped manner and you could play
around with how you mark the seams to be
able to get you know the ideal layout
you know similar to what I showed you
before it doesn't really matter but on
the UV editor down here you have
different options where you can say this
this actually selects the edges so it's
selecting all the edges of the vertices
and then this one select some the entire
face so you can see take a look at the
object on the right hand side you can
see as we select these different sides
like this one is in front of us that
one's on top front top front top so you
can see you can actually figure out from
your image you're like okay well the top
left is my top so let's go ahead and now
export this UV so that we can do
something with it
so if I go down here and I say go to UV
and then and the UV guys is right here
and go to export UV layout and then now
we just need to actually find a place to
save it to so I'll save it and we'll
call this a tutorial UV and then just
click over here on the right hand side
export UV layout and now we need to open
that up neither in Photoshop or
illustrator some sort of illustration
program so that we can draw on that UV
alright so here's my UV and now I'm an
illustrator so I'm going to go ahead and
and just illustrate this thing you zoom
out a little bit so in Illustrator I
would actually I have to play something
on top here so I can actually draw on
so if you're using illustrator just so
you know you'd have to stay file and in
place um what I'm going to do is
actually place the UV image that we just
saved and then I want to let me take my
and then I'm going to adjust my artboard
size Museum out a little bit so that my
artboard matches the actual UV and this
is all going to be depending on what
sort of editor program that you guys are
using so this is my my top right here so
let's go ahead and um I'll go to the
brush and then we're going to say test
and then try add some color here
obviously you'd have a lot you know a
lot better design you have image or you
apply like a texture or something like
that but this is going to be one real
sloppy example obviously but you would
take your time and do some pretty art or
at an image or do whatever you need to
do this looks like a child's experiment
so I'm just drawing here so now I have
an AUV wrap that I want to go and export
so I'm just going to go ahead and save
for the web I'll save it as a PNG and
then I'm going to go ahead and I'm just
not going to actually save it to the
same UV layout layout I had before so
tutorial UV I'll say yes alright now we
can go and minimize that so now that we
have this UV open let's go ahead and do
something over here right now it's going
to be a blender render by default we
want to go ahead and change that over to
cycles render so go ahead and do that
and we need to make sure that we're in
edit mode and we're going to go ahead
and add a new material so on the right
hand side here go over to this little
circle looks like a globe
and we're going to add a new material
like we did earlier in the video and
because we had this this top view open
which is called the node editor you're
going to see when we added a new
material that this little node thing has
popped up and we can actually pan it
with the middle mouse button to move
things left and right so I'm going to
make some room here and let's go over to
the add mode and we're going to say add
and then texture and then we say image
texture and we're going to place the
image texture right there and then now
we just need to say open and we're going
to look for the file that we just saved
so that is under documents and we call a
tutorial UV so we went ahead and applied
it and now what we need to do is we need
to click on this little color and then
drag it over to the diffuse color of the
material that we just created and it
looks like it didn't do anything but if
we change the render mode so if we look
at this little white ball down here
again and we change this over to either
texture or material you'll see that that
UV that we just created has now been
applied to our object now if I wanted to
get the actual rendered view to give me
a better idea on what you know something
like this would look like now keep in
mind there's like hardly any light in
this view but you can see that's kind of
what the texture looks like it's pretty
cool even though it's so sloppy
and let's go back over to the solid now
and we're going to go ahead and say
export so let's so go to file and then
we're going to say export as an FBX and
I'm just going to put it as this test
FBX where did that export it - hold on a
second I'll remember
yeah so if I exported there now if I go
ahead and pull up unity you can see I
have this game already set up which is
pretty terrible but um let's go ahead
and import that model so what we want to
do is we want to go over to our assets
and our standard assets down here and I
actually have a folder named my models
I'll just go ahead and import my model
into here so when I go ahead and import
a new asset and then I'm just going to
look for the test FBX item that we have
and we just saved
to be honest me I don't even know I
don't remember where I saved it now
there is test up VX alright so we go
ahead and we bring this in and what this
does is actually creates a materials
folder wherever you actually imported at
so you probably don't want it you
probably want to create a folder for
every model that you have because it's
going to create this materials folder
but if you drag the test into your
screen you're going to see that none of
the texture that we have was applied and
that's actually normal so let's go ahead
and and add that now so what I need to
do is I actually need to import a new
asset and I need to find my actual
tutorial UV and you can see that it's
actual unfolded UV and if I just click
and drag that onto the model and one of
the things I did that I screwed up guys
on I apologize is when we exported the
FBX model if you go over to our user
perspective when we zoom out you can see
that by default blender gives you a
light so if I go into object mode and I
click on this light I can actually
delete it I don't need it and it also
gives you a camera and that was that
weird camera view that we saw we change
this over to the camera view but I
wanted to lead down what I did is
because I saved as an FBX and I exported
it you can see when we brought in the
test cube over here that it brought in
the camera and the cube and all that
stuff so the camera and the lamp and we
didn't want either one of those but it
doesn't really matter I can go ahead and
just delete them here but you can then
select the the UV and then drag it to
your actual object and now you can see
in unity the mesh object has been added
so the controls on this are terrible but
here's the oh here's the object so even
though you know it's a very primitive
you know childlike drawing it's still
pretty cool we didn't put any physics on
there so we can walk right through a bit
I mean you got to admit that's still
kind of cool right I mean
my controls are terrible anyway so guys
that's going to wrap up this tutorial
man I hope you guys liked it let me know
if you have any questions and hopefully
I didn't go too quick I didn't want to
break this up into a whole bunch of
different videos and stuff it's hard to
just grasp I mean it's better just ok
start somewhere finish you know get
something done I think if if you guys
watch this video a few times kind of
learn the lessons that I have pointed
out I think you'll be able to do a lot
of at least basic kind of modeling you
won't be able to make this guy yet I
wish I could make this guy but I can't
and you know with this particular setup
here though I mean you should at least
be able to do some pretty basic shapes
to build some you know some basic games
and obviously you know perfect graphics
don't always mean the world I mean look
at Minecraft that guy had some the
graphics were unique I would say I mean
they weren't like terrible graphics but
they are obviously very blocky and he
was able to sell that game for two and a
half billion dollars so you guys can I'm
sure make a pretty cool game with some
relatively decent graphics even if
they're blocky and childlike alright
guys once again thanks for watching
