alright so we're gonna be doing some
mono game development and just a
disclaimer I'm not I'm a programmer but
I'm not a game programmer I've no
experience we gained programming
whatsoever not a very good math whiz
probably don't remember too much about
algebra or linear algebra or however you
even say that because I don't use it in
my day-to-day settings I do have some
programming experience with mainly
Python in c-sharp c-sharp I want to get
better at so it's really one of the
reasons why I'm focusing on mono game
model game just a requirement a few
things we're gonna need for this
tutorial you need to have Visual Studio
2012 because that's we're gonna be
working out of for a mono game project
because the mono game still has a
dependency on Microsoft's XNA framework
for a content pipeline which basically
is a programming code to manage your
your different files like audio and
photos and things like that that are
included in your game to be able to
stream those into your game and things
it requires a content pipeline and at
the moment mono game does not have one
so we're going to be using the XNA
framework 4.0 but that needs Visual
Studio 2012 so to just recap on that
we're going to use Visual Studio 2010
for the content pipeline and then we'll
use Visual Studio 2012 for the
development for mono game now for mono
game to be installed correctly you do
have to have the mono game 3.0 one you
can download that from mono games
website we also need to go ahead and
download the XNA framework 4.0 so I'll
just take that in right now and this
will work with Visual Studio 2010 you
don't have to buy Visual Studio you can
actually use the free edition and this
stuff will work for as long as yeah for
what we need it for anyway I do happen
to be using the professional Edition but
you don't
so I'm gonna go ahead and download this
now and just pause the video while we're
waiting all right so now that we have
that downloaded let's go ahead and run
their install
all right so we're gonna try to follow a
little bit of advice on that I found
online let's go ahead and copy this over
to our C directory just temporarily and
I'm just gonna rename it
XNA all right so that's go ahead and
open up a command prompt
and we're gonna go ahead and I was
looking on stackoverflow here it says
run XNA set up so let's try that I'm
gonna change the name note to what I did
nice a nice photo want to put in my
projects directory nice let's see if I
didn't get rid of that
I'm not sure if it's installed or what
Oh
Oh
all right this is somewhat of a pain
alright so now we have to jump through
more hoops apparently if you're on
Windows 8 if you're on Windows 7 you're
gonna install this with no problem with
Windows 8 you gotta go and download this
junk set this thing up first alright so
um once we do that let's go ahead and
try to run the Installer one more time
everything goes well this thing should
install now but who knows
well that's further than we got last
time
yeah all of the rules and here's alright
someone to pause this by this installs
now all right so this joint has been
installed and I don't want to go to
their website okay so now that that has
been installed let's go ahead and open
our Visual Studio 2012
we're gonna call the project we're gonna
make first game I already have one in
here they don't want to get rid of
all right so I'm going here say new
project and we're gonna say mono game
Windows OpenGL project and I'm gonna go
ahead and store this and my projects
directory of my C Drive and I'll call it
first game
all right I'm you're going to notice
some files over here in our solution
Explorer the game is like the main game
folder or file and then you have content
that's where your images and stuff we're
gonna sit and when we go ahead and run
this hood and you should get a blue
screen if you don't something's messed
up but if you do it means that the game
is running ok we got problems we got
problems now we need to make sure this
open AOL installer is installed says it
is if that is installed then this
should run doesn't
dude I don't even know what the man
I mean I'm gonna just get rid of this
SDL dll piece of I mean you would
think this thing would just work right
God and the reason why I say this is
that um there's actually like a second
or third video I've actually try to put
together just getting all this stuff up
and running like number one windows 23rd
Visual Studio 2013 don't even bother
trying it's not gonna work so you need
visual studio 2012 2010 XNA open a No
but anyway if everything went well
you're gonna have this little blue
screen and your game is running so oh my
god
hopefully you were able to get that set
up and continue along with the series
all right talk to you later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
