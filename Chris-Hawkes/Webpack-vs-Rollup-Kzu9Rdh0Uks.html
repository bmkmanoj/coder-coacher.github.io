gonna be looking at webpack vs. roll up
and roll up is a what they call a next
generation module bundler and it's
actually created by a guy named rich
harris out of the UK i believe let me
find him
i'm just talking about him because what
he created here was actually pretty good
and for quite a while now everybody's
been talking about webpack is being like
the module bundler that's replaced go up
and browserify like we no longer use go
up in browserify but this guy made a
hell of a project with roll-up j s and
it was actually something that Dan
Abramov the creator of Redux who now
works at Facebook was mentioning a few
months ago and it had me in to the point
where I was going to check out roll up
and see what's going on here so you can
see the project itself has over 8,000
stars and there there's one major major
benefit that roll-up has over webpack at
least webpack at the moment now webpack
too apparently is actually going to be
supporting the feature that roll-up
really does excel at and that is
actually tree shaking so a lot of you
guys are kind of newbie developers or at
least some of you guys so I just want to
give a demonstration on what this tree
shaking is so you can actually see it in
action because it's probably it's
something that I think is is extremely
important I've seen so many different
projects that are using react and redux
and all these other different javascript
libraries where you're downloading 1.8
Meg of like a bundled minified
javascript file that is just absolutely
humongous so being able to reduce the
amount of dependencies that are being
brought into this humongous javascript
file or it's a huge deal and i'm the
only one that's been able to do it
successfully so far as roll-up and they
really made webpack have to you know
halt their breaks on that project to say
hold on a second let's go ahead and
reevaluate this and went back to and
make sure we support this feature
because if they didn't then rollup was
definitely going to take away all the
thunder their web pack has had over the
years here and really it's been a short
ride for web pack probably about a year
or so I would say but they are
addressing it so I will get to that in
just a moment so let's go ahead and just
take a look here I have a folder that
I'm going to say on my tutorials and
we're gonna put it and roll up and I'll
just go into my command line CMD so
we're gonna install just set up our
project here
and I'm just gonna call this roll-up
versus webpack big ugly name alright so
now that we have that I could say I'm
p.m. save ya base sign actually I'll
just say so this is the web framework
that created it's a very minimalistic
simple node.js framework that already
has the static templates and everything
already built in which is really all the
reason why I ended up using this over
something like Express because then I
have to do a couple more steps for my my
tutorial all right so now that Bayside's
installed what we want to do is go into
our package config file so I'm going to
go into here in this package dot JSON
file you can see Bayside's add it as a
dependency we want to go to our scripts
and add a side down here that way we can
actually reference a locally installed
base ID which is in our node modules and
not the global Bayside which is just
better to do okay so now that it's in
there I could say NPM I'm sorry NPM run
Bayside and I give it an argument so I
was a great project and then the name of
the project which is app and this will
spin up my Bayside app so if I wanted to
run it I can say no app and you can see
the server is listening on port 3000 my
press control-c to actually stop that
one of the things I want to do now is I
want to install I'm gonna install
roll-up so we're gonna say I'm here and
NPM install we're gonna be saved up for
this born this roll-up would just be use
for developing and not for distributing
as a rollup is actually you can see a
pretty small project it downloaded
pretty quickly so now in order to get
this set up here let's go ahead and add
roll-up we're gonna do the same thing
here so that we can reference our
locally installed roll-up instead of
having to do it globally all right so
now inside of my static folder which got
spun up for me when we created this
project I'm going to create a Jas folder
and then we're gonna have we'll just
call this modules Jas and then we'll
create an entry so we're gonna say entry
Jo so that's our entry starting point
so in our modules we're just gonna have
to do the default we're gonna add
default form since we're just gonna
export to function so we'll say export
function we want and this is just gonna
say alright and then we're gonna do
another one that just says we don't want
something to copy this alright so you
can see we have two functions here that
are just being exported from this
modules folder so now if we said import
all as mother's same as modules from
actually I should just be able to say
modulo all right so now if we say
modules dot what's the name of our first
one we call this we want okay so now
we're gonna call we want alright so what
we've done is we imported all the
modules from module CAS and we and we
only use we want out of the two modules
that got imported so you can see we
don't want was not called inside of this
file but what we're going to do is we're
going to use roll-up to actually compile
this file and in order to do that we
actually need to set up a rollup config
file so in the role of config file it's
gonna be called roll-up config jas and
inside here Wednesday export default
which is the default object that will be
exported I'm gonna give it an entry
point which is very similar to what
we've done in the past with web pack and
I'll just go we have entry as the name
of our file entry at Jas ok and then we
have to add a few arguments here we can
say target given an object will say
destination and this is what we're just
going to play the bundle Jas and I'll
even call it bundle roll-up so we know
the difference bundle roll-up Jas and
I'm gonna say I want the format to be in
ES and then we didn't give it a module
name it doesn't really matter
we're just gonna call this role all
right so here's our roll-up config now
in order for us to be able to run this
once again you have to make sure roll-up
is added to your scripts and in order to
pass an argument to roll up to tell it
to actually compile your stuff you have
to do - - so watch what I do here I'm
gonna say NPM run roll-up and I need to
do two hyphens to actually give it an
argument of - C which means config file
and that tells roll to use a config file
and it knows by default to use the role
of dot config dot J's file as a default
you can change that if you wanted to but
by default that is the name of the file
and you
to do anything so that's the best way to
do it all right so now you can see
bungle dot roll up and you can see what
we have here is we have even though we
said import everything we only have the
one function that we needed so that's
what tree-shaking means it means that it
goes through and it actually looks at
all the usages of all the modules and
everything that you're actually
importing and it only imports
specifically what you need in order for
your project to work so you can see this
bundle dot roll up is like I mean it's a
very small if I reveal any Explorer and
I look inside here you can see it's a
tiny file that's one KB that's that's
it's very very small all right so now
let's look at the equivalent real quick
of web pack and with no tree shaking by
default which is what web pack has at
least one pack 1.0 and I know 2.0 you
have to do some jump through some hoops
everything but let's go ahead and say
npm install and say save what
all right so now that that is installed
we're gonna do the same thing that we
did before and I'm gonna go into my
package JSON web pack alright now we're
going to add a web pack da config file
so web pack config j/s and here we're
gonna say module dot exports so this is
the same thing we did before output
expects an object's I'm going to say
path our name and then file name and we
can just give this I'll just call it web
pack I say here's our web pack config so
now web pack by default it knows to use
the web a config I don't actually give
it any swear arguments so we go to run
this it's going to find the config file
automatically alright looks like I made
a mistake
I thought okay
all right it's simply not jumping out at
me let me try this again
all right weird it's almost like I
didn't change anything so that's weird
I'm so I might've just needed a second I
don't know that's that's weird okay so
here's our webpack bond though now you
can see this one's three point twelve KB
so quite a bit larger than the roll-up
and if we look at what we have bundled
up we go to our web pack bundle and you
can see all this stuff a lot of this is
by default with web pack one but let's
go down to the important part where you
can see this it actually imported even
what we don't want and what we're not
using so that is you know tree shaking
by demonstration and hopefully you guys
understand what that that is now because
a lot of people are talking about that
because of the amount of you know
network latency and then having to
download a humongous javascript file is
it's really important like a lot of web
pack bundlers nowadays a lot of people
using web pack anyway they it's better
to set up a situation where you have
like jQuery any other sort of large
dependencies you might have you want to
make sure that those are all actually
imported and maintained by their own
separate config file that don't actually
get included inside of your project
because there have been situations where
modules that get created are referencing
other modules that also reference
independent libraries inside of those
modules and and and essentially what you
can have is you can end up having things
like jQuery loaded twice into the same
minified javascript file and you would
never want that but I've actually seen
it happen roll-up prevents that sort of
thing from happening and also just you
know making sure you design your web
pack in a way where when you're building
modules that you don't actually include
some of those dependencies that would
cause them to be wrapped up into those
modules so it's it's tough to do because
sometimes like you just ends up
happening as you're developing you don't
really give it too much mind but that is
a big problem as far as the amount of
you know the sizes of our JavaScript
files so you can see bundle roll up is
much
because that's all we ever needed
compared to the to the webpack bundle so
web pack is still good now when we
compared the two projects web pack is
gonna have more support more popularity
web pack 2 is now calling for tree
shaking one of the first are arguments
I've read about tree shaking how it can
be introduced with web pack 2.0 you have
to have the latest version of apples
safe sway 2.0 and there's just litter so
kind of a lot you have to do it does it
just doesn't work by default so
hopefully you know that gets a little
bit easier with time and as far as like
you know the two projects are both you
know obviously highly regarded on github
and they have a lot of support and right
now if you wanted tree shaking it's
hugely important for you then I think
that roll up wins over over web pack
however when if you ask me you know
which one has the most you know most
possibility for for being around a
little bit longer than than the other
then I would probably say web pack at
this point but then again things change
so quickly it seems like just yesterday
everybody was using gulp and browser 5
for module loading we're now we don't
even talk about those two anymore it's
all about it's all about web pack and
then now would roll up I mean and
there's other module bundlers as well so
the fact that you know the community and
in a way they're always coming out with
these new features and things get
outdated so quickly in JavaScript day it
could be a good thing in some ways
because like web pack it's like well we
should have tree shaking I mean that
should be something that that we all
need I mean in this day and age with
modular JavaScript development it's
really important all right guys um so
that's really that's really it for the
comparison now everything else man I
think it you know these are two awesome
projects so it doesn't really matter
which side you go if you're trying to
look for the minimalistic approach I
would say roll up and then if you want a
more mainstream approach I would say
probably web pack at this point alright
guys thanks for watching have a good day
bye hey guys so a lot of you asked me
how do I get my foot in the door to
become a programmer and I just want to
take a moment to mention dev Mountain
coding boot camp is a 12-week intensive
course that focuses on the technologies
of the here-and-now for web development
some of the things that they're actually
teaching in this 12-week course it's
geared to get you into the industry by
focusing on things like Jake
no js' react angular how to use github
so a lot of the things that you're going
to need to do as a developer as soon as
you start they're going to be teaching
you in this and this coding bootcamp and
the entire goal is to be able to get you
into the industry within 12 weeks so if
you guys are interested in learning more
information about Deb mountain coding
bootcamp just check out the link in the
description tab of this video thank you
