video of the Ingo programming tutorial
series and in this video what we want to
look at is a raise and a raise and go
compared to other languages are not as
flexible and they're not as widely used
but we still need to know what they are
and what they look like and in the
following videos we'll get into
something that's used in replacement of
arrays which is somewhat similar looking
but they are different so let's go ahead
and create an array and we're gonna do
an integer array so what we do is we use
the VAR keyword and we'll just say my
array and then you want to give it the
actual index number that is gonna be the
amount of values in in the array now
since we're using an integer and we
haven't specified what those values are
we're just basically saying the array
which is my array is gonna have five
elements in it and since we haven't
defined what those elements are if we
use the print line and we just print
this out to the array go was gonna print
zero as the default integer placeholder
so you can see that there's five zero
elements because that's what we said
there was five elements in this array so
if we wanted to go through and update
each individual array element we would
do that by using a index and the index
is in square brackets where we say take
the zero element which is the first
element of the array and make it equal
to one and then we do the same thing for
like one so the one index which is
actually the second element and we'll
say equals two and on and on that's how
you can update individual elements of a
go array so you can see one two three is
now replaced a default zero and since we
haven't defined there our third or
fourth index those are zero now what's
interesting is we're saying that this
array should hold five element so just
keep in mind that although there's five
elements the actual elements start
counting at zero so you can't reference
my array fifth element because it's
actually the sixth spot in the array and
you'll end up getting a compiler error
so you can see that the index is out of
balance so the array stops at four
now this doesn't have to be an integer
so this could be five strings and it
would work the same exact way where we
can take individual elements of the
array and then assign a value but you
wouldn't be signing so this is a string
instead of an integer and you can see
this is the same process here and the
default integer values or I'm sorry to
default string values for the array is
an empty string so that's what that
space is there for right so the thing
that sucks about it raised is that you
have to know what their size is they
need to be a declared size they can't be
they can't just be determined on the fly
so you have to actually when you build
the array you have to know how big it is
that's what makes it very inflexible but
instead of actually having to declare
each line one by one you can actually do
it all in one one thing so if I want to
do it all in one line I can get rid of
the VAR keyword and just do the
shorthand colon equals and then after
the five string I then use curly braces
where I can go ahead and specify
whatever strings I want it to contain
and when we print you'll see that it
prints out all five values that were
instantiated so declared and
instantiated at the same time instead of
having to go through each element and
update the value one by one alright guys
so that's going to be the the video on
arrays and once again you're not gonna
see them as often as what we're going to
talk about in the next video which is
slices which are a lot more flexible
than a race in the go programming
language alright guys thanks for
watching and please subscribe bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
