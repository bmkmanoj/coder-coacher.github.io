want to take a moment to talk about
parallel versus a synchronous
programming these are terms that are
coming up quite a bit in the modern era
and both of them have kind of claimed I
think at different times to be the
future of how we're going to be
programming so I just want to kind of
touch on that real quick and hopefully
answer some beginner level questions
about what the differences are so let's
first look at non parallel programming
before we actually look at parallel
programming it means that a script is
executed from top to bottom and all
processes essentially waits one at a
time I should probably should've edited
that paragraph Jesus but it says so
basically and how the browser interprets
script tags is the way a non parallel
program would be executed so it sits top
to bottom left to right as soon as a
script tag is reached in the head of the
HTML page the browser is going to load
that javascript page and its entirety
before moving on to the next script tag
so that is how our typical procedural
programming works it's like okay execute
task a okay I'm done with task a I'm
going to task B okay I'm done the task B
I'm going to task C now the reason why
problems exist and we have needs for a
synchronous programming in parallel
programming is that sometimes you know
task a can be quick and then and then
move on to task B but task B might be
hitting a database that is constantly
being pounded by network traffic and it
could possibly be you know taking 30
seconds or something like that to
fulfill well we're the user is waiting
you know the entire 30 seconds for that
to hit to happen
so wouldn't it be nice if you could have
some sort of feature like okay execute B
but while I'm waiting for B if C doesn't
need anything from B let's go ahead and
execute C so let's move on so let's look
at parallel programming parallel
programming means processing can be done
simultaneous simultaneously via
different threads being handled by
however many CPUs your computer has so
most modern computers have four CPUs I
think that's what my computer currently
has but I know some people can have up
to like 16 cores in 30 the 32 cores and
so that's insanity but if you however
many cores you have
if you write a program that can be run
and run processes and a parallel fashion
and what that means is like if I have
some sort of function that says create a
new bottle of coke or something like
that there's quite a bit of work that
has to go into each one of those
processes and if I'm able to execute for
those like build four coke bottles at
the same time because I have four
processes then parallel programming
makes a lot of sense there are certain
scenarios over like you can only make
one bottle at a time there's a certain
like set of procedures and everything
that has to take place if your
architecture is not designed in a
parallel processing way so it's like in
the Koch example it's it most programs
because we used to only have one core
most programming languages and most
programs written with those languages
were written in a way that essentially
only allows you to ever create one coke
bottle because there was only one
processor to run threads on so in this
case so like this new way of thinking so
we would want to design our entire
architecture to be able to take in four
coke bottles at a time or however many
or maybe an indefinite number of coke
bottles in fact that would be the way to
do it because we might have eight cores
you know here as a standard in five
years from now so maybe a whole lot more
than that but anyway you understand the
point I'm trying to make is that the
parallel programming is actually
something that came about much later in
the advent of programming in computer
science so it's it's a relatively infant
baby and the technological world that we
live in right now I mean if you look at
programming in general it's a very very
young thing and parallel programming is
even younger I mean talking like the
last 20 years or so whether it being a
common thing with us having pcs that
have these multi cores so again not all
code can be written in a way to be able
to run processes like you know creating
four code files at the same time and
then being able to save those at the
same time like it takes a lot of
architecture a lot of thinking to make
sure everything is built in a
non-blocking way and that with parallel
programming as opposed to a synchronous
programming that we're going to see
parallel programming and programming has
even more of a problem because you have
to make sure that nothing in that
process is going to rely on
the execution of a previous process you
know what I mean so that that is a
definite problem that you can have
everything has to be essentially built
in a way that does not block alright so
a synchronous programming then is the
ability to program very similar to
parallel programming but on a single
thread so there's not there's not actual
multiple cores being executed and
processes aren't running simultaneously
not at the exact same time they're
running at the same time but not the
exact same time so the term actually is
is you hear a lot where the synchronous
programming is actually concurrency so
the asynch of weight model that is been
introduced to so many languages now is
actually part of that concurrent model
it's part of the a synchronous
programming pattern so in my opinion and
this is just opinion synchronous
programming is actually the the easier
option of the two it's actually the more
popular option because it's easier it's
just easier to reason about your code
when you can do little keyword tags like
a sink and a weight just to set up
certain blocks of functionality that can
say okay I need this functionality to
wait for this other piece of
functionality but stuff can still
execute in the meantime because it's all
still being executed on the single
thread it's just things are being done
at different points in time and not in
that procedural top-to-bottom fashion
that I described about how the browser
interprets script tags at the beginning
of this video so it's much easier the
reason why it's so and because it's
easier it's now introduced into
languages like C sharp and JavaScript
now has a sink in a weight JavaScript
promise pattern is also essentially how
this is synchronous programming is being
done within JavaScript and within the
new modern yes 6 standard so if you guys
want to get started with JavaScript I
would say like definitely look at look
at promises and that's gonna be the
closest thing you can see to a sync
programming with JavaScript now when to
use parallel programming really it's for
absolutely like mission-critical like
major major amounts of processing
products like Hadoop that is that uses
map and reduce or MapReduce and has is
built for big data for just processing
massive amounts of data and that is the
type of thing you want to set that type
of programming language and technology
up on
you know a server with 32 cores and you
just started massively processing things
and and but once again that is may that
is massive overkill for your typical web
application for your typical newbie
developer that's just getting started
these are just like I said
mission-critical big data huge projects
that can that can that really that the
money that is required to build the
system around a truly parallel parallel
system of programming it takes a
tremendous amount of effort upfront
after a lot of you know obviously for
forethought and everything so there's
there's a an investment that needs to be
made by companies I want to go that
route and it's not the best investment
for everybody so that's why you still
haven't seen parallel programming take
off into this like I would say
widespread thing that we do like day in
and day out so when to use the
synchronous programming I would say that
you would want to use that anytime that
you can I've seen asp.net backends that
are a synchronous to the core where all
the controller endpoints and everything
are all built with the asynch away
keyboard tags and
it Li was like so if you do that with
asp.net then you allow a C to the C
sharp and dotnet runtime to behave in a
way that's very similar to how node
behaves so that it's non-blocking so it
can take as many requests as as you want
to throw at it and it's going to still
process them one by one and as quickly
as it possibly can but it never you you
never block the the thread so that they
can't receive new requests and that's
the difference between the two so with
node it's single threaded so I did want
to mention that it's actually single
threaded and dotnet is is it's a sync is
actually multi-threaded asynch so there
is a difference between the two but the
similarity and how you develop and the
end experiences is going to be quite
similar so what if you're new to
programming a lot of you guys on my
channel are new to programming so I'm
trying to introduce you guys to concepts
and things like that so that you at
least understand it and you can you can
have a basic under
you're not gonna be a parallel
programming expert you're not gonna be
in a synchronous programming expert if
you're brand new
I would definitely focus on JavaScript
and the promises pattern because that's
gonna be the closest thing you're gonna
be
dealing with with a sink of weight
probably right out the gate and then I
wouldn't bother trying to build parallel
processing like systems or you're even
dealing too much with a saint can wait
if you're brand new like typically
you're gonna need it several years of
experience to be able to architect a
system that is going to work truly well
I've seen parallel programming in fact
I've done parallel programming and
c-sharp where I was trying to build
applications that could run stuff and I
started seeing that even though I was
trying to use parallel programming
constructs I was still writing things in
a and a procedural single-threaded type
of mindset and I was being hosed during
certain pieces that I would try to tie
together and things like that so it's
very challenging and like I don't think
it's something that a complete newbie
should be jumping on like if it's going
to detract you away from other things
that you could learn that you may not
cause you to pull your hair out and
things like that so that's really all I
got once again make sure you guys leave
a comment and and if you guys have
resources for parallel programming or a
sync programming that you want to share
just go ahead and feel free to leave it
in the comments and I'll try to add
stuff to the description as I see fit
and just let me know if you have any
questions guys thanks for watching have
a good day bye so this video was brought
to you by a dead mountain coding boot
camp they're a boot camp that is based
out of Utah but they're also in Texas in
Arizona now and they have very good
reviews so make sure you guys check them
out the link is in the description tab
below they offer courses in web
development iOS development UX or user
experience design Quality Assurance and
just a few other ones in fact they're
even getting into Salesforce as well now
so they're continuing to adapt their
courses based on what the market needs
are and major companies are hiring some
of their alumni so make sure you guys
give them a look they have great reviews
and thanks for watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
