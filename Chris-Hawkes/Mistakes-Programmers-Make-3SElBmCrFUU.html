reason over the last like couple weeks
I've had this like fascination with like
reading up on this guy George on
Armstrong Custer and that's actually
kind of the person that I am I get in
you know these curiosity stints were
like I'll start reading up on somebody
or something and it just not even as a
way to pass time but i'm just generally
people that I'm interested in but I've
always been like a big history fan
because I feel like history repeats
itself you can learn so much from
history and it's something that so many
people find this interesting and that
they overlook and in many ways they have
very ignorant beliefs and things like
that because they don't understand you
know history or the history of even why
they believe the way that they do so a
lot a lot of you know the way people
think about things can actually be I
think uncovered or at least you know
getting their perspective of things can
be uncovered by looking at history and
you know that said you'd like i said i
have had this fascination lately with
this guy George Armstrong Custer and
where I live in the DC area this was
basically the dividing line between the
North and the South and 1860s when the
american civil war broke out it was
fighting on a scale that really hadn't
been seen you know at that time you know
we obviously had like people like
napoleon before that and obviously the
ancient dynasties of like near the
chinese and things like that also had
their their major warfare and stuff like
that but the Civil War was different for
the Americans and really for the entire
world in that it was one of the first
wards that actually brought in
photography so there was like
photography that was taken of like the
brutal killings and things like that the
United States was a relatively young
country when this whole thing broke out
and and a lot of it wasn't even taken
seriously but there was also it was also
one of the first times that like rations
there was so much it's so much logistics
involved in and actually being able to
you know feed entire nations and thing
or you know these these humongous armies
I mean literally armies of you know over
a hundred thousand men would converge on
each other and days of fighting and some
you know it was just brutal basically it
was like the first steam or ironclad was
developed during the American Civil War
were like there was a humongous battle
like a port battle that occurred between
these two ironclad ships that other
navies didn't even have including the UK
and things like that and essentially you
know just it basically broaden the the
warfare all across in the world i mean
the repeating rifle was created during
this time the Gatling gun basically what
would become trench warfare and World
War one takes a lot of that influence
from you know the north and the south
and the American Civil War also you know
things like the disease that was rampant
I mean most soldiers actually died from
disease and not from actual you know
gunfire or being wounded another thing
that is very fascinating to me and this
war was like when the war broke out like
in the United States was a relatively
young country nobody really thought this
war would be as bad as it was but daring
you know the first couple years like
there was no way of of them taking care
of the dead so like there would
literally be thousands upon thousands of
dead people like bloating rotting on
farm fields and stuff like that and
there was no method for burying them
properly or identifying who was killed
and stuff like that so all around where
I live there's all these like tombs of
the Unknown were like you know though
they'll dig a trench and just like
thoroughly there's some over it of one
battlefield that went to that was
literally just grave site upon grave
site of the markers would show how many
bodies were in there so like some of the
markers were up to like 15 many had just
like four and five but they were just
basically taking these humongous groups
of people and they just throw me into a
pit so their families never knew what
ever happened to him or where they were
buried and things like that and you know
many of them couldn't even be identified
because they were just left there to rot
and stuff like that and including some
of the you know some of the soldiers
would later be dug up by animals and
stuff like that because they would just
be like you know basically covered over
so that the whole warfare was extremely
brutal I've been reading up on it
for many years now and I'm a big world
war two guys well but with a you know
I've never really been a huge Armstrong
Custer fan or anything like that but
just what would I what I think I'd
identified with with him in a way that
he came from a relatively poor family he
went to West Point and basically by the
skin of his teeth at West Point was the
best military academy in the United
States at the time and still is
obviously it's like you know it is the
military academy in the United States
but just even him being able to get in
his father was just say like a
relatively low paid blacksmith for the
town where he came out of and I'm you
know he gets into West Point he was kind
of a troublemaker of a kid and got in
trouble just left and right and and damn
near got kicked out of the Academy on
several different occasions and and
actually by the time he graduated like I
said he did it all through tlie by the
skin of his teeth like he ended up
graduating dead last in his class and
for that reason he was essentially
assigned to the Calvary divisions which
were like considered not as I guess
prominent or high ranking as some of the
other you know tougher positions i would
say for being in like you know being an
infantryman because you were on the
front lines and inventory men but being
on a horse I mean you were very mobile
and a lot of times you're doing
reconnaissance and stuff like that so he
was given that you know command of like
I said the the Calvary and um and it
just it's fascinating like you if you
look at his life through the American
Civil War he was at the first battle
that where everything broke out at the
Battle of Bull Run and then he was also
there when the Southern General of the
army of northern virginia robert e lee
surrendered at Appomattox em he was
there so he was there it was promoted to
these high-ranking well actually to
general of volunteer forces under
general McClellan who was the original
leader of the north during this fighting
but he ended up getting replaced by
Lincoln but even you know during
Lincoln's time here according to this
Wikipedia photo you can see Abraham
Lincoln's right here on this top hat and
here's Custer over here on the
right-hand side who was actually in his
early 20s during that photo so even
though
he looks like this old man he was only
in his early 20s and at this point you
know this is McClellan still in charge
knees right here and lately is the Arabs
are link has actually mad at him because
he didn't pursue lead after the Battle
of Antietam and Antietam in maryland
this battle when the south came up in
the Maryland and actually invaded was
the bloodiest battle and still is the
bloodiest day in American history so for
all the silting of the soldiers that
have died in World War two and World War
one and everything else Antietam is
still the bloodiest day in American
history but I say you can see Custer was
even there for that so for so basically
this dude survives so many different
things he's basically not even really
supposed to be there he gets promoted to
general some people say like he got
promoted accidentally to general but he
ends up losing that that title after the
war because there was his like entirely
separate divisions between whether or
not you were general evolved your forces
or actual army forces and stuff like
that so I thought that was pretty
interesting but I'm he ends up like so
basically he's in a ton of different
battles and stuff like that he's known
for his bravery like he would be very
flamboyant and everything we're like he
would stand out from the crowd by
wearing next ashes I rednecks ashes
having this long like flowing blond hair
and like you know he basically dressed
to the part and all this stuff and and
of all the good that he did in the
American Civil War and all the bravery
and everything like that this dude is
known for one specific mistake which
occurred after the Civil War roughly a
decade after the Civil War slightly over
a decade where I'm he gets wiped out by
the this Zoo which and it wasn't just a
Sioux Indians but the Sioux is a Native
Americans and it was out of Custer's
last stand but it was it's interesting I
think in some regard because the
programmers are kind of in the same same
fashion like you know we have to write
code day in the day out and sometimes
we're writing it excellent and more on
top of our game day on a day out but one
small mistake now grant is not as bad as
in Custer's your mistake because the
mistake cost him his life but one small
mistake for a programmer and you can end
up releasing some sort of bug into the
wild that ends up costing a company
millions of dollars or you know costing
them hundreds of customers or lawsuits
or you know you never know you know what
could end up happening but it's funny
because a lot of times we're known and
identified because of our mistakes
instead of what we actually accomplished
in our lives and I think that's you know
it's a relatively unfortunate thing like
if you actually read up on how much this
guy accomplished and all the stuff that
he lived through like charging headlong
in the battles you know one major battle
after another and the civil war
basically just you know miraculously
surviving at it without really ever
being seriously wounded and then you
know to be to be wiped out by Native
Americans was uh you know it was
relatively unheard of because um yeah he
made he made several mistakes leading up
to his death but it's just it's just
really interesting and I think
programmers in the same sense can also
be a thought up in the same way like we
write code and we ship it out one day
and and then when we're looking at that
code like somebody else's code they
wrote two years ago we don't really
understand you know the compliment
accomplishments that they've had prior
to that like maybe this is their first
foray into JavaScript and and they've
been writing cobalt ore for trainers on
like that for the longest time and you
know maybe they have a PhD at something
else and they just happen to write some
sloppy jQuery code or something like
that because they had just jumped into
it now but a lot of times we kind of
judge them based on you know what their
last thing was like what is there and
what basically what have you done for me
lately type of thing and I think with
programmers it's it's the same way like
we're forced to go in and learn new
things time and time again and and a lot
of times we're not given enough credit
for the amount of work that it takes to
actually be able to you know to learn
something new and then like our previous
accomplishments aren't taken into
consideration in many cases and in a way
I think that sucks because a lot of
companies out there it's like the new
norm for IT workers in the United States
to actually work for a company for like
two or three years and then jump on to
the next company you see that mindset
with so many different people and like
you don't end up like really building
any sort of seniority with the company
and a lot of times they might be able to
entice you to pay you 120,000 give you
five weeks of vacation and stuff like
that but then you're only going to
with the company for you know two or
three years and in many cases you don't
even get to use all these benefits that
are supposedly so great so with Custer
even though he was this you know this
great general man had accomplished so
much he made a lot of mistakes
throughout his life as well you know
coming from a poor family and obviously
coming from really the school the Hard
Knocks considering that he was involved
with a lot of other people that were
pretty much fed with a silver spoon and
and may even had you know better
academic expertise and he didn't things
like that but it it didn't affect his
ability to be able to be a good leader
and the leader of men and but all that
stuff is just overshadowed by a simple
mistake that he made later on in life I
mean anybody knows that the Battle of
the Little Bighorn and Montana territory
essentially what they were trying to do
United States was um you know
persecuting Indians right and the Native
Americans out west and the Cheyenne the
Sioux a couple of other tribes either
Dakota Lakota and Arapaho i think it was
rapaho Indians um so there's you know
these all these Indians that they're
putting on these reservations and
everything and they're promising I'm all
these deals and are promising them like
guns and food and all this stuff but
there was a lot of actual corruption
going on with the President of the
United States at that time in his entire
administration dealing with a lot of
these these American Indian Affairs and
basically they were they were watching
their lands get taken away from them the
Black Hills of South Dakota which is a
montana area they knew that was their
land and the United States was
essentially just taking it and people
were trying to settle it in mine for
silver and other things at the time and
they weren't you know so basically all
these different tribes left and under
the leadership of Sitting Bull which was
like one of the most commanding Indian
chiefs of this time you know he ended up
getting all these huge tribes that
normally don't cooperate together to
actually unite together to actually
build a fight and basically hold their
their final remaining bits of land
because these people were very no matter
if they lived off the land they went
from place to place just grazing off the
land and stuff like that so this was
their their final last straw and
literally like 10,000 of them left their
Indian reservations that they were on
and we're no matically staying you know
throughout the Black Hills area in
Montana territory and Custer was sent in
to go ahead and find these guys in fact
it was not just coaster but two generals
that were in charge and Custer was a
lieutenant colonel and he ends up
breaking off about 600 men but what he
ended up doing is dividing his men into
like four different groups one group had
to stay back because they were like the
mule cars that had most of the supplies
for the men and then I'm he broke his
men up into three different sections so
he had a roughly 200 people following
him but one of the guys that actually
was um responsible for trying to back
him up was this guy Frederick Benteen
and this guy Benteen actually hated him
for the longest time dating all the way
back to like a decade in our previous to
that and he was also considered a civil
war hero at the time but he hated Custer
because he felt Custer had on abandoned
this guy named Joel Elliott who was
another officer in the in the united
states army and during an Indian attack
in what is present-day Oklahoma I
believe he uh he accused Custer of
actually abandoning this guy and his
sixteen men who got cut off from the
regiment and they all ended up getting
wiped out by Cheyenne Indians so
apparently when Benteen got word that
Custer was actually surrounded I'm after
this battle a little bighorn he like he
didn't rush to his aid so he had roughly
200 men that he could have helped Custer
at the time which Custer I'd like 215
but he didn't rush to his aid and then
the other division that the fourth
remaining division actually had gotten
attacked earlier because they will they
attack the Indian village and we're
repressed back and just a long story
short I'm you know Custer and his entire
group get surrounded and you know this
dude looks through so much and then he
dies in such a unusual way basically but
ultimately it was all just simply
not paying enough attention or giving
enough respect to the Sioux Nation at
that time because they were a dedicated
people they had roughly 10,000 people
and including Custer's last attachment
of like 200 men and they said they were
roughly facing like 300 or I'm sorry
3,000 Braves so I mean they're
completely surrounded by 3,000 Indians
and they were able to fight them off for
about an hour or so but ultimately you
know that every one of them was killed
every every person in that entire group
and then after they were killed their
entire bodies were mutilated so a lot of
them had like their genitals cut off and
their eyes cut out on their tongues cut
out and sub like that and Sitting Bull
the leader of the Indians I actually
told them in a vision not to do that
apparently and they did it anyway and
some people say they're cursed even to
this day because they did that but it
ended up being worse for them because
I'm United States at that time you know
they saw this great civil war leader
Custer and they blamed him for getting
as all has been wiped out but they also
still blame the Sioux and everything for
you know that the you know the the the
defiling of the corpses and stuff after
the battle so it ended up being I think
rougher on them because I you see like
massacre at wounded knee and all these
other different battles that that
occurred after this were like the United
States Army just didn't I mean they they
they were just murdering men women and
children and it was it was pretty brutal
affair from what I would seem but i'm
just very interesting not really sure
how this relates to you know I T
specifically just in the fact that you
know an IT just like in pretty much
pretty much any other profession
especially like an when you watch sports
and stuff like that it's all about what
have you done for me lately you have to
can you know contribute and be a major
player day in and day out and depending
on how big your mistakes are you could
easily make a big mistake and
programming just as Custer did with with
just misjudging how many people he was
fighting against and and ultimately
you're you know you could be labeled and
known for that one particular mistake
which just isn't really fair I don't
think but you know life isn't fair right
so anyway guys thanks for watching man
and take care bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
