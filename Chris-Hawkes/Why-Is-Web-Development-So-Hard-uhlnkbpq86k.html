talking about why is web development so
hard and and a lot of people were going
to be like well web development is not
hard and I find it to be easy and things
like that and a lot of those people that
are saying that are probably not
speaking with any sort of real
experience so a lot of times when when
you're a beginner you think things are
easier than they really are because you
haven't challenged yourself in the way
that you're going to be challenged when
you actually go into an industry work
with a team of developers on cutting
edge software so anytime you start
getting down that path we're like you
become overconfident
like if you're self-taught like not
working in the industry yet I would
probably caution you on being too overly
calm optimistic I mean it's good to be
optimistic but at the same time you can
easily be over-optimistic in the
programming world so there's a thing
called the dunning-kruger effect and
that actually is something that you can
also find in the corporate environments
as well people that like get into
positions and make decisions that you
know that really just aren't very good
because they're so sure of their talents
in their own you know and they're in
their expertise and then and a lot of
times it's like completely fabricated
it's just in their own mind and when you
compare them to you know other people
that do make sound decisions they're not
very good at all so that you're going to
find that I think any where it will not
really anywhere but you're going to find
that occasionally especially and you
know really large companies I would say
but for the most part like well-run IT
organizations they're going to have
people in place that are truly smart and
know how to make you know really good
decisions and one of the reasons why I
feel like web development is so
difficult these days is like when react
first came out I was doing react I think
in 2014 2015 I'd have to go back and
look at my earliest videos but I have
been you know getting into the whole
reaction and the whole JavaScript you
know really does it model view viewmodel
kind of pattern everything with an MVC
but that's really not in that relevant
place so when I first started getting
into react it was much easier like we
had JSX and JSX was something I hated
but a bitch like we like it and you know
I would use my JSX transpiler and really
I just had to include like a react file
and but then you know all the sudden
everything kind of shifted over to the
whole es6 thing where the browser's
didn't support es6 we started adding a
lot more complexity when it came into
like using things like golf and
browserify and then you know now we're
introducing babel and web pack and
roll-up and all these other things but
the fact of the matter is though is that
that web development is harder than it's
ever been and I'm going to get into a
few reasons why I think that might be
but I can tell you that the the entire
industry itself I mean has gone towards
like these micro services where you have
you don't need to have monolithic api's
that render everything for everybody
like it's all about you know if you're
going to have like a
software-as-a-service type of model you
should have multiple different end
points so that way is pure if one
endpoint goes down like you could still
kind of scale back the amount of
functionality that your website could
have if you have you know five different
API endpoints that are providing five
different features of your app so if
feature a goes down will feature a is
down and there's not much you can do
about that but at least the entire app
is not down but even more than that by
breaking things up and there's so much
so many different API is especially
these microservice api c you hear about
it really it allows people to focus
independently on different pieces of the
architecture and and that is actually
very beneficial I don't think that
there's you know really any problem with
that whatsoever but where you then have
to tie all the stuff and choose together
is where like the real real complexity
you know gets gets involved the entire
react and really I would say the entire
es6 is the es6 way of writing web apps
can get so damn convoluted very quickly
it's unbelievable with the amount of
work that javascript is now doing it
makes things very very challenging so if
you did the react you built a few basic
simple stuff and react well that's
nothing I mean try then taking your
project and and you got to think of like
a master project where you then try to
end
maybe flux or redux or something like
that
the point is though is that things can
get really really complicated very very
fast and that's why they you have to
have browser tools like they're the
redox dev tools or react dev tools and
then the same thing is the same concept
is for angular as well one of the
concerns about angular one was that
stuff became still out of control so
quickly that now it looked great on the
to-do app and things like that but then
as things scaled up and complexity and
as you add like large teams um you were
fighting the framework you were fighting
your world design it became you know
convoluted pile of basically so
react came along and they do it much
better they have a much closer component
based system Redux offers a pretty good
option for like a shared state amongst
those components but things can get very
very complicated because in addition to
all that stuff like I said you're tying
in all different kinds of pieces of
functionality still whether you're
connecting to like third party API is
your own API there's their database
layers there's all this business logic
and things like that a lot of that stuff
has been pushed over to the client now
so you still have like you know
intermediary server services that can
end up existing between like an API
there to get you know Google Maps data
or something like that and then you have
some sort of you know a repository type
of API that you're communicating with
it's acting as like a translation layer
and then another one that acts as a
translation layer to to then check take
your data that you've manipulated and
then you know and put it in the form
that is able to be saved upon within you
know your in your database says that
you're in the storing that it this is
just an example basically shake is
really really complicated when you have
large-scale enterprise applications that
you're working on and then you have to
multiply that by like you know what
maybe 30 40 developers sometimes that
are all checking into the same codebase
so you got to make sure people aren't
stepping on each other's toes and and
then every piece of functionality should
also have unit tests to test so whoever
thinks that like you know writing modern
day react applications is somehow easier
than what we used to do is actually you
know they're they're out of their mind
so I've seen some real pretty talented
or struggle with this stuff and you know
this entire senior dev mindset now that
exists in 2017 is all about how well do
you pick up this stuff like how quickly
can you pick it up how quickly can you
tie things together based on experience
and just your your overall understanding
I mean your research capabilities of
using Google or other internal services
within the company how well do you
communicate within your team how well
you to your test I mean how how thorough
are you with testing your code that's
actually something that that sometimes I
falter at and really everybody does to
some extent but you think you'll miss
certain things that you feel like you
should that you should have missed
because you're kind of you know in this
tunnel vision focusing on the happy path
so it seems like it works there that's
one thing but then you know you start
tinkering eight or nine different
variables and your output could be
completely unexpected especially when
you have Java trip now that is listening
to all kinds of different things like on
key ups and on key downs and on blurs
and on focus and all stuff that is
firing off all these events you know
using tools I read us and reacted and I
know that keep focusing on Rios INRIA
read often react because that's what
I've been using a lot late lately but
it's no different with any other more
modern day approach as well like maybe
UJS was going to simplify that a little
bit but you're also not going to be
building the same large-scale enterprise
applications I mean I don't see that
being adopted too much right now in the
corporate world not as much as people
seem to be going head over heels with
react architecture but you know this
it's really difficult so why is it so
difficult and really you know as we
progress I think that we're trying to
make better tools and I think that you
know reactive is pretty cool but it's
much more complicated now that to write
react than it used to be and and some of
the reasons for that though is that I
really think it's because we have people
that are put in positions you know that
are extremely smart like the creator of
redox Dan Abramov is is clearly a very
smart guy he now works for Facebook but
he's probably too smart to be writing
web apps you know crud applications he
should probably be working on like
machine learning than big
and like artificial intelligence or
something that would maybe suit him a
little bit better he's obviously very
you know very fond of Evan kaputski I
think from the own programming language
Harvard Graduate you it's like there's
some very smart people that you know
that are building some very smart things
like if you look at modern-day web
developers that are coming out with some
of these tools I really feel like the
overall usefulness of them really pales
in comparison to what you saw like
during the 1950's at Bell Labs or in the
1940s 50s all the way into the 60s and
70s that a company like Bell Labs where
you know it gave birth to Dennis Ritchie
who created a few of the C programming
language that every major language has
been built up also you know that same
level of usefulness I don't see I don't
see it coming out of Google I don't see
it coming out of Facebook and one of the
reasons why this is the case is because
companies don't seem to be spending as
much on research - in development as
they did back in the old days one of the
reasons why Bell Labs was able to create
so many ingenious things was because
they had a monopoly on their industry
all the way back to the early 1900s so
in order and part of their monopoly
regulations they could not compete in
new industries so they had some of the
best talent working for them in some of
these think tanks in New Jersey and in
Manhattan and and they would come up
with certain things I literally like
usually the beginnings of the
transistors and
semiconductors and the microchips and
things I mean they all kind of grew up
out of that entire environment out there
and and they weren't able to just
compete so companies like Texas
Instruments were able to come in and and
use some of these these patentable they
did a repentance that be more exclusive
to like you know to Bell Labs even
though they developed it the technology
like companies like Texas Instruments
were able to take the technology and
build a transistor radio and to build
you know pocket calculators that ended
up being extremely popular and so the
point I'm trying to make is that like
some of the smartest talent that worked
for some of those companies like then we
have in some ways the same level of
smart people when it comes to like Evan
Kaplinsky and writing your own
programming language but
do we need it do it like it are we
making the world a better place because
of it I would actually argue that we're
really not like it's great you know it's
very smart like you overly complicated
something that probably doesn't need to
be that complicated and the benefits
like if they would fit was clearly that
beneficial I mean it's been around since
2012 we would see more cutting-edge
stuff where it's like oh we have to jump
on that because this is this is creating
some new thing for us so the problem
with web development right now is that
you're going to go out you're going to
spend a ton of money trying to pay
senior developers that can tie together
very very complicated architecture using
this modern JavaScript es6 and and
you're going to have a lot of people
that used to be able to flourish under
you know just basic web applications and
crud applications using jQuery and time
to gather some data and things like that
because most of the applications don't
need to be that complicated where I was
like now everybody seems to feel like
you know that every crud application
needs to use Vijay s as a template
engine whether you need to use react and
redux and all seven-league we're finding
ways to pigeonhole this technology and
we've been doing it for like decades now
it seems like and and we're not like
getting anywhere as fast as as we would
like at least in my opinion now there's
probably other you know obviously
there's there's there's advancements
being made in other industries there's
no question about that but strictly in
the web development world we don't need
the level of complexity that we've added
into our lives because it actually is
not providing a huge business advantage
even react if you look at like react
okay I mean it's being used by Facebook
like Facebook has a successful business
model but it's not because of react
right and like even Facebook's website
isn't overly impressive so it's like
okay they're using react and it helps
them out be as a business man a business
meeting they created it but it does it
doesn't necessarily make them like a
like a it doesn't in my opinion they
don't have a better product I don't find
their UI to be any more intuitive or
better
something like Google's YouTube or like
like I look at indeed non dico indeed is
like old tools and indeed probably I
mean one of the reasons why they have so
many listings and they're able to handle
some extra buck is probably because they
didn't add so much complication and you
look at something like Craigslist I mean
they're able to get by and be one of the
most popular websites without all that
complexity same with Wikipedia same with
you know a lot of these other sites that
just don't need that level of complexity
and they're because their business
doesn't really call for it and and the
mistake that a lot of businesses are
making is that they think they need you
know some of these tools and they have
to pay the best and the brightest to be
able to handle it because it's adding a
hell of a lot of complexity to what used
to not be so complex now you're going to
tell me oh well try tying together a
bunch of dollars and stuff with jQuery
below you'll know I reacted it was born
yes I understand that so if you have a
very very complicated architecture then
yes react makes sense if you have
Wikipedia where Craigslist you don't
need react it's plain and simple you
don't you're going to add complexity so
there is that distinction I'm not I'm
not you know blind to that that you know
if you have a truly very very complex UI
you're going to you're probably going to
want to do something with react however
like I will say that you know with you
know the level of complexity you now
have with es6 and the s7 and babel and
web pack and all the different babel
plugins you know 150 different plugins
that you're using within your
package.json you're creating projects
that are very very unmanageable so
you're going to have to pay the
top-level talent so you really need to
balance that trade-off and say okay
whatever sort of application i'm
building do i really need to use these
tools because i mean this is a simple
fact of matter is that there are
observant there are developers out there
quite a bit of them that just won't be
able to hang in this market they really
won't
i've seen many of them at my old job
later they're just not going to be able
to do it so the thing is i think that
some of the talent that is actually
producing some of these tools you know
they're very good
promoting them they're obviously smarter
than some of the people around them so
you know they're able to probably run
circles as to the benefits of certain
things but once again I think that you
know overall like we need as many
programmers as we can get where we used
to have so many different web developers
that did a lot of CSS and things like
that you had like a few standouts but
then bootstrap came along everybody
realized it was much easier to use
bootstrap and things became more
difficult so now you had to study you
had to you know step up your game and do
better than bootstrapping and kind of
the same thing is being done I would say
with the web tooling world like we're
always trying to one-up each other as
far as the next project you know if it's
reactor inferno or something that comes
behind you know beyond that but you know
the end game that I see is that we're
not writing necessarily better
applications I really don't I don't
think we are not from a maintainability
perspective or performance perspective
or even you know a joy of use
perspective so I miss the old days of
jQuery to be honest with you like I miss
those days of being overly confident
that I'd be able to get something done
just because you know it was so much
easier to do at the same time having
things more difficult can also have
benefits to those that can thrive in
this market so once again there's
probably too many physicists and you
know advanced masters and PhD math
mathematicians and things like that
they're getting involved in the
programming world as far as web
development where they probably don't
really need to be but the problem is
most of the jobs are in web development
so and then not a lot not enough
technology is being introduced by
somebody companies companies like Apple
and Google like when it comes to like
writing a better web server like you
don't see that very often you're seeing
engine X and Apache and is and those
things aren't really coming along and
replacing that like because there's just
there's not as much money I guess
there's not as many jobs like to pay for
that in fact one interesting tidbit is
that in 2011 both Apple
and Google spent more money fighting
with each other over patents than they
did on research and development so
you're looking at two of them you know
the biggest companies with the most cash
that we're spending more cash on
fighting their patents and their
existing patents over you know I'm
fighting with each other over that then
actually researching newer and better
products so anyways just my thoughts man
what web development is difficult it's
going to get more difficult you know
best of luck to everybody kind of you
know kids to try to get into this
industry eventually I think we're going
to realize that we're making ourselves
and making our lives a little bit more
complicated and they need to be and it's
going to its increasing business costs
and everything else so you know the
markets will will correct themselves
eventually and I'm not even trying to
say the reactor and redox or not good
tools I'm just simply saying that people
need to pump the brakes on some of these
tools that they're introducing into
their basic applications that don't need
them alright guys thanks for watching
have a good day bye hey guys so a lot of
you ask me how do I get my foot in the
door to become a programmer and I just
want to take a moment to mention dev
Mountain coding boot camp is a 12-week
intensive course that focuses on the
technologies of the here-and-now for web
development some of the things that are
actually teaching in this 12-week course
it's geared to get you into the industry
by focusing on things like jQuery nodejs
react angular how to use github so a lot
of the things that you're going to need
to do as a developer as soon as you
start they're going to be teaching you
in this and this coding bootcamp and the
entire goal is to be able to get you
into the industry within 12 weeks so if
you guys are interested in learning more
information about dev Mountain coding
boot camp just check out the link in the
