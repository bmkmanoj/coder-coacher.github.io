from one of my viewers and he says hey
Chris I have a question related to
finding a career how do you think
programmers looking for a career in the
field should choose their specialty or
specialize at all right now I am pretty
experienced with nodejs but when I look
up jobs in my city on indeed.com most of
the jobs are asking for programmers with
experience and not just know but also
C++ Java Swift etc a bunch of other
languages and frameworks so one of the
things I would caution with that like
wide of you know that that large of an
array of languages and everything like
C++ Java Swift I mean now you're jumping
over into Apple and stuff it's like so
what maybe that's that maybe that
particular job may be android you know
app development or something and then
you know obviously iOS development but
then you know you throw C++ in there so
gaming you know I'm not even sure but
what a lot of these AI that you know
there's IT recruiting firms out there
that will actually just seek anybody
that has all kinds of like different
skill sets and everything so they're not
asking for somebody to have all of those
skill sets they just want them to know
do you have this business oh it's great
if you have this or whatever but I
wouldn't be too concerned about that
honestly like I think the best way to
really approach this question is
probably to go on indeed.com right now
and just like do a quick search and see
what's going on so if I look up a job
here in Washington DC and I look up
nodejs
I pulled up the second listing on here
and it's from this company upside I've
never heard of them but they're looking
for a no js' enthusiast eager to build
commercial applications with ecig es6 so
it's like I'm sure everybody's eager to
build commercial applications and es6
you get easily excited about continuous
delivery so clearly this company is
looking for a complete nerd so may not
be the best job you know to obviously
look for when you're first trying to get
your foot in the door if I look further
down this list of all these different
skill sets it's like messaging
busses Kafka Nats blahblah clustering
and all stepside it's like I clearly
wouldn't be a good fit for this job
because I can tell I don't understand a
lot of what what these guys expect
people to know hitting the you know the
ground there so you just have to kind of
move on like I wouldn't spend any more
time so this one it's so it's saying you
gotta don't get all right so clearly
like if you're gonna get in there and
you're gonna start working you need to
know get because if everybody's using
gatling and you don't know how to use it
then they're gonna have to train you on
that so they kind of expect you to take
initiative to be able to learn that but
that's not that's not a big deal I mean
that's kind of to be expected most
companies don't want to really have to
train you on a lot of stuff that they
really feel that either you should know
or that you know you would have picked
up you know from a previous job you know
how did you have one so then like other
stuff like webpack you know obviously
we've seen that hope and everything so
this job this looks like it would be
geared towards a relative beginner I
mean this is kind of they asked for the
BS in computer science but I'm sure like
if you could show a portfolio and things
like that that you would have yeah you
know pretty good opportunity to land the
job like this here but you Python Jango
a lot of newer developers using Python
Jango or JavaScript react you know what
I mean so they react hasn't even been
around that long so if you bring in a
lot of react knowledge and things like
that there's a good chance you'll feel a
little and that a job like this so I
just wouldn't spend too much time
focusing on trying to land in with some
of those IT recruiting firms and then at
the same time I would just make sure you
know you know you're not really like
spamming a resume but just in the same
sense like you don't want to spam a
resume like you want to figure out who
the good targets are like if you if you
don't have a college degree even though
this company asked for it you could
still submit your resume and if you have
a good amount of skills and things like
that I'm sure that the company would be
willing to work with you but they
probably do try to sift out a lot of
people and in that and that category
because basically they're probably
saying hey even if you don't have past
experience she better have like at least
you know a year or so or two years of
computer science experience and things
like that that's kind of what they're
getting out so yeah I mean I'll say it
again if you're looking to get your foot
in the door I would probably focus on
some of these newer technologies I mean
react even react is not as new it was
something like view but you focus on
some of those those newer technologies
the kind of levels the playing field
because a lot of senior developers and
developers are already in the industry I
mean they have to pick that up in their
own time if their companies aren't you
know paying them to it to learn it and
things like that so it's it kind of
levels the playing field in a sense that
now it still doesn't take away a
programmers experience that they bring
to the table because programming is a
lot more than just syntax and things
like that it's it's you know how you
design your applications and things like
that and how you understand them
understand them reason about them and
things like that so you really can't
ever replace like the amount of value
that you know 10 years in the industry
could give you know give you over
somebody with like you know two or
something like that but you know that's
just natural
but anyway guys thanks for watching have
a good day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
