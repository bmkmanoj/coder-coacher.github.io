to show you using Django easy avatar a
trick to styling a file upload button
which can be really difficult to style
with every single browser displays it
natively in their own way and it all you
know change it's all a little bit
different it's just notoriously hard to
style that so Django easy avatar
includes a label for tag on the element
here which says change avatar you can
make that say really you know whatever
you want but for right now I just want
to show you how you can go about making
this essentially a button right here so
all you I do is just some we're going to
right click on this element and then i'm
using chrome but this is just for an
example let's go ahead and just put a
width on this of 90 pixels and then i'm
going to say background color make it
like a red color it's really too dark
but just for an example here border
radius 5 pixels to make it kind of
rounded we're going to add some padding
of 5 pixels i'm going to change the font
size to make it much smaller so we'll
just say 11 pixels and i want to go
ahead and it looks like it's already
pretty well aligned but we'll just say
text the line equals center i want to
change the font so it is a little bit
easier to see so we'll change it over to
white and that's that's really not bad
right there so next thing you want to do
is you want to go ahead and take this
this element right here which is your
input type file and you can see it's um
it's styled right here but to to
specific just for this example purpose
we're going to say display equals none
and now the element is actually hidden
this label is now styled like a button
and when we go to click it
it's still acts as if the file type so
that's the key behind doing that another
thing you probably want to add to this
thing is a cursor pointer that way when
they highlight over it their little
thing you know it turns into a finger so
once again that is a key trick here so
what we want to do within our CSS file
is just grab all this stuff here and I'm
going to go into the file here where
it's actually being declared and the
cssa you need is label and i'm going to
say for equal i don't you remember what
that was one second for file you can see
it here
okay and now this is pasted in the
styles that we just copied want to get
rid of that extra brace there okay
now let's also go ahead and change the
display for the file type and really you
can just copy this right here
and we're just going to display none
so it's going to refresh the page after
i upload it and i just uploaded the page
so normally when you refresh google
chrome is going to change anything you
styled within it some little editor
there so you can see now that it's a
good way to change our default settings
of django easy avatar one thing that i
am going to add on a future rendition to
django easy avatar is um we currently
don't have the ability to change this
text so i'm not i'm sure some people are
going to want to say obviously you know
something else besides change avatar and
I didn't really think about that until
just now so I'll end up adding that to
django is the avatar so that we can give
the option of changing that text alright
well thank you for watching I appreciate
it if you would subscribe or comment
rate whatever you ask me any questions
you want and I'll try to get back to you
as quickly as possible thank you bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
