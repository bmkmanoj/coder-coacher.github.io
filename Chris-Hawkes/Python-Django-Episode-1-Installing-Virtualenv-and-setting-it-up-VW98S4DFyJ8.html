video before we get started with Django
we need to go ahead and install a
virtual environment that way the plugins
and things that our Django project will
need will not be interfered with by
other plugins that other Python projects
you may have going on so virtual
environment it just isolates your your
Python environment for this Django
installation that we plan on using so
the first things first
let's go ahead and you want to make sure
you have easy install and pip install
installed on your machines there's
plenty of tutorials and videos on online
so once you have Python installed just
those are the first things you need to
do install pip P IP and install easy
install once you have that you'll be
able to just go a pip install and
virtual env and then it'll go through
the process of installing everything
virtual environment needs now in my
particular case a virtual environment is
already installed so you do not need to
well I don't need to go through that but
you're gonna see a lot more than what
mine just printed out so now let's go
ahead and go to an area where we're
gonna be working on our project so I'm
gonna put mine I have a movie directory
that I'm gonna put this in a long story
short but that's where this is gonna go
and we need to create our virtual
environment so that's what we're gonna
do here so that way we can isolate our
Python plugins alright so now that we've
done that we want to go ahead and we
need to create the virtual environment
I've already done this as well but I'm
just going to do it one more time
virtual
and then we just need to name it
whatever you want in my case is gonna be
Python movies
and you'll see it go through this
process of where it install set up tools
and pip I know once that's done we want
to go ahead and CD into the drive for
the environment we just created so in
here you can see we have scripts and a
few things you're gonna notice Django is
installed on here but that's going to
the next step that we take because you
will not evil not see that so let's go
ahead and we need to enter into the the
environment so go back to script sorry
and inside here we're gonna go activate
this type of activate and now you can
see inside your command prompt that
we're in this Python movies virtual
environment so anything that you install
is strictly installing to Django that is
in this virtual environment here so as
long as new or whatever your environment
name is is showing up there then then
you're good to go so once we've done
that we want to go ahead and install
Django now if you do like a pip install
Django it's gonna grab the latest
version if you want to get a specific
version of Django which in my case I
want to use one point five you want to
go pip install equal equal and then one
point five oh wait I'm sorry pip install
Django needs to know what you're
installing
so I've already installed Django on my
machine so once again it's gonna be a
quick little message thing and it's
already there but you're gonna see a
whole lot more than that so I'm gonna go
ahead and cut this video off here just
because I want to stick to setting up
our virtual environment for Django and
in the next step we're going to go ahead
and get started with actually building
our project thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
