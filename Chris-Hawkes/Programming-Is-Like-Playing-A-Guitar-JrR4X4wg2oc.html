and I just found something on the floor
and in my room actually in my closet
that I've had for I think almost two
years now and it just kind of reminded
me of something like us so it's just uh
it's guitar they call like a capo thing
and really you attach it to the the neck
of the guitar so it plays at a lower
lower chord or lower tune and and
whether or not you're a professional or
a beginner like you can use a capo to
try to play different types of songs to
have you know different tunes or
whatever so without having to move your
your hands up and down the neck
especially like if you pretty much have
to hold like the top what are they
called frets or whatever down I don't
even know see but the point is is that
mmm I bought a guitar a couple years ago
and I played it a handful of times like
I thought it would be cool to play
guitar like you look at professional
guitars like you know get the tattoos
and your fingers like answer urinary
from Bayside and you see them playing
the guitar and you're like you know they
make it look so easy right and and you
think that you know maybe you can play
guitar and maybe go out there and you
buy one like I did and you taking home
you play with a little bit your fingers
start like health and then like you
start playing it less and less right and
the same thing is with with programming
like there's a lot of programmers out
there a lot of people that would want to
get into programming and they take it in
the same sense like they they they go
out and they they or they download their
editor they download and install Python
on their machine they watch some of my
Python videos they get all excited about
it and then you start to realize that
programming is a complete pain in the
ass just like playing a guitar and that
you only get really good at it when you
start just practicing man it's
repetitive like it's exactly like
playing a guitar in my opinion and and
the thing is like the reason why I've
had this thing for two years and I
haven't opened it is because I don't
really want to be a guitarist like I
like to play the guitar but I don't want
to put in the work and the effort to
become a guitarist like I know I'm not
going to be a rock band or in a rock
band or anything like that I know that
I'm not going to be as good as some of
these rock music stars that make you
know guitar playing look so easy it
looks so awesome but that shouldn't
really stop me from maybe you know
trying to
the guitars I don't know but for me like
I usually like to like if I'm going to
do something I want to be good at it
right and if I know that I'm never going
to have the want and the drive to be a
good guitarist I'm going to end up
stopping and and that's kind of what
I've done like my guitar is just sitting
in my office and it's collecting dust I
have a capo from about two years ago
I've never opened never bothered using
even though at one point I thought I
wanted one
there's Bayside you guys probably
haven't seen her in a little bit Bayside
hey thanks
alright anyone so I don't know I think
it's equivalent oh man like like when I
was getting started programming I would
have nightmares about coding I would
wake up in my sleeping and and know how
to solve a problem or I'd wake up and
I'd be like you know that way I was
doing it was completely up and I
should have been doing it this way and
it just comes to me right it comes to me
naturally with like sleep and and
through repetition and things like that
so in order for any of you newbies out
there to actually become a good
programmer like dude you got to do it
every single day as much as you possibly
can and and you have to just deal with
the fact that it's going to be a bitch
and that you're you can't compare
yourself to other developers that have
been doing this a long time and even in
a guitar sense like there are certain
like guitars that are in rock bands and
stuff like that even like my favorite
band Bayside where Anthony Ranieri is
like there's no way I'm going to be as
good of a guitarist as Jack O'Shea who's
the lead guitarist of that band like
that guys are better guitars maybe it's
through natural talent maybe it's just
through practice both of them have been
doing it for like 20 years now but jack
is just a better guitarist like there's
just you're going to have that anywhere
and and and you can't let that drive you
crazy basically so it doesn't mean that
you can't be successful or that you
can't even be richer than that guy you
know what I mean it's so if you
obviously value successfulness based on
riches or whatever but anyway just my
thoughts man don't give up keep
programming and see you guys later bye
hey guys so a lot of you ask me how do I
get my foot in the door to become a
programmer and I just want to take a
moment to mention dev Mountain coding
