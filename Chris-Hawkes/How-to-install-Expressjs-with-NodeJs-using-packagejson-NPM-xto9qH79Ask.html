nodejs tutorial in this video let's go
ahead and create a folder where we're
gonna put our project and I'm gonna put
it in my C Drive under projects and I'm
gonna call the I'm gonna call the app
I'm just like chat with ch 80 I'm gonna
capitalize it so whatever our directory
chat and we want to go ahead and pull up
a command prompt and let's go to that
directory okay so what we're gonna do is
we need to go in to that directory so
I'm using Visual Studio as an editor you
don't have to you can use any sort of
editor you want there's free ones out
there like sublime lepton a studio is
eclipse all kinds of different site that
you can use but I use Visual Studio it's
just something I use during the day and
I'm used to it so bottom line you need
to open up the directory where we have
our application so here it is chat I'm
gonna open this up and that way on my
right-hand side and depending on
whatever editor you're using I'm sure
it's gonna be on the right or left hand
side you're gonna be able to see all the
folders in your application so it's good
to have something that helps you keep
track of everything you got going on
with within your app and in this video
we're going to be using the Express
JavaScript or nodejs framework and let
me just briefly explain so know Jaya or
the nodejs Express framework out there
has over 30,000 apps already using it
and these are just some of the major
ones like MySpace and Storify I know
they have this Ghost blog down here
which is pretty new and it's an up and
comer so a lot of big apps are using
this obviously LinkedIn is a big one
using nodejs itself so this definitely
has some good backing behind it now my
editor over here I have my my chat
directory and I'm gonna go ahead and
create my first file and it's simply
going to be
it's gonna be a package.json file some
of the title it package Jason and Jason
is a form of it's like an XML
alternative for JavaScript which is it
has much less overhead to structure data
as opposed to on the old way of doing
things in XML all right so in this
package JSON file we're going to paste
in this code and I'll provide this in
the description of the video but we have
the name of our application chat we have
a description about it we have its
version number private shrew just keep
that on by default and then we're
directing this towards e Express
framework the three series are greater
Express framework now make sure you save
this file next we're going to use
something called NPM now NPM is going to
be enabled for you once you install
nodejs under the MSI file that that we
had gone over in the last video so the
first video of the series explains how
to install node.js so that'll give you
an PM let's go back over to our command
prompt and we're going to type NPM
install
well you got some crazy little design
going on over here on the left while
it's thinking all right so you're gonna
see it go through and it exceed and
installed a bunch of this other stuff
that expressed needs in order for it to
function properly now if i refresh my
directory it's gonna take my editor just
a second here but you're gonna see that
we have the node modules we have our
express framework we have a ton of files
and everything that have now been added
to our application so it's pretty sweet
so it did a lot of work for us out of
the box just by running that one command
alright guys so we're gonna end this
video here that is how we set up our
first application in nodejs using the
package.json file in the next video
we're going to go ahead and just jump
further into this discussion all right
thanks for watching guys please
