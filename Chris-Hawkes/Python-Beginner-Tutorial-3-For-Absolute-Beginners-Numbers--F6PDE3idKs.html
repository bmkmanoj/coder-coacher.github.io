for the long absence trying to get
through my cold and everything and now I
think I'm ready to go so the next thing
we want to talk about is is numbers and
python and we've already looked at what
a string type is and we saw that we
could take a string and we could
actually make an HTML file with it and
even though some of these larger
concepts aren't going to be there yet
that's not a problem don't worry about
it but one of the things that we do want
to focus on is that numbers are
completely different from strings and
programming languages these types are
like I said very important even though
you don't have to necessarily know how
they work or how they're made in fact I
don't even know how but like they're
really formed and from the lowest level
I mean I really don't but I do know that
there are different types and you can do
different things with a number type and
you can do different things with a
string type so if I were going to have a
number in Python is it's it's super easy
my variable could be my number equals
and then just a number so here's number
2 and obviously this allows us to do
mathematical computations and things
like that so for right now what I'm
going to do is I'm actually going to
create a separate file so we're not
gonna put anything inside here we're
going to create a new file and our
Python editor so I'm gonna click on this
little new file icon and we'll just call
this numbers dot py so in here I just
want to say x equals you know and we're
not going to do that we're going to say
print and then you can see 8 plus 8
times 8 which is 64 right hopefully I'm
right about that and we're going to just
press the debug so one of you guys asked
me somebody said I don't have the icons
and all this stuff well you have to make
sure you're in the little debug mode you
also have to make sure you have your
Python extension installed looks like
there's already an update I don't feel
like updating it right now but when
you're in your little debugger and you
have your file selected here you should
have this play button and then you can
start you just press play and it sits up
there and it's running and it's going to
actually print to this debug console
down here it actually stops on the first
line for some reason I think there's a
bug actually I don't know why it's doing
that but if I just press control f5 or
I think even just f5 it'll it'll run
through without actually stopping on the
first line there but you can see it
prints out 64 so Python is able to do
mathematical computations and if you try
to do something like a humongous number
in your calculator you probably wouldn't
be able to get the result of a number
this big and in a typical calculator in
fact I'm almost 100% sure you couldn't
and if we tried it in Python let's see
what happens so I'm going to press
control f5 to run the program and we get
that humongous number so just that
quickly Python figured out two
relatively humongous numbers so that's
what eight eight million eight hundred
eighty eight thousand eight hundred and
eighty eight so let's go ahead and do
that's 800 million value let's go into a
billion actually so we're going to so
basically saying these are these are not
billions now and we'll going to I could
also just press the the loop button as
well and the editor so you can see we
get an even bigger number and if I want
to run the program over again I could
just press that that rerun button it'll
run over again but it once again it
stops on this breakpoint which is really
weird I don't know why it's doing that I
don't know if it's a setting on my end
or if it's just an update that that may
have broken the way this works but I'm
assuming and I'm hoping that when I
update this it will stop doing that but
maybe you guys can tell me if you have
that same problem or not but anyway the
point is here is that and this is a
number this is not a string and numbers
are extremely important in programming
because not only are you doing
mathematical computations if you start
getting into like video game programming
and things like that but you know math
is obviously the one thing that can
pretty much explain the world around us
you know like when you do complicated
math maybe you could you can visualize
things an example of that is uh let me
share something with you so I love this
question on Stack Exchange for math
because like this is showing you like
these way it's just it's just amazing if
you go through this link here and
and look at some of these math concepts
I could tell you pretty much every one
of them's over my head I haven't in fact
I I still need to math courses and my to
get my two-year degree so that like I'm
not an advanced math whiz or anything
like that but the point is is all this
stuff is math and it's all numbers and
and it's capable numbers are capable of
solving very very interesting things you
know like if we break down the world
around us into like mathematical
computations they can literally explain
things and why things are the way that
they are so it's it's pretty amazing so
that all said numbers can't be strings
they have to have their own separate
functionality and that's why they are
their own type so an example of why we
would you know why we would use
something like this in a programming
sense is like say I went to YouTube and
I'm at this I'm just picking a popular
song with 182 million views and and you
could have this copy video URL at a
certain time so if I right-click on the
video and I copy at the current time and
if I paste that into my program you can
see that here's the link at time t + 90
so what if this could all be a string
right here so what I could do is I could
say YouTube URL equals and I'm going to
take this entire part right here and
we're going to put this inside of a
string and then I can say and we could
say
time equals 90
so now the interesting thing is that I
could simply have this all be in one
string and this would work so if I were
to put this URL on the webpage so I'm
just going to paste this particular
string portion and I'm going to put that
in our first file so instead of going to
hipster code I actually want the link to
open up into the YouTube video and I can
just do that by pasting that youtube
link in there and if we run this this
program I'll just press ctrl f5 again
and we go to the folder where it's being
output in I can say reveal and explore
and that will open up my my Windows
Explorer to show me where the file is so
if I click on this I click on me it
should take me directly to so it's not
cable we're wired differently which
means we can fix things differently
thanks for calling files so you can see
that it went right to the time that I
wanted it to go too so that's all great
and you're probably like why would I
need an integer then or a number and by
the way is some programming languages
call them numbers some places they're
programming languages call them integers
you're going to hear them use
interchangeably which means either way
it doesn't matter but it means the same
thing at least in Python so in this
number here you're probably well I
couldn't I just use it as a string and
the problem is is that if you don't have
to manipulate 90 you could just use it
as a string of it would work a problem
so if I went here and I said we'll say
time equals 90 and then I could say
so the problem comes in though is when
you're like you know what I have this
value 90 but I need to add 20 to it so
how do I add 20 to it I can't do that
with a string and right now this this 90
is just part of a string it's not a
number so this has to be a number so
that means that you're going to create a
variable that is your number 90 and then
if you wanted to add to it you could say
time equals and then say time plus 20 so
now time is going to be 110 so we've
changed the value of time and the
interesting thing here is that we've
actually we're looking at an actual
mathematical operation where we're
taking the existing value of time which
it's 90 and then we're changing it so if
I actually put a breakpoint on here so
we can visualize everything that's going
on I'm going to stop this and I just
want to
I'm going to save ctrl s and then we'll
go ahead and run this so I can see I
want to make sure you guys are fully
aware of everything that's going on here
so what time right now if I press f10
it'll take me down to the second line if
we hover over time or we look over here
I could add this to the watch I'll say
add to watch so we know time right now
as of the third line in our program time
is still 90 but now what we're doing is
we're saying hey time you're the value
of number 90 but we're going to say
you're going to be your value now plus
20 so watch Ram is the time now it's 110
so you can see the program change but
now how would I reference that inside my
my link to then you know to go to a
different section of that video the
thing is is you would have to use
integers and strings together in order
for that to happen so what we're going
to end up doing is we're going to say
you know what instead of you being here
we're going to we're going to actually
do a double quote and we're doing a
string concatenation again and remember
how we did it in the first video we
actually added two strings together by
using the plus symbol so this isn't a
mathematical plus this is just string
concatenation string merging but what we
can do is we can actually
reference a number value or variable I
mean and I can put that right here so we
can say time so we know time is going to
be a value of 110 so instead of this
being 90 it's going to be 110 now the
one thing that's going to be interesting
about this is that Python is going to
complain because you can't just add a
string and an integer or a number and
they're completely separate types so
Python will run into an issue or at
least it should some some programming
language is actually infer we're just
trying to predict what you're trying to
do and it doesn't actually cause a
problem and in case so I was actually
wrong about this because I actually
thought it would throw an error and it
looks like it's not going to or another
it is okay so I did throw an error good
because I was about to be like dammit
this is like because literally some
languages will just try to figure out
what you want to do and those languages
are generally considered to be bad
programming languages when they try to
just infer or predict what type you're
trying to turn something into a language
that does that is actually PHP and perl
and that drives people up a wall when
when they learn when like actual like
skilled programmers that are like you
know trying to make an art out of all of
this they're like you can't do that in
blah blah in many cases you shouldn't do
that probably but it's really not that
big of a deal but anyway Python will not
let you says hey there's a type error
and we once again we've looked at types
says you can't convert an integer object
to a string implicitly and what it means
is if I were to Python were just to let
that occur and turn the number to a
string or turn a string to a number we
know the string can't turn to a number
but we know the number can turn to a
string so that that's probably
complicated the way I just said that but
when we had the original value 90 in
here that was a string value but 90 can
be a string so but in a strip but this
sentence can't be a number we know this
this sentence and HTML and head and all
this up
that can never be a number but what we
can safely say you know what time can be
a string so in order to say hey Python
it's okay to turn time to a string we do
this we say STR and then in parentheses
we wrap it around time and what we're
doing is we're saying hey time value
we're turning you to a string type and
now this will actually work no problem
so let's write a program and I'll step
through it line by line again so we look
at time it's 90 now it's 110 and now
we've we've created my variable and
here's my variable so it exists just
fine and if we look at it if we look at
the full value you can see that the
enough for good don't worry about it
anyway you can see that it's it's fine
so when we write out to the out file go
ahead and play now we can open up our
HTML file look in the file
all right so if we look at the link
let's click on it and now you can see
when Whirlpool builds and appliance they
put everything they know into it so you
can see it takes us right to 110 so that
is the the combination of why you need
numbers and why you need strings and why
they're two separate things that's just
one small example but eventually you're
going to be writing stuff and you're
going to be converting numbers to
strings and you're going to we're going
to look at some other types too and
you're going to be converting other
types to strings or to numbers and it
gets it gets you know quite a bit
complicated as we go down the road but I
think you know in this case I just
wanted to explain why a number is
different from a string and just try to
harp on this whole you know this whole
concept of why we have types and
programming languages and just to cap
out this this video here I want to go
ahead and just show you that Python has
some of the the basic you know two plus
two so that's how you would do addition
print to minus two that subtraction
print two times two print - and / - so /
is this forward slash or that might be a
backward slash I always get those
confused but the point is that yes yeah
step forward slash actually so that's
the division and then there's also this
modulus thing but let me go ahead and
run these real quick and you guys can
see
alright now here's an interesting thing
that we're going to get into we're not
going to touch on it in this video but
this is kind of like a number but it's
actually called something else and we're
not going to get into that because it's
a completely different type but it's
related to numbers but it's when you
need to start getting more precision
because remember when you look those
mathematical concepts I shared in that
video you start getting into some really
complex math and believe it or not
Python is actually a very popular
language to be doing a lot of that
numerical computation even though it's
not the fastest language in the world
it's one of the easier ones to work with
so it's it's used by NASA and a lot of
different sciences and bioinformatics
where they're like taking genes and you
know mapping out the human genome and
the Neanderthal genome and all it's a
lot of that's being used by Python and
language is similar to it because of its
ease of use but yeah that's a different
different type that we'll look at later
and yep and now that's that's about it
so the part of the the Mount of the math
stuff when we look at numbers in Python
there is something called the remainder
and one of the trick programming
questions and programming interviews is
the modulus operator so the modulus
operator it's just the the percent sign
but the percent sign actually returns
the remaining amount when you divide a
number so if I said prints we'll say
we'll say 3 sorry 3 modulus of 3 so if I
went ahead and stopped this press ctrl
f5 you can see it's 0 it's because 3 is
divisible by itself
so if you guys know about prime numbers
and things like that if you were ever
trying to figure out if you know if
there's a a prime number then like 9
divided by 3 is obviously going to be 3
so it's a prime number and it's going to
return 0 okay and now what if we said
something that isn't divisible so we
could say like 8 module is 3 so this is
actually going to return to come on so
the reason why it returned two is
because it's it's called the modulus
operator or it could be called the
remainder operator but when you say 8
divided by 3 you get 6 right and how
much is left to you can divide it by 3
so it just returns the remaining amount
it's actually a pretty calm a comp
common mathematical concept but
something that I've never touched in the
web world it's it's interesting because
a lot of trick programming questions for
kids coming out of college they'll
they'll ask them about something like
this and for experienced web programmers
that aren't doing games and mathematics
and stuff like that they don't you know
they don't use this operator very often
and they might scratch their head and
like oh how do i do without you
know so it's one of those things so it's
definitely something I want to convey to
you guys especially if you try to take
this programming thing you know as a
professional full time gig which I'm
just I'm assuming all if not most of you
guys are trying to do that anyway guys
that is the video on numbers so thank
you for watching please subscribe to
this channel please share it with your
friends your family your relatives which
is the same thing as your family I'm
just kidding do what you want where they
put up thanks guys have a good day bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
