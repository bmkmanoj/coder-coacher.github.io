to go ahead and take a few moments to
explain why go is a good language to
learn I'm not saying it's the best if
you want to know the best language I
think right now to learn is it's
probably Python but if you're a systems
level guy that's looking to building the
next server or some other high-speed
project that you need to build that
you're maybe thinking about using C or
C++ go is definitely a language that you
should consider learning before you make
that decision
besides the ridiculous mascot which
she's really not bad he's not as cool as
a Python and definitely not as cool as
the Perl camel however with Perl 6 that
is a entirely new logo which is not cool
at all Perl has a butterfly for the Perl
6 implementation and a lot of you noobs
out there probably don't even know what
Perl is but Perl is a still a popular
language somewhat and still has quite a
bit of jobs out there for but Perl 6 is
pretty much been its downfall since it's
been 15 years since it was supposed to
come out and never really did I think
the Creator Larry wall has recently
stated that he's like optimistic it's
going to come out by the end of the year
but we'll see we've heard that for like
15 years in a row now so anyway go has a
little mouse guy he's a gopher and one
of the reasons why I go is is really
cool is it's actually one of the few
languages that's not built on top of the
C programming language so like languages
like Python or C sharp Java JavaScript
they're all sea based languages written
on top of C so with go though it's
actually a completely different language
that's not dependent upon C and it's
brand-new it was developed by Google in
2009 and it was actually created well
one of the creators are several creators
but one of the major creators was this
guy named Ken Thompson who was on the
original creator of the C programming
language along with Dennis Ritchie over
here on the right but Ken Thompson's
like a hardcore hacker since like the
70s and the dude super smart genius but
he's had a big part in building go
in a way that is much more efficient for
what we need a programming language to
be now go when I say what a language
needs to be nowadays computers have
multi-core processors they have a lot of
processors back in the days of you know
even c-sharp or Python or Perl a lot of
those web languages were built around
the entire premise that you have one
core and you didn't so it really wasn't
made for parallel processing or
concurrency now what Google go drives in
is actually having a concurrent
environment now if we look at the
definition what concurrency is it's when
two tasks can start and run in complete
and overlapping time periods it doesn't
mean that there be running at the same
instance because that's actually what
parallel programming is and Python
offers parallel programming c-sharp
offers parallel programming so a lot of
languages have parallel programming
built into it but it becomes a real pain
in the ass when you have multiple
processors or processes that could be
running simultaneously in parallel to
each other and they could be reliant
upon each other so you always have to be
very careful and always have to work
around basically shortcomings and
headaches when you're doing parallel
programming but with concurrent
programming and with Google goes
specifically concurrency has built into
its core so it takes advantage of all
the cores you have available using what
they call channels or go channels and it
just it works out of the box and the
language was specifically built for that
so it's perfect for any sort of high
load like server type systems like if
you're going to write the next Apache
web server you're going to want to
probably do it and go as opposed to C
now when Google was started in the mid
to late 90s their entire stack was
actually built and run on Python for a
very long time in fact it wasn't until
like sometime after 2001 or 2002 that
they actually started switching over a
lot of their back-end processing like
hard core processing to see sheep
plus libraries because they needed a lot
more speed than what Python was able to
offer at the time now there's been major
headways in Python since that time but
we're talking about like one series
Python when now we're in like three five
I think is about to release or maybe
even more than I think it's three five
but the bottom line is Python was almost
in its infancy back in those days and
and so they're slowly getting rid of the
C++ libraries over at Google and they're
actually converting them over to go base
code and the reason why they chose go is
go is a very verbose so to do simple
commands and go you typically have to
type in a lot more than you would using
something like Python or even an
object-oriented language like C sharp
pythons object-oriented - but it can
also be functional now even though it's
not C based it still looks kind of like
C and it's kind of ugly sometimes but
like when I say verbose it means that
you have to type out a lot of stuff so
like in this particular case just to be
able to print a line to the console it
has to actually import a library to be
able to do that now go is very rich with
the amount of libraries that it has
built into it so it has libraries for
like HT to http Jason and regular
expressions opening files reading and
writing to output there's basically a
large library that has but one of the
things that you'll notice is you always
have to import anything you want to use
and it will actually not compile if you
don't or if you have imports that you're
not using because it's it wants to be as
bare-bones as as humanly possible
another thing too is it has a built-in
Unicode support so that's actually
something that is you know it's always
it was always been a little bit of a
headache having to deal with Unicode
especially if we go back to like Python
2 series compared to to Python 3
but Unicode is is fully supported and go
even where the Python developer Guido
van Rossum the founder even had his
employment Dropbox are actually moving a
lot of their processes over to go to
because if you're really looking for
speed of execution
you really can't beat it it's going to
be almost every other language out there
and with its built-in concurrency
support it just allows you to run a lot
of simultaneous processes and and just
do it with with a lot with much greater
ease and with other languages so it's
been a few years since go came out and
they're slowly expanding upon it there's
a lot of different weird things about it
like it doesn't have built-in exception
handling or anything like that some of
the like comparison operators and stuff
like that is very very foreign or alien
I should say compared to a lot of sea
based languages so there is a bit of a
learning curve with it but once you
actually learn it the good thing about
go is that you can't do a lot of
trickery like with something like Perl
or even c-sharp with link statements and
a lot of like dependency injection
containers and or ioc containers and
even in you know some of pythons
class-based programming it can be very
difficult to follow along with a very
large project in fact that's really a
headache for any programmer dealing with
a very large code base that it takes
forever to try to figure out what things
are doing somebody's cute and they try
to put you know eight statements you
know you can't concatenate it into one
line so it's almost impossible to
understand what the hell it's doing and
so a lot of languages are famous for
that javascript too so with go though
you can't really do any of that trickery
it's verbose meaning you have to spell
it all out so that way when somebody
comes along and it could be you know ten
thousand lines of some go program or
even a hundred thousand lines you should
be able to pick up wherever it is and
there shouldn't be any sort of you know
foolery going on with with the code it
should all just make sense once you
understand the go syntax so that's
actually one of the reasons why Google
adopted it because even though they hire
really smart developers they want
developers really hit the ground running
they don't want them spending you know
five months or six months trying to
understand the large code base just
enough time for them to move on to the
next job or take a company you know jobs
at some other company or god knows what
but the bottom line is it's always a
challenge even for the best programmers
to learn a very complicated code base
and Google go is aimed not just at
concurrency but also at ease of
development for developers now in my
opinion I don't think go is the best
first language to learn there's not a
lot of jobs out there for go at the
moment there's not a lot of companies
using it for the most part like you
could probably come up with a list of 20
or something like that but it's not like
their entire stack runs on go if you're
looking for a job to get in the market
I mean Java C++ Python c-sharp I mean
that's really where it's going to be at
and obviously JavaScript for the web so
I don't think go is like a good first
language for anybody but I think if like
if you go with Python you learn a
functional / object-oriented language
like Python which is easier to learn or
a completely object based language like
C sharp I think that should be like the
first option for new developers and then
if you're going to get into the web your
second option is definitely JavaScript
I really should learn that in
conjunction with them with what you
Python or C sharp or whatever web-based
server-side language you're going to use
but after you've done that after you've
gotten that under your belt I think go
is a definite a good move for any sort
of systems hacker the ultimate control
type language I think go would be a
better option and C or C++ because it
has the speed it compiles just like
those do on multiple operating systems
whether it's Windows Mac or Linux and
one of the biggest pluses compared to
like C++ or C is that go handles garbage
collection so if you don't know a
garbage collection is ultimately it's
about managing your computer's resources
specifically memory to clean up unused
references that you have in your program
after your program has executed that
reference if it's no longer being used
most languages out there today like
c-sharp or Python the compiler
automatically removes those pointers and
it frees up memory and C++ it doesn't do
that for you you have to manually do
that it you can run into just hellish
nightmares
with memory leaks and just your program
crashing because of garbage collection
issues so you go actually handles that
for you and that I that's honestly the
number one selling point for me but
anyway guys that is the reason why I
think go is a good language to learn not
the best especially for a new programmer
I think new programmers should learn
Python and I have a video explaining all
that and there's a lot of basis on why
Python is a great first language and
really a great language to even get a
job in right now but aside from that go
is definitely an interesting language
that we should keep our eyes on because
it is growing in popularity pretty
quickly in the last couple years alright
