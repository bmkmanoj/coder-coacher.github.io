building a Django website series and
this video what we want to do is get
involved in jQuery library it's
extremely important it's basically a
high-level JavaScript language that has
made JavaScript much easier to deal with
and javascript is the important thing in
any website that causes dynamic
interactivity things like that now one
of the benefits google offers is that
they actually host jQuery documents and
they have fast servers that you don't
have to actually you don't actually have
to actually serve up the jQuery file
from your particular server so it just
saves a little bit of bandwidth and
makes things a little bit faster for
your customer and I always use them so I
just say on jQuery on Google library and
just click on this google hosted
libraries and down here you'll see the
jQuery right here so just copy that
entire thing the whole script tag there
and we want to go ahead and put that
just before our main dot CSS
and to see if jquery is working we're
going to do a quick test to run a jQuery
script just to make sure things are
working and my band page I'm going to
build a script right in the middle of
the page and I'm just simply going to
say document dot ready function and what
this tells jQuery it says don't execute
anything until the page has been fully
loaded now we have an ID on this I'm
going to create an ID just test and to
locate the test object it has to be a
pound sign since it's an ID if this was
a class it would be a dot instead of a
pound sign it would be a dot like that
but it's an ID so it's a pound sign so
this dollar thing says hey find this I
detest which is the HTM h1 item down
here and I'm just going to say dot click
function so I'm chaining a function to
it if you click it and then inside here
I'm just simply going to say test dot
hide fast
alright so there's the overview of it
and let's go ahead and upload that and
we take a look at this on the website
what should happen is if we click on the
title it should disappear using jquery
and it does alright so jQuery is now
being served from google on a fast
server and it is now installed on our
website so that we can use it to our
advantage and i want to get rid of this
stuff that we don't need
alright guys so this tutorial series was
pretty short but it was just adding
jquery to our website so i kind of want
to keep things separated in the
different contact content chunks so that
way if you guys ever have to come back
and revisit a certain section certain
things we discuss aren't buried in like
a 10 minute video that discusses like
five different things so anyway thank
you for watching please subscribe bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
