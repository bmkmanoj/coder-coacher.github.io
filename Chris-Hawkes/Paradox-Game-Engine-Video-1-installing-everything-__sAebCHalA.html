rodox in game engine tutorial series I'm
going to be creating this looks like an
awesome platform that was just recently
released to the public and open source
it is currently working with the windows
environment for like Windows Phone you
can also port it to android and iOS and
the one caveat though is that you have
to have XM Aaron studio for that but you
know that aside this game engine is
completely written in C sharp which is
really awesome when you compare it to
something like unity which is using mono
so the fact that we can use some you
know all C sharp and game engines pretty
good so this is definitely one of the
more promising frame or game engines to
come out recently so let's go ahead and
get started what you want to do is
download it and it's going to have an
installer so assuming you are using
Windows this only works on windows at
the moment for development anyways and
just go ahead and follow the install
instructions it'll tell you exactly what
you need to install now it's going to
once you're done with that go ahead and
continue the video you'll have a I con
here for paradox so just go ahead and
double click on it and open it up
alright so this is the splash screen
that you're going to be doing a lot of
the development in so it comes out of
the box with a gooey type of environment
that you can work with let's go ahead
and create a new game and I'm just going
to go to new game we're going to call
this paradox game I'll call even test
game and we need to pick a project
directory where this thing is going to
sit I want mine to sit in the projects
folder of my c drive so i'll select that
folder and go to select and it comes
with all these environments you'll see
android and iOS is not supported at the
moment that's because you need xml in
studio and we're not going to worry
about that right now so I'm just going
to unclick those I'll keep the store on
the phone that's fine and we're also
going to just stick with the landscape
right and click ok so this is going to
go through a setup process to build all
their assets and things that we need
alright so here is the the main editor
window over here on the left hand side
is going to be your solution Explorer a
lot of people put their solution
Explorer over on the right you can't
unpin these things if you want so it's
not a requirement I'm going to keep it
on the right though for right now now in
your assets folder it's empty right now
but if you had like images and things
like that you can see all those showing
up inside the assets so just a few
things that it does have is as the
property grid over here which is similar
to what you've seen in regular C sharp
development and we're not going to get
into too much right now but if you look
at the code you'll be able to see the
different environments if you didn't
unclick the Android and iOS then they
would show up here I'm going to make
this a little bit bigger but in order to
actually view the source code and start
editing it you're going to want to
actually right click so just right click
on the option and then you can see open
an IDE and that will open in visual
studio now if you don't have the windows
phone 8 s DX or I'm sorry I'm SDK it
will most likely throw some sort of an
error like this and probably for android
and iOS too if you selected those we're
not going to worry about that for right
now so we'll just go ahead and say okay
now because it's not installed on my
machine I get the windows 8.1 and I can
agree to become windows 8.1 developer
which I'm going to go ahead and do
alright so if you have a Microsoft
account you just have to log into that
and you can see now that I'm I have a
developer license for a 8.1 so that's
great it's it will last for the next uh
what month that sucks
I'm going to learn more right now it's
stuck so for one month but anyway i'll
do that off the video cool i'll just
accept that our most likely the oils
because i don't know the license but
when i loaded or national
alright so now that we have the project
level will be able to use it in Visual
Studio like we're used to and I'm you
can see the windows story point one and
all that stuff really i'll probably just
stick to just regular windows for right
now but will actually win this store
probably as well but anyway i'm in this
particular video i just wanted to stick
to installing the paradox game engine
and then just getting it loaded up and
working within visual studio so in the
following videos we'll get more into how
to use the framework alright guys thanks
