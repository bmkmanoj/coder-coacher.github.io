beginning JavaScript tutorial series for
hipster code comm and what we want to
talk about in this video is the variable
names the actual valid variable names
that you can use inside JavaScript as
well as the comments so let's start with
the variable names so the VAR keyword is
a reserved keyword in JavaScript there
are many different reserved keywords
like the break keyword function other
names that you would never want to use
as a variable name but for the most part
the var allows you to identify variable
names that can begin with an underscore
and then followed by any sort of alpha
character and then you can also have
numerix in your and your your actual
function names and variable names but
typically you're gonna see just you know
lowercase tight function names if it's
multiple words like one word the second
word should always be have a capital
letter for the first character of the
second word that's known as camel casing
and JavaScript is definitely following a
camel casing convention sometimes you'll
see people do all caps and stuff like
that just don't do that the JavaScript
community is using camelcase for
everything so just remember anytime you
have more than one word for your
variable name just a camel case it so
for instance last name
another thing with variable is you can
actually declare multiple variables
using one var statement a lot of people
think it's cleaner to do it that way so
you can have first name so you're
declaring multiple variables in one
statement test name look at this so it's
even three words there you close it off
so you just declared four statements you
could even give them values
you know let's do my real name equals
Chris
so now we just gave values all those
variables you can do that all in one
statement using just one var keyword
some people think it looks cleaner to do
it that way so that you're just you're
not using var this and var that all over
the place but those are all valid
variable names another thing with your
variable names they should be
descriptive like you don't want variable
X to equal your last name and only you
know how to do that like that would be
completely ridiculous
you don't want Y to be your first name
or anything like that so basically don't
don't do ridiculousness like that you
should not do that
the next thing we want to look at is
comment so you're gonna see comments and
the code all the time comments are
ignored by the JavaScript compiler so
you can write whatever you want on these
lines and those are supposed to be
special notes to yourself or future
developers that maybe looking at your
code to try to figure it out what it is
that you're trying to do hopefully you
don't have to use a bunch of comments to
try to explain what you're trying to do
because the code should always try to be
relatively transparent and what it is
that it's doing but sometimes that's
just not the case you need to put some
some comment in there if you want to do
multi-line comments it goes like this it
goes a forward slash star and then
anything inside these multi lines
they're all gonna be comment basically
don't to do the multiple forward slashes
for every comment but those are the two
different types of comments that you
have in the JavaScript language and you
will see those often alright guys so
yeah don't try to get too crafty when
you come with when it comes to like
variable names because it does allow you
to you you use unicode characters but I
think the JavaScript community would
probably have a heart attack if you
started using Unicode for your variable
names I just don't do it use the
standard ASCII model and if you do try
to do it good luck because people are
gonna rip your head off
so anyway say we're from Unicode for
your variable names use camel casing and
that is how comments work in JavaScript
so thanks for watching guys please
subscribe have a good day bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
