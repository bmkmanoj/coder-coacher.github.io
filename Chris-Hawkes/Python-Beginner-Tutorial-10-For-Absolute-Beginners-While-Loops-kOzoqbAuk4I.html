this video we want to focus on the while
loop in Python and while it's very
similar to the for but it gives you a
little bit more control on how many
things you want to loop through and
stuff like that because we saw that we
can have a little bit more control with
the range where we can give a starting
and end point in the range but sometimes
you don't know when the start and end
point is and it's all dynamic and it's
all dependent upon the data that you're
evaluating and that data is never
predictable especially if you want to
have a smart program like Google or
something else so you need some greater
way of being able to say you know what
do something while this condition exists
and then once that condition no longer
exists and the Sun stops shining and it
turns into a red dwarf or something and
it starts sucking in planets go ahead
and stop what you're going and we're
going to do something else and hopefully
get off this planet and out of the solar
system and move on but short of that
just continue to do what you do so let's
look at the while loop and we're just
going to look at the continued my list
which is just ten numbers and we're
going to while loop through it and we're
going to say while you know in fact
we'll even have you know we're going to
have a little index number so we're
going to say go until this number this
is just a big long drawn out variable
name and we're going to say five so
that's our magic variable that says hey
when this condition until this condition
exists go ahead and and do what you're
going to do in fact we can even have we
can and what we're going to need
actually to have another number that
actually says where to start because if
this is the condition that says hey this
is what we should end then you probably
won't even know about that in fact a
better way to do this is probably going
to be just say start number and we're
going to say equals one because what I
could do I can then say while start
number is less than what we can just say
five we'll just say five for now then I
can say prints
my list and then I'm going to say start
number so I'm actually passing in the
start number into the list and we've
seen that my list is just a list so if I
passed in you know 1 or something like
that in fact we can even start at 0
we'll start at 0 so this number is going
to be dynamically updated but how do we
update this here because let me show you
how we can get into a problem where we
go into a continuous loop and this is
where it goes on forever we have start
number here at 0 and we're saying well
start number is less than 5 which it
always will be less than 5 because it's
0 it's going to continue to say print my
list start number so when you first
start out in programming you're going to
write these infinite loops and it
happens you don't know why but the more
you think about it the more it will
eventually make sense but here's start
number at 0 it's less than 5 so we're
saying print my list start number 0
which is it's going to print 1 down here
in the debug console alright and we do
it again and again and it goes on
forever and ever and ever you can see
it's printing out 1 why it's because
start number is always 0 and it's always
less than 5 so it's constantly printing
the same stuff and and we typically
don't want that let's go ahead and stop
the programs and get out of this
infinite loop what we need to do is say
you know what start number needs to be
incremented every time we evaluate so we
need to say start number plus equals 1
and this is a shorthand way of basically
saying you know what start number is
going to equal itself plus 1 so in this
shorthand way let's go ahead and now
look at what's going on start number 0
like it was before it's less than 5 so
it's printing that number now what
happens when we say start number now
start number equals 1 so we've
incremented it by 1 and now when we
print this start number is now 2 so if
we keep doing this eventually it's going
to snap out of the list as soon as start
number is
greater than five four five and then you
could see that we jumped out of the loop
because startnumber eventually became
greater than five so this this statement
never equated now in this example we
didn't really need to use my list my
list could have been just a series of
fruits and all this other stuff or in
this case it was just a bunch of numbers
but this particular way of using a while
loop
you know while some condition exists do
this the problem is though is that if
you're looping through something you you
have to you have to increment you have
to have some sort of counter that says
do something for this period of time
because if I had if I wanted this thing
to run forever I could just simply say
while X or I can even say while 0 not
equal 1 and we're going to get into not
equals in just second but this is going
to be a situation where it runs forever
and we can say print hello world and if
we run this 0 never equals 1 so it's
constantly going to print so if I keep
pressing f10 f10 and f10 of 10 you can
see we have this infinite loop so if you
ever want a program that runs
continuously you could just have a while
statement that doesn't equal each other
and never equals each other and the
program will continue running forever in
fact that's a simple way that programs
continue to run the only problem is is
that they can eat up memory and things
like that depending on what you have
those programs doing and every once in a
while you do want it to just stop
running because of some catastrophic
error but if you're running some sort of
electric grid or something for a
hospital you're obviously going to have
a while loop continue to run your
program and continue to how to doing
stuff and and try to gracefully handle
errors along the way but anyway guys
that that is a wild statement and python

share this video please subscribe please
up vote if you would and if you down
vote just let me know why you're down
voting thank you guys bye hey guys so a
lot of you asked me how do I
my foot in the door to become a
programmer and I just want to take a
moment to mention dev Mountain coding
boot camp is a 12-week intensive course
that focuses on the technologies of the
here-and-now for web development some of
the things that they're actually
teaching in this 12-week course it's
geared to get you into the industry by
focusing on things like jQuery nodejs
react angular how to use github so a lot
of the things that you're going to need
to do as a developer as soon as you
start they're going to be teaching you
in this and this coding boot camp and
the entire goal is to be able to get you
into the industry within 12 weeks so if
you guys are interested in learning more
information about dev Mountain coding
boot camp just check out the link in the
description cab of this video thank you
for watching and have a good day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
