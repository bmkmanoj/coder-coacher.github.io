backyard backyard shot again so one of
the shittiest things about being a
developer is when no matter how much
work you actually do you just get more
work so that's actually one of the
reasons why programmers sometimes get
burned out because you get this
never-ending flow of work and a lot of
times the work isn't you know it's not
like messing around on your computer at
home and just doing stuff whatever
interests you whether it's video games
or something like that but in the real
in the real world you're working on
somebody else's product somebody else's
visions the meals business plan and
everything and it's okay but because you
get paid a lot of money to do it but no
matter what that you always get want
work so it's interesting because you
have to kind of find the right balance
about how much work should I be doing
for my salary and everybody should be
working as hard as they can but certain
places will give you so much work that
it like takes basically you know 10 12
hour days where other people are much
more reasonable they'll give you about
eight hours worth of work and expect you
to get it done and you know should you
like you know slack a little bit you
know one one day to try to make it up in
the next or you know one week to the
next and I would say for the most of my
professional experience that that's the
way it's been so that like it wasn't
like slave drivers and things like that
but you know even still if you if you
can do 12 hours worth of work and you
can get it done in like six or seven
hours especially when you're new to like
a company or like you know you're young
trying to prove yourself then you know
typically what happens is you just get
thrown you know more work and and you're
kind of raising you know your own your
own bar basically to to to what could be
an unmaintainable level so I guess that
is the concern you know that one should
have if they're trying to do as much as
they possibly can that you know they
will end up you know eventually not
being able to do that day in day out
week in week out and a week out
especially you know as you you may get
older get more responsibilities maybe
find new interest man you can hear all
kinds of Virginian birds out here the
other day I was walking I heard like on
there's at least like 10 different
woodpeckers manages all like
pecking like the trees around you and
like I was looking for him and I
couldn't find them but I have actually
seen them in my backyard like anyway so
another thing that can be very stressful
about being a developer is that you're
basically on any given assignment
whether it's a you know like a three
week sprint or you know just maybe a
couple days I'm going to work the best
analogy I can really come up with is
that you're basically throwing like a
five hundred to a thousand piece puzzle
man I probably a thousand or more
actually cuz it takes your legitimate li
you know days to do some of these you
know these tasks that are assigned to
you during a you know two or three week
sprint and in case you guys are
unfamiliar with like the sprint like
they have this whole agile methodology
and software development where
apparently if we break things down into
like small tasks we get more stuff done
and we're able to better adapt to
changing requirements and things like
that so you know I go back to the
waterfall days like my first
professional development was with a
company that was doing waterfall
development and and to me like agile is
quite a bit different there's a lot more
planning upfront a lot more I think
analysis is done you know it's like so
is there a huge difference between the
two I think it really depends on where
you came from because I've seen people
that use the agile methodology and then
still kind of you know create this like
waterfall agile like combination where
like you kind of blend the two together
and this you know this mix and mash of
whatever the hell you want to call it
but the fact that matter is that like
when you're giving these assignments you
can equate it to like you know maybe a
thousand or you know five thousand piece
puzzle or something like that but I
let's just say a thousand right so so
then you know the thing is like you're
like oh yeah a thousand-piece puzzle
even if you know how to do that puzzle
maybe you've done a few puzzles before
no shut up right so even if you've done
that a few times so even if you've done
that a few times before you know
a puzzle sometimes like when you're
halfway through it all of a sudden like
the colors start changing and then what
used to be like edge pieces are now like
the centerpieces and and vice versa
so that's like the best analogy when you
have situations where like people are
coming up with new things that you need
to do like halfway through your
development and or you know maybe
somebody goes out of town or something
like that and all of a sudden it's like
yeah you know they weren't able to get
their stuff done so now it's gonna be on
you and and then you know you have even
less time you know obviously to analyze
and try to figure out what's going on
with that code you just have to dive in
but that's really those are two
difficult things I think to deal with
with being a developer number one the
more work you do the more work that gets
thrown at you and then the more the
higher the bar that you raise for
yourself is and and clearly every
company wants to get as much production
out of each employee as humanly possible
but you know there is that and then
there's also the fact that you
constantly are up against this like this
stress factor where you don't know how
long it's gonna take you like if you've
said hey I'm just giving you a 500 piece
puzzle or even a hundred piece puzzle
but you know every couple of hours do
those you know those pieces will change
the colors will change the actual your
overall schema of or with the overall
end game you know with that puzzle
whatever it is that you're putting
together with it's a picture of my
backyard or something like that but you
know that that changes on you and and
those little changes and and sometimes
their external sometimes it's just like
a mere and there's some sort of
programming problem that you never run
into before and you're spending three
hours like researching where you thought
it would have just taken you a few
minutes to get it to get all that put
together so you know that said you know
of for my four and a half years five
years of professional development about
five years now actually it's been about
that you know what I mean it's it's been
situations around my oh I put together
that puzzle I've done that place on that
Django puzzle before I can do that and
and then you just start you know you get
down into certain rabbit holes where
like you make maybe one bad decision and
then you
you pile on another bad decision on top
of that and another one and another one
until eventually you have a complete
messy pile up a code that you have
to refactor like just the other day for
instance I was like going down this out
what will we call this rabbit hole where
it's like you think you're on the right
path and only to come to find out that
things just get more complicated and
eventually you're looking at your own
code you're so this is a mess I
know it could be done better but at that
point you're like well I've already
devoted this too much this amount of
time let me just continue to to go
forward because at the end of the day if
it works is better than not working you
know what I mean like so you could have
beautiful code and if it doesn't work
and then the ugly code that works is
going to be in a much better position to
make your bosses happy to make your your
career more successful and everything
else but but the fact is like you can
get down these certain paths and these
rabbit holes were you like I know
there's a better way but at this point
I've already punted on the better way to
do it and I just need to continue to go
so I was I was in that situation the
other day and then I ended up after
spending like literally probably six or
seven hours I'm just looking at the code
and everything and trying to just weigh
in that and everything I just basically
was like dude you're just like all of a
sudden kind of just hit me like I don't
have to do this this and I like I
started just I basically got rid of
about 50% of the code and did it much
more concise and in a completely
different way than what I had initially
intended and it took probably three
times longer and then what I had would
have envisioned something like that to
take and had I had that perfect you know
that that perfect moment of clarity to
say hey this is exactly what I'm gonna
do I didn't have that because like
everything's not like the same puzzle
you're putting together every time like
I said puzzle pieces changed the me like
there's just so many different variables
that that come into play when it comes
to like trying to get an assignment on
and the point is that if you can if you
can balance that on your shoulders
without freaking out because some people
freak out
figure things out you will eventually
pull through and I think you know the
more senior you are the more you realize
that you'll eventually you know pull
through and and that you know people you
know even if like for me I'm somewhat of
a naysayer like pessimist a lot of
people say that so it's like I look at
like it you know the glass half-full
type of thing so a lot of times though
that glass half-full is like completely
my own imagination it's like I'm
respected generally everywhere I go and
I say that because you know I've had
some shitty comments on YouTube and
things like that but for the most part
like I don't try to be a dick to people
and I'm pretty much that I would say
respected among amongst my coworkers
there's been a few that are dicks and I
guess I'm dick in return but you know
that said like I am like you know sorry
I guess I don't have all these answers
so like in a way like I look at it like
you know I'm a fraud you know we've
talked about that whole imposter
syndrome and things like that but you
know I part like I don't have that but
the I think even the most you know
successful and the most comfortable
developers probably still feel that same
feeling of like okay I'm throwing this
new assignment it's gonna pause well you
know maybe I'm doing it for the first
time maybe it's the fifth time I've done
it there's gonna be those those unknowns
so a lot of people especially developers
morstein you or you you are like you
give it like three times the timeframe
that you think you know something will
actually take you just in case because
of all those unknowns so alright guys
I'm just rambling on now but you guys
have a good night take care bye hey guys
so a lot of you asked me how do I get my
foot in the door to become a programmer
and I just wanna take a moment to
mention dev Mountain coding boot camp is
a 12-week intensive course that focuses
on the technologies of the here-and-now
for web development some of the things
that they're actually teaching in this
12-week course it's geared to get you
into the industry by focusing on things
like jQuery nodejs
react angular how to use github so a lot
of the things that you're going to need
to do as a developer as soon as you
start they're going to be teaching you
in this and this coding bootcamp
the entire goal is to be able to get you
into the industry within 12 weeks so if
