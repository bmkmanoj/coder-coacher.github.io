video a lot of people don't know or like
at first I didn't either was ridiculous
but um I was trying to figure out how to
sort a playlist like his YouTube has
predefined playlists that you can sort
by like date and stuff like that but a
lot of times you may upload a video that
is number three of a ten series set
after the tenth video or whatever you
know what I mean like so you do have to
custom order your playlist so to do that
you go to your playlist and this for
example I'm going to click this Casper
one you have these predefined if you go
to edit playlist first you have these
predefined quick sort things by views
titles date random and reverse none of
that is um you know what you need when
you want to custom this thing customize
is saying so if I want to put the first
video to the last you have to highlight
over here and there's this little thing
right here a lot of people don't see
that so I'm just making this quick video
to point that out and you simply drag it
to a different spot so that's all it is
that's how you customize your playlist
thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
