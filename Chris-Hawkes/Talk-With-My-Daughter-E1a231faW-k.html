a few questions your questions number
one do you want to be a programmer when
you get older
no why not okay now have you ever
thought about all the stuff that
programmers have created that you use
day-to-day yeah oh yeah including the
iPhone dad
using your hands way out iPhone 6 and
how many followers you have on them okay
so I believe you have a hundred and
twenty thousand followers on Instagram
almost like you're not you're making me
look bad with my fifty thousand
subscriber mark on YouTube but seriously
so you have all those subscribers and
you're on Instagram all the time you're
snapchatting you're doing all this other
stuff and you don't want to be a
programmer do you and you don't even
care about the programmers who created
all that code that made that possible
really that's interesting so what makes
you not want to be a programmer I don't
hide fast enough and I mean I guess I it
was good used to typing at a closet but
I'm not sure to look at how you work
again it's cool so what's interesting is
a lot of people especially new people
they think that you have to know it's on
a map in order to be a programmer but in
like in nine times out of ten we're not
doing well really nine programmers at a
ten probably aren't that great at math
and don't have much more than your
general probably high school level max
so I find that interesting number number
two question do you think that I work a
lot
yeah you do okay
you come home you go to work a full-time
job and then you come home and you start
working on your computer or whatever it
was video just coding practice coding
probably do it your sleep to dream about
cooing that is funny I have dreamt about
coding inside most programmer town right
that is interesting so and so and that's
the downside I actually made a video
last night about why you know being a
programmers right you make a lot of
money you can have a big house you can
make you can send your kids to college
so that they can do whatever it is they
want to do when they get older but you
do have to sacrifice a lot of your time
you end up for me like programming's of
Holly so so I come home and and I study
but even before that do you remember
when I was in a programmer I do i lips
that you created was it good no it was
terrible
you lose math with this red background
in like Times New Roman font
title like heading it's like she had
like purple little things to click to
take you to the pages I look terrible
right now a couple was i proud of it
yeah you know a real proud of it
kind of says oh my goodness this is
whorish man this is how I said so this
is this is good information though so
did you did you go back then I clearly
wasn't a programmer and you would have
been much younger than you are now
did you think I was going to become a
programmer I thought so you really
enjoyed it so maybe one day you seemed
really invested did I ever get
frustrated while programming that's an
understatement
let's say gear you screaming profanities
from your office and my room on the
other floor not all the time all right
just some donkey hearing capital got
judo your life your dollar now I'm
literally open okay I feel so I can't
even lie about the swearing and things
like that because obviously on this my
own channel I've had people witness my
my attention so I don't I don't think I
like rage out and I like break stuff but
I will cut
and for dynamo there's no hiding that
that's just the way it's been throughout
my learning curve so the fact that your
father is a programmer successful
youtuber dude and then here you have the
social social networking presence you
still don't want to be a programmer even
though you're your father's program is
the guy who makes all the money in the
house is a programmer you don't want to
do I have no interest whatsoever okay
now I mean again honestly that's that's
good feedback because from the younger
generation a lot of people your age are
actually watching my channel and you
know they want to become programmers
they're mostly male line 15 year old
girls that's the thing and that's
something I was going to say so I do
have viewership that are that are girls
or women but girl it's like six to six
to eight percent somewhere around that
so this is a male-dominated industry but
did you know that the first algorithm
police programming algorithm was created
by a woman and the 1800 good not Ada
Lovelace yeah in 1800 about 1830 or
solium about a hundred years before the
the PC was actually created released the
earliest they need that information a
bit enough they won't they had um it was
a analytical machine I forget exactly
what it was called but it was it was an
analytical machine to solve calculation
problems and things like that it was
very slow it was mechanical so it wasn't
electronic or anything like that but
they saw the writing on the wall but
about a hundred years premature to what
you know what was needed to actually
make their vision a reality all right
well I'm running out of room on my phone
this interview was great Oh
Thank You Isabel bye hey guys so a lot
of you asked me how do I get my foot in
the door to become a programmer and I
just want to take a moment to mention
Deb mountain coding boot camp is a
12-week intensive course that focuses on
the technologies of the here-and-now for
web development some of the things that
are actually teaching in the 12-week
course is geared to get you into the
industry by focusing on things like
jQuery nodejs
