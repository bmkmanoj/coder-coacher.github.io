going to show you what we can do
remember you have to list you need to
combine them into one Python has a
built-in function that makes that really
easy for us to do so let's just go ahead
and create to list real quick so we'll
say list 1 equals Chris John Billy and
then list 2 equals 10 12 14 so I guess
maybe ages or something associated with
the two so if we want to actually
combine these two lists into one list
that we can iterate over equally then we
can use something called zip so i can
say because normally what you do if you
want to iterate over a licious safe
where I and list one print I let me just
start this real quick
I'm missing my n ok GG iterated over the
list one item at a time and we could say
like 4i X and list 1 list to print I
print X now that does not work so the
reason why is because we have to
actually use the method of a song about
which is called the zip so what we can
do is I'm we pretty much keep all this
the same way that it is but except we
say zip and we put these in parentheses
and now you can see that the list
iterated over each item so kristenjohn
12 Billy 14 so it's essentially taken
one list and combining them into one so
that's a very common thing you're going
to do in Python programming anytime you
have to deal with list now another
problem that comes up is that when you
use this method the items have to be of
the same length otherwise it will fail
so if i take out 14 and we started
you're going to see that it actually
skips the third element so Billy is not
displayed because it basically says okay
only whatever the length of the shortest
list is match the second list up to that
shortest list so you know one could have
20 and if the other one only has to then
you're only gonna have two so obviously
that's a problem and you don't want to
do that now if you're using hopefully
you're using Python 27 or later I'm
still stuck on Python 27 a little bit i
haven't made that jump to three-point oh
I really need to do that but if you're
using 27 and above there is something
from it or tools that you can use which
is the izip let me think real quick with
that name
okay yeah what it's actually I zip
longest so what we say is I'm we have to
import it so we say from itertools
import izip longest okay and before we
even going to all that well actually
i'll leave that we're going to create
just one list here so we'll call it
lists one so say this one equals list i
zip longest list one list too
i jacked that up and it's obviously
because i'm still using the zip method
which we we don't want to use zip so i
can just simply say list one
alright so now you can see that it
actually goes through each item so even
though there is not a third item for the
second list too it'll still just display
none we could probably have some
additional logic to withhold saying none
if we don't want that but none is null
so it doesn't usually matter whenever
you're iterating over something alright
guys so that's really it some solder is
for iterating multiple lists in Python
alright thanks for watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
