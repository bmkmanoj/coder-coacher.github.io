list for the top ten programming
languages of 2017 yes I am a fortune
teller I can see into the future and
2017 is right around the corner this
list is going to be more official based
on mainstream feedback basically you
know what are the top line which is out
there that are dominating the markets
we're not going to mention languages
like rust or closure or type script or
elixir all these other languages that
literally shouldn't be mentioned in the
top 10
they're great languages nobody I mean
this stuff is there's no right and wrong
answer here it's just an opinion but if
you just want you know the simple you
boring list of what are the top ten
languages and when I say boring it just
simply means that there's not going to
be any shocker for the sake of being a
shocker I create a list about a month
ago where I mentioned typescript
typescript is going to be a big language
for 2017 but it probably shouldn't be in
the top 10 another language like
assembly assembly is making a pretty
strong you know if you look at something
like the TLB index and assembly jobs
seem to be out there but in the real
world you're not going to really find a
whole lot of assembly like if I'm in the
DC area if I'm looking for a job in DC I
don't see a whole lot of assembly jobs I
see a lot of what we're going to talk
about in this list so let's get into the
main stream stream list here and start
talking about it all right number 10
Perl we're not going to we're not going
to on Perl this time so Perl needs
to be in the top 10 Perl used to be the
Swiss Army chainsaw held the the web
together with duct tape and scotch tape
and all and glue and all that crap but
Perl still widely used it's a great
scripting language
it's going to continue to be popular Pro
the newest standard was also just
released last year number 9 Ruby
everybody's like where's Ruby on the
last list well Ruby got hose because I
decided to add Ruby well really I kicked
off Ruby because I wanted to be able to
add a functional language like Haskell
but in order to have a language like
Haskell or Scala listed in the top 10 or
f-sharp you have to boot one of these
larger languages but it's really it
doesn't do any justice because Ruby is
going to dominate over those languages
like I mentioned there's going to be way
more jobs and Ruby an opportunity for
you in Ruby then there is going to be
for rust or closure or elixir and all
this other stuff so I mean I'm sorry to
say it but that's the mainstream you
know mentality that's what people want
to hear and it's honestly the truth
number eight is Swift's the Swift is
going to be Apple's newest language
essentially it's all you know some
people say it's Apple's attempt to make
Objective C easier to deal with that
programmers didn't want have to do the
Objective C and it was too hard for them
so they decided to create a Python are
more simplistic language you know not
really similar to Python but a
simplistic language when compared to
Objective C so Swift is the apple
language every programming company
software company has a language I mean
Google has their language now with
golang and Microsoft has c-sharp and
Apple now has swift PHP everybody really
got pissed off when I didn't mention PHP
PHP runs a lot of websites out there
which WordPress all the the e-commerce
shops II like it open cart Magento
PrestaShop and all these other things if
you want do e-commerce PHP is there
almost your only option it seems like
but it's still going to dominate it's
really it's a rather terrible language
when you compare it to something like
c-sharp or Java but you know PHP it does
roll on people it can get the job done
and a lot of people make a full time
living on PHP so you can't really hate
on them for that it's just that I would
never recommend it as a first language
just because it does teach some very
terrible habits number six is Python
Python arguably deserves to be higher
than this but in a real world list you
know if we're looking at this as
objectively as possible there's going to
be more opportunities for the jobs that
I mentioned after for the language as I
mentioned after Python here but Python
is going to make this list at six it's
an awesome language it's a language for
web robotics bioinformatics for pretty
much everything pythons involved in it
but it falls at number six here number
five is JavaScript JavaScript was my
number one language in 2016 it was also
I think the number two language on the
list that includes some of the Shockers
that I had on there like Haskell and
assembly and typescript but in this list
this more predictable list JavaScript is
sit at five number four is C++ the
programming language for games
Barney Strauss trip came out of Bell
Labs in the 1980s and created C++ and
actually worked for what would remain of
built labs all the way up until I think
into the 90s for sure but still is a
it's a very powerful language to powers
most of the video games that we see so a
lot of video game engines are written in
C and C++ and there's still going to be
a lot of opportunity out there for C++
in fact it's a it's a very humongous
codebase when you talk about all the
legacy code written in it
number three is c-sharp Microsoft's
language of choice microsoft language is
now open source and I had this as the
number one as more of a shocker but if
like I said we're looking at this
completely objectively then c-sharp
probably belongs to number three they're
doing a lot of stuff to open source the
language but it's really not an option
outside of Microsoft at least at the
president you guys are gonna be like
well mono and you're going to tell me
how its open-source now and how it works
on when Linux and all that and I'm
going to tell you that it doesn't not at
dot at the time that I'm creating this
video and it wasn't five months ago when
I was trying to use the kestrel web
server for a dotnet core asp.net core
1.0 site that I wanted to put on my
Linux Ubuntu server but it didn't work
because I needed a goddamn database
driver and there was no database driver
for Postgres or my sequel so I was
forced to use entity framework in order
to be able to use one of those other
things and maybe I don't want to use
entity framework but it's not a problem
with the project itself it's just that
it's relatively new so c-sharp is going
to dominate an enterprise development
it's going to dominate for anything
microsoft and microsoft's a humongous
company but it's not truly the
open-source vision that microsoft wants
for the language or at least that's what
they say that they want so i think it's
going to be a couple more years before
we truly see you know c-sharp is a
viable option for my linux ubuntu server
and when i say my i mean for other indie
developers and things like that out
there as well but in the meantime
c-sharp is a is an awesome language as
far as like language design it's one of
the best i've ever seen
well actually it's the best I've ever
seen
so next number two is the C programming
language the Godfather of all
higher-level languages that pretty much
every language on this list takes after
so if you look at Python or JavaScript
or PHP or Perl or Ruby or job or any of
these other languages you're going to
see that they are built on top of C so
it's C code and then C is obviously
considered to be a high level language -
when you compare it to something like
assembly but not being too specific
about everything C is definitely going
to be on the list Dennis Ritchie the
creator of C at Bell Labs in the 1970s
is the greatest programmer of all time
most most definitely the most important
like programming a programmer of all
time Dennis Ritchie look them up if you
guys never heard of them and then number
one on our predictable list of the top
programming languages is going to be job
a job of Y because it pro it dominates
the job market it's truly open source so
you can write Java on both Linux and
Windows and run it runs it's also the
language that's used for the Android SDK
so if you want to write native Android
apps you're going to have an easy time
doing it in Java if you want to get a
job an enterprise development job is
there for you if you want to get into
some embedded systems and like that
then even Java has a market there but
you know even even games so job is all
over the place so is c-sharp so C so C++
any one of these top ten languages
you're going to be able to most likely
be able to find a job there's going to
be opportunities there for you this list
is very predictable but to be honest
with you a shitstorm gets raised when
I'm not predictable so it seems that the
masses want the predictability and
that's what this list is for so anyway
guys thanks for watching and have a good
night bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
