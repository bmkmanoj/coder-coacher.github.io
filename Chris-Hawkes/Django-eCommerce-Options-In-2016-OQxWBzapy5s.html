this video and what we're looking at is
Django ecommerce options I just recently
tried to build an e-commerce platform
with Django and this isn't the first
time actually I've tried this endeavor a
couple times actually in the past and
each time there's some sort of you know
framework or something out there that
shows some promise and it looks like it
works and then I try to download the
latest version of Python or maybe I'm
using Postgres in the latest version
whatever it may be
maybe it's Windows maybe it's a bun -
the thing never seems to work properly
and unfortunately ecommerce websites are
not an easy thing shopping carts state
management of you know main and managing
tracking products that are in people's
carts and also dealing with like
different taxes shipping invoices
inventory all that stuff ecommerce
platforms are not like exactly easy to
develop there's a lot of money a lot of
problems riding on whether or not this
thing works or not like if you end up
charging some customer you don't ship
the product you have no idea that that's
a major issue obviously your shop can be
taken down so the point behind this
video is that there are a few options
out there with Django
as far as I'm aware with e-commerce
platforms and we're going to go ahead
and look at those options also look at
some other options that you may have and
then finally we'll look at all so what
paid versions are available as well so
there's a lot of options you have and
depending on I guess what your what your
ambitions are is going to determine you
know exactly where you end up choosing
or what you end up choosing so the first
things first is we have django cartridge
so django has a CMS thing where it's
almost like a like a bootstrap of django
where it kind of gets a lot of it does a
lot of things for you and not
necessarily things that you needed to do
for you but it does do a lot of stuff
like having the ability to add google
analytics being able to apply bootstrap
to your Django project and stuff like
that I've never actually used it I've
never found a need for it but this
Django
mezzanine project is out there and I'm
sure that you guys have used it before
I've actually run into issues using it
with the latest version of Python on my
Windows machine so that was the first
time I tried to dabble with it and it
didn't work but cartridge here Django
has a cartridge plugin that works with
mezzanine so if you actually just pip
install cartridge it should install
mezzanine for you and get a pretty good
solution working for you however I was
not able to get it working correctly on
my Windows machine and I think I just
pretty much said you know this is not
going to be you know an option for me so
I ended up moving on from that project
however you guys may have different
success depending on which version of
Python you're using and also which
operating system the next one is Django
Oscar and I've actually been involved in
Oscar just a little bit as far as you
know following the code on github and I
think at one point I did log and bug or
something like that but with Django
Oscar there is a it's very opinionated
so it does a ton for you out of the box
and I think it's built mostly by some
guys overseas so like there's a lot of
currency conversions and and in code
like that that's all intertwined
throughout the project so actually
getting into the source code and trying
to figure out where things went wrong is
even harder than trying to look at
Django source code there's just so much
to it and there's a ton of moving parts
and it's another situation where I just
couldn't really get it working right
with the latest version of Python and
what I was looking at the project myself
I was like damn this is just going to
take way more effort than what I was
hoping for and I'll get into that a
little bit more as we move down through
these slides so Django Oscar is another
option for you then you have a Django
Satch list and such list gets its name
based off of a an ugly project called
Django Satchmo and Satchmo I actually
have on this list but was one of the
most unpleasant experiences I've ever
had working with a django project
however Django satchel is apparently is
supposed to it gets its name from
Satchmo where it says Satch list because
it doesn't come with so much stuff that
Satchmo was trying to do for you like I
said Satchmo itself was a terrible
experience I've never tried Satch list
I've heard that the documentation is not
very good and once again you know that's
never a good thing when you're trying to
get something off the ground when you
didn't write the source code yourself so
then I have Django Satchmo on here and
this is like I said the most unpleasant
project I've worked on and as far as I
can tell this projects effectively dead
but it is still out there and a lot of
people still it still shows up and like
different searches and communities and
things like that so then we have Django
shop and Django SHOP is supposed to be
very unopposed actual shopping cart
checkout process for you so everything
else is kind of left up to you
unfortunately there's not a ton of
documentation on that and I haven't had
a lot of experience with this because by
the time I actually tried out Django
Oscar and a few other options I pretty
much had disbanded Django as being a
good ecommerce platform at least with
what you know what has been created by
the community out there so you know
unfortunately there isn't much else out
there for Django that I'm aware of and
really you know I put down here Django
is e-commerce packages leave a lot to be
desired unfortunately I'm not trying to
hate on Django I love Django I've always
been a contributor to Django but when it
comes to actually running an e-commerce
site the Django options that I've seen
out there just aren't aren't very good
they're not they're not very reliable
they're not very good so I said what
other options are out there for
e-commerce platforms
well there's free options and with free
means that there's gonna be a lot of PHP
stuff so there's like Open Cart I've
used Open Cart before my only problem
with Open Cart is it's very I think it's
a little bit more difficult to extend it
I'm not a PHP guy I actually don't like
PHP very much I can work my way around
it pretty well but the thing that I do
like about Open Cart is it is it is very
very easy to setup the problem is there
is a lot of ecommerce sites out there
that are using Open Cart now and they
all look exactly the same you can buy
all these different add-ons and things
to Open Cart but the biggest issue of
all with Open Cart is that it is a slow
bug and that's why I've said it's slow
as a mofo that this it was the slowest
thing I've ever had to work with I think
when it comes to
get back in like I tried it go an attic
product and it just seems like it takes
forever if you ever have to do bulk
inserts and stuff like that you're
probably best just communicating with
the my sequel database or whatever
database system you're using but good
luck trying to figure all that stuff out
because a lot of these tables and things
that open card is making for you make it
very difficult to work your way around
it but then again ecommerce platforms
are never an easy easy thing to work
with to begin with so here's a
screenshot of OpenCart it's very
professional looking site in fact hasn't
changed much in the years that I've seen
it because the last time I actually had
a ecommerce site running was like two
and a half years ago maybe longer and it
looked exactly the same as this so I
guess not much has changed over there an
open card over the years the next one is
Magento and Magento is also PHP it's
open source there's a paid version and
customizing it is a real uphill battle
so I've never actually had to customize
it but I've heard that actually working
through Magento is a very very big pain
but it is a very professional platform
and ultimately they're pushing the you
know the paid versions so that you can
get business support and stuff like that
which is probably a good thing if you're
very serious about having an e-commerce
site running so then there's PrestaShop
another PHP site and PrestaShop is very
similar to OpenCart where I was able to
get it running very quickly but once
again the problem was that it's hard to
customize and it's slow as dog poo so
the slowness is it really gots me after
a while of trying to manage my inventory
and stuff like that if you just selling
a few products and it's no big deal but
you know for any sort of major
e-commerce site I felt like it was very
difficult but at the same time when I
say difficult with OpenCart or Magento
or PrestaShop they're not nearly as
difficult as what's being supplied
out-of-the-box with Django because
Django Options just don't really work
there halfway working they're never
supported the documentation is never
up-to-date so it's just a problem so
then I said what are the paid options
out there so if you actually start
weighing the pros and cons of these
things the paid options start to look a
little bit more attractive when you're
actually talking about charging
customers and dealing with you know
charge backs and things like that so
there's shop of
five and everybody's probably heard of
Shopify at this point but I mean you
could pretty much you have to pay them
and you can get a small shop running for
like I think it's like 15 bucks a month
maybe a little bit less and then you
know they'll handle their credit card
transactions for you so you're gonna be
paying them a little bit more per
transaction and all that stuff but you
know having the the commercial support
and all this stuff in the cloud makes
things a lot easier to deal with if
you're you know a shop owner and then
the other paid option that comes to mind
for me is Volusion and a Volusion is
also a major competitor to Shopify so
those may be two options that you look
at if you decide that just you know
coding if your primary goal is just to
run an e-commerce site you know might be
best not to build it from the ground up
at the very least if you have any sort
of you know
tight deadlines we're trying to get
something off the ground it might be an
option to look at a paid service and I'm
in no way affiliated to either one of
these things I don't you know I could
care less if you actually chose one or
the other or none but just in my
experience when it came to building an
e-commerce platform I was like well hell
it might be worth just paying the $15 a
month and you know having a new
professional support and stuff like that
without and that's coming from a code or
two so I just I wasn't you know too
happy with with the options out there
with Jango so you know unfortunately
here it is 2016 February 28 2016 Jang
has been around for almost ten years or
ten years now and and there just really
isn't any good ecommerce platform Jango
Oscar is probably the best but I would I
would strongly caution trying to use the
latest versions of Python using Jango
Oscar you're in for a major headache
probably using Windows is going to give
you a headache as well but if you do
pick one or if I had to pick one of the
Jango e-commerce platforms that would
definitely be Jango Oscar even though
it's opinionated I can work my way
around Jango pretty well but when I have
to weigh whether or not I want to do
that compared to whether or not you know
whether or not I want to spend three
months trying to get a Jango Oscar site
off the ground or whether or not I can
just want to you know set up an
e-commerce platform you know over a
weekend PHP options with the free
version or just the paid version using
Open Cart or Volusion scene
you know really attractive alright guys
