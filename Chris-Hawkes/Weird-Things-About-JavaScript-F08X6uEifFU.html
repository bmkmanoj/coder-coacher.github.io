weird I know it's gonna sound a little
strange there's been some calibration
issues and I'm still trying to address
that and I just need to pump something
out here so uh the mic quality hopefully
will get better but this video is about
weird things about JavaScript and I'm
not gonna go into like too many details
I would say or too many like I would say
dork level details at least hopefully
not but you know JavaScript not trying
to knock on JavaScript but every
language has its own quirks and
everything but javascript is definitely
unique and the amount of quirks I think
it has compared to other languages and I
just want to kind of touch on some of
those things and and we'll talk about
you know a little bit why of you know
why and what's going on there and let's
just jump in the list here all right
first thing type of array equals object
to me that's that's really interesting
like it's one of those things that will
bite you one day and you're gonna be
looking at you're like hey I got an
array here and I'm looking at type of
make sure it's an array and then you're
getting an object or level-wise an
object well type of on an array type
actually will return an object so that's
that's actually quite strange in my
opinion not a number is a number so
that's another thing that's actually
very confusing so if you do a bad
calculation on you know any sort of
JavaScript that you're doing any sort of
mathematical calculation that doesn't
actually return an actual valid like if
you try to multiply let you know string
by something you know a string by
whatever number or something you're
gonna get not a number but the
interesting thing is that if you look at
the type of not a number it is a number
so it's almost a little comical there if
you add two empty arrays and JavaScript
you're gonna get a string so that's a
lot like I said that has to do with a
type coercion a lot of this stuff is
kind of this weirdness and surrounding
what is considered to be a weakly typed
language Java scripts a weakly typed or
dynamically interpreted so you don't
have these static types that I've can be
laid out because normally in a
statically typed language you would
never be able to be able to do this even
in a strongly typed language like Python
you would never be able to do something
like this without an error but with
JavaScript it just basically magically
coerces into whatever
things that you know it should return
even if it's just bogus so that's
interesting and once again here's
another type coercion type of thing you
have a string one and then you have a
number of two so instead of taking one
and turning it to a number and getting
three you actually get a new string of
12 so it took the number and it coerced
it to a string and just added the two
strings together making 12 but it's of
type string and not a number so anyway
that's that's an interesting thing I
don't know of any situation where you'd
ever want that to happen in the wild and
now javaScript just do that because most
of the time if that just happens like
you're gonna have some sort of weird
there's gonna be some sudden you're
gonna have some sort of ripple effects
going that you're going on down the down
the system and you're gonna be reading
log reports and stuff like I have no
idea what's going on and it's because
some crazy like this happens
somewhere along the way alright
referenced referenced anyway reference
variable doesn't exist
no problem throw it on the window object
so I probably should have wrote that out
a little better but one of the reasons
why we have strict mode in JavaScript is
because javascript has this prototypical
inheritance so it goes through like if
you request a name of a function it's
going to look within the scope that the
the function is being executed from so
it's gonna look at that level scope and
then it's going to go one one
inheritance object all the way up until
it gets eventually to the window object
and in JavaScript if you're not in
strict mode and you try to reference an
undeclared variable javascript will just
throw that variable on the window object
even though you've never you know you
never you know you never instantiate it
or anything so it's like you never
assigned it a value never even you
actually declared that you were gonna be
using that variable it just gets thrown
on the window object so a lot of times
said that's not what you want but it's
what we've become accustomed to all
right next one
javascript has no classes at least the
real object nor any classes that we know
so and I'm
in programming language generally a
class can be thought of as like a
blueprint and the blueprint are just
instructions for stamping out new
objects and you know based on that class
blueprints and JavaScript we have this
thing called prototypical inheritance
where in order you in order to have a
class like inheritance system you
actually are stamping out duplicate
copies of objects that share the same
prisoner change the same parent
prototype all the way up to the window
object so you can definitely bring more
about that but in classes in the general
object-oriented term for JavaScript they
it's not the same thing so they are at
like I know but the es6 you got it you
guys will tell me that they have classes
now but it's still a prototypical
inherited prototypical inheritance type
of system next one is a variable
hoisting and this one I'm just going to
provide a demonstration because it's
it's easier that way and we're going to
look at w3c sees example here and really
it should be called jobs the
declarations are being all wasted but
the same thing so you know your
declaring a variable down here what's
interesting here is here you're actually
referencing an undeclared variable in
the code base at least and you're
assigning at the value five and once
again this is where JavaScript would say
oh you didn't declare X anywhere I'm
just gonna throw X on the window object
now in this example though what's being
happened here is because of hoisting
this declaration is actually hoisted to
the top when the function is is executed
so X isn't undefined when the value is
assigned to it which is interesting
because it looks like it's on the unjust
on a sign because JavaScript it quickly
reads you know top to bottom left to
right but with variable or declarations
that are voiced it to the top and those
will be interpreted first so that's that
can be really confusing to a lot of
newbies so there is no comparison really
to compare two arrays like if you look
at these two arrays here that both have
the values like the same exact values
there's no difference between the two
but they do not equal each other in
JavaScript so if you've ever
to compare one array to another most
likely that's tripped you up because
those two do not evaluate us as the same
object or they're different all right
one equals true now obviously you know
JavaScript has a true and false like
boolean's a lot of things that equate to
true and false and this isn't just
unique with with JavaScript like you
know one is true true is true any any
non empty string is true so in
JavaScript we call those truthy and
falsy so there's a lot of values that
can be truthy and falsy
falsie values can include zero false
empty string no things like that console
dot log typeof null is an object so
that's another thing too a lot of times
people think that null is like there's
some some value some reference or
something and in memory to some you know
null value or something like that but
it's actually an object and in the
JavaScript language functions execute
themselves so this thing also baffles
the hell out of people that have been
even people have been developing
JavaScript for very long time they don't
know about you name spacing they don't
know about immediately remote function
expressions which really it was a term
coined by this guy cowboy
that's his github name back in like 2010
anyway the if you know is basically the
essentially the model that something
like jQuery is using and and why you can
get the dollar sign and then be able to
have all those no dollar sign dot append
or you know get to the selectors or
whatever if you're using jQuery the the
immediately invoked function expression
is actually a very very popular thing
for not just name spacing but really
just for keeping things concise e do not
put you know pollute the the global
namespace of the global window object
so I could have touched upon more
probably would like strictmode but I
didn't go into strict mode too much
because we're moving away from strict
mode we have lexical scoping now with
es6 and I could have mentioned some of
the uniqueness and the weirdness of
JavaScript and the fact that there's so
many different libraries you have like
you know NPM and now node and no it's
confusing in its own right because a lot
of people think that node or straight
JavaScript but it's really not so
there's like there's there's still
plenty of other weird things to talk
about but this is kind of just I think
like scratching the basic surface and
that's kind of what I'm hoping to do
here I don't want to go into too much
detail anything that I might have missed
in this list I know you guys probably
have some suggestions out there but I'm
always curious to try to you know be
able to have a nice conversation about
different programming languages so
anyway guys thanks for the support you
guys take care have a good day bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
