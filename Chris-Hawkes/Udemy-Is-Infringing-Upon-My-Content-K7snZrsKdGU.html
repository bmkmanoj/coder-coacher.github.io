take a moment in this video to kind of
point out you to me seems like kind of a
sleazy ass company I'm not sure but I
just wanted to see what you guys his
opinion is on what you to me is really
all about so apparently there's just
like rampant copyright infringement
across the entire platform there are
some legitimate courses apparently but
there are just like a ton of fake
courses you udemy's been under pressure
for quite some time about this actually
this is a major article but a verge that
was talking about it so you know it's
something that they've been on on notice
for for quite some time so what do I
think udemy is a sleazy company well
maybe they're not but they've had this
problem where they don't validate any
sort of content or anything that's being
uploaded by these professors in this
particular case like I mean you could
clearly see that the the the you know
these videos had different authors and
things like that but you look at this
course is a nice little course here $194
they haven't marked all the way ninety
four percent off all the way down to
eleven ninety nine
but 30-day guarantee money-back
guarantee over eleven thousand students
enrolled so pretty good course right
alright so 11,000 students god knows
what they paid some of them paid 200 if
that was the listed price I'm assuming
and then you go down and you get to the
first video on this thing Oh a
major companies that use Python that
sounds familiar
hey guys what's up so in this video well
I'm on you to me what's up no nobody
ever ask permission like what and and
this stuff like is embedded into like
udemy's platform with her watermark on
my like that's just crazy so the
thing is like I don't know how much of
this other stuff is copyrighted like I
don't know about all these other videos
I would imagine if this person has the
brazen balls to just copy like somebody
else's content on the introduction
course like then there's most likely
probably more of my stuff in here and
like I'm sure other peoples and
everything else so in my opinion like
udemy should have to pay some sort of
penalty for this or something that's
what I think I could also look at it
like whatever like I get a little bit
more exposure but then again nobody's
even mentioning my name it should
just stole my stuff and like content
creation world that we live in you know
that I'm contributing to so I'm curious
what you guys think just leave a comment
should I be happy about my stuff being
stolen or should I be mad like just let
me know what you guys would do or think
all right take care make sure you
subscribe and have a good day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
