you guys all right so uh in this guy's I
just want to share this video with you I
can't share the whole things I just want
to do like this fair use thing and I
wanna make sure this guy gets credit for
making this video its funniest video
I've seen and a little bit for
programming and it's so true
but I'm gonna go ahead and play just a
few snippets of it but did the skirt the
link the description good damn it
the link is in the description tab below
make sure you guys check that out click
on that watch this video it's it's
hilarious if you ever wondered what
programming is like this video
definitely describes it this is what we
think it's like so then it goes into
that real quick and like I said I can't
display the whole video because I don't
want to not you know I want to give
credit where it's due basically but then
it like it fast forwards to this point
regular right about here
so basically that is what programming is
like we're gonna spend a lot of time
google searching solutions to problems
in fact one a lot of times I don't even
spend any amount of time trying to
diagnose what the error message is
sometimes I'm so lazy that I'll get the
error message back and immediately
Google search it without even trying to
comprehend what the error message is if
it's not like is obviously if it's some
error that I run into all the time like
you know some element doesn't exist or
some you know it's an old check or
somebody that but besides that like if I
get some sort of weird crazy error
message like I don't even start with
like trying to figure out where it came
from what line things like that I'll
immediately Google search it just like
that one dude day all he saw was just
like it didn't work and immediately he
was looking for the solution and he
wasn't trying to go about it the hard
way though he probably would have
learned more about his own code and
about the project and technology and
everything had he tried to find the bug
instead of just immediately google
searching it but like a lot of times
time is money and we just have to move
as quickly as we can so that's what we
do all right so what else am I going to
talk about one of the things I wanted to
reach out to you guys about is a lot of
you guys are in the market looking for
jobs and I actually have people that
reach out to me offering jobs and also
asking me if I know of other people that
are looking for jobs so I can tell you
specifically what I'm looking for and
what I might possibly be able to help
you with is if you're in the DC area and
you're looking for dotnet jobs like if
you have any sort of c-sharp dotnet
skills and you're in the DC area
definitely hit me up I might have an
opportunity for you even if you're not
like and you feel like you're working on
it like I'd like to get all my users to
start giving me your like your names and
your email addresses and what skill sets
you have or what you're looking for and
if I find those results then I will you
know it forward them to you so make sure
you guys try to help me out I'm gonna
see if I can actually do something with
this I'm not really sure if it's gonna
go anywhere or not but it's something
that I've been wanting to do for a while
so I really think that I can I can help
people find jobs and I also think that I
can help employers find the right
and it's something that I'm gonna be
focusing on trying to do but I need your
help I need you guys who are in the
market who are trying to find jobs let
me know I really I need pieces of detail
I need like your name your contact
information your location because
obviously if you're not any and like DC
or in the United States and I can't get
you for that job and maybe there's other
you know I do get I get overseas
opportunities but not really for like
the type of full-time salaried position
that you would expect from you know
within the United States like there is
like Russian startups and things like
that that will reach out to me be like
hey crazy here we have this opportunity
we want to work with you typically those
are like business ventures and not
necessarily like getting a paycheck to
be a developer for that company but what
I'm looking to do is I'm looking to
possibly have a list of potential
candidates for four employers that reach
out to me and then also to also be able
to help out those candidates and
actually being able to find out find
employers who are reaching out to me for
for jobs and things like that so once
again the the best way to contact me is
if you go to my channel and you look at
the about of the channel there is a
corporate email address there and I'm
not gonna just give it a without you
guys actually going through the proper
motions of looking it up just to prevent
some spam but yeah just you can get my
email address on this channel I think
that's gonna be the best way to contact
me I'm probably gonna end up building a
website maybe for like a community
contact form or something like that just
to be able to make that a little bit
easier depending on the results let me
see what you guys actually respond back
to me with and at the very least if you
guys are gonna be super lazy just go
ahead and put your information in the
comments but or at least some way for me
to get in contact with you or maybe I
can private message you I'm not sure how
we want to do that but anyway I know
this is a weird video but if you guys
would work with me on that I appreciate
it and again if you're if you have
dotnet skills and you're in the DC area
I may have a potential opportunity that
you could be interested in and and it's
something I would certainly recommend
but yeah I got it gotta get that
information for us gonna know who who
could possibly be interested and again
even if you're not a dotnet person like
I need
I need Python skills any Ruby whatever
rails view anything I and I just need
that I'm gonna start comprising it and
I'm gonna try to get you guys these
these offers it just really I'm hoping
that I can I can these people that reach
out to me for enquiries I'm gonna try to
direct them to you guys that's gonna be
the kind of that's gonna be the end goal
here that's that's what I'm hoping for
but we'll see how it works out so this
video was brought to you by a dead
