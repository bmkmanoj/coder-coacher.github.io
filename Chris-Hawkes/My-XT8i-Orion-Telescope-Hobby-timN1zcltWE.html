of a off the topic video over here but I
want to show you guys not sure if you're
gonna be able to see it but above my
house actually you could probably see up
at that star up there over there it's
actually not a star so that's Mars so
Mars is gonna be the closest approach
well actually that's already past I
think late last month
Mars was at its closest approach to two
earths and the closest approach that
would be for in the next 10 years so the
next time I get to see it that close
it'll be when I'm age 44 so that's
pretty amazing and then you can see over
here that another other bright spot in
the night sky is Jupiter so really a
point behind this video is that you you
have to have hobbies other than just
programming right you have to get out
there in the real world and you know do
do other things I think to keep your
mind fresh least that's what I tell
myself and that's how I justify paying
like seven hundred bucks for a telescope
but I definitely recommend this if you
guys kind of swing seven hundred bucks
just Orion xt8
this thing I mean when I'm looking at
Mars Mars is approximately 48 million
miles away right now somewhere around
that but I mean it seems right in so you
can see the bands on Mars you can
definitely see the four moons of Jupiter
over there and you can see Jupiter
relatively close to in fact in March
when Jupiter was at its uh at its
brightest it was it was definitely
bright it was awesome I was a heck of an
experienced and like the first time you
end up seeing like the rings of Saturn
from your front yard is pretty amazing
because really I try to put it in a
historical context I've always been a
big fan of history and you know they've
known about the stars for you know
obviously thousands of years right I
mean there's probably going back to you
know people living in caves and
everything they knew about the Stars and
and that the planets acted differently
from the constellations and the planets
were unique because they always move
around from the night sky like right now
here it is in June and Mars is finally
above my house
I have a relatively good clearing here
but I haven't been able to catch a good
shot of Mars really since I got this
telescope and Saturn's gonna be shortly
behind probably behind these trees right
here but I had a wait you know until
like 3 o'clock in the morning but here
it is it's it's not even midnight yet I
mean it's a work night but I still you
know I could get much prettier night
here in Virginia and like I said this
camera's not catching it very well but
on the fact that matter is it's pretty
clear out here right now and you're not
gonna get a much clearer night so I felt
like I had to get out here even on a
work night and take a few glimpses of
Mars especially knowing that I won't get
another opportunity at least from you
know my front yard with my own
terrestrial telescope to be able to see
anything that close for the next 10 10
years but yeah so with the cavemen and
everything it's it would not really cave
in and call them what you want the you
know historic man dating back thousands
of years ago you know they knew that the
planets were unique because of the way
that they moved across the night sky you
know at different times of the year and
you know it took us until the late 1600s
until a Dutch astronomer was actually
able to build a telescope large enough
to be able to see the moons of Jupiter
over there and also to be able to see
the rings of Saturn so if you put it in
context it's pretty crazy because I mean
fast forward of 2016 you can make a
small investment of like six or seven
hundred bucks if you can swing it then
you get a telescope you can put it up in
your front yard and you can actually
view something that people weren't able
to view for thousands of years I mean
he'll at one point everything was flat
you know now we have science that can
map out the night skies and tell us
exactly where planets are going to be at
any given time for the next like
thousands of years and even beyond that
that we can send like spacecraft like we
have Rovers nASA has Rovers right now
climbing around on that little planet
Mars which is half the size of Earth 40
million 48 million miles away right now
so anyway I thought I'd share this
moment with you guys just let you know
that
sometimes I get out of here in the
middle of the night by myself and just
started looking at the Stars alright
guys have a good night and bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
