what's that welcome back all right so in
this video I explained before that a lot
of times when you're debugging Casper
you have no idea what's going on because
you could be in step 4 of a five-step
process when you think you're in step 5
or you think yeah that would be a good
example you think you're in step 5 but
you're in step 4 you have no idea what's
going on you're not getting the results
you want the best thing to do is go
ahead and print Casper out to the screen
so you get a screenshot of what is going
on all right so how do you print out the
screen what we're going to do is we set
up a new method to do it everything has
to be done inside these methods and
we're going to go ahead and just say
Casper dot then function right and then
inside here we're going to say Casper
that capture and then inside here is
going to be the location where you want
to store to store the the image so in
this case I'm going to store it right in
the directory that I'm running the
program from now let's go ahead and test
that and see if it works
all right now the folder of the image is
now in my scripts folder so I'm pulling
that up as we speak and there it is so
you can see that Casper went right in
and pulled up this google image and did
it all behind the scenes so it's really
pulling up a browser and its really
working behind the scenes now if you
want to change the directory where
you're going to be storing that image
feel free you can put that anywhere you
want this just happens to be stored
right where the file is is being kept
all right I do want to keep the videos
on topics so it's easier to come back
and reference how I did something so
some of these videos are going to be
pretty short this one included just want
to keep it on topic this topic was how
do you save a screenshot to help debug
thank you for watching
