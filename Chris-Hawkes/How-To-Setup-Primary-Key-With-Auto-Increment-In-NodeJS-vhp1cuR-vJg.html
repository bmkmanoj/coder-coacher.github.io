video we're looking at our model schema
and if you've been following along in
the last video we actually set up our
database and we were querying and we
were acquiring but we weren't doing
anything on our database here to
actually enforce any sort of primary key
so what we're gonna do is add a primary
key which is gonna auto increment
anytime a new item is added so we're
gonna call this the ID and this is very
helpful because you don't want to have
to deal with setting your primary ID
every time you add a new a new option so
or add a new record to your database you
don't wanna have to set a primary key
that just sucks so we're gonna set this
as an integer and then we're gonna put
down here auto increment true and then
primary key is also true so now we'll be
able to query so basically every entry
is gonna have an ID and we'll go ahead
and test this out right now if you look
at the database table it looks like you
don't even have my table yet so when I
restart my app it's going to go ahead
and create the table because of this
sequel eyes sync it's going to add one
record and it's also going to query that
record that it just adds and let's go
ahead and do that so I started the app
and you can see that it actually query
two found so it added the record found
the record now I'm going to stop the app
because what I want to do is I'm going
to add a second entry to the database
and if we look at this you can now see
that this is the my sequel shell and
that there was one record added which is
the node tutorial and then you also have
this ID right over here so it assigned
it a 1 so the next time we actually
query or insert into this database it
should automatically assign the value 2
and if you've ever used Django or any
like that the way those worms work the
object relational mapper is they all
have that built-in functionality so this
is extremely helpful so let's go ahead
and run through this again and once
again it's going to create a second
record so when we go ahead and query
that you can see that there's now a
second record in the database and it has
an ID of two so it's Auto incremented
alright guys thanks for watching please
