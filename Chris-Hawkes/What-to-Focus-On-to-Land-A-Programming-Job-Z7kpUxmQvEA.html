question from minke he says hey need
your advice should a self-taught focus
on them trying to get a junior front-end
job or a back-end job first before
transitioning I'm not sure what you're
transitioning to there but but he says I
want to be a full-stack developer but
the amount of information is
overwhelming so anyway yeah so he wants
to be a full-stack developer I when I
was working in Richmond there was a guy
that I worked with who used to like
absolutely hate when people called
themselves full stack developers he's
like no you're a UI developer because
all you're doing is react you're not
full stack shit you know anything like
but on anybody that's just kind of a I
guess but the the full step number one I
think the first thing we need to focus
on is just making sure you guys know
what front end versus back end is and
I'm sure I'm gonna bore this shit out of
you guys but JavaScript is obviously a
front-end language it runs inside the
browser but now it does a little bit
more than that because of technologies
like node or what is that memory hog not
element every other name of it but it
whatever slack is written in a BS code
what is that anyway but with JavaScript
you can now do more than just
client-side development but typically
javascript is a client-side only
language client means the user that is
viewing your web page so whoever owns
JavaScript com there is a server that
sent data to me to my browser and then
the browser rendered it all this data
that the browser is rendering is
considered client-side or front-end
development anything that is on the
server that says oh I got a request I
need to go to a database I need to get
data from that database I need to then
send it to the client that is all
considered server-side work back-end
development so he's asking like how can
I get a job and we're really what is the
best opportunity to get a job and that's
a ton it's a tough question because
obviously it depends on where you anyway
depends on where you live and obviously
if you don't he said he's self-taught so
he doesn't have a degree so that's gonna
play into it so my advice to all these
are the sub thoughts that people trying
to get into the industry is I would
focus on probably front-end definitely
and the main reason why is because the
technologies
rounding front-end development they
haven't been around very long right now
some of the hotness is is still reactant
view I know I've talked about that a lot
lately but if you look at something like
the the react library here it's only
been in existence for four years so
that's not very long that means that if
you got into this joint four years ago
you're probably way more advanced than
in react then you then even a senior dev
who's been in Java for ten or fifteen
years or something like that you're just
gonna know the tools and the
terminologies and everything much better
than the older developers and if you
look at the the contrary like let's look
at say we'll look at let's look at
Python right pythons are popular it can
be a server-side language it can also be
used for robotics and and other things
as well but like if we look at Python it
first came out 26 years ago so if you've
been involved in Python all that time
you have people that have had decade's
worth of experience programming and
Python so you're gonna try to compete
against those guys to get a girl so I
shouldn't just say guys I say guys that
have I just had a habit but I mean guys
and girls might say guys but anyway yeah
so 26 years decades of experience you
really don't wanna compete against that
probably unless you're really really
good so I would focus on the client side
stuff that is the stuff that the boot
camps are focusing on in fact while
we're even talking about it like I can
go ahead and mention my sponsor which is
Deb mountain coding boot camp I've
hooked back up with these guys these
guys I love love that mountain cuz we've
been working together for a long time so
of all the sponsors on this channel like
Deb mountain is dead point the sponsor
that is has been my my rock but anybody
here the if you look at the course is
you look at web development and you look
at some of this stuff and just look at
like what what the you know what they're
teaching in these courses and things
like that so you're gonna be able to
probably gain a pretty good
understanding like you can see here this
is all client side stuff html5 CSS
JavaScript git and github it's good that
you know that kind of stuff as well but
then like jQuery client-side angular
client-side nodejs is a server-side
technology but it's still very it could
be considered well it's not considered
client-side but anyway you use
JavaScript which is a client-side
language
right it react as client-side databases
now with web development there's really
front-end and back-end but then there's
there's actually more that like full
stack development that means you're
dealing with databases you're setting up
firewall rules and things like that so
you're dealing with networking and stuff
like that so I consider myself a
full-stack developer because like this
website hipster code is written in
Django it's written in Python something
or another but like I created I the
server's the databases the client-side
technology the server-side technology
this websites using react it's using
Redux it's using like say Python and
Django it's using Postgres as a database
it's using stuff like quill and jQuery
and react and there's just so much stuff
that it's using that data so I consider
myself a full-stack developer because of
that but it doesn't mean that I'm some
ninja that's like dude that can just
figure out any sort of full stack I do a
lot of c-sharp Microsoft Development but
I'm still I wouldn't consider myself a
very good back in c-sharp developer I
consider myself to be fairly decent and
because I have so much UI experience I
consider myself to be in fact I don't
just consider myself do the companies
I've worked for consider myself to be
you know relatively advanced and a lot
of that is it's because of the fact that
I am full stack and I have a lot of I
have a wide butt so if you want to get
to that level you're right it's daunting
as hell like you're gonna have to learn
how to set up your own VPS which is
virtual private server and I would
recommend that probably and then you
know obviously learning how to install
things like Apache nginx virtual host
things like that having to deal with
databases obviously picking out your
client-side stack your frameworks
whatever there's a lot that goes
involved so if you have the time you're
gonna learn so much doing that and I
would definitely recommend that if you
had the time but for people that don't
have the time and if you're simply
focused on getting a job in the industry
then I would definitely go client-side I
would focus on react or view or angular
or something like that I would make sure
that you know about es6 I'd probably
start fucking with things like
typescript as well and I would be
focusing on all that stuff make sure you
know get github I have tutorials on a
lot of that stuff as well so like
especially if you're just getting
started with gages why
my tutorial but that is my advice man
because you're just you're not competing
with so many old neckbeard programmers
that have been in the industry for so
long this technology hasn't been around
very long and you're gonna be able to
hit the ground running pretty quick so
that is my advice guys thanks for
watching make sure you guys subscribe
vote of the video and have a good day
bye so this video was brought to you by
dead mountain coding boot camp they're a
boot camp that is based out of Utah but
they're also in Texas in Arizona now and
they have very good reviews so make sure
you guys check them out the link is in
the description tab below they offer
courses in web development iOS
development UX or user experience design
Quality Assurance and just a few other
ones in fact they're even getting into
Salesforce as well now so they're
continuing to adapt their courses based
on what the market needs are and major
companies are hiring some of their
alumni so make sure you guys give them a
look they have great reviews and thanks
for watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
