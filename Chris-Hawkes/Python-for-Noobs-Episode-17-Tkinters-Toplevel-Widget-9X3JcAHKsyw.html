Ken or some to counter-programming
and this is a complicated bastard a
little bit so hopefully you guys can
hang in there and we can learn this junk
and hopefully be able to make some cool
GUI based applications anytime we're
dealing with the Kenter first things
first you always want to stay from two
Kenter what should need to be
capitalized but mine automatically pulls
that and just a import star which means
import everything so everything is
available this quick video is about
tkinter
one particular widget which is called
the top level which is a widgets
essentially if I can just show you here
any of these co2 counter programs we're
gonna say root and then you're gonna
assign it paid to Kenter you're
instantiating the tick enter method I'm
assuming so root equals TKA open and
close parenthesis and then we want to
set it on the infinite loop so then we
would just say root and main loop so
that our program doesn't close as soon
as it runs and that's really all it is I
mean when you say root equals TK it's
pulling up the tkinter shell like you
know that show application so when I
when I run this I have this program name
top level and this is the tick enter
thing it's the shell it's you know it's
whatever
that's what do you see every time you
run it so that's all you got to do to
actually pull up the the GUI based
widget there or application so one of
the widgets though that we can call upon
within tick enter is a top-level widget
and there's basically a couple different
variations of your top-level widget
there's actually the top-level and then
there's also a sub level most of your
applications I guess basic ones are
probably just going to be one top level
and and no child or whatever but then
there's also the top level widget that
is similar to the child or to the main
shell except that it doesn't actually
display like the outer portions of the
show
like to minimize the maximize button so
you can have applications that don't
show that stuff which is the transient
top-level and then you have a top level
that you can display which is basically
a different variation of it so that you
don't have the minimize and maximize
buttons I'm assuming in case you don't
want somebody be able to you know expand
the program and make it look all funky
and everything if you haven't accounted
for that type of thing so if I could
just run through and show you guys a
quick example of what we're talking
about so first things first like we've
done in the last hello world application
we're going to say label route so you're
you're including the parameter or the
route that we just instantiated so
basically the tick enter shell and then
we're just going to write text to the
screen we'll say this is the main top so
then you want to say dot pack which is
basically a geometric version of I'm
having to cancer basically arrange like
frames and things that we may have
inside of our GUI application and it
adjusts and expands and things
appropriately based on geometric
positions and that's kind of built in so
that's all there is to that so in order
to and include this into our TK widget
there we need to say let's just say top
level or top 1 equals the top level and
it will say root so it's including this
show okay so when it does that it should
it should display this is a main top
level underneath the shell actually
almost in its own shell basically you'll
see what I'm talking about in a second
so then let's create the child shell so
this one is going to include instead of
including root it's going to include the
one that we just made the top level
basically the I don't know if you call
the top over top top level or whatever
but this is a child level that we're
working on right now so it's including
instead of the shell meaning root it's
including
top-1 and then we'll say text evils this
is a child burst by the top level and
then we'll say dot pack and then we need
to include this and we'll say t2 equals
top collection in this top two will keep
the same convention top level and so
this should be a sub of the top level
let's go ahead and just run this work we
can see what we're doing here so we run
this you can see that we have all kinds
of going on here all right so we
got only moved this alright so this was
the main top level and then this was the
child that was birthed by this level and
you can see that here is the main shell
so we basically took the main shell and
then we created a top layer on top of
that main shell and then we created a
actually I'm sorry this is the top layer
this is the top layer and then then we
also included a bottom layer which would
be within this show so if I close this
and actually closed all of them all
right cool whatever so let's move on I
want to show you the transient one real
quick this is where it doesn't display
any of the open and close I mean it's
real simple so we can just say label and
we'll say top this one will instantiate
the child so top two and then we'll say
hey Tex you both this is a trans
window pack and then we'll say top 2 dot
transient and say roof until they run
this and yeah we're gonna do something
right here one second all right so
actually on this is correct so this is
what we want I just had my Verbier too
messed up the transient window is
actually the window that does not
display the expanding control so the
window that displays no controls at all
simply uses geometric positioning like
you have to give it a metric coordinates
and we're not gonna get into that right
now but for right now I just want to
show you that you have the basic top
level and then the child level and then
the transient level and to look at the
transient level you see what I'm talking
about what the
alright here it is so there is no
control just simply closing your your
window here so you have no minimizing
maximize buttons so those are the basic
different top level things in the next
video we need to get into the frames and
how we can use those within the GUI
application alright thanks guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
