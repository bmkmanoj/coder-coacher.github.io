about emerging tech trends of 2017 so I
know it's still 2016 but we always like
to try to look into the future
especially as programmers just trying to
figure out where the technology where
the industry is headed and I say tech
trends specifically for programmers
because there's a lot of things going on
in the world that don't involve
programming whether it be like
architectural stuff or electrical
engineering a lot of areas that are
really cool space and all that stuff but
in many cases there's not very much
opportunity for programmers to try to
you know maybe jump into that type of
industry so there's going to be you know
areas that I probably leave out of this
list and you know this list is just one
person's opinion so if you guys have
additional things that I may have missed
or you want to add maybe I said
something incorrectly just please leave
a comment I try to approve all comments
as long as you're not being like
derogatory or racist or something like
that but we can um you know we can all
talk about you know where where this
entire industry is headed into 2017 all
right so the first item on this list is
the CRISPR gene editing and this is
actually very interesting but
unfortunately I'm not very well versed
in this sort of thing I'm not a
biologist or I don't know much about
molecular life and DNA strands and all
the different molecules and things that
make make up who we are as organisms but
a lot of work is being done in this
industry not just by scientists but also
with programmers trying to map a map
actual genes now with this CRISPR gene
editing what we're looking at is we're
actually looking out for the first time
being able to remap the way our genes
are created so basically if we have
genes that are more susceptible to
cancers even different types of hair
colors and things like that there may be
a day where we can actually edit those
genes to remove those deficiencies you
know well in advance of ever having any
sort of major disease that comes about
so if you want to read more about that I
would definitely suggest you know the
Wikipedia page just to start although
there's probably some
accuracies in there but this CRISPR gene
editing is definitely something that is
is taking the world by storm in fact
it's one of the some people have said
it's one of the most important
technological advancements maybe of the
last hundred years so it's that big
there's tons of money being poured into
it just recently on Engadget here either
Engadget a-- had announced that for the
first time gene editing is being
approved for human trials so you know
there's always you know when it comes to
like stem-cell research and stuff like
that there's always a lot of pushback a
lot of people feel very uncomfortable
with with humans you know playing that
much of a role in the creation of life
and things like that but it's very
interesting another interesting thing is
this Napster guy the guy Chris Parr Sean
Parker who created Napster changed the
entire music industry then you ended up
joining Zuckerberg and Facebook and
getting kicked out of Facebook we all
probably know about the movie and
everything but he's a billionaire
through all his tech ventures and he
started a new company or co-founded a
company that is actually into the CRISPR
editing and looking to try to you know
prevent cancers and try to solve cancer
so it's it's an interesting thing for
his project if you want to read more
about that but it's good for him that
he's going to be able to you know be
able to push that agenda further now
that they're going to allow human trials
another thing that's very interesting
quantum Magazine just recently came out
with an article that scientists in
relatively close to where I'm at in
Rockville Maryland outside of DC they've
essentially created a new life form or
at least mapped a a synthetic organism
what they have so basically organisms
are very complicated with the amount of
genes and possibilities that those genes
can encompass to have different you know
traits and things like that but you can
see here that this particular this you
know this weird life-form only has 473
genes but they're saying approximately
like 30% of them are still unknown to
mankind and that there's just not enough
information there because they they
basically still can't explain how this
thing had
you know forms or how it lives because
there's about 30% of the genes that we
just don't understand and and some
people you know they say that you know
that 30% is even in a organism that has
just 473 genes apparently the way the
chromosomes and all this stuff works
there there is more possibilities it's
basically you know one person equated it
to like a needle in a haystack
with the haystack the size of our entire
galaxy so you're talking about you know
trying to find you know that one needle
and the entire gut you know universe
that's and it's obviously incredibly
large but you're talking about that's
how complex life is and even life that
is as simple as this organism is still
you know we're still a ways off from
ever being able to understand you know
life and how it forms but you know there
is progress being made there and then by
comparison according this article which
I found interesting was that the Accola
bacterium has four thousand five
thousand genes so you can imagine that
that is much more much more high-tech or
much more involved than this particular
gene and then you know humans have
20,000 so if you're talking about 473
gene organism with 30% unknown as far as
you know it's mapping and understanding
then you know we're obviously a ways off
even the fastest supercomputers in the
world are not going to solve that
anytime soon the next item on the list
is cyber security this is a blossoming
industry it's been in a hot industry for
quite some time we've always had to deal
with network security and things like
that but when you look at some of the
highest-paid programmers in the industry
you're looking at companies like Juniper
Networks that's dealing with like you
know the RSA credentials and they're
your network monitoring and things like
that intrusion detection a ton of
companies are kind of money's being
poured into companies in this industry
literally billions of dollars and it's
not just coming from private companies
and backers and investors it's actually
coming from the United States federal
government a court and and in many other
industrialized nations as well there is
all kinds of cyber
you know espionage that's taking place
between different countries
it causes international relationship
problems proprietary data is being
stolen pirated and just you know playing
you know copier and and really even
beyond that you're having tons of news
about you know the latest breach of
people getting their information stolen
released on to the web I mean every
company it seems like every major
company is dealing with some sort of
issue whether it was Home Depot or the
target hack or even recently LinkedIn
had me replaced my my email because
apparently like several years ago they
were hacked and this information this
recently became available so there's all
kinds of data breaches going on all over
the place in many cases it's low-level
hackers and those aren't as as
problematic but in other cases it's
actual cyber warfare from countries that
have hostilities towards each other so
it's going to be a industry that is
going to continue to see major major
advancement going into 2017 and beyond
in fact one article mentioned in fact
Forbes magazine had mentioned that in
2020 the amount of money being poured in
the cybersecurity just in the year 2020
is estimated to be a hundred and forty
billion dollars the next item and very
related to the previous item but still
somewhat different is the biological
authentication and that's kind of just a
name that I just kind of came up with on
the fly but what you're seeing now
including my bank just recently came out
with an update where I can now log into
my bank using my thumbprint when I was
down in in Disney World and Universal
Studios actually Universal Studios in
Orlando Florida
they now have thumb prints for all their
guests so when you actually scan your
ticket you give your thumbprint and you
use your thumbprint for lockers and
things like that and you're literally
talking about a place that gets millions
of visitors I don't know how much it is
a day but like even in April where it
wasn't supposed to be busy there was a
ton of people there
so they're able to use this modern
technology to authenticate all the
visitors that are in their parks and
literally millions visit every every
single I would imagine every week now in
addition to just thumbprint you're
seeing a lot of this authentication
having to be updated just because
passwords are a thing of the past or
eventually are going to be a thing of
the past a lot of websites are now just
implementing you know sign-in with
Google and sign-in with that account and
this account in that account and the
reason why they do that is because you
know a company like Google can handle
their security a little bit better than
you know a mom-and-pop shop that is
managing a bunch of user accounts but
even beyond that you know that's called
OAuth or OAuth 2 but even you know
beyond those standards we're now looking
at you know thumb prints we're looking
at iris detectors so you know actually
looking at your eyeball
maybe facial recognition software so
you're going to see a lot more work
being done and the biological department
when it comes to recognizing humans for
who they are where they are and
monitoring inappropriate you know use of
credit cards and sign-in locations and
things like that so this is kind of in
line with the cyber security in some
ways but this is more in relation to
authentication piece and not just
monitoring networks and things like that
so it really is a separate field of
study and it's something that's going to
continue to be really popular going into
the future the next item on the list is
the so-called Internet of Things and the
Internet of Things is a very broad
definition it's a very broad term and it
encompasses a lot of different areas but
essentially it's about devices whether
it's like wearable devices or its
devices that sit around your house or
whatever it may be a car like no matter
where you are if it connects to the
Internet the Internet of Things is all
about trying to get everything on the
web for external monitoring things like
you know your refrigerator being able to
connect to Amazon for some household
groceries when you're running low on
milk or you need a new water filter or
something like that that it
automatically orders it for you a lot of
people are predicted that you know this
would take off faster than it has in
some ways until we get the cybersecurity
aspect down I really feel like this is
going to lag behind I don't want my baby
monitor hooked to the Internet I don't
want my home security system hooked to
the Internet in many ways you know if
it's hooked to the Internet it's
available for hackers to eventually
breach it so they could be watching me
they can be watching my kid you know
they there's all kinds of different
things that they could do and I still I
think that we need to focus on the
cybersecurity part but there's still
going to be a push for the Internet of
Things trying to get everything
connected to the Internet and in
addition to that we're going to continue
to see like we're going to continue to
see search engines expect data to be
formatted in a specific way on the HTML
and allowing you know easier access for
you know parsing for scraping and things
like that so that's kind of a separate
side piece but what I'm referring to
mainly is that the Google and other
search engines had come out with these
item props where you add these tags to
your HTML pages and even if you have
JavaScript rendering the HTML you still
add these tags and allow the search
engines to figure out your data a little
bit easier so with more things
connecting to the internet and being a
needing access to that type of data and
understanding what it's communicating
with and what it's trying to accomplish
we're going to probably need a little
bit better abilities to be able to share
our data and allow the web to be I guess
more easily parsed the next item is big
data and machine learning so this has
been a buzzword for quite some time now
but there is a wealth of data that's
stored on all kinds of different
mainframe systems spanning all kinds of
different industries and the data is
just sitting there where the data could
it be compiled easily it could you could
learn from it and we could advance a lot
of different areas just based on the
sheer amount of the volumes of data that
is out there the problem with big data
is that it's very hard to manage and
it's very hard to access so we've seen
newer technologies like Hadoop and
MapReduce and all these are
algorithms to try to parse through
humongous amounts of data and we're
seeing a lot more companies springing up
trying to build you know not really
cognitive machines like if you look at
IBM Watson it's supposed to be a
cognitive machine but they know that
it's not true artificial intelligence
but there is machine learning involved
so their entire thing is that they're
supposed to be able to tap into your
data your resources and if you apply
Watson correctly then it's going to be
able to learn from itself and it's going
to be able to adapt and ways that your
business
you know needs and sees fit so we're
still yet to see true cognitive ability
like artificial intelligence but in
order to get there we obviously need to
understand more about genes and the
origins of life and how the brain works
but in addition to that we also need to
bility to be able to parse through
humongous amounts of data effectively
efficiently and to be able to learn from
it now nobody does this better than
Google I would say if somebody truly had
a cognitive machine that understood
factoid questions like hey you know what
is the weather going to be like tomorrow
you know basically like we know Siri can
do that to an extent and Google can do
that but like you know a you know who
shot who in 1786 or something you know
what I mean like if somebody truly had a
cognitive machine that really understood
what you were talking about in that
regard and then I think that they would
be competing one-to-one with Google on
the search engine market we know that
Google has the best results not just
because of algorithms and things like
that but they have the best results
because they have the largest user base
and they have access to the most data
when it comes to figuring out what are
people looking for and how to make up
for mistakes and things like that that
occur within their algorithm Google is
far from its original PageRank algorithm
that got them popular back in the
mid-90s this you know this machine that
they have now is much much more
sophisticated it spans millions of
computers and there's tons of data
processing that's going on and a lot of
the ability of it to be able to
understand what it is that you're
looking for is just based on the sheer
volumes of data so if you want to know
what Big Data can do for you just look
at the product that Google has now one
of the
concerning things about something like
that is that as we search the web and as
we have our personal ways be parsed by
companies like Google and Facebook and
things like that it almost creates an
unfair advantage for these companies
that have access to that that huge
amount of data that eventually they're
going to have they're going to have so
much of an upper hand over the smaller
guy that it's just going to be
impossible for the smaller guy to be
able to compete on that level now that's
assuming that you know something doesn't
come along to level that playing field
but that is a concern going forward just
the fact that you have a relatively
select few amount of companies that have
access to these you know substantial
amounts of data that they can cater
their product towards the next one on
our list is geographic information
systems or commonly referred to as gist
this is the ability to be able to read
latitude longitude points and things
like that using GPS in space but it's
ultimately what makes things like Google
Maps and real-time traffic updates and
things like that easily easy to access
so we've seen this as an emerging thing
for quite a while but it's getting
better and better we're seeing a lot
more JavaScript libraries that are able
to interpret a lot of you know Jason
formatted data to be able to display
complicated map plots and things like
that so it's not just used for like
surveyors that might be interested in
property landscapes you know companies
like Zillow are very interested in that
to see who owns what properties and
stuff like that it's also very important
though for a lot of analytical data
whether it's commercial analytics for
where to start your next business or
your residential berta blooming towns
things like that maybe looking at you
know the fault lines for all that the
oil that we're pumping out of the ground
using you know fracking and stuff like
that but there's ultimately tons of
reasons why we would want to have
geographic information systems and why
we want them to be better as our cell
phones and handheld devices you know get
better and better as the technology
develops Google Maps is a very very
complicated and interesting piece of
technology
works great on my samsung galaxy s7 I
you know I praised it before I think
it's it's really great and a lot of that
is made possible using gist systems
alright next up on the list is mobile
apps they are still a thing they're not
a thing of the past and we're going to
continue to focus on native app
development we've seen a lot of products
spring up like whether it's Microsoft's
recent purchase of xamarin to make
c-sharp more of an attractive language
for mobile development to sites like
react native not really a site but a
framework react native created by the
Facebook guys that built a react library
but we're looking at ways have been able
to cross-platform be able to develop in
JavaScript and create apps that run on
you know Android or iOS and one of the
interesting things about react native is
that you're able to write in JavaScript
in that it does actually compile
natively to like an Android or an iOS
depending on which Marta mobile
operating system you're targeting there
are still some concerns and headaches
there the what's called native
development is still going to be a very
very hot item if you're trying to build
an app that is really going to be
groundbreaking for instance one of the
apps that I love when my Android is a
skywalk to app where I can locate any
stars and galaxy clusters in the sky
in fact with my telescope I actually
find myself using the cell phone to
identify planets when I was first
getting started because I felt it was
easier than the GPS system that came
with my telescope so I'm using a
complicated Android app like that that
was built natively specifically for that
platform the the actual user experience
was flawless and what I don't know that
you're going to continue to see that
with things like xamarin or react native
as opposed to just you know writing
JavaScript natively that runs on Android
or writing Swift or objective-c that
runs on the Apple iOS so the thing is is
mobile apps you're they're more
important than ever Google now has just
as much traffic being conducted on their
cell phones as they do on actual desktop
computer so
as much as we love our desktop computers
a lot of people are accessing the web
from their mobiles and their tablets and
these apps are going to continue to
provide a better experience than a
native standard HTML page that they're
accessing on their cell phone so it's
always going to be a I think that
admittin the demand there is going to be
there for some years to come the next
big item on our list is virtual reality
so we've all heard about the oculus rift
lucky Palmer a young kid who was working
out of his garage building the first
prototype of the oculus rift ends up
going to Kickstarter to raise funds to
help his project get along he raises I
think millions of dollars on Kickstarter
but ends up selling his oculus company
to Facebook who swooped in and bought it
for over two billion dollars in 2014
since that time we've been waiting for
the release of oculus oculus has been
released to so-so reviews so far the
actual apps have not caught up but it is
truly an immersive experience it's
something that you definitely have to
experience and it's something that it's
not like it's the Nintendo Power glove
or something like that in certain ways
when you're using it you're like ah this
is you know you can tell you're dealing
with the first implementation of
something that's big to come what I find
I actually have a VR headset which I
purchased for only $100 that works with
my Samsung s7 but it's made by oculus
and I can put it on and and and it's
truly an amazing experience it really is
even though the games suck for the most
part all the games that I played it's
still very incredible that you can turn
your head and see different parts of the
world and you're truly immuno immersed
in this world so one of the greatest
things that I've seen is actually being
able to watch movies and videos using
the headset I mean when you're going
through like a insane asylum and people
are jumping out at you and it's just
creepy I mean you you feel like you're
in there it's it's absolutely incredible
and it's something that's in its infancy
it's going to get better and better and
now we're seeing a ton of money being
poured into this Sony's going to release
their new VR headset you have the HTC
vive that's already come out you have
oculus that's the rift that has come
you now have you know the the VR headset
for Samsung's Galaxy phone and you're
going to continue to see more and more
virtual reality there's going to be a
ton of money poured into this industry
now there's still more items that I
wanted to mention to you but I don't
want to make this video too long I feel
like it's already too long hopefully you
guys are still watching if you want to
know another or if you want me to create
another video that has a few more ideas
of emerging technology that I think is
coming down the pike let me know and I'd
be glad to do that and I do want to
mention that in addition to all of this
that if you're a programmer there's
still going to be a ton of money and an
opportunity and and obviously the web so
the web is not an emerging tech trend or
anything like that but it's something
that is going to continue to dominate
the industry that I mean there's going
to be a new framework coming out every
single week and we're going to continue
to make web websites different there's
going to be a lot of different trends in
that in that regard but that's almost a
video unto itself as far as all the
trends that occur in web development by
itself but this is just a broad overview
of just some of the tech trends that I
predict for 2017 and beyond and let me
know what you guys saying please
subscribe I appreciate you guys watching
and have a good night bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
