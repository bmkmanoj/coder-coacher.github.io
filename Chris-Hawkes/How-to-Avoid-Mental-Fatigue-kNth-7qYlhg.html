question from one of my viewers Igor he
was asking how do I deal with mental
fatigue when programming so I thought he
was talking about in general because
mental fatigue also can lead to like
burnout and and they're kind of one of
the same in my opinion to some degree
obviously mental fatigue can be brought
on by all kinds of different things like
not getting enough exercise drinking
enough water getting enough sleep so
those three things are pretty hugely
important and like drinking enough water
is not something that idea drink more
water i typically have to tell and
remind myself to drink more water and
like call drink coffee in the morning
and sometimes if i don't get enough
sleep the night before then i'm going to
be drinking coffee by midday and then
that typically can can sometimes lead
into a bad schedule where I then get
home and by the time I'm supposed to be
winding down to go to sleep leader that
coffee still due to wearing off and and
these little changes I noticed that you
know effects might my sleeping pattern
things like that so that could play a
big part and it seems so like so basic
but that can play a huge part and not
being able to concentrate very well at
work also if you're in a stressful
situation sometimes people create
stressful situations whether it's
co-workers that you work with or you
know it could be a boss or just an
unrealistic deadlines or something like
that so yeah a lot of those stresses
will occur you just have to be able to
accept them I think so you know being
able to practice breathing patterns to
not get frustrated is also something
that that can help I mean there's been
situations where I've been working on
development with a team and you know a
few weeks before we're supposed to go
into production we notice a bug and
sometimes you know that bug could be my
fault it could be somebody else as well
it could just be the testers that didn't
you know you can point blame and things
like that and it really wants because
well you should be testing your code
obviously but there are things that end
up happening that you just wouldn't
expect to happen especially when you
deal with a lot of Java trip nowadays
and the javascript is doing things that
like basic HTML and web forms used to do
for the last couple of decades we now
are like replicating things like you
know these on change events that are
occurring on inputs to do this and do
that as they're typing so you can run
into all kinds of
weird little issues I think running a
lot of JavaScript but the point is is
that you're going to run into situations
that are stressful and you're going to
be like man I messed that up well blog
and the best thing you can do really is
not be too hard on yourself because I
mean there are going to be mistakes that
are made and you just have to accept
that hopefully that you're not like
million-dollar mistakes but you know
both are a natural part of programming
and it can be very very stressful i
think when you when you're too hard on
yourself in that situation but most
companies are pretty forgiving of you
know the you know the process that is
developing and there's a lot of things
like safeguards in place to make sure
that you know there's testing plans and
that what you know there's units has
written and there's all kinds of
different you know steps that are taken
before we actually go to production with
which code that could have bugs in it
but even still there are the code that
goes into production and that has bugs
and it happens so that can I think lead
to mental fatigue and really if you just
focus on those three main things of
getting enough sleep drinking of water
and getting enough exercise then I think
that helps a lot and another thing too
though because I was originally thinking
well how does you know how if you asking
me how do I avoid programmer burn out
because I do a lot of programming I
learned a lot of stuff on at home you
know outside of business hours I'm
messing with languages and technologies
that I don't even use day-to-day but i
would say that by me scratching the
surface with a lot of that stuff and
here's where i might come a little bit
contradicting like a lot of you guys
were like do I learn Python do I learn
key sharp and you guys were bouncing
back and forth between the two but you
were just getting started programming
I've been programming for almost eight
years now so if if I tell you guys to
not jump around when you're learning
that that's one thing but like if you're
already a senior developer and you do a
lot of JavaScript you do a lot of C
sharp you know there's no reason why you
can't scratch the surface with with
different things like elm and an elixir
and just kind of get your basic idea now
so I think that that is perfectly
finding it's actually something that i
would i would advise other programmers
who have you know years of
to go ahead and do the the thing is that
I do with that though is like I never
push it so much to the point where it
becomes a drug and there's been projects
that I've created on the side like my
movies and my music and stuff where I
pushed it to the point where it became a
drug to to want to work on to maintain
to extend and it just wasn't fun anymore
so typically when that happens I just I
stop those side projects because they're
just they're not fun anymore they were
fun building them and then they just
they're not and I don't really have this
whole drive to build some sort of
startup that I have to put in all my
time and effort into and for that reason
i work at you know different employers
because it to me it's better to need to
be working for an employer and obviously
have the steady benefits and and pay and
things like that because we could still
play around on the side so to me that I
think I avoid a lot of like burnout and
mental code fatigue doing that I can
tell you that that some days you're just
going to be off man like some days like
you have a lot of stuff going on with
your life maybe your kids sick maybe
your kids got problems at school maybe
you know maybe you and your wife had a
fight like who knows the life hits you
those like you're going to get hit with
life this you know just recently I got
hit with a big tax bill at the end of
the year so I gotta pay thousands to tie
in tax isn't like a I knew I was gonna
have to pay about a grand or so but i
have to pay closer to two so you know
it's not a big deal from for me i mean
i'll come up with the money and i'll but
normally I'm kind of in a hurry to do my
taxes because I get you know about a
grand back or so this year I don't get
nothing back and I could get stressed
out over that I could let that affect my
work and things like that and and maybe
in some ways it subconsciously does but
that's where like if you're in the
prayer and meditation that can't help so
like once again I'm not going to say
that I'm like some like religious guy or
whatever but there are times where I
will you know maybe try to do some sort
of meditation type of thing you know
paying attention to breathing especially
when you're inside of a stressful
situation you know focus on your
breathing you know big big huge steps
like a big big breath in through the
knows you know hold it for like three
seconds maybe and start being a pretty
exhaling through the chest Oh or the
mouth so you know just little breathing
tips and stretching it helps deal with
those stressful situations and also one
of the things that I do that maybe not
other people do is like I hate not
understanding how something works or not
understanding what I'm doing so if I'm
learning a new technology there's going
to be things that that are very
stressful trying to learn and it's
sometimes sometimes it's easier if you
take that work a little bit home you
know I mean when you're learning and if
you can find a couple of hours on the
weekend to try to brush up on those
skills I mean whatever you're using at
work like some new library framework
whatever you spend some time with its
building your own project because a lot
of times when you're in a production
environment the usage of those tools
become so convoluted with everything
else you know business rules and all
this other stuff at the company that it
becomes very very difficult to play
around and break things so in order to
get very comfortable with a lot of code
and libraries and things you have to
break things you have to change that
code figure out why it doesn't compile
or why it's not working properly anymore
and you learn a lot about what you're
doing by doing that so that's definitely
something that's very helpful but at the
same time it's much easier to build like
a size a little much more abstracted out
you know isolated project it deals with
some of that new technology they have to
learn but isn't nearly as convoluted so
that can help you really start
understanding the boundaries of where
language is being or a framework or
library or tools being deployed and
where diet starts to cross over into the
boundaries of business rules and logic
that's being written all over the place
and you know so I found that that
actually helps me out quite a bit to be
able to do that in fact one of the ways
that i did that i got into responsive
web design before bootstrap was the
thing so i was writing a lot of these
raw media queries and all that stuff but
i went home even though i don't i was an
asp.net programmer I went home and I
said you know what I'm going to build a
responsive website so i built it and jan
I called it new movies and and I built
it and it was all responsive code
without using bootstrap that I wrote all
from from stretch and I was very
impressed with that because I was able
to take a lot of what i learned there
and then apply it back at work but by me
being able to extract out into a much
smaller project that i have full control
over it allowed me to play around with
my ideas and theories and things like
that much easier and understand what
works and what doesn't and then be able
to bring that knowledge into the
workplace now I also don't condone that
you work all weekend and stuff like that
like that project was actually bigger
than what it needed to be it could have
just been an HTML page for for goodness
sakes instead of a full stack frame work
it didn't have to be as complicated as I
was making it out to be but at the same
time I was also like hey I want a movies
website every cool i have movies website
and i'll help my portfolio and things
like that and i think it did because
some people were impressed with that but
once again it turned into a drag though
because those types of things you need
to maintain them with fresh data and if
you want fresh data and you're just some
outdated crappy music or movies websites
that nobody wants to look at in and then
it just starts to it's almost like like
it's like a code based and I said this
before is never done and I mean that is
just the truth it's never done you
always think that maybe you know it will
be done just right around the corner six
months from now blah blah and it never
is done it's always like a plant that
you always have to prune and or a house
it always needs maintenance you look at
the house on the side of the road that
obviously people abandon how quickly the
weeds start growing up and the Windows
get broken it just it starts falling
apart code bases are just like that man
I mean especially with content based
websites that need content in order to
be aware that may use scrapers to
collect data and analyze you know
different rules and things like that
based off of the data so it's amazing
how quickly your codebase can turn into
that dilapidated old shed on the side of
the road would like a literally a jungle
growing inside of it at least that's my
my impression so I know that that is a
you know a lot of stuff there to do but
I also do other things too is to try to
do other stuff besides programming I do
think that helps like I'm in the sports
so I'll go to sporting events in my DC
area I'll take my kid to different
things
can we will go over the different arcade
type places I mean yeah like chucky
cheese and in places like that we do a
lot of amusement parks so we'll go to
amusement parks in my area if you're
fortunate enough to be able to take a
vacation every year that obviously helps
to get away for you know week or more to
literally not even be checking email
very much yeah so I guess other things
to just I mean I got into the the
telescope you know I bought a telescope
to try to get into astronomy and I think
that that gets me out and does gets me
doing something different besides
programming so there's all kinds of
different things that that we can do but
sighs programming is and I think that
you can be much more susceptible to the
burnout and to the mentality the just as
a coding fatigue or mental fatigue that
comes with coding if you're not taking
proper breaks so alright guys that's
really all I got thanks for watching and
have a good day bye hey guys so a lot of
you asked me how do I get my foot in the
door to become a programmer and I just
want to take a moment to mention dev
