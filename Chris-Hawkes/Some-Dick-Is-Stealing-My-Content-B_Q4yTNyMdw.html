just when I think I don't have any
content for the night I end up getting
an email and the big shout out to Tom
who gave me this email and he said I
guess this kind of happens when you have
over 30,000 subs but I randomly stumbled
on the video tonight was it was like hey
I know that voice ha he's I anyway this
guy is judging her video and audio and
putting ads and trying to make money off
your content so this guy with his
creative art channel which I shouldn't
give him any credit for but I'm going to
know give him a shout out for being a
douche bag it just completely ripped off
my entire content like he he took the
entire video the tags and all like and
everything and just and then posted it
to his YouTube channel where he's
already had 704 views and made money off
it and everything obviously never got
permission or anything like that dudes
out of Pakistan he considers himself a
web developer must be a real dickhead I
don't really understand and in a way
like I understand the piracy stuff but
like to do that like it's not like
you're pirating a copy of some software
that you can't afford or something like
that you're just being a straight
douchebag and taking somebody's entire
video and posting it to your channel I
mean that's not how you get ahead in
life dude and if that's the way you do
business I mean I hope I never run
across you because I would never do any
sort of business with you it's just it's
it's a scandalous you know shitty move
so it's bad for your potential employers
and everything else so I mean either way
I mean it I think it's funny in a way
just that that anybody thinks that my
content is good enough to copy and call
it as their own and another way it's
just it's kind of frustrating cuz it's
like I don't make very much money off
this channel and it took a tremendous
amount of effort over a four-year period
of time to even build up any sort of
audience and you know if you look at it
from a financial perspective that the
channel literally makes like you're
talking pennies a day like if you add up
all that effort and stuff and you can't
really look at it that way but yeah the
point is is that you know a lot of hard
work went into this channel and it's not
like it's some lucrative thing that that
makes a ton of money or anything like
that and it to just you know rip off
somebody's content like that it's just
definitely not a way
to get ahead so yeah this rahul de
bonnie real real prick move there so i
remember this this reminds me of my
favorite band bayside they've always
been fly under the radar type of group
and nobody knows who they are even now
but I mean they've had you know some
success like that reason album I think
charted and the top 100 albums just yeah
briefly so I mean they have enough fans
where they can hit the charts just
barely and then they you know they fall
off or whatever but it was interesting
that he released a tweet one time where
he found a you know how to play guitar
like basically guitar chords or
something like but they were using
bayside songs and it was like an entire
instruction manual on how to play bass
sides music and I obviously had you know
illegal access to their music and stuff
he's like I guess you've arrived when
your when your stuff is being you know
pirated on on Amazon or something like
that because this dude was like trying
to like pose as a legit operation but in
my case I certainly haven't arrived it's
not even it's not even close to being
the same because they are a
semi-successful band and i am a
struggling youtube artist who doesn't
have a whole lot of unique content and
then i guess what unique content i do
have i have people stealing it so what's
interesting is the guy that pointed this
out he actually creates a few courses on
you to me where he actually gets paid
money and and people pirate his stuff as
well and that's unfortunate because I
mean this dudes trying to make money
trying to teach people the guy that
reported this douchebag tonight and so
he's making courses on you to me he's
barely making any money off and I'm sure
and then people pirate it and and that
sucks and then you have somebody like me
who's like I'm doing free tutorials and
I make you know what little bit of
literally tiny bit of revenue off of any
sort of adds to do the tutorials for
absolutely free and people still torrent
or pirate and um I don't know man at the
whole argument that like oh well I can't
afford it so I'm a pirate it because
that's typically like the argument you
here I can't afford it so I'm going to
pirate it or I can't buy it in my
country so i'm going to pirate it in
this case this dude is just straight up
like you know what I'm just going to rip
off somebody else's content throw it up
on my own channel and call it my own so
I've heard about this kind of bullshit a
lot actually like a grade-a under great
under a that guy was really mad about
this guy named Tyrone Magnus and it was
actually extremely funny video about how
this dude was ripping off his content to
react to a video of mine a few months
ago one problem is that he never asked
for permission and if he did I wouldn't
have given it to him because I do not
agree with reaction channels I've made
my feelings of things about reaction
channels very fucking clay but whatever
he went and stole my video anyways it's
not like YouTube fucking kids right Oh
anyways last time I saw he had over
300,000 views on that video which so the
youtube drama is real and I'm gonna post
a link to this video if you guys have
time I actually found this video through
eli the computer guy when he was going
through his stuff with YouTube where he
was basically talking about leaving
YouTube but with a grade-a Andre he was
talking about everything that's wrong
with YouTube and the fact that people
were doing reaction videos you can just
steal people's content and then react to
it and act like you're you know you're
you're making some sort of unique
content and a lot of people were like
there's you know it's bullshit because
they're making money off other people's
work and all this stuff but in my case
it's not even you know not even at that
point because number one that money lost
it hasn't been that big of a deal i mean
the guy probably made a few bucks off it
number two he straight-up stole my shit
so it's like it's not even a reaction or
anything like that so like there's no
justification for what the dude was
trying to do and number 3 i'm not a
big-time youtube or so it doesn't really
matter but it's funny as how like if you
watch this video because it does
describe a lot of stuff that's that's
wrong with youtube and how you were
really the whole entire thing could you
need there I don't want to say it's
fucked but basically there's a lot of
problems with YouTube where it's like I
would never put all my eggs in the
YouTube basket expecting to try to make
some sort of full-time living I would
never ever do that and just uh Furby
because Tyrone Magnus what he did is he
he uhhh um he ended up using a great and
raised video he did this reaction to it
he made like literally he got
hundreds of thousands of views on the
video so he obviously made hundreds of
dollars and things like that maybe even
thousands and it was all just completely
just reacting to a grade-a Andre um
great a Andre I don't know I can never
say that right but he was he was
reacting to it and then the entire thing
he said apparently like one sentence
like oh shit this is a long video and
that was his entire reaction as he's
watching grade-a andre's video and
getting all the revenue and everything
for hundreds of thousands of views and
great a Andre doesn't get anything and
then when he actually you know points it
out to time where Magnus he actually
deletes the video instead of giving the
proper copyright holder claim or
whatever so that you know the actual
owner of the video can end up making
money so Tyrone Magnus would like denied
all the accusations on stuff but clearly
used a video without permission and his
entire channels based on copyright
infringement put a gray Andre man he
like calls him out in this video and it
was just it's extremely funny and I'm
just gonna play the short clip from it I
hate vide possibly comments down below
let me know what you all think anyone
that attachment will be banned as usual
cuz nasty comments hurt Tyrone's
feelings pussy he doesn't keep hate
comments so so yeah I find that
hilarious now I mean I'm going to end it
here just basically say it's you know
it's a problem on YouTube obviously
where people are stealing people's shit
and it's been going on for a long time
and it's unfortunate but somebody tries
to offer something free and then even
that is being your stolen to somebody
else's benefit and it really creates a
society and I've talked about this a lot
with our whole socially connected world
on the internet and everything it's just
it just creates kind of a fucked up
situation because every once in a while
you think and you're like man I don't
really make very much money on this
YouTube stuff and I could be doing
something else or and I don't know man
like the very least if somebody's
offering something free to the community
like I mean at least don't steal that
shit you know that that's the least you
could do but obviously this guy's morals
are are not quite aligned with my own
and that's fine but let me know what you
guys think thanks for watching have a
