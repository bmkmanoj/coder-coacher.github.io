question about work-life balance as a
programmer so it's a relatively
important thing because in order for us
to be able to perform we have an
interesting job where we have to
actually be able to perform day in and
day out we have to be able to get more
tired when we're stressed we're dealing
with other life issues whether it be
kids or wife or i mean we go through
things like deaths in the family and
divorces and some people have addiction
to alcohol and other things and there's
all kinds of things that can end up
affecting you in life and work-life
balance is really really important the
thing that that kind of sucks though is
that a lot of companies don't really
respect that companies want to be able
to get as much as they can out of their
resources without you know without
having to basically they're trying to
get as much out of you as they possibly
can now most respectful employers know
that they can only get a certain amount
of productivity out of somebody per day
a lot of tech companies and really a lot
of businesses nowadays are starting to
have like you know these little perks in
the office like really it seems like it
started with companies like Google where
they started installing slides and going
to the extremes of hair cutter ease and
bakeries and stuff like that inside of
the office but we're seeing things like
you know foosball tables and horseshoes
basketball courts gym all that stuff so
they offer all these perks and
everything because they want their
employees to be happy so I think it
really helps with the programmers in the
sense that you can only program like a
certain amount of time in a day before
you really start to slip off for me I
try to build a lot of stuff when I have
the time and being married married man
with two children sometimes I don't have
as much time as I want to be able to
code so I'll come home and finally I
might be able to unwind it like ten
o'clock pull up my github account or my
visual studio editor or whatever it may
be and I'll start firing away on some
code and at first like it's like man I
could probably do this you know for next
several hours but then by the time you
know 12 o'clock rolls around I've been
doing it for two hours I'm tired and I'm
starting one down my productivity is
actually slipping with time so
the thing is is that I think there's a
certain amount of time that programmers
can actually truly pound out solid code
day in and day out typically if I have a
good night's rest and I'm eating and
drinking properly and I can come in the
next morning and there's times that I'm
whizzing through problems over that I
was being faced with the day before and
it's also about feeling comfortable too
because I think if you're under a
constant state of pressure then you're
going to have a much harder time trying
to succeed in programming correct
solutions I told the story just recently
about how I didn't do very well under
pressure of the moment and trying to do
it whiteboard coding exercise for a
typical day to day programmer like you
don't have to do that kind of stuff
anyway but you don't have to come up
with solutions and a lot of the times
those solutions can be found either you
know you can obviously google search and
people find algorithms and things like
that but if you were solving complex
algorithms like all day long or writing
a lot of like a lot of functionally
intensive code you know do this do that
do this do that and not something that
is like more routine and I suppose
mundane then you're going to burn out
after a pretty short period of time for
me I mean I would think maybe five or
six hours before I start winding down
now if I'm doing something that I'm
familiar with and comfortable with and
just doing but if I'm learning something
new and really really racking my brain
trying to challenge myself then I would
imagine I could only do that for maybe
five or six hours a day luckily though
as a programmer you're going to be in a
lot of meetings if you have a title like
a programmer analyst you're doing a lot
of analytical stuff too so it's not even
just you know writing code like a code
monkey all day long some places they
look for code monkeys and to me that
would be a terrible place for somebody
like me to work I've never been a math
whiz in fact for my business degree I i
just recently took an intro to computer
information systems course i don't
remember the course was anymore but i
think it was computer information
systems or something along those lines
and i took it at a community college and
it was the first time I never taken it
puter science course for my two year
business administration degree and I've
been able to get by all of this time
without taking any math or science I
need the math in order to take to
science so now I'm faced with two math
courses that i need to get which is like
calculus and statistics or something
like or something calculus and
statistics I think it is and then I need
to take either to biology courses or to
physics or some other sort of science I
think it's either between biology or
physics and honestly I took off this
fall semester and I just I plan on
trying to finish it up next year if I
can but my point behind that is that I
never even I haven't taken any sort of
advanced math courses since I was in
high school so that is a very very long
time ago I'm 34 now so the last time I
would have even in fact I don't even
think I took a math course my last year
of high school I think that I was
already on work study because i left
home at seventeen I mean I came from the
school of the hard knocks to be honestly
I didn't have some rich parents that
were putting me into some you know nice
school and i was working throughout
high school trying to make ends meet I
was you know we land a deal and doing
different things and i left i left the
entire state where I grew up that's at
17 and never really looked back so my
life has never been easy and if anything
like I feel in some ways like i'm a
pozer because sometimes you're
surrounded by the you know these nerds
who went to schools like university of
virginia william and mary i know people
that have gone in california i don't
think we have anybody from berkeley or
anything but i know so we have plenty of
graduates from all that Virginia's top
schools around here like UVA and
Virginia Tech and and in some ways it's
a little bit intimidating because those
guys are getting pounde you know pound
it with easier these theoretical classes
and computer science and stuff like that
where I never I never did that my
programming expertise were about how do
I solve the next problem that's put out
in front of me and how do i do that i do
that through using the means of like if
I'm going to be solving a problem in
javascript nowadays I'm
much writing my stuff in the JavaScript
console within chrome and I started
testing my assertions and if I feel like
there's some sort of algorithm for the
most part I don't enjoy doing that kind
of problem solving so I'll probably look
for an actual algorithm out there that
seems like something that that would be
useful for me so some people might
actually like doing algorithms but I
don't really feel like that actually
makes you a programmer or not for the
most part like I'll tell you a situation
will not really situation of a story
when I told a lead programmer I said hey
I don't really use the modulus operator
and this lead programmer he he was like
well haven't you ever done the fizz buzz
challenge and it's like okay so that's
the first example that you can
give me for the modulus operator is the
fizzbuzz quiz you know the
thing that they try to do to weed out
programmers from non-programmers I
understand the modulus or you know the
remainder operator is you know obviously
good for things like mathematical
computations whether it be gaming or
physics or like financial institutions
and things like that but I don't really
I can't think of any time in my seven
years of programming that I've ever used
the modulus operator except for fizzbuzz
so there's definitely going to be
examples i just recently started getting
into unity and c sharp and i'm sure that
there's going to be some of those you
know somebody i will make use of some of
these more mathematically basically the
more mathematical side to computer
programming because i recognized in
myself that i need to get better at
algorithms and stuff like that but as a
web developer as a guy that can build
websites and stacks and Windows or Linux
it's not really necessary it's about
okay how well can you use the linux
shell how how well can you read
instructions to understand how to set up
a virtual host for engine X and apache
to how do you set up django and learn
the Django framework in order to be able
to
up to a database whether it's my secret
postgres or how do you create your
tables and database migrations you know
how do you do media queries in
responsive CSS I mean how your how are
you using the bootstrap framework in
order to make your life a lot easier
when it comes to to designing for the
mobile mobile space as well as regular
desktop computers how are you using
Chrome tools in order to write your
JavaScript how are you setting up
everything with Babel and web pack and
all this other but what is the
point I'm trying to make there's two
different worlds to program there is the
programming mathematical type of concept
of programming and then there is like
the okay let me build a node framework
type of programming where I'm going to
be building you know basically
input/output writing and reading to
files and stuff like that and there I
think there are two very very different
things I would like to be good at both
but I'm definitely not so mote and most
of that comes from the fact that I
didn't go to college to study and and
that I don't really have an interest in
that type of thing so i think that
people that like get a kick out of that
like I'm not saying the satisfaction of
completing something like that because
everybody feels good about completing
something even if you didn't like the
task at hand but for me like I mean I'm
just not that kind of guy that liked to
do mathematical computations I feel like
you're probably borderline crazy if
that's something that you truly enjoy as
a young child I like putting together
puzzles and in a lot of cases I think
programming is similar to that oh this
didn't work let me try it this way let
me try this way you know anywhere you're
switching the puzzle pieces around
because a lot of times that's what
you're going and programming and granted
you may not even be getting you're
getting the full concept of exactly why
those puzzle pieces are the way that
they are and and that comes either with
just raw natural ability make it come
with time people ask me how do you get
better at architecture I feel like with
architecture it gets you get that from
experience because you can't really you
can buy head first design patterns from
over
and you could probably retains a decent
amount of information there but are you
really going to learn about in inversion
of control or dependency injection and
stuff like that and why those are truly
important are you going to learn why
like you don't want to use a bunch of
static classes all over the place in
c-sharp are you even going to understand
like what some of these you know these
unit testing libraries are going for you
and stuff like that so there's I think
that that comes with experience because
a lot of times you learn from making
mistakes in the past like I've had many
failures where I've learned from every
one of them and I wouldn't really do it
over again to be honest I've done a lot
of different type of things in fact now
I'm building this you know this nodejs
web framework just for my own personal
self and if anybody doesn't like it they
can go themselves right sorry but
it's it's the truth you know I mean
people are going to yeah so basically if
you're not good at some of these
analytical things you can work on that
if you're not good at solving some of
those problems on hacker rank I mean you
don't have to be discouraged behind that
because in many cases it depending on
the path you choose you're not going to
have to do that and I've said this
before but not necessarily are the
richest or most successful people this
you know the smartest the brainiacs you
know you see a lot of these these
Brainiac programmers they aren't the
ones that are starting these companies
and becoming billionaires or even
millionaires in many cases there is a
difference between being you know
completely geeky smart when it comes to
numbers in your head theories and
algorithms theoretical stuff and also
being business minded somebody like me
who's you know like slept out of my car
slept on my friends couch you know like
I came from a pretty difficult life
where I was able to make make
happen you know and and I'm going to
continue to do that no matter what
happens so this YouTube channel is it is
an example of that I went from you know
just starting up a YouTube channel to
within a couple of years I now have half
a million views I'm on pace it was like
four hundred and sixty thousand views
this channel this month so take that for
what it's worth but I mean that's just
for me it's like that that's something
that I saw years down the road ears ago
that it could be you know something that
I not only used for a tool to teach
myself but to network to get out there
to to help other people and I've had
people tell me that that I've changed
their life and that have helped them and
some people have even said that that
they've gotten a job because of some of
the tutorials and things that I've
taught so I really think it's cool i pre
appreciate the support but the main
thing is I is work-life balance is
definitely important i just went off on
a complete side tangent on that but uh
yeah with it to get back to the whole
work-life balance thing if a company
doesn't respect work-life balance you
definitely don't want to work there
they're just about burning you out and
you can get burned out in this industry
for sure you can lose confidence you can
lose interest and all the changing fads
things change with the wind and you have
to be motivated and that's another thing
with programmers like if I were hiring
from my own company I would want people
that are actually passionate and trying
to develop their skills one way or
another and maybe if they don't have a
particular skill that I'm looking for if
it's really not going to be a fit it's
not going to work out but you know I
want people that are passionate and if
you if you don't have a proper work-life
balance you're going to eventually
you're going to ruin people you're just
going to you're going to you're going to
ruin their entire careers you're
probably ruining their families
and everything else so it's like if a
company is treating you like
definitely look for someplace else
because I can say firsthand that there
are good businesses out there there are
traditional businesses that have an IT
need there are smaller businesses that
have I he needs and there are more
family-oriented shops and they'll treat
you well as but if you're just being
treated like a number like a piece of
 basically then you need to you need
to find something else before you end up
getting burned out and and you know
don't let these uh these people try to
ruin you you know now you got to look
out for number one if you can't look out
for yourself you're not going to help
anybody else and that includes your
family and everything else so anyway
guys up that's really all I got on
work-life balance I'm it can be found
you can
find plenty of companies that will offer
the proper amount of vacation that
understand why you know foosball tables
and stuff like that inside the business
are an important thing and how that
helps developers be able to step away
from their desk for a moment and and
just recharge their batteries causing
program you got to recharge man you got
to recharge through sleep through
exercise through water through just
taking a break and also being able to
shrug off the bat because you're going
to get criticism you're going to feel
like a failure at times shit's not going
to work for you sometimes other times it
will you're going to have an unhappily
cajuns where you have more confidence
than you should have and that's
something that I've seen time and time
again but of late I feel like I've never
been overly confident saying that I have
something down or I'm grasping this and
that like I feel like I have a long way
to go I really do the only thing that I
would say that I do have a pretty good
hang up and and then I know from within
myself is that I do have a lot of
passion to succeed I want to I want to
continue to try to drive my life for you
know my success story like I just I want
to be better than what I am and I think
most people do but the perseverance of
being you know kicked in the balls get
back up try again don't listen to the
naysayers just just understand that
you're worth it and that you're going to
be able to get you're going to be able
to get you reach your goals with enough
effort and it's going to come to
hopefully everybody that tries hard
enough anyway guys man that's all I God
thanks for watching and have a good day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
