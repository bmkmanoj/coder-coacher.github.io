gonna be doing a top 5 programming
languages to learn right now I'm trying
to actually put a lot of analysis into
this and it's something that is a work
in progress so it's gonna get better I
think but right now I'm looking at me
mainly five different main focal points
to look at some of those include like my
github and just Google results as far as
like blogs and things like that being
written month over month and then I'm
looking at a few other things like Stack
Overflow as well as jobs how many job
listings are available for each listing
so granted some of that is based you
know out of the US but I would say you
know probably this list is um is as
definitive as I've been able to get it I
think so far where it makes a decent
amount of sense I think I still probably
questioned the data a little bit but I
think it's fairly accurate a little bit
more accurate and probably just you know
any sort of list I just come up with off
the top of my head at least I'm looking
at data elements and and I plan on
adding to that so I kind of want to do
like a monthly type of thing I know that
um you know certain websites are out
there trying to engage the same level of
interest and I've always been kind of
interested in that and talked about that
on this channel so plan to do that I'm
some more so let's go ahead and jump
into this the top five programming
languages to learn right now and like I
said I limited it to five I didn't have
a lot of time to crunch all the data I'd
like to have like literally like the top
50 but for right now it's just the top
five and this is what the data shows and
again it's gonna be manipulated and
adjusted but this is what I have alright
so number five is gonna be JavaScript
this one ends up I thought it would be
higher because like github there's so
many different Java JavaScript projects
out there but when it comes to actual
code bases and the amount of like
questions and things like that
javascript is actually not number one
number four is going to be C sharp so C
sharp dotnet microsoft.net it's
obviously huge dotnet core is is still
out there and and making traction
Microsoft's open sourcing a lot of stuff
so they're getting a lot of traction I
think within the dotnet ecosystem again
and they're number four number three is
gonna be C++ this is one that I don't
have a ton of experience with but C++ is
still like a major major factor when you
look at like the original Bitcoin was
written in C++ most videogames are still
using C++ in some capacity or another
even game engines like unity engine is
using c-sharp to like basically code
with just like nodejs allows you to do
but both node and unity are written in C
and C++ so any of those major projects
that require like real intensive memory
handling and things like that you're
still gonna have a a major market for
C++ and I suppose that's why it's number
three number two is Python this one's a
little bit of a surprise to me because
python has has had just like resurgence
multiple times now Python was created in
like 1990 but it didn't get popular
until the late 90s when Google started
using it as its primary you know
technology stack IBM also contributed to
its success as well but then you fast
forward to today and you look at like
Django and Instagram and Pinterest and
all these reddit all these major
websites that are actually running on a
Python stack even though python is a
dynamically interpreted duck type
language it's it doesn't have the speed
of C++ or Java or C sharp but Python I
mean its ease of use and and the the
fact that it's the number one taught
language and most US universities I
don't know the exact stat there but
there was an article and I've even
shared it on this channel but a few
years back Python had actually surpassed
Java as the most taught introductory
language in computer science courses and
and that seems to be that trend seems to
be continuing the only downside I think
with Python is that there's just not as
many jobs at least on the East Coast of
the United States outside of Washington
DC there's definitely not as many jobs
in Python as there are in c-sharp or
Java and that goes to the number one and
the number one I probably shouldn't even
a mention Java but that's gonna be Java
so Java is is by far and away the
front-runner even over C sharp according
to this data that I looked
really when you look at like I said the
stackoverflow the indeed the jobs all
that stuff Java is definitely like the
clear-cut winner actually C sharp what
was tied so let me pull that up once so
ya see sharpen and JavaScript were
actually tied for for last place
essentially but but C sharp got to
slight a slight tiebreaker on that
anyway guys that's my list top 5 let me
know what you think let me know what
other data elements that you guys would
include in this sort of list because I'm
I'm very interested I want to try to
have some like a more of a scientific
analysis that goes into this clearly
there's no way to know exactly what is
the best language there is no such thing
as the best language that's like saying
what is the best tool that you have in
like your toolbox or whatever it's like
you have one that you use a lot but
you're not gonna use it like if
everything if all you have is a hammer
then everything looks like a nail right
so if all you know is Python then you're
gonna be trying to like just just like
slam python into everything when it
really doesn't apply so clearly all
these languages have strengths and
weaknesses and I want to find out like
scientifically as close to as possible
like you know which languages are the
most widely used which ones are the best
ones to learn for our careers and
everything and we'll see what happens
but anyway guys let me know what you
think and take care of have a good day
bye so this video was brought to you by
a dead mountain coding boot camp there
are a boot camp that is based out of
Utah but they're also in Texas in
Arizona now and they have very good
reviews so make sure you guys check them
out the link is in the description tab
below they offer courses in web
development iOS development UX or user
experience design Quality Assurance and
just a few other ones in fact they're
even getting into Salesforce as well now
so they're continuing to adapt their
courses based on what the market needs
are and major companies are hiring some
of their alumni so make sure you guys
give them a look they have great reviews
and thanks for watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
