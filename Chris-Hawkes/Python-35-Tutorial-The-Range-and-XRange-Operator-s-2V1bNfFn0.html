guys may have heard of the range
operator or keyword and Python or the X
range and in this video I'm gonna go
ahead and clear up what those are used
for number one and Python 3.5 or any
three series Python there is no more no
such thing anymore as the X range so X
range has been deprecated
there used to be a range building type I
believe for older versions of Python but
anyway Python 3 and that's what we're
concerned with in this video just simply
has the range type and it is its own
type so like list is a type and string
is a type and a tuple and all those
other types that we've talked about in
Python the range is its own title and as
beginners you're probably not going to
use it that much but you will see it
sometimes so we're just gonna go ahead
and do an example here to show you how
it works so ranges are good for
basically iterating through a list using
numerical values so what we can do we
can say like for I and and then you can
just simply say range and the range
takes up to three arguments you can see
here self so self don't you just ignore
that you have start stop and step so
start means you could start at zero and
you can end at a hundred and then you
could say step you could just say 1
right so we go one at a time and in this
list will just say prints I and I'm
gonna go ahead and call this this method
here my object example alright so we've
went ahead and ran run this then you'll
see what it does so you can see it just
count it up right so it's kind of it's
kind of easy to do that I mean you could
have a variable and just add to that
variable you know I plus plus equal one
which you see a lot in Python whenever
you start iterating through a list but
you don't actually have to do the I plus
equal you know plus equal one you want
to do that craziness if you don't want
to the range operator will help you now
another thing that you can see is like
if we go ahead and we change the
iteration through you know the list we
could say 0 102 so now this is going to
iterate over multiples of two and one
thing so if we look over here no worry
about this third thing that's just from
a previous example you're gonna see that
even though we're doing multiples of two
it's always going to start at your first
range so if you were just one of the
even numbers you would actually probably
start it to that way because no matter
what your first range operator is gonna
it's gonna hit this one and then go by
multiples of two from that point on so
just keep that in mind and just to be
clear if I went like that and you can
see it starts at two so if you knew you
wanted to do two four six eight twelve
all the way to a hundred then that's
what you would do now this thing can go
both ways so you can have all the way
down to one and then instead of going
multiples of two or whatever you could
do multiple of negative one and if we
run this then you can see that actually
counts backwards and you see it stopped
at two because it's not going to hit one
so if you actually wanted it to go all
the way down to zero and well actually
if we wanted to go down to zero you
would do negative negative one and you
can see it can continue to go so it's
actually helpful than trying to figure
out know how I guess basically trying to
figure out your index number as you
start looping through large data sets a
lot of times you can have a list like my
list equals
all right so we have one two three four
so we have ten elements inside of this
list right and I could actually say the
range is will start at a at one and then
we can go down to the actual we can call
in my list or actually go length which
is a keyword it will get the length of
the list and we pass it in my list so go
ahead and do that and you can see it
actually counts through the elements of
our list so a lot of times you're going
to be working with data elements and you
don't really know how large they are and
maybe you only want the first 20 of them
or something like that well you know
range operators they're good for a lot
of different things but that's just an
example of what you would want to use it
for one second I need to let my whining
dog out the door he wanted to come in I
let him in he starts whining gotta let
him out anyway guys that's the range
operator thanks for watching please
subscribe have a good day bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
