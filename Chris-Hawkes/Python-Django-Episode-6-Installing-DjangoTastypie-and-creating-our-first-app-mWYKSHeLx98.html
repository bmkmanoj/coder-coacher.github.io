I want to go to install Django tasty pie
so we can set up a restful service um
because we're gonna build an app a
little module that we're gonna add on to
our Django project and we want to use
tasty pie to be able to interact so
we're gonna do like crud operations
which is create read update and delete
and then but we're going to do it
instead of interacting with a database
like like we normally would we're gonna
end up using we're gonna expose an API
and basically we're gonna make calls to
the API so that we can do those update
and you know delete create operations on
the database object that we're gonna
build I'm not exactly sure what we're
gonna build yet but for starters we need
to go ahead and install Django and tasty
pies so let's go ahead and do that right
now
very make sure that you have your
virtual environment already activated
and we're gonna do pip install and we
should only have to do
Django tasty pie and this should work I
say should because a lot of times
windows just doesn't seem to work out as
well for me when I'm trying to install
some of these modules
all right so if everything went well you
should see it print out all this stuff
to the screen I has to install modules
and things that it needs to get it to
work now once we've done that we need to
go to our settings file in our project
and we're gonna add this to our
installed apps anytime you have a module
that you're building or if you're using
some sort of like built-in Django
module that you're trying to add your
your project you're always gonna put
that in an installed apps so the purpose
behind that is so that these installed
apps can be self containing you want the
installed apps to essentially be able to
work and functioning on their own that
way you don't change one module and all
of a sudden you have broken modules all
over the place the term is called loose
coupling and it's just decoupling the
application or the section of your
application from the rest of the
application but your application can
still communicate with it in things so
that's really the whole purpose behind
like installed apps so anytime we build
a module or anything we're just gonna
add it here and when we go ahead and we
should just have to say you should just
have to add it not sure what we're gonna
call it here in one moment all right so
the module is just called tasty pie
so we're gonna better put that here now
let's go ahead and run sync DB just to
make sure that there's no problems
anytime we add a module sync TB we'll go
ahead and creating sort of database
tables or anything like that that it may
need so if for some reason the module
fails or maybe I need some sort of a
requirement or something that is not
installed then sync TB will fail so
anytime you add something let's go ahead
and just run sync TB and make sure
everything's still cool and clear now as
you can see it is creating tables that
tasty pie requires so now it's installed
and we have no errors so now we have
tasty pie setup now the next thing we're
gonna do here is we want to go ahead and
call the Jing we might be able to do it
wouldn't manage actually we're not to
use the I can't remember if you can do
it with manage that py if you have to
use the Django admin but let me just try
this real quick we're gonna do a pols
application like they do and the we're
just gonna call it pol actually cuz
it'll add the s and and admin let's go
ahead and try to create this yeah that
does work for some reason I was thinking
that my to use the Django admin it's
been a little while but we don't have to
we can just use manage to create our
module now you can see what manage did
we now have a poll and this is gonna be
almost as if it's its standalone
application slash module and we're just
gonna add it to our project so if you go
ahead and look at the files that are
given to you anytime you create a new
app and you can see here that every app
has its own models which is where you're
gonna define your database schema then
you have tests at PI you're really not
gonna do anything with that views that's
where we'll get into views in just a
moment and then one of the things that
we're probably gonna add is its own URL
file that will will include here so
before we go any further I'm gonna go
ahead and just cut this video off here
what
the installation of Django tasty fine
and creating our first app and then in
the next video we'll get into what we're
gonna do to to work with both of these
new new things all right thank you for
