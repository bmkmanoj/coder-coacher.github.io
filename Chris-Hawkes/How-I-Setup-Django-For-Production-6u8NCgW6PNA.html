had some questions in regards to how I
actually host a website and in using
django so i've actually stated this many
times before but I actually use OneNote
as a hosting option so first things
first whenever you're getting started
with actually getting your Django
project in production and this really
doesn't just apply to Django but
probably any sort of staff that you're
trying to run in production you need to
have a hosting company so a hosting
company is who you're gonna pay money to
to actually store your servers unless
you're gonna run it out of your house
which probably isn't a good idea since
you're gonna need solid state drives
you're going to need probably fire
security and all kinds of other stuff to
make sure it doesn't go down on you the
note is actually a very cheap option in
fact I'm gonna put a link to the
affiliate details in windowed that way I
get a free months hosting if you guys go
out and purchase this product so you
know just befor warned I do make money
on that if you do that which I've
actually never had one before so you
would be my first anyway that said you
need to actually have a hosting company
in the note is actually very cheap so
you can do ten or twenty dollars and and
that should be more than enough
resources for most websites that you
have
so here's hipster code calm this is
actually you're looking at a local
version of this thing running but the
actual website is located on the web let
me go ahead and go to it real quick
so here's the website on the world wide
web so I went ahead and I purchased the
domain I always go to godaddy.com to
purchase the domains because it's very
quick for them to actually update all
the DNS records and everything so you
can point the DNS name servers Toula
node and then within like a few hours
your website is up and running once you
have your server set up one thing I do
want to mention is that when you do get
your Linode account set up you're gonna
get a blank server you're gonna have to
actually determine your flavor of Linux
that you want to run so there's like
CentOS and fedora and a bun too and you
just use a bun to 1404 if you don't know
what you're doing and you could probably
use a bun yeah use a bungee 12 1404 but
you can also go to this website here
this guy is a Stanford grad I believe he
he did a pretty awesome job trying to
like show the basic steps of getting the
server provisioned and all that stuff
whenever you get your first Linode
account so it's going to walk you
through installing and python setting up
your sudo user for your linux account
and all this other stuff so definitely
follow this step by step it's gonna be
you know pretty big bitch to get it set
up but once you do you should be good to
go just follow this step by step though
and then and then your node will be
pretty much set up you're still gonna
have to run into the problem with the
actual virtual private host and all that
stuff so with Django I want to mention
let me actually show you guys GoDaddy
real quick too so if you log in to your
GoDaddy account once you set up a
GoDaddy account by your domain name
there's gonna be this name server
settings when you go in to manage it and
you can see hipster code calm and I'm
pointing them to the five Linode name
servers so I'm telling GoDaddy whenever
this domain is requested just forward it
over all the node for handling and then
in Milan node account once I present
provision the server and everything I
need to update the DNS settings inside
one note so inside the Linode panel here
I have all these different domains that
I own and stuff like that but if I were
to add a new all you have to do is go to
say add a new added domains
and then inside here just give your
domain name without the www then you can
give whatever sort of email address you
wanted to show up in case it ever goes
down it'll have your email and stuff on
there so that's that that's all you then
need to do with a note for the moment
the next two things you're going to need
you need FileZilla FileZilla is this
this item right here but you're gonna
want to download if you're on Windows or
it's basically anything other than Linux
because you need to have it's a GUI
system that allows you to be able to
upload files and documents and
directories and all that stuff to your
to your web server so definitely get a
good file zilla's for file transfer you
know I'll try a protocol but you know
download is saying download applying for
Windows or Windows only whatever you
want but then once you have it up you're
gonna see something like this and really
it's just your your files on the left
hand side and you can just and then on
the right hand side is going to be your
server and once you connect it but you
have to give the right host and username
and password on stuff and then you can
connect to it and an upload files
directly to your server next you're
going to need this thing called putty
and putty is if you're using Windows it
allows you to use a Linux command post
to allows you use the Linux command to
actually interface to your your Linux
server so if I log in here then I could
go ahead and log in through putty
and now I'm logged in here so let me
make this bigger could go to change
settings appearance change the fonts
I'll make it really big alright so if I
then go into after if you follow those
those settings are going to end up
having Apache 2 and nginx installed on
your machine I use a combination of
Apache 2 and nginx to handle any sort of
domains setups and everything like that
so basically nginx is used as they were
what's called a reverse proxy so it
listens on port 80 and all requests is
coming to hipster code comm on port 80
but what it does is it sips out any sort
of static content and static content is
JavaScript CSS images and in those basic
files and it will actually render those
because it does a better job of
rendering those faster than Apache and
then it's going to because it's a
reverse proxy it's going to send
anything that's a request for items that
are not matching that description it
will send them directly to Apache to for
further handling so basically Django is
running on Apache but also uses nginx
for static content so if I looked at
putty I can show you that if I go to CD
over an EPC let's just go to nginx first
and I'll say sites available there is a
sites available folder in fact let me go
back one directory if you look at nginx
inside here there's a sites available
right here and then there is a sites
enabled so you really just need a
symbolically linked so you should just
have to go into like one of these sites
available and then if you're adding one
of these domains like so let me show you
if I go into sudo nano hipster code com
you can see this is actually called my
virtual my virtual host so nginx can
handle multiples but you can see it's
listening on port 80 and it shows you
the root directory where some of this
stuff is actually located which is
actually a temporary directory for right
now but then here is the actual reverse
proxy part of this where it's it passes
it to localhost 8080 and that's where
Apache 2 is going to be listening but
you can see I also have SSL enabled for
this site so I show it the syringe and X
can handle as a cell traffic and all
that stuff but that's what this is is a
virtual a virtual host is what it's
called an engine X and also patch 2 is
the same way but that way when you have
a Linode account your only hat you only
have one domain but you can have
multiple sites on that domain by having
mulch multiple virtual hosts inside your
engine X sites available and also Apache
2 sites available so if I go back a
couple directories here I can do the
same thing on Apache 2 and I'll say
sites available and if I look inside
there here's some of these web sites I
own so let's look at sudo nano hipster
code calm down config and then here
there's a lot more that's going on here
but you can see that it listens on port
8080 also it's pointing to the directory
with the actual project resides right
now it's under post and that's because
it's temporary because long story but
basically hipster code was more of an
afterthought compared to something that
I already had running if you're using a
virtual environment and Python and then
your whisky script alias has to actually
point to where the whiskey file is
located
but then this yeah so that's where the
whiskey file is located but then this
daemon process here is actually saying
that you need to give it the Python path
and the path is actually going to be
where your virtual environment installed
so you can see that it goes to Python
3.4 in my environment which is my
virtual environment where this project
is located right now
so that's a relatively complex thing and
then you have this the error log but
really that's essentially it you restart
Apache you restart engine X if
everything goes well then any sort of
request that gets made from GoDaddy
Toula node is going to hit its gonna
look for your your name your your DNS
record for you know when you add that
slave record so it's gonna see oh
hipster code calm it's gonna use Apache
or nginx on port 80 to request hipster
code calm and nginx is gonna find it
because there's a virtual host for
hipster code comm it's gonna handle the
static content it's gonna redirect
everything else to Apache to Apache
choosing be like okay I'll handle it
Apache two needs to know which version
of Python you're using which is like I
said that's because it's a virtual
environment it wanted to point directly
to where the virtual environment was
installed on the file system and then it
also wanted to to know where the whiskey
file is right because whiskey is the
Python protocol of how Python works on
that web so it needed to know where all
that stuff was so guys that's in a
nutshell how everything is set up and
like I said it's a it's a pretty big
pain when you're joining it for you know
for the first time but it's a pretty
ideal way of running a Django website
especially if you're just some you know
typical traffic website where you're
you're maybe get a couple hundred
thousand people a month or so but let me
know if you have any questions I know
that was a lot of information I've had
this request before and I just thought
I'd make a video just kind of giving you
guys an overload overview of how all
this stuff actually does come together
when I host it and in the real world
alright thanks for watching have a good
day please subscribe bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
