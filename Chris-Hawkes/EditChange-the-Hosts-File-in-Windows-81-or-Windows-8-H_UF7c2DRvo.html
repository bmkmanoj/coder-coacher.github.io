going to edit the hosts file to try to
prevent a program from reaching across
the web and trying to either activate
credentials or like you searched for
updates things like that things I can
slow your computer down if you don't
want that activity to take place all you
have to do is just edit your hosts file
to get on Windows 8 or 8.1 just go ahead
and use the windows button and then
press hold down hold it down and then
press f4 find and or you can just like
however in the right corner of your
screen here and click search and search
for notepad and then right click on
notepad and say run as administrator
okay now we're going to go ahead and
open we want to go to the c drive
windows go down the system 32 look for
drivers ET SI change this text over here
to all files and then go ahead and open
the host and then once we do you're
going to see like some commented out
stuff here where you can see the comment
a little pound sign the hash symbol
means that it's just a it's commented
out so it's not actually doing anything
so if you want to add something to the
host file and i'm just scroll down to
the bottom of it and then we can just
like paste whatever so you want to make
sure that this first thing you pace is
your local host address which is 127 dot
0 dot 0 dot 1 and then just make sure
there's at least one space it doesn't
matter how many spaces there are and
then whatever either the domain or this
could be like test com or even something
like this like test your program com
hopefully know is specifically what
domain you're trying to block but it can
be the actual domain name or it could
just be like like I showed you want at
pace they can actually be like an IP
address
so that it would work the same way so
once you've done that you can just go
ahead and just save save the file and
then close it and and that's it it's
effective right away so we need to any
requests made to you know that test calm
or whatever it is you put in there will
only point to your local address so
it'll never reach across the web and try
to validate or whatever all right guys
um thanks for watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
