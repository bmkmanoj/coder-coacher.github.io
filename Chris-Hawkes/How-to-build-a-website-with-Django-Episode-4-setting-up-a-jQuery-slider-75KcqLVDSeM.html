alright so if we want to add some more
cool stuff to our site we need to get it
looking a little prettier what we want
to do is add a slider and let's go ahead
and see what jQuery free sliders are
available I don't know why this thing is
defaulting to free sliders so here's a
website Rhino slider jQuery slider shock
I don't need anything too fancy
it's kind of sweet there
some of these sliders are like way you
know way too much overkill I mean they
definitely can take off some system
resources another thing too is like they
look great when they have the images all
perfectly but like I mean you slap in an
image that doesn't quite fit and it
doesn't look nearly as good I don't know
that I'm looking for something simpler
than this actually let's continue to
look here all right so what I'm gonna do
is actually use this basic jquery slider
just something very basic that's all I'm
looking for it looks like the color
seems will match pretty well so it's
really all I need so I'm gonna go ahead
and download it it when i download it
here I get some I get I get this right
alright so I got this demo CSS images us
view the instructions here you can
download the plug-in directory blah blah
blah plug-in dependencies let's start by
extracting I don't want there J s files
to our folder so I'll just extract the
minimized version and now you just want
to go ahead and find your project and so
see projects you see environment my
project ecstatic see if J assets where
it goes alright so we're gonna send that
there okay send that there let's go back
what is this jQuery secret source I
guess that's the jQuery library we don't
want any of that crap for right now
we'll use their test images so it's just
going to extract those just so that we
can verify that it's working properly so
I'm going to go back to this
send those to my images and then we also
need to use the CSS and we're gonna
extract that over to the last last thing
I'm gonna do see projects my project
static yes extract that all right so
we've done that we need to go ahead and
bring in these plugins into our project
so let's go back to the based on HTML
I'll just go ahead and copy this line
that we have before for our CSS and
we're gonna paste that in here instead
of this we're gonna look for let me
refresh don't remember the name of the
file so it's called bjq s that's yes yes
so PJ Cuba stop CSS and now let's go
ahead and copy the jQuery make sure
jQuery library is actually first in line
second is gonna be this javascript file
that we're gonna be using for the
plug-in so it's just called no I'm gonna
get rid of this want to rename it I'm
gonna rename this I don't care I don't
care about all those many stuff so I'm
just called ejq SJS keep it simple right
so let's go back over here BJ us yes
all right now we've done that before I
even started looking at documentation I
like to just view the source to see how
they implement their own slider which
you can see they're doing this here and
see how this matches up to the
instructions it pretty much
pretty much matches up let's go ahead
and add this below are now inside of our
content and this is really index page
specific so let's go into the index page
and we'll get rid of this this I don't
need this my slideshow crap we'll just
keep slide show you new new Oh class
let's go ahead now at the JavaScript
that we need and we're gonna add the
JavaScript before the body tag at the
end so it just needs to go inside a
script tag and let's copy the JavaScript
needed for this which is right here and
let's go ahead and put that in our
script right here I'm gonna get rid of
jQuery I don't like that I like to just
do the typical dollar sign
all right let's see what kind of results
we're not gonna get much of a result
actually until we try to pull the images
into into the joint so let's do that
let's look at their source you can see
they simply put that right into the UL
class so let's try to do the same thing
see where that gets us
so I put it right into the UL class just
like that and these images aren't gonna
be found all they do exist so what we
need to do is when you use our little
static I'm gonna change image
I am J cuz that's not gonna be finding
anything so images let's see what time
result we have right now
and we got nothing all right so it's a
viewer page source see what's going on
here
all right so Sierra a little slider is
going in there it's click on the image
so the image is being founded so that's
a plus and see if we're getting our CSS
that seems to be found - that's a plus
and that seems to be found - so
obviously the implementation is not
working what the hell is this
I hate bloatware when you try to install
something and then it installs like
other crafty didn't ask for that always
pisses me off going back to this base
file I can see one implementation that
we have right here is we're looking the
default code was banner fade if you look
at our index we actually have slideshow
so go ahead and copy slideshow as our
class name and get rid of this cuz um
this isn't gonna work at all go ahead
and put that in let's see what the
results are results wouldn't work so we
have this being found now the images
aren't being found here which is
probably CSS related inside of the CSS
here so let's go ahead and look
suppose that
all right so I'm looking around here
we're obviously not getting CSS that we
need that's being shown in this goddamn
demo Oh Frick I did not mean to do that
so we're obviously not getting CSS that
we need it might be in this which it
shouldn't be in you know the demo CSS
because that typically means hey this is
if you want to view the demo on this
index.html page that we provided then
you need the CSS to go along with it
because I mean it's finding all the CSS
that seems to be module specific but
obviously it's not working as well as we
would like at the moment I'm gonna see
what we can figure out I'm just gonna
move this over to CSS real quick and
refresh this will pull up the demo dot
CSS and see what we're missing
it looks like this stuff here
seems like all that stuff there needs to
go inside here I would think so let's
just see and what do you know so
obviously I'm not sure what happened
when they were putting this together but
that stuff should not be in the demo CSS
it should be in the actual CSS required
by the module all right so you'll notice
now the next thing we should do is that
we should take this and there's gonna be
the last thing we do in this particular
video I'm going to take the slider I
want to Center it in the middle and if
you've paid attention to how we've done
that in the past we're gonna do it the
exact same way we are going to take the
C so we need to figure out what is the
name of this in fact I want to do
everything in styles which classes so
I'm gonna just get in the habit of doing
that we'll just create a class called
slideshow and I want to copy that we're
gonna take this into our main that's put
this down here and then we're just gonna
say margin:0 auto check out the results
all right so now we have our slider
perfectly centered in the screen and
it's definitely what we want at this
point so I'm gonna go ahead and cut the
video off here we installed a nice
little plugin so that we have this thing
looking halfway decent so far so we'll
just continue to move on in the video
series thank you bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
