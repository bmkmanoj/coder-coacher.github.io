next video and the hipster cocom
beginning javascript tutorial series and
in the last video we looked at four
loops and while loops in this video we
want to look at a raise and why they're
important so arrays are just essentially
their lists of values and the values can
actually consist of different types that
we've looked at before like strings and
numbers they can also consist of a raise
themselves so let's go ahead and say my
array which is just a variable and we
use the square brackets to signify an
array and JavaScript and let's just say
this is going to be a a set of values
which is just going to be a bunch of
strings for name sir john billy so now
this array contains three values so if i
want if i just said let's just say
console dot log my array
and clear this out here
alright so you can see that the the list
is just 33 separate values inside the
array and I could even say console dot
log my array I can do it in the console
you can still get it we can do the same
thing where we looked at like type of my
array you can see it's an object if I
said my array dot proto it comes with
this new symbol and the new symbol is
actually something for a newer standard
for what's considered JavaScript six
point 0 which is the latest version of
JavaScript but you can see it's proto is
an object so it continued you can follow
up that proto chain that we've talked
about in the previous videos but the
array allows for different functions
here so you can see there's a lot of
functions attached to an array in
JavaScript one is the pop and push so if
you're actually adding a value so if I
wanted to add a value to my array then I
could say my array got push and then
we'll just say your mom I need to stop
talking about moms man that might offend
somebody but you can see it's actually
returning the value for because it
pushed in and it returns a value like
you know how many elements are now in
that array and if we do the same thing
so now we have five so you can see it
returns that value that expression does
but this is ultimately a built-in
function that's attached to the array
object in JavaScript it allows us to
insert values now if we were to say pop
it's going to return the last value so
it returns daddy now if we looked at my
array after we do the pop you can see
that Daddy is now not a part of that
array anymore so if i push them back in
and then I look at the array you can see
he's in there
once I pop it's going to take the last
value so that goes by a function that
you are an expression that you hear in
programming which is called lifo and
fifo so first in first out or last in
last out lifo or no last name first out
so this follows the light lifo pattern
so last in first out so I think that
yeah that's right so anyway your pop is
going to take the last value from your
array and those are very silly names
they're used in like pearl and I guess
that goes back to the sea days as well
but I'm just kind of an old-school type
of way of being able to remove values
from a list and add at least I think I
think it just sounds kind of silly for
some reason now one of the things with
arrays which are very interesting is
that they are index based so if I were
to use a square bracket and I actually
say 0 it starts counting at zero like
most programming languages out there the
computer counts 0 as a first number so
in an array it's no different in
JavaScript so this is called an index so
I'm saying hey the index number is 0 and
if I do that it's going to pop or not
pop but it's going to return the first
value in there because it starts
counting at zero if I said my array one
it's going to grab the second one or the
third one is your mom and you can see if
I print the array again it's not
removing them like the pop function did
they're still there it's just that's how
I'm referencing individual elements
inside the array now the reason why
that's important is because we can go
back to our for loop and let's uh let's
do an example of that right now if we go
back to our editor and we do our for
loop we could say for variable x equals
zero semicolon and then we'll say x is
less than my array now there's a
built-in length function on the array
object which will return the actual
length
of the array so let's look at my array
will save length it will return the
value of the the number of how many
elements are in that array so that's how
our for loop can be smart to know okay
this is going to be equal to four and
then we can just say X plus plus and now
we can say alert my array and then we
can use the index so if I were to say
zero it would actually repeat Chris over
and over and over again because it's the
first element in the array so let's look
at what happens here I'll give you the
example so this is going to say Chris
Chris Chris Chris it's going to do it
three times because we said start at
zero and go to the array length and and
actually the array length is just 3 i'm
sorry it's not for because it was only
for inside the console because we were
playing around with it but you can see
there's only three values so it goes
through three times because that's the
length of the array but each time it's
it's just alerting the first value so
it's like hmm how do I actually get it
to alert each value as it's looping
through it well what you would do is
you'd reference this X variable right
there and this X variable changes every
time you're looping through it increases
by one so that's why you're not going to
get Chris over and over and over again
you're actually going to get all the
names so here's Chris John Billy so
you're going to see a lot of that in
your for loops and that's why it's
important for a raise to have that
length feature that way you don't have
to add know in advance how big is that
array you can just use the built-in
length function that is attached to the
array object alright guys so that's what
we're going to wrap up this video series
on our arrays and while we're going to
use them so we saw in this video how we
can insert into a raise grab from how to
index and arrays value by a specific you
know but I specific one by using the
index of our array to just return that
one specific item that we're looking for
and in many different ways you're going
to use
over and over again in the JavaScript
language and even if it's not
immediately clear while you would want
to use that that will eventually become
clear once you start doing more and more
programming and you start getting more
and more of the big picture but it's
definitely something that you will use
so anyway guys thanks for watching this
video please check out hipster cocom for
more tutorials and please subscribe have
a good day bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
