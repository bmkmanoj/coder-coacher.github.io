is going to be a little bit weird and
we're going to be going on a little bit
of a stalking kind of thing just kidding
but the New Boston when I was first
getting my channel started in 2013 the
the influence of actually starting my
youtube channel actually came from the
New Boston and some of his Python stuff
and I really just I liked his speech and
his teaching style especially when I was
first getting started and like nothing
was making sense he had this like you
know down the earth kind of way about
him and I like that and I still do
although you know I have not I can't
like pretend act like I've been like
viewing its content over the years I
just haven't had too much time or really
I wouldn't say didn't eat or anything
but I just I kind of used other avenues
in many cases when I'm trying to learn
new things but his stuff was was always
really good and I guess the question I
posed in this video was like what the
hell happened to him it's been like 10
months and and he hasn't posted anything
but what I find out something crazy
about that is like he kind of stopped
when he hits a million mark like he had
a million subscribers and now he's you
have 600,000 more than that and it's
almost like he just like he just fell
off the face of map so I'm curious like
you know what he's doing you know why he
left I guess in a way just because
although he's much more popular as
obviously as way more views and on stuff
I've always liked like sometimes I kind
of have like this reflective look at
what I do on YouTube and and what I'm
talking like coworkers or friends and
you know most of you know I would say
pretty much everybody
you know there's some naysayers or
whatever but pretty much everybody's
like yeah that's cool you know you do
what you do and and I think in some
cases you know there may be like you
know uh you know wouldn't want to say
like hopefully there's not like people
that are jealous out there or whatever
like I know that that exists to some
extent and because people see oh you're
making
or like a dead mountain is sponsoring
your content like what you know why do
you think you're such a great program or
all this stuff and the interesting thing
there is like I've never claimed to be
but with with a new Boston like he got a
lot of criticism on some of his toils
once you get that big like people are
like well who the hell are you to be
teaching other people and things like
that and the simple fact is like nobody
has to listen to the new Boston and
nobody has to watch Chris Hawkes either
if people choose to do that and you
choose to get things out of it then
that's great but like people have that
freedom of learning from who they want
to learn from I was in college and still
pursuing my business degree when I was
watching the New Boston I was also
successful in living in a decent house
and everything like I had some success
going for me at that time so what I'm
trying to say is I feel like I had
enough know-how and knowledge where I
wasn't going to be like lead blindly
down some dark path that's going to ruin
my career or something like that just
because I watched New Boston videos that
wasn't the case at all in fact it was
enough to like rob Legman Python is
really starting to click I really like
his Python stuff and in like a year or
two later I ended up starting my own
channel and then here Here I am you know
four years down the road but that's so I
had the choice of going to his videos
and watching his stuff and and I wasn't
like expecting to be promised the world
learning like that so basically the
criticism is as what I'm trying
to say because he actually influenced a
lot of people to do a lot of different
things and people are always going to
criticize when people criticize success
they criticize failures and everything
else but my main question with this
video is just simply like where the hell
did he go I wonder if any of you guys
out there because I know you guys have
watched his his series and things like
that I'm just curious if any of you guys
know what made him drop off in that band
well weren't you know in here looking we
can look at pretty much public things to
figure out you know where somebody is
like a something where it's really salt
hearings like that but Bucky is clearly
on github and he's clearly going commits
as of you know even yesterday so so
clearly out and out of passage
when he's working on something but he
just doesn't do the tutorials anymore
but I just find it really interesting
like you know he just kind of rode off
into the sunset for at least the last
ten months and maybe he felt like there
wasn't enough views and things like that
on some of these videos I mean because
I'm sure he's had videos that have had
hundreds of thousands of views and then
here is es6 stuff is pulling in
thirty-two thousand views and I can tell
you firsthand you're not going to make
any real money doing that so yeah I mean
if this is like your primary bread and
butter and like you're expecting like
you probably put into it you know some
decent work on these es6 courses and I
can tell you based on these views here
he's just not making very much on those
you're talking about maybe maybe a
couple dollars a month or something like
that
not that nothing big nothing you could
really really you know rely reliably
depend on or anything so that may be why
he bailed out and I really think that
that it might be now clearly from I like
a large like if you look at his overall
channel I'm sure it's making import of
him money I would say easily more than a
hundred thousand dollars a year but that
is uh it's just interesting like I said
how you know he just he just rode off
but you know I wish them the best just
curious if you guys know what he's doing
and I just thought I'd mention and in
actual videos I'm not sure I've ever
said it in a video but he was really the
primary influence of why I started my
channel back in 2013 our guys thanks for
