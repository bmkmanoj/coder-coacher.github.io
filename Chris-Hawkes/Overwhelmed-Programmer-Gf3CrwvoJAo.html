hey guys what's up so good evening and
I'm I'm back I'm back so I you guys just
saw that that cartoon that I made it was
absolutely terrible I know you guys know
I'm not an artist and I certainly can't
make cartoons man that is there's no
question about that but I do like
messing around with stuff I like to take
a break from programming every now and
then to just play with something else so
when I was working on a game recently i
was using blender and blender is just
such a miserable experience i mean it's
one of those things where it's like it's
it's so damn difficult to jump into
something like blender and then jump in
the photoshop and then back in the butt
like i've used photoshop now for many
years but when i first started using
photoshop i'm like oh this thing is such
a pen and yes but like at least
photoshop there was a lot more benefit
for me to learn photoshop i could use
that i work I could use it for projects
I could use it for you know doing photo
editing for gift cards and things like
that there's so many different purposes
right but with blender you're either
going to use it for modeling or
animation or you're not you know so it's
like I don't have a whole lot of use for
something like blender and blenders
learning curve is so steep for me that I
really just it it's tough to deal with
sometimes it actually brings up a point
that I wanted to talk about in this
video because somebody had left an
awesome comment and they were asking me
like basically how to not get
overwhelmed with in the programming
community and it's from this person it
was called a godless monkey that's
pretty interesting name and they said
was there ever a point when you first
when you were first starting out where
you felt overwhelmed with all the stuff
you felt you needed to learn could you
perhaps make a video talking about that
part of your journey keep up the good
work so I mean to answer that question
you know that it never really goes away
so when I was first starting out
programming I probably went about
everything the hardest way possible i
was i was teaching myself and all kinds
of
different crazy orders and stuff like
that and I wasn't even really focusing
on a tough schedule and and with me I
mean I was working a full-time job I had
a mortgage I had a pretty long commute
back in those days I had two young
children I have a wife and I still have
a wife and then I'm still marry her and
have children obviously nothing's bad
has happened like that but the point I'm
trying to make is that I had all kinds
of you know parental responsibilities
and homeowner responsibilities and
things like that that I was also having
to balance you know as I was trying to
teach myself at a program so yeah
definitely I felt overwhelmed back then
when I was first getting started because
I just didn't really see the progress i
was making especially when I was first
starting out over time though I can say
that the the tasks at hand get much more
complicated so you still feel that
daunting sometimes overwhelming feeling
like oh man I have to learn all this
stuff and it's so difficult but the
stuff that you're then comprehending and
spitting out is actually much more
complicated than anything that you could
have mastered when you were first
starting out so unfortunately that kind
of stuff sticks with you a little bit
but the good news is is that the the
stuff that you will be accomplishing is
just so much greater as you go through
you know the stages of being a
programmer so years will go by and
you'll look back and you'll think man
the stuff I was balancing then there's
nothing compared to what I was balancing
now but you know it's always it's always
something like you're always going to
experience that in some ways now there's
also the other side of the equation that
if you are like do I learn Python do I
learn Java do I learn C sharp and you're
trying to jump back and forth between
all these different languages and you're
not spending enough time and in any
individual one then I would say that you
could easily feel overwhelmed just
recently I've been ranting about the
JavaScript fatigue which is a real thing
because JavaScript has so much so many
different ecosystems and so many
different you know people that tell you
this is the way that you need to write
JavaScript you need to use this language
you need to use this compiler there's so
much argument going on that it's just
like it gets overwhelming and and you
get tired of it because you're like you
know what there's all this stuff and
we're not really getting anywhere so
if you're feeling overwhelmed by because
you're jumping in from one thing to the
next and that's something that you need
to probably you know step back from and
just focus on one thing because that's
going to be the best way to truly expand
your skills and knowledge and everything
that you need but if you're feeling
overwhelmed and because of you know the
JavaScript type thing where you're like
you know jumping around from one
framework to the next we're there each
kind of doing you know the same thing
and you're getting to the same end
result no matter how you go about it
you're just kind of making things harder
for yourself so in both cases you're
making things harder for yourself but in
one case you can you know in both cases
you can just pretty much prevent doing
that just focus on one thing I'm sorry
my voice is still giving in and out in
this cold man so yeah that would be the
best advice I could say is that you know
try if you're jumping around from one
language to the next focus on one
language first if you're just messing
and monkeying around with different
JavaScript libraries and don't mess with
any of that for right now if you can
avoid it a lot of people really will
just drive themselves in circles because
really they want to land their first
corporate gig and things like that and
you know they're spending too much time
jumping from one thing to the next where
you need to just focus on one niche and
get good at that so that way you can
compete in that job market because if
you're to learn in Java 6 months and
then you're jumping over to see sharp or
Python or something like that for six
months you're nowhere near going to be a
senior JavaScript developer senior java
developer and be able to join some large
company you're going to be able to
scratch the surface with a lot of those
languages but you're going to end you
end up running into some major problems
along the way I think and also in this
video super grimy or Grimmie he uh he or
she comments on my channel a lot and I
appreciate that and they have a pretty
perfect comment here I love it so I just
want to repeat it and he responded to
this person and he said just don't jump
around and start and poke at every
single language library in tech
ignorance is bliss I actually kind of
feel more clueless now compared to when
I started programming in the start you
explore the small garden and slowly over
time you realize you live on a huge
planet and of solar system and a galaxy
in a galaxy cluster etc the programming
profession spans a lot of areas
for something you like just learning the
basics preferably in one language so I
mean that's the exact same thing that I
said essentially it's just that if you
jump around you're going to be more
overwhelmed and and it kind of goes back
to what I was saying as far as like you
you start to learn you know the more
complex functionality things you're
starting to comprehend things that you
just weren't able to comprehend before
so you know it's a different set of
challenges and I don't think the feeling
of overwhelming or the overwhelming
feeling actually dissipates i will say
that confidence that the rise is because
each new challenge that you end up
compline along your career path you're
going to be you're going to be more
confident yourself you're like you know
I've done this before I learned the
stuff and you know I'll be able to
persevere and one interesting note to
when I was first starting out um like I
would spend you know weightless nights
like basically i would i would program
it like you know midnight after i've
been working and things like that and on
a weekend and you know i would already
be tired so I have these you know
already already I'm fighting an uphill
battle when I'm learning something
complex like programming and in that
there would be some small spelling error
or like a minor import error or
something like that and I would you know
spend like two hours trying to debug and
search google and then I'd start
doubting what I was doing all together
like maybe I shouldn't be using this
library this framework and you have no
idea what the problem is because you
just don't have enough experience
identify stuff very easily and you know
I would go to bed at times and in many
cases I would wake up the next morning
and realize it was such a simple error
and be able to move on with my way so
you're learning the craft of being able
to step away from the desk to get your
bearings and to recharge your batteries
I've said that all along it's like it's
extremely important and I think a lot of
companies don't respect that because you
know but some companies expect you to be
code monkeys just pumping out algorithms
and code all day long and I think that's
 because you should have time to
be able to group to live your life to to
understand and reason about you know
these things and it kind of goes back to
the whole scott Meyers from the C++
community and the white boarding where
you know the companies that ask you to
solve some you know
tracked algorithm on a whiteboard it's
just unrealistic and if somebody expects
me to do that day in a day I would never
want to work for him and I think this is
the same you know kind of applies to
just you know to being overwhelmed as as
well but during those times like it
would be such a simple error that and
that I wasn't seeing and I would go to
bed and sometimes I'd like I would think
about code in my sleep I would literally
dream about the problems and and
sometimes I'd actually wake up and I'd
be like dude I didn't try it this way or
I'll just try you know these ten steps
over again and it turns out like i was
just doing the steps out of order now
another thing too is I do want to say is
a lot of programmers have a moment of
clarity and mine wasn't really so
precise that like I could say like
overnight like it just clicked but like
I remember my dad who's also a
programmer telling me that when he was
going to school in the 80s to do it like
he just wasn't grasping it but then like
he said it was just like overnight like
it just clicked like he started
understanding how things fit together
and it's the same thing with me like
I've had moments of clarity with you
know like object-oriented programming
which is programming in general with you
know things like CSS relative and
absolute positioning and you know when
you finally figure it out and it just
makes sense you realize it wasn't as
complex as you thought it was but yeah
but these are really you know even
though they're if you boil them down to
their their their finest detail they are
relatively simple concepts the bigger
picture is never an easy thing so even
if somebody says something as easy
people's learning curves and paths are
going to be all different so really guys
that's all I got man and hope you guys
like my cartoon and thanks guys for
watching the channel also i put actually
doesn't matter check out the interview
with out with john sama is that that I
did I would appreciate that it's on his
channel so thank you guys for the
support have a good day bye
if you don't like Python then piss off</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
