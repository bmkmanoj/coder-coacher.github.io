talking about this I know I've talked
about it a lot in the last couple weeks
in fact really for the long as long as
this channels been around talked about
it several times but we've talked about
the degree thing whether or not you need
a degree or read on anything with degree
I didn't actually get a computer science
degree in fact I don't have a degree at
all I am still trying to get a two-year
degree in business administration by
bennaia senior programmer and I've been
doing development enterprise development
for four years and doing self-talk
development for seven or so I guess I
did a study I didn't even do it study
was a shit program that looked at 188
thousand jobs and it was just simply
wrong parsing for certain keywords not
phrases it wasn't smart it took me like
two minutes to learn that two minutes
don't be like an hour to make the
program maybe not even that and then it
took two days to go through and start
looking at all these different jobs oh
that I came back with like five point
four five and a half thousand job
listings I didn't mention a college
degree at all now the thing is is that
in most cases JA companies and
Eli the computer guy talked about this
at length and a lot of people mention
that in the videos that these employers
they ask for the world when they're
asking for positions they're saying you
know we want to see us degree we want
ten years experience on top of that or
you got to have a PhD or no ask for this
or that they want ten years of react
experience even though reacts only been
out for like three years you know so
these people don't even know what they
want they're just asking for the world
it's usually an HR person that's filling
out this form it doesn't even know what
the technology is or anything about it
so all this being said I want to
actually share an interesting link that
that I'm going to post in the
description of this video but apparently
on Stack Overflow they did this huge
polling where in not just the United
States but around the world where it
said that 43% of all the devs polled
actually have a degree so that means the
majority of actual developers in the IT
field are actually self-taught and
here's the here's the big thing guys it
doesn't matter if you went to school or
you didn't go to school being a
programmer and
stay in agent requires that you know how
to learn and you and you get better at
learning and the technology changes with
the wind so we're constantly having to
adapt and learn new things and anything
you learn in ink you know your computer
science courses for the most part
they're doing you know some old-school
job or some basic this or that it's not
telling you how to set up stuff in
docker set up a node.js website or how
to do coherence you know caching on a
django front-end or something like that
it doesn't teach you all this stuff this
is the stuff that you're gonna learn in
the field now that said people have
asked me what is a degree worthless it's
not worthless it's great it's gonna get
your foot in the door because here's the
problem it's not easy getting your first
opportunity you may need to get into a
company and work your way up from a
business side of things and get into
programming or you may need to have a
buddy that can vouch for you or
something you need to you need to
network you might need to do a YouTube
channel or a vlog or something your
blogger or whatever then can showcase
your skills but one of the best places
to go is github so if you can actually
work your way around github you should
eventually be able to make connections
and be like look I can prove myself and
but here's the thing it's also about
easy it takes years worth of experience
you're going to work really really hard
in order for any of your code to even be
sufficient for most of these open-source
projects that are being written by
actual you know real developers have
been doing this for a long time so I
think that's interesting that you know
within the Stack Overflow community
which is the largest probably
programming community I can think of and
they're saying that only 43% actually
have degrees so I can tell you a hundred
percent are all self-taught yourself out
one way or another whether or not you're
going doing and getting an education
somewhere or not a lot of these
companies I hear are just wading through
is literally thousands of applicants you
have people that are doing just web
design and like one guy was talking
about this guy's previous experience was
just looking at a board yet like some
sort of tester if it turned green and
was good at the term ready and I
switched out the board and he was gone
for some sort of advanced like software
engineering position and clearly just
because you're not a switch out of board
doesn't mean anything that you know
about object-oriented programming a
multi-tier development or anything like
I mean that stuff takes a very long time
in order to pick up so having a degree
is going to get your foot in the door
much easier than it would be without the
degree but if I think the key is that if
you can get into your foot into the door
if you can prove you know yourself and
then there's gonna be many ways that you
can do that I would just name the few
you know I think that the degree is not
as isn't as important number one is that
video that I announced cuz really that
video was just simply saying just this
raw first time parsing looking for
keywords and this is what it found and I
think it's relatively accurate and the
fact that a lot of people don't want to
hire people without experience I mean
they either want experience or they want
to degree ultimately they want people
that can do the job so if they find that
it's it's um you know it's gonna be less
risky for them to just hire somebody
with a degree and if that's what their
records are showing if they want to weed
out web designers who know a little bit
about CSS and WordPress from applying to
advance C sharp and Java program or
development jobs I mean you know
that'sthat's gonna be the way it is but
one of the guys mentioned that he's also
he commented on that video or he was
concerned that the video might lead
people down the wrong path or get them
you know get their hopes up or something
like that and then maybe even possibly
get them to give up but if you guys have
me I mean there the video on my channel
is like don't give up you don't give up
I mean you can't give up and anything
you do and anything that is gonna be
worth attaining is going to be hard hard
to attain so otherwise everybody would
do it and it really it boils down the
drive and motivation eventually you'll
get your opportunity I think that comes
to everybody that works hard enough and
I mean that's really a guy so yeah I
think you know the Stack Overflow poll
in my opinion is a much much stronger
opinion on this matter than certainly my
rough around the edges creeping thing
that I did last weekend and also just
what anybody has to say for the most
part so alright guys thanks for watching
have a good day bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
