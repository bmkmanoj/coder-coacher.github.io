video I just want to show you quickly
how to add a path to your environment
variable in Windows 8 and to do that all
you gotta do is just if you're using
Windows 8.1 you have your little icon
down here and just right click on that
and open your command prompt and just to
show you here I'm going to be adding
phantoms javascript to my path and right
now if I if I type phantom JavaScript
that's not going to work so Windows
doesn't know how to handle phantom
javascript so if we add it to the path
it will then be able to handle that so
what you want to do I have two 23h
monitor so the best thing to do is use a
shortcut to open up your charms Mendo
menu which is the windows button plus C
for charms that way you don't drag your
cursor across to 24 inch monitors if you
have a dual monitor setup and in here
you do want to go ahead and go to
settings and in control panel when
you're here click on system and then go
to system again go to advanced system
settings and then environment variables
and go ahead and scroll down on this
bottom system variables box here and
we're going to be looking for path click
Edit and once you have that highlighted
and then now make sure there's no spaces
here and that there's a semicolon after
whatever is on this path so in this case
it's Python scripts and there's a
semicolon so that's exactly the way I
want it to be now let's go ahead and go
C colon forward slash my phantom
JavaScript is on projects and then
phantom instead of phantom Jas folder so
just go ahead and close that off with a
semicolon
and ultimately all you're going is just
putting the path to the folder that
contains whatever sort of executable you
need it to be so if it's Python it would
be your C colon and python whatever
version you have or in my case so I just
see a phantom JavaScript works so if I
go ahead and click ok another short
short I just showed you guys is just
right clicking on the windows button and
doing the command prompt so now if we
type phantom JavaScript the computer
should now know how to handle it so you
see the fan of JavaScript
now executing and the reason why is
because windows search for the path and
said you know fan of JavaScript what is
that so it searches its path and if it
says oh this this executable match is
phantom JavaScript this is a phantom
JavaScript program and it executes
properly so thank you for watching
that's how you add something to your
path</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
