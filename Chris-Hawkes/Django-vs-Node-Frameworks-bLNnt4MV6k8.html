doing a comparison between Django and
nodejs
and the video I did before actually did
it probably earlier last or this year
actually I don't remember when I did it
but I know the video was was absolute
 but this video I'll try to touch on
a little bit more of what I choose
between Django and ojf so number one I
think it needs a little bit more of a
context surrounding like Who am I and
you know what information do I actually
know about this topic so number one I'm
a programmer I've been developing for
about seven years now professionally for
close to five or over for a headed
towards five I've been using Django for
about seven years and then I've been
using nodejs probably for two in
addition on my dotnet c-sharp programmer
so I deal a lot with asp.net webforms
and also MVC net and basically I build
websites I am a web programmer so I'm
not I'm not a games program or anything
like that I'm not some guy who doesn't
know anything about web but I'm also not
a genius when it comes to anything like
you know building frameworks from
scratch or anything like that however I
do have a a node.js framework that I
built and and it's called base IGS which
I ended up making it because I felt like
really I wanted a more django style
templating engine more all-inclusive web
application that was built for single
page apps essentially that was my goal
but I haven't really done anything with
it I created this a few months ago but
there are some examples that I have of
actual websites that are that were set
up on that framework and once again
that's a node.js framework so nodejs I
think we need to properly understand the
term it's not an actual it's not a
programming language it's not even a
framework like something like Django it
is a it's basically a technology set
that uses JavaScript that you can write
web websites and server-side technology
using the JavaScript language but it's
not JavaScript it's actually written in
C and C++ I have videos that talk about
you know what no jeaious really is but
let's talk about you know a full full
framework so let's look at like it's
fresh j/s or
um or a full-stack framework like sails
Jaso sails jess is much more full-stack
very comparable probably to something
like Django and then Python flasks will
be very comparable to something like I
would say like my bass ijs framework or
expressjs something like that so the
problem is though is that I built
websites on both and when I was creating
hipster code comm this is a you know
this is a framework that knot framework
with a website that is using the Django
Python framework so it's all written in
Python Django it uses some of the latest
JavaScript stuff like react and I'm
using babel to compile my JavaScript and
things like that in some of the places
it's overkill but the reason why I
created this site was actually as a
learning opportunity because I was going
to be working with react and I needed to
get you know more involved in and
reacting when I when I wrote this I
actually was using like older react
using es es 5 which is the older
standard of JavaScript and the newest
standard just got finalized last
December none of the browser's support
it yet but they call it es6 so now I'm
in the process of upgrading all that
code that I wrote using react and flux
in es5 and I'm actually making it react
and redux using es6 and it's the crazy
world of javascript but the reason why I
mentioned that and why I actually think
Django is a better opportunity for a lot
of reasons a lot of companies that
actually need working products is
because of the craziness that I've
talked about a lot of the JavaScript
community where you know one one minute
you're using you know gulp and
browserify
as like you know bundling modules and
things like that and next minute you're
using webpack one and then webpack once
a time and the Sun you know lasted four
or five months and now everybody's
turning or transitioning over to the web
pack to and eventually it's gonna be
something else but there's always some
new toy or new feature that we're
talking about in JavaScript now
everybody saying react is too
complicated so let's use V UJS where you
know VJ s is hardly anything more than
what knockout was several years ago so
it's none of this stuff makes any sense
like if it's going to help you I think
you
but if it doesn't then scrap it so if
you're going to build a website and
here's a website like this where I I
have I have the ability to be able to
sign up to the website so I need to be
able to authentication that means user
permissions things like that I wanted
them to be able to register through
social networking sites a lot of people
like to convenience there so I'm dealing
with API so I'm communicating back and
forth with the Google API with Facebook
with Twitter I needed to have HTTPS
enabled so I needed to have a you know a
lot of tutorials and things like that on
how to set up my engine X server this is
using Apache 2 as well as engine X for
static content Jango works flawlessly
under those conditions I think another
issue is uh another thing I was going to
talk about is if I go to actually write
some of these blogs and things like that
you know the simple fact that I'm just
it's a crud application so I'm simply
displaying data from a database so ok do
I need to use MongoDB which most node.js
frameworks are out there trying to get
you to use Mongo Mongo isn't anymore is
it's not faster and it's not more
reliable than either I would say
Postgres or my sequel or sequel server
and you know most these other major
database engines so with this site I
said you know what it's so much easier
Django is built around a relational
database model which is what we've been
using since the 1970s Django is built
for that it's entire authentication
works out of the box if I was going to
use base ijs I'm having to write all
that from scratch or Express j/s I
could use a full stack framework like
sales but once again I'm not a big fan
of either sales or meteor when it comes
to full stack frameworks if you compare
it to Django I think Django is better in
fact I would even say probably MVC
dinette it gets a step ahead of both of
those as well because if I was going to
build a site like that I mean I could
use MVC net or asp.net and I could host
it and Microsoft's cloud or in AWS but
the thing is is like for a simple site
like hipster code I could have written
all this stuff and expressed but the
database issue is something that
typically bites me I'm a more relational
database type of guy
MongoDB is not going to do away with
with relational databases at one point
we thought this whole no sequel model
was going to you know be this this you
know this glory road down to riches and
fame and things like that and and it
turns out that's actually not the case
it's it's going to have its place and
it's not bad it's just that like if it
doesn't help you why do you need it so
in this particular case Django works
with relational databases
Postgres is perfectly free and it works
very very well so here's my Postgres I
can run it locally I have you know Linux
server that's obviously running this
website you guys didn't really know that
but obviously well I'm telling you now
it's Linux Ubuntu 1404 which is running
this website I have another site that
uses Express j/s and it was uh it was
with react and I'm using isomorphic
JavaScript so it's actually the server
is compiling the JavaScript on request
so when the browser sends down the data
it's already rendered so there's no
client-side rendering and what's funny
about that is that we said Oh with
nodejs you can write JavaScript on the
front end and the back end so that way
you can share the same language then all
of a sudden we say oh well in addition
to all that because we want first they
said hey use JavaScript and let's push
some of this functionality that's
typically handled by the server like
page changes a lot of validation things
like that obviously we want to validate
front and back in but you know he's
routing and things like that we were
like you know what it's so much better
to have JavaScript do that because then
javascript is xyd being executed in the
clients browser and then it's not tying
up server resources and things like that
so that was like this big argument for
pushing a lot of these client-side
frameworks that did a lot more
server-side stuff and then all of a
sudden it's like oh well that's bad
experience and we think it's too slow
and that the server now needs to render
all that that we said we wanted to
get rendered on the clients machine but
now we want to do it back on the server
so since we're going it back on the
server you know let's use all these
latest greatest tools like react and
redux on top and then have to do all
this executions on the server to send
down some rendered content which still
needs to be most likely interface
to your website through an API to get
data to post data all this other stuff
once again if it doesn't help you don't
do it and and for me there's no benefit
and all that stuff I have major major
headaches trying to get all that
set up when Django is perfectly fine
this Django stuff is like is simple this
is it guys I mean this is the home page
right here I got tutorials that are sent
down that's how the tutorials are being
displayed I have an index.html I don't
need to have reactant and redox running
this front page there's no reason for it
the data is pulled from the database it
gets displayed you click on something
then you can take the quiz you have to
register I believe so it'll tell you to
log in and then I should have had it
take them back but anyway you go to the
quiz you can actually take the quiz
which then uses the quiz is actually a
little bit more I think involved so
that's why I went ahead and I I wrote
that in JavaScript and using react and
now I'm actually going to be using react
redox but if you have to do a lot of
what websites have to do here I'm
actually interfacing to a credit card
provider so I have to deal with credit
card data that's being you know passed
back and forth unfortunately nobody ever
pays for anything so that's fine they
don't even click on the ads but the you
know the opportunity is there for
anybody that that might you know that
might one day click an ad or something
like that but none of that stuff needs
to be rendered that's another issue like
if I was going to have react render this
entire page now I have to load these
scripts and things like that where
otherwise I could just paste them right
into the template this doesn't need
react and redux it really doesn't now
one thing is it's not always it's not
all pros for django django is slower
than nodejs and it's it's noticeably
slower so the problem is though is that
so many newbie programmers when they're
trying to pick out their next stack
including some hipsters that work for
companies and end up making business
decisions that cost millions of dollars
they they focus so much on oh it's not
you know this is like a slight bit
faster I can do 50,000 requests and you
know point 25
it's faster than Django or some and
you know obviously any speed boosts you
can get is great but Django you know
nodejs is going to be faster so if you
really want to have that fast argument
and talk about benchmarks and stuff like
that yes nodejs is going to win on the
on the flip side to that though I would
say that rarely does anybody ever
experience the situation where they have
to scale to such a massive level and now
with hardware and software you can kind
of you know shard the stuff out over
server farms and you should be okay I
mean for Django somehow it manages to
run Instagram Pinterest and not
Pinterest anymore but still using a
Python stack but Instagram and a few
other major web sites are still running
Django so you know they can scale it to
billions of page views and things a
month but I don't know so I guess the
performance gains that I've seen from
nodejs always end up biting me because
then I have to spend more time actually
writing stuff that just works better
with django django also has much better
documentation it's not so bleeding edge
that they break all the time no Jay
no js' and all the JavaScript frameworks
they are constantly stepping on each
other's toes and they're constantly
breaking each other it is a nightmare of
a headache to deal with some sort of NPM
install that downloads half the Internet
because everybody is linking out to all
these different projects and and then
when you know you accidentally upgrade
that bitch all of a sudden you got all
these problems this it's it's a
nightmare but Django has always had like
the more what I would say traditional
old-school approach to programming that
I saw a lot in the pro community where
it's like you know what we're going to
release a new version of Perl we're
going to release a new version of Django
and we're not going to step all over
everything that everybody's done in the
past this is going to work with
stuff in the past and you know sometimes
it's inevitable that you're going to
have changes that are very very you know
breaking like when Python 2 went to
Python 3 but some of that stuff with
Python 3 could have been thought up
better to say you know do we really need
to change some of this you know basic
syntax to break everything in the past
so I think you know backwards
compatibility it seems like it's
something that has just gone out the
window with with today's hipster startup
you know day and age I think we need to
get back to that because honestly I
talked about
web assembling and web assembly is going
to end up replacing JavaScript because
of a need that needs to be filled and
right now there's a need that need you
know we need some we need some clarity
we need some consolidation of the
JavaScript community because it's an
absolute mess right now
everybody out there who has a github
account is now trying to make a name for
themselves developing some sort of
framework including you know my ass who
built base ijs for no particular reason
I did it as a learning curve but I don't
tell anybody to go out there and use it
I'm not pushing it I'm not even saying
it does anything better than anybody
else I simply use it from my own story
you know side projects because it's a
very basic framework and I know how it
works in the templating engine that I
built into it is very similar to
Django's templating engine but yeah we
have this problem that needs to be fixed
in this and the fix is going to come
through some sort of consolidation so
what I'm saying now is Google Facebook
or Google Microsoft Apple and Mozilla
coming together to work on the web
assembly standards and granted it's
probably not going to replace JavaScript
anytime soon or maybe ever but there
needs to be I think more thought when it
comes to this this cutting-edge stuff
and try to make sure that we're not
breaking everything every time we
upgrade look at angular 2 compared to
angular 1 the angular 2 of the tutorial
I was doing a couple months ago it was
absolutely atrocious I mean I had like
18 plugin files for a simple hello world
application decline how to download like
1.8 5 megabyte of data
I mean why why why are we doing that for
something where Django could have easily
done that even if we just you know stuck
with the basic expression AS with like a
hug template engine you don't need all
this crazy and for that reason I
don't need no js' if I was going to
build a a chat application I would use
node.js probably maybe if I was going to
do any sort of process intensive stuff
so maybe if like you know someone who
fills out information and I start
reaching across the web to to make all
these requests and things like that then
I might end up using node.js for
something like that but if I need a crud
application with user profiles
authentication all
and just basically display and non
display there's no reason why you can't
use Django and really I would choose
Django over Rails at this point even
though there's still more rails
opportunities with rails it seems like
it's dying because ruby has definitely
lost out in the language war with Python
and Ruby on Rails is like the only thing
Ruby does really well in my opinion and
it just seems like you know Python
there's opportunities there and despite
you know besides the web framework in so
if you're not to be a web developer you
can still find opportunities in Python
even though a lot of its data sciences
and things there is still that
opportunity where I don't know that that
exists as much on the Ruby side so
somebody asked me if Django was was
dying and it's absolutely not I think
there's like 2,000 open Django jobs
right now in the United States then just
according to indeed.com
unfilled Django positions I've seen a
few shops like granted you know no jess
is still a very popular option but I
think people are starting to realize
that no js' isn't some sort of end-all
be-all solution I mean look at
walmart.com which is written in nodejs
it's one of the biggest piece of
websites I've ever seen in my life and I
know it was hard work and developers are
probably completely inundated with the
amount of you know effort that goes into
something a billion dollar company like
Walmart but that site is terrible it
barely works and I think you know some
of this stuff that I've noticed is
because of all the JavaScript problems
so you know leave it to JavaScript to
actually complicate something like an
input box where all of a sudden you
start typing an input and you have all
these cascading errors because of all
this crazy that you got going on on
the client and it's just you know it's
but what it works it does work well like
it like people point out Netflix is
written a note and Netflix is very very
good I think those developers are pretty
good but Netflix is business model is
not nearly as complicated as like a
financial industry or an insurance
industry or even you know something like
e-commerce like Walmart it's just not
the same level of complexity they're
displaying and streaming movies compared
to something that literally is dealing
with taxes and shipping and wrote you
know I mean there's like that I think
that they're obviously that Netflix is
doing some of that stuff too because
they
shipped DVDs I believe I haven't used
that in five or six years I don't think
but anyway I don't want to downplay
their complexity but I have a feeling my
opinion just uneducated opinion on it is
that Walmart has a much more complicated
business model than than Netflix so
maybe you know the Netflix made the
right decision using node but I feel
like you know two of the sites that I
hate the most
just with whole user interface layout
and everything is Walmart comm and
LinkedIn and both of them are written in
node and both of them I think are
shining examples of oh you know
overarching complexity that sometimes
JavaScript brings into the equation
where if you do a little bit of both I'm
of the opinion that you don't need a
single page application you could have a
traditional MVC app that has certain
endpoints that are then displaying
single page apps within that endpoint
you don't need your entire effing site
to be a single page app why not have
like a hybrid of both I mean that's that
to me that's it the way that it makes
sense I mean I can have one endpoint you
have a forward slash quiz that then
behaves as a single page app for all
this quiz based stuff but then I don't
have to deal with you know all the
analytics requirements and the back page
and all this stuff that you know people
try to you know downplay and say it's
not complex but when you start getting
hundreds of thousands of lines of code
and JavaScript being injected all over
the place and all of a sudden because of
some tiny Java Script there all of a
sudden your analytics are broken you're
back paging functionality is broken your
links to your third-party ads that
nobody ever clicks on are broken you
know all that you know just if you
don't need it don't use it it's all I'm
saying and for God's sake stop using ad
blocker because everybody uses a blocker
these days all right thanks man take
care guys make sure you subscribe to the
channel if you're not already subscribed
if you are thank you I'm about to
approach 40,000 subscribers I think
that's great very thankful for that and
still surprised by it but you guys are
great thank you bye hey guys so a lot of
you asked me how do I get my foot in the
door to become a programmer
I just want to take a moment to mention
dev mountain coding bootcamp is a
12-week intensive course that focuses on
the technologies of the here-and-now for
web development some of the things that
they're actually teaching in this
12-week course it's geared to get you
into the industry by focusing on things
like jQuery nodejs
react angular how to use github so a lot
of the things that you're going to need
to do as a developer as soon as you
start they're going to be teaching you
in this and this coding bootcamp and the
entire goal is to be able to get you
into the industry within 12 weeks so if
you guys are interested in learning more
information about dev mountain coding
bootcamp just check out the link in the
description tab of this video thank you
for watching and have a good day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
