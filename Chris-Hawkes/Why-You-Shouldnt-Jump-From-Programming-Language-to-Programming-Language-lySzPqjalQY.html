from a listener or viewer whatever you
want to call them and he was asking me
how many languages do I program in and I
actually get that question all the time
I've had it probably at least 25 times I
would say over the last couple months
and one of the things I do notice from
the comments and not just on my videos
but other people's videos as well is
that a lot of new beat programmers and
when you're just getting involved you
start looking into like a programming
book and you learn some of the basics if
we're talking about Python you're
learning about dictionaries arrays and
how to import libraries and things like
that and ultimately if you go through
like an entire book like you're learning
you know quite a bit but then you end up
jumping on to like the next language
it's like okay so now I've learned
Python let me go ahead and learn
JavaScript well I mean really
programming is not like that
you can't just master a language without
using it a lot and when I want to talk
about a lot like I don't even know that
you could program in a language for six
months and really be considered like
even proficient in it I mean even a
language like Python which is a lot
easier than some of the larger
frameworks like the dotnet framework
with c-sharp the Python language I mean
it's it's very complex I mean it has its
own complexities and the thing is is you
don't really master a language without
using it probably for you know years
really I mean sometimes even decades I
mean some of the brightest people that
I've worked with and I'm not talking
about just naturally smart and gifted
because I've worked with people that are
like really smart and and definitely
have you know better you know logical
minds than my own and and and better at
mathematics and things like that and you
know some of those guys you know even
those guys I mean you that you have to
be in this industry for a long time and
you have to have made a lot of mistakes
and have seen a lot of failed
architectures to kind of know how to
design your own you know it's you're not
going to just learn that from a book
you're going to
learn that through years of experience
for the most part so I guess my point is
that I wouldn't be too quick to try to
jump from one language to the next
without spending a lot of time in that
one language especially if you're just
getting started if you're just getting
your feet wet and programming you know
stick go if you're gonna choose Python
stick with Python if you're gonna go
Java stick with Java C sharp or whatever
it is unless you get a job where you're
doing something else you know then you
probably should just stick to that one
language because at the very least if
you do end up transitioning down the
road you're gonna have a greater
mentality to be able to transition over
to that new language but if you keep
like scratching the surface with one new
language after another you're never
going to be you know the the Software
Architect that you hope that you that
you'll be the guy that you know can land
the job at Facebook or Google or
something like that I mean people are
naturally gifted some people are and and
then some people just through hard work
and dedication I consider myself in that
category can learn how to do complicated
things through repetition and and like I
said just you know straight
determination and programming I would
say even for those gifted like I said
they don't just magically learn how to
design database architectures and and
you know these these multi tier
architectures that are used by
enterprise level programmers or
enterprise you know program programming
shops that stuff just comes from
experience so I get the question how
many languages do I do I actually know
and I would answer that even though I
programmed in Perl and PHP and Java I've
done some even Android stuff with the
Android SDK and like I've done all these
I could go on and list a ton of
different technologies that I've used
and even have sometimes created
applications I have created an Android
app one time do I consider myself an
Android programmer not at all like I am
NOT an Android programmer I don't like
Java very much and I don't like the
Android SDK I feel like it's a miserable
experience trying to build Android apps
with the you know the whole XML like UI
side of it and you know using eclipse as
the editor and that that virtual
emulator that takes
fifteen minutes to load up like it is
just a terrible experience my point is
that I consider myself a programmer in
c-sharp because that's what I use at my
day job JavaScript because also that's
what I use in my day job and I've been
using that for probably longer than all
the other languages and then also Python
because that's what I use as a hobby I
like Python a lot and I use those on a
daily basis so I would consider myself a
pretty decent programmer in any one of
those however if I consider myself like
a really good c-sharp programmer I
probably don't I'm considered proficient
like I mean I've even done tests and
things through like Red Hat and
apparently I'm supposed to be a
proficient c-sharp programmer but I
don't even feel like it I mean most of
the time I try to stick to the UI I like
JavaScript I like doing things and node
and that's another thing like no it's
not even programming languages so it's a
library really it so it has a JavaScript
API but I like JavaScript stuff I like
you know these these frameworks and
everything and um and and I've been
programming out for a year so I guess
the thing is is like you don't want to
jump from one thing to the next not too
quickly anyway you're not going to be
hurting yourself by spending some time
in one particular language that you
choose whether it's Python or PHP or
whatever you want to use and then start
making mistakes and that stuff start
writing some bad code start you know
learning you should be looking at your
code after like a month and looking back
and being like oh you know I just feel
I'm better and look at some of that
stuff I was writing back then and I
don't even know what I was writing and I
mean all that stuff is just natural so I
would just I would caution trying to
jump from one language to the next when
you're just getting started I did that
myself and I don't think it did any
justice for me because even my my
expertise in Python to date I don't even
consider myself like a real solid Python
developer I mean I've I've only built a
few Django projects and just recently I
can't read contributed to another Django
project on github which was the
relatively basic thing but I mean
there's some Python programmers out
there like it and if you're going to a
Python shop you know they want a senior
Python program
that's been doing things for like at
least five years so that means you've
been in Python for like five years and
the reason why they want so much
experience is because a lot of being a
good programmer comes from like I said
that experience of writing bad and
failed software you learn a lot through
that process so that's basically it for
this video guys those are the languages
that I that I use on a daily basis the
thing is is programming is also more
about languages too so I should mention
that most of my struggles and most of my
like you know my head scratching that I
do during the day is because I'm
actually using stuff that just isn't
working right whether it's like Team
Foundation server for like repo code
repositories looking up documentation on
things like github for even how to use
stuff like github like pull requests and
all that stuff like you have to learn
processes like that
there is uh things called test-driven
development where literally your your
code is a hundred percent unit tested so
you have unit testing libraries there's
libraries that exist in JavaScript
called Jasmine that help you test your
JavaScript code there's libraries like
moq and c-sharp that allows you to
isolate dependencies and that that comes
with like a whole different mindset from
you know from a programming perspective
when you look at like test-driven
development some of the other things
like you know JavaScript libraries like
you spend a lot of time being a jQuery
guy it doesn't mean you're a jQuery
programmer means you know jQuery jQuery
is a library that is just JavaScript
code but it simplifies JavaScript a
great deal but it still has its own
semantics and syntax that you have to
learn just like any other other like
language so it would take literally
hours probably to name off all the
technologies that I've played in or
played with and that's not even to
mention like databases and things like
that like you can see in here like I was
I Postgres right I'm creating a website
right now we're like I had over 8
million records in the database on
Postgres and Django was struggling with
it
and I really had nothing to do with
Django is it was the development server
and and and you know having a having the
query eight million records which isn't
even that much I mean a relational
database should be able to handle that
but my whole point is that like I'm
looking up like documentation like okay
is my problem with Django is it with
Postgres is it just because I'm running
the development server is it you know
those are the types of things that you
end up dealing with as a program or
where it so I got some Postgres
experience but I'm not a post whereas
God because if I was I mean I'd have to
be involved in that database for like
five years I just recently started
scratching the surface with it and moved
away from my sequel which I use for a
long time and do I even consider myself
with my sequel guide now I've been I
have development projects that use the
my sequel database and that you know
I've used that for five years now and I
can get I can work my way around it but
would I consider myself some sort of
proficient my sequel guy definitely not
and that's because I you know I I
bounced from one thing the next because
I like it for what I was trying to do
like I wasn't paid to learn my sequel
but if you wanted to be a my sequel DBA
you better learn the ups and downs to
that thing and and build some projects
in it and then you can be you know that
guy or that girl that works for the
company and has the answers to all the
system problems and get paid a lot of
money but anyway that's that's just what
I want to say I see that a lot you guys
will post and jump from one thing to the
next and I've done the same thing and I
just don't know that it helps I actually
don't think it does
so I'd spend more time with the
academics in one particular language I
start building some websites or some
software applications or just do
something maybe maybe make an
open-source project on github or
something with that with that you know
that language that you've learned or at
least contribute to others so that way
at the very least you can see some of
the complicated code that is being
written even by some of you know the
simpler languages and yeah so good luck
guys umm yeah I know it's it's a
struggle every day and everybody is uh
you know excited to try to jump from one
thing to the next everybody wants to be
the next Google engineer or start the
next Google and stuff like that but you
got to take steps you know at a time you
can't you can't
run before you can learn how to crawl
and walk alright guys thanks for
watching have a good night and bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
