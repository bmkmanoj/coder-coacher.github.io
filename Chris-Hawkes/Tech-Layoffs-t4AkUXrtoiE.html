talking about tech layoffs and it's not
something that's unique to the tech
industry all kinds of industries have
faced layoffs now with tech layoffs the
reason why I'm mentioning it today is
that in 2017 we've already seen quite a
few different companies announced some
pretty large layoffs one of the
companies that keeps continuing to lay
off employees because they can't find
any sort of profitability and it's one
of the most surprising as twitter
twitter has been in existence now for
quite some time and believe what
2008-2009 come around that maybe longer
and in that time they've never earned a
profit in fact all they do is just lose
lose massive amounts of money so in
order to you know reduce the amount of
money they lose they end up reducing a
ton of their staff so that's what
they've done time and time again because
they're having a very hard time finding
any sort of profitability model and at
this point a lot of people just kind of
speculate the Twitter's just looking for
somebody to buy them out somebody that's
willing to take on that kind of a loss I
mean I'm really the only company is
capable of something like that or
companies like probably you know
Microsoft or Google or one of these
humongous players but so far nobody's
bought Twitter I guess they're you know
they're it's like a race to see we're
really not a race just kind of a game of
sitting back and seeing how far quitter
will go but eventually people are saying
that if they can't find a suitor that
they could end up closing their doors
now Twitter they own vine and just
earlier this month they did shut down
vine completely so were there there were
some layoffs with the associates that
were maintaining the blind website which
was all about you know taking me Twitter
models like 140 characters and applying
it to video so you have like six second
loop videos that just loop over and over
again I looking at it from afar I've
never used vine seen a few vines every
once in a while some of them were funny
but to me like when I look at a business
model like that I you know I immediately
think well you know it doesn't really
surprise me that something like that
goes out of business for the longest
time I was telling you that medium was
was overvalued so medium.com is
basically it's an overhyped vlog it came
from the same
creators of Twitter you know they use
this you know this is what they call a
clean look and appeal but you know I've
already said before I showed you how to
use quill jus to actually create a very
similar blogging type of you know
experience that medium offers and if you
were to use your own stock whether it's
like you know some sort of PHP or Python
or Ruby or C sharp or Java it doesn't
matter what you use if you use the same
type of thing like a closed we ask you
basically have everything that medium
provides except you have all these
benefits of not being told by a
particular company hey we own your
content or that we could just turn
things off when we go out of business or
you can only advertise in this
particular way and things like that so
it's like why would you want to deal
with all that and immediately that's
what jumped out at me with a product
like medium I just basically said well
that's really overhyped I don't know why
they would you know pump hundreds of
millions of dollars of venture capital
funding into another project and as far
as I can tell doesn't make any money and
the thing about medium is that it tries
to make money on ads so at least you
know it has some sort of plan to try to
make money but it can't even make enough
money to pay its bills on ads for
content provided by other people you
know to meet so everybody that's using
medium is blogging about this that and
everything under the Sun and medium can
capitalize off of all of that blogging
and then show ads on it and do you add
sharing revenue models with their
creators and things like that but
they're not even producing that content
to drive the add add you know add funds
so it's very interesting to me that if a
company like medium can't can't find
profitability on ads on other people's
content like how the hell can a website
pay for people to produce content and
make money on ads and clearly they can't
we've seen it with like New York Times
and Washington Post and all kinds of
different website publications that are
in the news industry they're just not
making money they're not making money
selling newspapers anymore and they're
not being able to find a way to make
money online so there are now paid to
read publications like I know well
Street Journal was doing that even my
local city that I live in is now trying
to make you pay to referent or to access
the news website at least on the mobile
phone so they'll give you like 10 free
articles and then they want you to pay
but you know they want to appear like
seven dollars a week and I just don't
care that much about my local news to
pay seven dollars a week to be honest
it's too much another company that just
can't seem to find any sort of
profitability is Pandora I mean Pandora
their entire business model is about you
know paying royalties to all these
different music companies and things
like that that they have to you know to
pay for the rights to stream music and
the thing about pandora is that to me
you know it's you have you has a pan
doorway where you do get the ads and
everything every once a while but they
play the same old songs it seems like
all the time so like for me I'm much
better off going to youtube and
listening to music than I am ever going
to pandora so whenever I listen to music
it's always on youtube if I'm you know
in front of a desktop and i'm doing a
browser try saying because to me i just
i don't find any sort of value in
pandora because i can't really skip i
can always give a certain amount of
songs because I understand Pandora's
paying for them but it's the same old
crap like I said they generate the same
old songs because they're trying to do
whatever they can to basically give you
what you want to hear so that you don't
they don't have to pay for songs that
you didn't want to hear now on the
contrary a company like Spotify i
downloaded their app not that long ago
and i was in the car and like they were
playing 30-second commercial roles like
every single song and sometimes like the
song wouldn't play I'd refresh enough to
hear the freaking commercial again and
it like in literally after like ten
minutes of that I said all right to hell
with this app and I uninstalled Spotify
and I haven't used it to this day
because I understand Spotify is doing
what they have to do to try to find
profitability but the entire experience
was terrible so it's like you might as
well just pay for something like that if
you really want it but for me I just
don't I can all buys the music that I
like on iTunes I'll listen to it on
youtube to see if I even liked it and
I'll buy it on iTunes
then I have it on my ipod so I haven't
whatever I want you know like I can just
listen I mean so to me that's more to me
it's just it's just better for me it's
better suited so we'll see where that
goes but pandora is another companies i
just recently laid off seven percent of
their workforce and they continue to lay
people off throughout the years another
major company to announced layoffs today
and the estimated reports are anywhere
from six to ten percent of its workforce
is scripted sip it has been kind of a
darling of the check and the street it
seems like over the last couple of years
everybody's talking about it companies
and human resources departments are now
like paying for employees to have
fitbit's to try to keep them healthy
because it reduces their their company's
health insurance costs or sister
associates are healthy but the problem
was Fitbit and always goes back and I'm
talk to people that I've owned them I've
read the reviews online they're the
quality of the product itself like they
are they fall apart I mean two of them
to people I worked with during a
Christmas break there though we had a
Christmas luncheon thing of my my work
and they were showing me the Fitbit and
they both of them had the actual little
rubbery outer outer thingy around the
bracelet part was like falling off and
he was saying that he had already had to
replace it several times and he doesn't
even take it into the shower with them
and stuff like that so I guess a lot of
people are wearing these things like you
know day in and day out a lot of them
are healthy so they're probably pretty
active with them getting them sweaty and
dirty and things like that but they fall
apart they fall apart all the time and
that seems really like a consistent
problem with Fitbit at the moment that
they just need some better more durable
quality the day today announced 10 like
I said six to ten percent based on the
early reports of how many people are
being laid off in that company so that's
really enough about talking about all
these different companies because this
isn't like a news channel or anything
where we talk about companies that are
laying people off the reason why I
really want to bring it up is that one
of the biggest things to me when it
comes to determining whether or not I
want to work at a places is how stable
they are like I don't have a lot of
ambition to try to start or work on a
startup that you know that could go out
of business next week like a lot of
those you know these venture capital
funded startups I mean that is a very
questionable biz
models and and they're trying all these
different things and the venture
capitalists will fork over a few million
because it's nothing to them and they
hope for that one that really takes off
and turns into like a Facebook and
rhythm returns them 500 to a billion
dollars or whatever but for the most
part that never really happens and you
know and then they can still make their
money back over all kinds of different
ways including when the company is not
profitable like I mean some of the early
and investors in Twitter and Pandora and
things like that those guys have made
their money back already but it's
usually eventually becomes the
stockholders and are there the common
shareholders and the employees that end
up holding the bag at the end once once
you know it's fully realized that the
business model just isn't going to work
it's not going to make the money than
everybody anticipated so the reason why
some of this stuff though is good news
for a lot of tech guys like people that
try to bootstrap your own startup
operation is that if you can find
profitability and whatever you do you
already have like a step up on some of
these you know these tech entrepreneurs
that graduate from school and then
immediately start a business the there's
plenty of bootstrapped operations that
exist out there a lot of people are just
simply providing services you know
database conversion things like that
some people are creating websites for
people are hosting there's always going
to be a market and that as technologies
change annuities smaller business could
always use an updated IT operations you
know even expertise of of trying to help
people with larger software-as-a-service
platforms like salesforce and things
like that so the markets always change
and and we just have to change along
with them and also you know whatever you
do work for coming and you you might
have a layoff depending you should
always be boring it you know it's not
really worrying but you should always be
planning some sort of alternative plan
of action there should always you should
never put all your eggs in one basket so
what I mean by that is go out you know
learn all the different technologies
that you can you know focus on what your
company needs you to know obviously
number one first and foremost so you can
keep your you know your job but you
always want to play around with new
technologies you want to stay hungry for
that new knowledge and to stay up to
date because you do not want to become
dated in this industry in the tech world
you could lose your job at any time I
mean you can lose it for so many
different reasons and we've seen in the
tech as far as you know this video is
concerned a lot of this stuff you know
did the employees you know there's not
much they could have done to change the
outcome it's just it is what it is and
markets change and consumer industries
dry up and economy sometimes grow and
retract and and there's all these
there's all these different things so
you want to make sure that your skills
are relevant for that next gig no matter
what you're doing so make sure you guys
stay competitive all right really that's
it so thanks for watching you guys have
