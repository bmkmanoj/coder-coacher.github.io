going to be talking to you about how you
can actually learn the code without
going to college and that's one of those
things where it's like a lot of people
tell you you have to go to college and I
never went to school and everyone's
school variety and I'm a professional
developer I'm an professional developer
now for many years one of the things
that pisses me off a lot is that there's
a lot of people out there that are
claiming to be programmers and are not
really programmers and I don't
necessarily have a problem with somebody
considering themselves a programmer even
if they don't get paid to be one like if
they're a dreamer like me then it's fine
as far as like you know considering
yourself a programmer as long as you're
actually really programming and making
things as opposed to like creating
YouTube videos and talking about how
you're a programmer but you don't really
do it in real life and what I mean by
that guys I know that sounds like an
asshole movies like you either have
stuff on the github or you have stuff on
like overflow or you have like websites
you've created some sort of code base
maybe a company to give work for that
you've actually done coding and if you
haven't done any of that stuff you've
only been learning how to be a
programmer for a couple of months and
you're full of shit you know basically
so the thing is like none of us have all
these answers but I'm going to tell you
something that a lot of people won't
tell you on YouTube and that is that you
don't have to go to code Academy
Pluralsight or any of those other places
to learn how to become a programmer in
fact when I was learning to become a
programmer I didn't go to any of that
shit like I used the new Boston only
after I've been developing for quite
some time like literally years and
before I even checked out his beginning
Python stuff I really liked his style of
teaching but literally I watched his
videos for about a weekend and then I
decided to create my own channel over
four years ago
and and I do credit you know his his
tutorials and everything for trying to
motivate me to create my own tutorials
and everything like that but I did that
because I was also trying to teach
myself and the thing is that that's what
you have to do you have to build shit in
order to learn and what you know code
Academy or treehouse or whatever all of
that other explore the weak bullshit
that's cropping up everywhere just
trying to tell you yeah go to this
tutorial go to that tutorial I'm like
yeah you can get some warm and fuzzies
about watching some tutorial man but
you're not going to learn based on
somebody's tutorial I'm sorry to tell
you that look at my beginning pythons
to one and this coming from a guy who
just created this in September 141,000
view is 1297 out votes a lot of people
like this this beginner course they you
know they like it but what I'm telling
you is that you're not supposed to just
start here and then just end like you're
not going to learn from this series
syntax doesn't make you a programmer two
months doesn't make you a programmer
three years I didn't know shit like when
I started my first corporate gig I
didn't know anything and I had been
building projects for three years so
anybody that tells you hey I took a
Coursera course and I'm a programmer I
can give you all kinds of advice you
know they are completely full of shit so
guys if somebody has a YouTube channel
and they don't even use their real name
and you don't know what their
credentials are like whether or not
they've worked at a real company you
know take that their advice with a grain
of salt like really because you're
you're only going to be hurting yourself
nobody's going to hire you with you know
two months of experience anywhere now
the coding boot camps like for instance
Deb mountain coding boot camp my sponsor
there's a difference between a coding
boot camp and like an actual course on
tree house or something like that I even
created my own elearning platform and
I'm not I'm going to mention the name
because it's not about what I created
but what I'm trying to say is that
anybody can create a course and try to
teach you how to become a programmer
including people that aren't even
programmers themselves so the difference
between something like that mountain is
that leash you're going to be working
with other developers and it's like a
code intensive thing it takes you know
12 to 16 weeks of intensive coding where
you're actually working hands-on with
other programmers that's different then
watching Chris Hawkes is YouTube
tutorial series on Python so like one of
the things that people don't really want
you to know is that like none of their
tutorials will teach you how to become a
programmer whether it's Pluralsight or
anything else
what Pluralsight is great for in my
opinion like you look at quarry house
and as react series and things like that
like if you are a programmer an
established programmer you're getting
involved in and react like you can you
can learn a lot of like good like tricks
of the trade and everything when you
know how to set up and deal with some of
these languages but if you're learning
react for the first time then why over
complicate anything go to reiax website
and they have everything you need to get
started with you don't have to pay for
anything from Pluralsight or tree house
or go to anybody's tutorial series
including my own you start with the
information from the project itself
which is going to be it's going to be
self-sufficient enough to teach
beginners how to code using react now
react is overkill so I would never
suggest if you're just getting started
learning how to code that you use react
like you don't want to do that you want
to go with something like Python but how
do you learn Python well you can go out
and buy a book because honestly that's
what I did I learned based off of Python
books that exist in inside book stores
in fact I was buying computer books from
borders when I was still in business but
I loved having an actual physical book
like I even showed you guys like some of
the books I have learning Perl I have I
have an entire bookcase I should
probably turn it this is a great book
for Python you don't need anybody's
bullshit tutorial courses or anything
like that you can use them to your
advantage nope no doubt but the way
you're going to learn especially without
a degree and the only way it's ever
going to work is that you have to have
to solve a problem because you're going
to build something so how do you build
anything like syntax like I said does
not make you a programmer so you have to
find out what am I trying to build for
me when I was getting started I was very
into data scraping I wanted to grab data
on movies on rock music bands and things
like that I was trying to grab data
online so how do I get involved in that
well Perl was a great text crunching
language that mainly was designed for
initially but then I found that you know
Python was a lot easier but my Python I
was creating box that were just scanning
the web following links so they were
spidering just like Google did when they
were getting started granted not nearly
as sophisticated on my end but still I
was solving a problem and I was learning
a ton by solving that problem once I
started having the data I learned like I
said out how to store data and text
files how to read from those text files
how to just you know extract data like
that you know little keywords and things
I was looking for inside of the text and
by doing that I was learning so much and
then eventually I had another problem to
solve I needed to create a website based
off of all that data that I was
collecting so I ended up using things
like
Gengo so I moved on to the Django
framework but how do you learn how to be
a a Django developer you could watch my
Django series in fact I've had hundreds
of thousands of views on my Django
series which has actually made me a
decent amount of money but I'm telling
you first hand you're better off going
to the Django documentation because this
is going to be more up to date and it's
from the actual people that wrote the
fucking project instead of people that
just claim to know what they're talking
about the next thing like if you're
going to learn Java or JavaScript I'm
sorry there is no better place than
Mozilla developer Network Mozilla has
been on there they've been on the
leading edge of JavaScript development
for a very long time their documentation
is superb but once again if you're not
solving a web based browsers practice
situation if you're not creating a web
app in general then JavaScript is not
something you want to look at so do you
need any of those other Pluralsight code
Academy any asshole who has a YouTube
channel that's been around for two
months you don't need any of that that
is the truth go to the actual official
documentation first if you do like
watching the tutorial videos that's fine
but if you're not building things guys
it's really not going to get your foot
into the door in the industry you need
to actually build stuff and so you need
to have a problem to solve and then you
use the best tool to solve that problem
other than that man there's root there's
really nothing else that there's nothing
else that you need to know just that's
what I did and eventually you're going
to know enough to want to be hired by
enterprise level companies that are
building very very complex applications
that you know granting you've been doing
now for several years but are you going
to learn how to become a programmer
after two months hell no then there's no
way not possible so another thing to
have another site sponsor which is site
one two three make sure you guys check
them out as well so one of the things
that can help you as a developer
especially when you try to establish
your reputation online start with a
portfolio site if you don't know how to
build your own stock go to site one two
three set up a profile say my name is
Chris Hawkes I'm a programmer obviously
use a real name and then put some some
pictures of some code that you've done
especially like talk about what you're
into whether it's UI data
punching machine learning robotics like
whatever it is that is your passion
gaming start putting it out there
because you really need to have online
credentials in this day and age because
you clearly don't have the experience of
an actual company that you're working
for and if you're not actually building
stuff yet then it's difficult to have
any sort of credentials whatsoever but
what I'm telling you guys is 100% legit
from a programmer who's been in this
industry for a long time nobody's going
to hire you without doing some of these
things so that's that's the truth
all right guys take care bye hey guys so
a lot of you asked me how do I get my
foot in the door to become a programmer
and I just want to take a moment to
mention dev Mountain coding boot camp is
a 12-week intensive course that focuses
on the technologies of the here-and-now
for web development some of the things
that are actually teaching in the
12-week course is geared to get you into
the industry by focusing on things like
jQuery nodejs react angular how to use
github so a lot of the things that
you're going to need to do as a
developer as soon as you start they're
going to be teaching you in this and
this coding boot camp in the entire goal
is to be able to get you into the
industry within 12 weeks so if you guys
are interested in learning more

boot camp just check out the link in the
