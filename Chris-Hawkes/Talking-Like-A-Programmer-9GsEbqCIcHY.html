have a question from a viewer who asks
how to get better with programming
terminology that you're gonna run into
in our field and and we deal with so
many different terms that just like
things that like you know what their
meanings are but from a computer science
perspective like you may not especially
for people that are just getting in like
I mean you're gonna learn terms like
explicit versus implicit and you're
gonna be like what the hell does that
mean and many cases I'm sure a lot of
you guys brought at least I was so what
kind of buzzwords am I talking about and
programming terms I mean there's gonna
be things that come along every so often
like you're gonna hear about web 3.0 web
2.0 like we used to hear about web 2.0
you don't hear about him when I would
call it 3.0 in 4.0 so one of the
examples I can give it is if you go to
pythons web site which is one of the
easiest programming languages even in
the examples here like they're using
like functions defines here like what
you know what is a function if you're
brand new to programming and it's
talking about Python allows mandatory or
optional arguments so arguments keyword
arguments and arbitrary argument and
lists and like so you're looking at all
these different terms just in that one
little paragraph and that's just
programming in a nutshell and in no
matter what you're always gonna have
that that learning curve so if you could
just kind of get past that and
understand these terms and everything
will make more sense as you do it and a
lot of these terms actually are shared
across programming languages in
libraries and things like that so it's
not like you have to relearn words like
every few months or something like that
so all of these terms and everything
they're gonna come with time and there's
really no way around that you could take
due diligence to every time you come
across the term look it up but
eventually you're gonna be spending most
of your time doing that so so how my
dogs going in and out of the dog door
but if if you make some you know make an
effort towards doing that I would say
that's actually something that I didn't
I'd come across some term and I you know
stopped what I was doing and looked at
up but sometimes that ends up leading
into okay that term derives from some
mathematical concept and you end up
reading about that and then you could go
off on tangents sometimes where you're
reading like eight different Wikipedia
articles about you're going into like
in-depth mathematics and stuff just
based off of one term that you tried to
look up so that does happen there's also
this new programmer speaking in a very
nerd way so unfortunately the the the
way that we talk about stuff when we
talk about abstracting and encapsulation
and you're talking about durations and
like all these different programming
terms and mathematical terms and things
yeah they're very nerve like so
unfortunate there's no there's no
there's no way around that you know it's
like doctors have no way around the
crazy latin names that a lot of stuff
derives from as well and you just have
to kind of work through that but you'll
be surprised eventually like you'll be a
couple years into this gig and you'll be
talking like nerd speaking and most
programmers out there that didn't really
grow up in this stuff you know like is
for me I grew I didn't grow up I mean I
grew up around computers like I had my
first laptop and I was in the second
grade and it was a black and white
laptop and it was it was before most
people had computers in their houses so
this would have been like in the early
90s like 91 90 99 1999 he wanted
something like that was when I would
have had my first laptop and I used to
play like Leisure Suit Larry and like
leaders - Larry - was was the top game
out at the time like for adventure games
in the Sierra and stuff like stuff like
that but anyway I am you know I grew up
with das like I used to install my games
through das and not Windows I remembered
Windows 3.1 and it was a piece of
like at least I thought it was better
than previous versions but like I just I
didn't like it I didn't I didn't want to
use it I wanted to just use the MS DOS
prompt so anyway I guess like so that is
like the the that in computer hardware I
knew a lot about computer hardware at
least assembling computer computer yeah
basic stuff like putting a new processor
his memory cards things like that so I
had some knowledge so when I saw like
when I went into
programming like I didn't know anything
but I definitely wasn't a programmer
when I first started so I started at 28
so in getting getting into something you
know that late I think that the
terminology for me took a little bit
longer to adapt to because you know I
used to be I used to I'm not gonna go in
there like my job history I've talked
about a lot on this channel but I've
done a lot of different jobs and it has
absolutely nothing to do with nerd talk
and programming sometimes you're gonna
run into terminology that is based on
technology or
or even just a library like Microsoft is
famous I feel like for having their own
terminology for a lot of different
things so you're gonna have terminology
that sometimes is windows-based that's a
Linux base you're never going to know
all the different terminology but that's
I think it's sometimes like the
frustrating thing about certain
libraries like one of the things that
people hated about angular is that there
was like these angular specific ways of
doing things and these angular specific
terminology is and everything you would
have to learn in order to be able to
read the documents effectively and be
able to also probably work with other
angular developers effect that was I
remember one of the complaints about
that it's like we don't want to have to
completely relearn how to invent the
wheel like every time a new library or
framework comes out so it would be nice
like if they didn't come up with their
own little stupid-ass terminologies and
things but they all do so we're kind of
stuck with that because like you see
that with so many different libraries
just look around I get up and they'll be
like okay you instantiate this and we
call this your your view blah blah or
whatever like and then you know so you
have to like learn okay that's what
they're talking about with that and with
that I have this lifecycle I don't know
it's just I'm sure like you guys know
what I'm talking about
if you've done programming for any
period of time but yeah the terminology
specific to a technology set or a
library is also necessary but overall
like once again this stuff just takes
time but you definitely don't want to go
into an interview and being like yeah I
like to iterate much for loops using a
sass processor or something like that
you could you um you obviously wouldn't
do that you would
we never applied for a job if you truly
didn't know lot of the buzzwords and
then the buzzwords sometimes they're
like I said computer science sometimes
they're mathematical in nature sometimes
they are just library sometimes they're
just made up like terminologies from the
library creators and yeah so it's like
it's just gonna take time and you might
end up spending your wheels too much
like if you try to worry about learning
all the technology all the acronyms how
to say them or properly that's gonna
take time I don't think you should worry
about it you know right away like right
out the gate as you as you think as you
have time and as you see fit I would try
to you know look up different
terminologies and try to understand that
it's also helpful to pronounce
technologies the right way sometimes
there's multiple ways of pronouncing
something or saying something like nice
or or niche this is the word some people
say my sequel other people say my SQL
probably looking up a few videos and so
it's why it's helpful I think honestly
with these video tutorials that we have
nowadays too because a lot of these
terminologies you'll read in a book but
they don't tell you how to pronounce
them and you sound like a jackass like
especially from a self-taught or like if
you don't work with other professional
developers and you start going in and
working with professional developers and
calling things the wrong names and
pronouncing things completely backwards
I used to call Babel in fact on this
channel I called Babel Babel I thought
like to me it looks like it says baby
but like nobody ever heard I never heard
anybody talk about Babel and I was like
I feel like jumping into it as soon as
everybody else was so it's like I didn't
have to watch videos and other people
speak on it but when I first started
jumping into it and calling it that I
wasn't using it at the workplace so I'm
like people that was working with maybe
we didn't even have those conversations
to even know whether or not I was saying
it right or not but it wasn't until
later until I started working with a
buddy who was like yeah I think it's
although but either way a stupid
name so anyway guys I'll talk to you
later have a good day bye this video is
brought to you by wicks code wicks code
is this awesome product that allows you
to take the Wix product and you can
start programming it using the Wix code
API you can set up forms build ecommerce
websites its server list so you don't
have to deal with like server
maintenance Wix actually handles all
that behind the scenes using Wix code
you can actually set up databases so
it's great for programmers who just want
to get a stunning looking website up
real quick and this shows examples of
how to use the API and you can
so pretty cool make sure you guys check
out wicks code thanks for watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
