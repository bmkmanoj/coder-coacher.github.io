PHP tutorial series for hipster code
calm and the last video we learned all
about strings in this video what we need
to learn about is a array array is an
important feature of many programming
languages and really it's a list of
characters or not even characters it can
it can contain any type so in the video
previous videos we looked at types and
programming languages in PHP
specifically they consists of things
like strings integers floating points
and even other arrays so an array could
actually hold all those different types
it doesn't matter whether it's a string
or an int or something like that you're
not limited to declare array there's
actually multiple ways of doing it let's
go ahead and say my array is the name of
the variable so just like other
variables in the past we use the dollar
sign and then we can use the array
keyword to say 1 2 3 so as we can see we
have 3 strings that we passed into this
array make sure you have a semicolon and
then if we try to do the echo my array
we're gonna see that this does not work
in PHP because PHP echo is looking to
actually print off a string or something
that I can convert to a string but you
can see that an array cannot be
converted to a string in PHP so what
we're going to use is a built-in print R
which stands for raw so print raw and
that that has the ability to just simply
print out the contents of my array in a
array format so by doing that you can
see that an array is a list of elements
so the first element because all
programming languages start counting at
0 you can see the first element is the
string value 1 second is string value 2
and 3 another way that we can reference
an array instead of doing this we could
say my array equals and then we can use
square brackets and we can do the same
thing 1 2
three and this has the exact same effect
now with an array you can also index
stuff individually so if I started
counting at zero this is going to return
the value 1 and instead of it returning
an actual array it will return the
contents of 1 so you can see which is
just a string value so I could even say
print R and say get type and get type
I'll pass in my array and you can see
that it actually returns a string but if
I didn't actually index a single value
of the array then it would turn return
an array so an array is a different type
just like the different types we've
discussed in the previous video except
it's a very powerful type the my array
doesn't have to just store strings they
can actually store integers so here's 10
and let's just say we'll call this crazy
array and then we can actually reference
this in here crazy array and then we'll
have this is a string so this is still
going to have three contents three
values in my array except the second
value is going to be an array the first
value is an integer and the third value
is a string and we're missing the
semicolon again which I seem to do a lot
so you can see it still prints the type
array so we'll get rid of the ax type
let's just go ahead and print the
contents of array or my array and you
can see in the second element because it
starts counting at zero it's actually 1
it consists of an array itself so if I
needed to
a value from this array I could do
something like this using index I'll
grab the first value which is actually
second once again and then I can say
grab 0 and this is going to return 1 so
you can see that you can have arrays
embedded inside of arrays and you can
use these index values in order to get
the specific element of the array and
you can even get a specific element of
an element inside the array so that's
actually pretty cool gives you a lot of
freedom and flexibility and it's
something that you absolutely must know
inside PHP alright so now that we we
have our array identified a lot of times
you need to add in fact not a lot of
times probably all times you need to add
to your braid to make it bigger to add
elements and you can do that in one of
two ways in PHP the first one is that we
can just say my array you know we can
even go just down here we can use the
keyword we'll say array push which is a
built-in type or a function of PHP and
then the first argument is we give the
actual array that we need to push into
and the second is going to be this is
what we are pushing so pushing and
programming means putting in and popping
means taking out so when we print my
array we're now gonna have this this
fourth value added so here it is this is
what we were pushing so you can see this
fourth value remember start counting at
zero gets this value that we just pushed
in no there's another way of doing it
too we could say my array and then we
just say open and close square braces
and we'll say this is the second way of
doing it so now we're going to have even
more elements we're going to have five
elements inside of our array
oh except we just declared a new array
anyway so my array I had a typo remember
variables in PHP are case-sensitive so
here's the fifth element of our array
this is the second way of doing it so
whenever you're trying to add to an
array there's two ways those are the two
ways now if we're trying to remove
elements then instead of a ray push we
can say a ray pop and instead of this
we're gonna actually say let's get rid
of a ray pop and we'll get rid of one
and instead of my array we'll do crazy
array so we're telling remove the
element one from crazy array so why
didn't that work
well the reason why it doesn't work is
because the array pop is kind of a piece
of crap all it does is actually remove
the last element so another thing too is
because we're using the array pop we
actually have to actually assign crazy
array so let's do this here we're gonna
do in fact I'll leave that there we're
gonna take this entire statement and
we're gonna place it above where we're
actually referencing crazy array and our
my array example and we want to say
crazy array equals array pop and you can
see that this doesn't actually do
anything we just pass in simply the
value or the array that we're trying to
remove from and all it's going to do is
remove the last element
and because we went ahead and we removed
that last element it's three and then we
reference this down here and you can see
three is all that's returned because we
created a new array by saying crazy
array we didn't have to create a new
array we could just simply say a ray pop
and it's not going to create a new array
and it's just gonna remove the last
element so zero it's one two and then it
removed three so there's not very much
flexibility there as far as being able
to say hey I want to remove you know the
first element of the Ray it's always
going to try to remove the last one so
the better and more flexible way
whenever you're trying to remove an
element from the array is that you're
gonna want to use the unset keyword so
we could say unset and then we're going
to use our index to actually say from
crazier ages I want you to unset the
first value so by doing this we can see
that we now get the desired effects what
we can actually give the specific
element that we want to remove so here
is a ray that we call crazy array and
it's got four strings in it and the
strings are different band names and
what we want to do is just simply change
the order of the band name so that they
are ordered from you know start to
finish to be alphabetically ordered so
we can use the built-in sort keyword and
then you just pass in the array name so
by calling sort here's what we had
beforehand and now if we refresh it you
can see that PHP has now sorted the
bands based on alphabetical order
the final built-in type for arrays with
PHP that you're going to commonly use is
the count feature so if we wanted to
figure out how many values are inside of
our array we're gonna actually use the
count and this is a common thing because
you could say if there's more than a
hundred items or something like that
inside of an array then do this if not
do that so this is certainly something
that is
is extremely important and something
that's used in PHP all the time so
instead of returning the value this is
going to return the amount of items that
are inside the array and there are four
one two three four all right guys so
that'll settle everything on a raise
