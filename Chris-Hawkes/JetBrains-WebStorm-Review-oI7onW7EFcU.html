going to be talking about webstorm and
how do you guys know for the last year
probably I've been touting Visual Studio
code as like a great editor Visual
Studio code I think is great because
it's open source and it's free and
everything but when it comes to you know
free versus paid obviously you give what
you pay for there are some good open
source projects out there that that can
rival paid products but in the sense of
the guys over a Jeb Raines who have
created tools like resharper or PyCharm
or in this particular case webstorm the
the tools that they provide
you know you truly understand why people
buy certain tools because having the
right tool for the job is like half the
battle for the most part like if you've
ever worked on a car one of the things
that has always been the biggest pain in
the ass for me when it comes to working
on a vehicle is actually having the
right tool like it or you know typically
leverage because like you know when
you're working in tight quarters and
things like that you need to have you
know we're really crafty tools for
limited space and things like that and
you know really the same can be said for
programming so when you're trying like
that's why people purchase things like
you know dotnet and an equal server
because it has all these tools and
customer support and everything that
they need so while the you know it's
impressive what the open-source
community can do they typically don't
provide the same level of support that
like a paid product would provide so
that's just kind of my spiel on like ah
you know what webstorm why i have
multiple opinions and by the way people
can like multiple products like there's
nothing wrong with that so one of the
other cool things here is yours like
it's just a play react readouts project
that I have going on so it has like
basic functionality where you can see
the line line numbers it has different
coloring you can download different
themes just like you can with Visual
Studio so the open source community has
created additional plugins for this
project but if you wanted to just use
different settings out of the box you
just go to the settings and appearance
of behavior go to appearance and then
and you just click on and arby's so a
lot of people use the dark theme
I'm not sure what you prefer some people
really like that but for whatever reason
I kind of go back and forth with the
dark theme
some people say dark name lets you like
as easier on your eyes and sometimes
people say that the bright colors of
light colors actually gives them
headaches I haven't really found a story
correlation between that but I can tell
you that when it comes to reading really
complex code I typically like the
lighter theme I don't know why that is
and I'm mostly a dark name guy there are
guys that you could call - for my old
job that you know would always like your
comment on the fact I always had some
sort of dark name going on I was a big
fan of like sublime text and things like
that but the dark theme for whatever
reason I find it to be harder to deal
with when it comes to really really
complex code bases or at least ones that
I'm unfamiliar with so that's said now
another cool thing about this this
project I like is like you can see that
on my es lens that I'm setting up for
the project here it's got you know like
the little es6 icon and the JSON icons
the J's files everything so typical to
other make other editors and things like
that when you create new for different
projects you can see it's even got up to
date like icons for POG and J so J just
you know barely transfer it over its
name to Pogue I guess probably in that
last couple years we see that it even
has icons for that so the reason why I
mention that is the JetBrains community
is actually very very good at keeping up
to date with modern tools one of the
reasons why everybody you flock to
webstorm over something like Visual
Studio not Visual Studio koba's Visual
Studio is because in 2015 one of the
most in fact it was the most requested
feature of Visual Studio 2015 so this
would have been actually more like 2014
or so going into 2015 the most requested
feature from Visual Studio one of
Microsoft's most popular projects was to
add JSX support so JSX is the HTML XML
kind of hybrid language using javascript
that react uses and everybody needed it
for Visual Studio but the problem with
Visual Studio came out with 2015 and
and jsx wasn't included but going back
to that time the only ide at that time
that has native support for was webstorm
so JetBrains knows the stage of rains
because that's the company the creative
webstorm but they know how to keep up to
date with the latest features that that
the community is demanding so and if you
guys have done Python as well you know
that PyCharm with whichever aims is one
of the most popular and I think it's
probably the most popular Python editor
that exists out there for you know
really large support you know with
multiple teams and things like that
supplied Sharma's here now once again
you know I was touting a lot like in my
Python beginning Python series to use
Visual Studio code because the downside
of JetBrains is that you do get quality
but you do have to pay now the thing is
is that the price isn't that bad now I
know it sucks for you know a lot of
people but if you look at those they're
like the price for webstorm
it's really not bad it's like $59 a year
so that today that's not too bad now if
you're a company you're going to pay a
little bit more for licensing and things
like that
the $59 a year for an editor that I
guess really could be one of your most
popular or really the only tool that you
need for major web development and then
that's pretty cool alright so let me
also show you real quick so if I were to
go to this side of this base edge right
here and I'm going to go ahead and I
just want to open a command prompt to
this goddamnit I'm going to open a
command prompt I don't know what I'm
doing all right sorry so I'm going to go
into the command prompt and then I just
want to get I met a project here and you
see I initialize an empty kids
repository summits they get add dot to
get at all files that are in this
project right now I probably should have
added a git ignore exact deal if I can
cancel out of that I'm going to do that
so now we have this get folder inside
here if I go back to web swim
so I need to change my color being back
because that was annoying the hell out
of me
alright so now sure alright so if I go
to my base I project now that I've added
a good like it knows about the get
project so I'm just going to go ahead
and add a new file real quick and it's
going to be a good dog get ignore and
then by adding it you can see that
there's now it even recognizes oh you're
adding a gate ignore file that there's
there's plugins here that you can add so
you want to add we get ignored to the
project you can say no it will ask you
but you can even install the plugins if
you want so I'm actually going to ignore
the plugins I don't really want to add
those but I'm going to go ahead and
exclude my node modules folder all right
that's all there is to that so then I
can go back to my get add and add all of
them you can see now I didn't have to
add nearly as many okay so now that I've
done that I can say gig mid message
sorry I had to put in double quotes here
it should be a git commit - em neither
that I spelled it wrong no double quotes
I guess I don't know fucking working now
so you can see that added all the files
down to the gif that was my first get
push and if I now right click on the
project you can go down to the git
folder and you can see show history so I
can go through and you can see just
moments ago that I have this first check
in so if I double click on it you can
get all the different files that have
been checked in if you wanted to just
right click you can say compare with
local if you wanted to so anyway you can
right click and then even just say show
all affected files or really you can go
through any one of these files if it's
green you know that you added it you
could say show diff and you can see all
the green is just new files all together
but if there's changes you can just
review any one of them but obviously all
these are going to be brand new files I
just got committed to the project but as
you make changes and you do commits and
things like that you can also do
check-in and this is really one of the
best ways to learn about complex coding
one of the things that I don't really
stress enough unfortunately is that with
newbie developers they get its really
really complicated breaking into this
whole source control crop where you have
to check things in to get where you
might be using Team Foundation server
but you know these centralized code
repositories that people are checking
code into there's all kinds of
terminology that is confusing like if
you're looking at the git world you're
looking at get a commits and pushes
you're looking at branching and and just
branching cloning all these different
terms and things that you just have to
come to grips with and it takes some
time in order to be able to do that so
the best way is probably to make sure
you have you know some sort of I would
say a GUI tool and go is a graphical
user interface because some people
prefer the command line tool forget to
do their pushes and similar to what you
saw me doing in
you know this year but you could have
also committed to your your source
control by using the you know the tools
available with something like webstorm
so on my next check and I could make
this this simple change here in fact
we'll even just to make a little bit
more significant will say remember and I
can just right click up here on the tab
and I can go to the gif folder and say
add I can go in here I could say commit
file now this will bring up the GUI tool
I was telling you about so I could say I
made a change and you can see that it
tells you the changes that are being
made here there in green what we just
added I could put my name is the altered
everything and I can just go ahead and
commit it all right so now if I look at
the right click and I've you to get
history of the project I now have the
second check in which is moments ago
double click on that it shows you all
hey this one this one file got changed
and let's change Microsoft I could say
show diff and you can see that here is
the differences so if you've ever you
know like github you can look at open
source projects and things like that and
go through all the history there as well
but it's just a little bit easier to be
able to do that you know as you're
writing and editing code and stuff like
that so that's one of the most helpful
features of webstorm and really you know
that feature alone is one of the best
reasons for purchasing a license for an
entire year over another open-source
tool like even Visual Studio code just
because the level of get support is a
bit better from these guys over at Jeff
brings another thing too is if you've
ever done c-sharp code I've actually
worked with quite a few people that
literally can't live without resharper
like Rijo ever tells them how to do
everything when it comes to writing
c-sharp
there's both positives and negatives to
that there's positives and the fact that
you know it teaches you a lot of crafty
ways to write stuff and then another
a negative could be that it writes code
better than most kirlyam programmers so
in some ways when you just click in and
rewrite it just reach angels everything
some programmers don't learn a lot from
that you know a lot of times you learn
from the mistakes in the way that you're
doing things you incorrectly you learned
that to experience and then it can be
really valuable feedback but sometimes
when you know things are doing so much
for you we become so reliant upon our
tools to basically do everything and
that's kind of that goes into maybe an
argument that you know one day like
artificial intelligence is going to
write a one day write code better than a
human couldn't join modern times so
hopefully it doesn't happen because then
we all be out of a job but all right
guys that's really that's just my uh my
review of the webstorm product this
thing's phenomenal you know it's just
definitely a ten out of ten or nine and
ten I'm not sure I'm not even a critic
or whatever so my ratings don't really
mean anything but I can tell you that
it's really it's an awesome project and
the JetBrains guys are really good all
right guys take care have a good day bye
hey guys so a lot of you asked me how do
I get my foot in the door to become a
programmer and I just want to take a
moment to mention dev Mountain coding
boot camp is a 12-week intensive course
that focuses on the technologies of the
here-and-now for web development some of
the things that they're actually
teaching in this 12-week course is
geared to get you into the industry by
focusing on things like jQuery nodejs
react angular how to use github so a lot
of the things that you're going to need
to do as a developer as soon as you
start they're going to be teaching you
in this and this coding boot camp and
the entire goal is to be able to get you
into the industry within 12 weeks so if
you guys are interested in learning more
information about Deb mountain coding
boot camp just check out the link in the
description crowd of this video thank
you for watching and have a good day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
