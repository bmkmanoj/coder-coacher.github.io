so in the past we've talked about
variables in Python and what they are
variables can be any name as long as you
use a proper spelling convention like
they can't start with a number and stuff
like that but variable acts common name
for variable this is a string and if we
just simply print X we're gonna be
printing the value of x which is this is
a string
now if python has a bunch of built-in
variable types everything in python is
an object so everything in python is an
object kind of like my balls are objects
in python which is lists and you're
gonna use that a lot for almost
everything that you do
you're gonna involve some sort of list
now why we're on the while we're on the
list topic let's discuss tuples tuples
are very similar to lists except they're
immutable they cannot be changed once
you enter contents inside a tuple you
cannot take anything out you have to
create a new tuple so the benefit of
tuple over a list is that it is slightly
quicker because it Python doesn't have
to worry about okay can certain contents
of this list essentially be taken out if
it's a tuple and the answer is no it
can't so it doesn't have to dedicate as
much memory to storing that that
essentially a list which is called a
tuple so the difference between so we'll
say my list equals its remember it's
inside a square bracket we'll just a 1 2
3 and we'll say my tuple equals and it's
in these just the yes parentheses yeah
and guess that's a parenthesis sorry
words are failing me right now so 1 2 3
and then we close that off and we're
missing a comma there all right so if we
want to go ahead and iterate over that
my tuple for I and my tuple
rent I and you can see one two three
which is the exact same thing that would
happen if we said my list one two three
so exact same thing except one can be
edited so we can say my list dot pop one
and you can see that we've taken off the
first sequence which in Python you count
from zero so zero one so we removed two
so pop removes from the list and if we
tried to do that to the tuple it won't
work and you see that it had no effect
I'm sorry I didn't even try to do that
so my two pool and you'll see it has no
attribute pops so tuples cannot be
removed from that that's the difference
between a list and a tuple all right so
moving on with the object types Python
also has a dictionary so we can say my
dictionary equals and it goes inside
these curly braces now a dictionary is a
key value just like a regular dictionary
if you look up what is a table in a
dictionary you're gonna get a definition
of that so to build off of that we can
say my dictionary and then we'll inside
square brackets we're going to give the
actual key and the key will say table
and then we give it a value and the
value is just like a regular string it
can also be an integer but in this case
we're going to do a string so we'll say
a four-legged furniture object
so then if we say prince my dictionary
and we can give it the we're gonna say
table because we're gonna give it to key
and you can see that by giving it the
key and saying print that it's actually
finding the key within our dictionary
and printing the value so we can add
more to our dictionary just by simply
doing the same thing my dictionary chair
equals a place to rest your a and if we
did the same thing here we just give it
a different value
I'm sorry different key a plus certain
place the restoration area is in Python
you'll use those a lot in Django
assuming you want to get into web
development using Python another object
type in Python is files so they are
objects just like everything else you
can say my file and then to go ahead and
create a new file we can just say open
and give it a location on your hard
drive where it can find that location so
I have a projects directory and my C
Drive C being the root this first
forward slash so anything after that
it's gonna be C Drive and then projects
and then we'll just say our test on txt
and to write a new file we simply say W
because what it does is um it it just it
automatically creates in our tests txt
file now that to be careful with that
because if you do have our test txt
already there it's gonna overwrite
everything if you don't want to
overwrite everything you go and you use
an a which means a pen so it will append
to whatever whoever is in that that that
file it will start adding onto the end
of it there so by doing this we can
my file dot writes our test okay now
let's go ahead and run this and you can
see it doesn't look like anything
happened but we did go ahead and create
this file and just so you know this is
an object just like everything else that
we've been talking about but it's a file
object and file object has a method
right so a string object you know it's
not gonna have a method of write aside
pythons I can know how to handle it but
this built-in file object says hey we
have a method right oh we know that you
want to write to the particular file
that my file is and that is right here
so let's go ahead and just look at that
real quick and our file explorer and we
put it on there projects there should be
down here at the bottom and you see our
test and we open up our test
and when we pull that up here you can
see that it created a file our test and
it printed off what we want it to print
in our write statement so I'm go ahead
and take that out of there all right so
that is where we're going to leave off
with our Python object types typically
in your day-to-day python programming
tasks those are going to be the types
that you end up using there are other
types that that are available like I
briefly touched on decimals I mean
there's a whole array of stuff that you
have to learn in order to use something
like that properly there's also some
additional capabilities like for
mathematical equations and things like
that that Python can help you with but
for the most part people aren't gonna be
messing with that and in this particular
example I don't this introductory video
I don't want to go into all of that so
anyway I hope this helps and thank you
for watching bye this was some good
but it may take some time for a noob
like me to remember everything
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
