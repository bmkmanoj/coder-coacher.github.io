I want to talk about system arguments
and they're also known as command-line
arguments a lot of times in a Python
program you're going to see something
like this it's going to be like sISTAR V
which basically I believe it's like
short for argument value but don't quote
me on that but I it looks like argument
value and that seems fine to me so
you'll see something like system Darvey
typically like 1 or something like that
and you're like well what the hell is
that well what that is is what anytime
you have a system argument for your
Python program so if your program or
script can actually alter the way it
functions based on the amount the
arguments that are given to it when the
program is executed and what I mean by
that let me show you we're going to
import something called sis sys and now
we can go ahead and we can look at the
actual command-line argument so we're
just going to simply print out we'll say
sis dot Arg V 1 or 0 I'm sorry so 0 and
what 0 is gonna be it's always going to
be the full path to wherever the Python
script is located so when we run this
you're gonna see a path that goes right
to where this tutorial script is and as
you can see here let me get rid of this
so I'm not confusing on the issue so
when we run the program you can see that
it is printing out the exact path from
where this tutorial script can be run or
be found now you can also just simply
say print Syst arc v and what that's
gonna do it's actually going to print it
in a list format so you can see there's
only one list item because there's no
arguments passed in now if we actually
pass in an argument i want to show you
something if I go like this and I run
this tutorial dot py which is the name
of the script and I give it like a
argument like test right it actually
doesn't show you the test and the the
list item there because I'm using
Windows you have to actually explicitly
say Python tutorial
dot py and then you can actually put in
here as many arguments as you want so
we'll say are two so test this argument
one Arceus test or is our argument who
is arc 2 so you can see that it's not a
list so if we wanted to actually say
this princess Artem will just say starts
counting at zero but number zero is the
name of the script so we'll just say
print the second argument and when I
execute it here you're gonna see that it
prints aargh - and if I actually tried
to do 3 you can see that the list is out
of range because there is not a third
argument there but anyway you can have I
believe an unlimited number of arguments
but typically I don't usually see more
than like four or five tops otherwise
there's you know there may be another
way of going about it but you do see
these sis arcs and the programs all the
time and that's all they are they're
just accepting command-line arguments
and then using them within their script
and there's a lot of reasons why you
would do that like say if you're
iterating a list of items and those
items are a DVD and a DVD is handled in
a certain way as opposed to a blu-ray so
you could give a command line argument
so you could have the same script that
does the same logical stuff except it
just buries just slightly if it's a DVD
or blu-ray so you can pretty much reuse
the script by just saying okay the
command-line argument is blu-ray or it's
DVD and you know essentially you can
reuse the program that's probably it's
it's a it's an example but there's
multiple reasons why you would want to
be able to pass in arguments that could
be dynamic to a script alright guys
