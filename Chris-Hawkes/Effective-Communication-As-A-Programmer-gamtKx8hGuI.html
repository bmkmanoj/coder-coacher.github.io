quote the other day and it goes like
this and this might be out of context a
little bit but I was talking to a buddy
last night because I've ready yesterday
I thought it was hilarious and it said
if you run into somebody and they're
being an asshole then they're just an
asshole but if everybody you run into is
an asshole then you're the asshole so if
you stop and think about that for a
second maybe you don't think about it at
all but I there's so much truth to that
at least in my life it's unbelievable
because there are days where it's like
I'm driving down the road and I'm like
like you pricks why aren't you going
fast enough why are you stopping at the
yellow light you know why just where
people just irritate me and typically
it's because I haven't had enough sleep
or I didn't get something you know
anything to eat that morning maybe you
know I could there's all kinds of
different issues and in many cases it's
just simply that I'm just tired I'm worn
down and one of the most difficult
things to deal with in the IT world at
least you know where I'm coming from
anyway at the point that I'm at in my
career is effective communication it's
one of the most difficult things I think
for me to be able to wrap my mind around
so I went to school for business and you
would think that I would be a better
public speaker and things like that but
the truth is like I don't really like
talking to people I don't like open
environments like open office spaces or
a terrible idea i think it you know they
spread the germs like there's all kinds
of distractions and it just makes the
job more difficult now there are certain
extroverts which I am certainly not an
extravert which would say hey i love you
know to open office space but to me I
think the open office space is a
terrible idea and it's a terrible trend
I hope it dies as quickly as possible
and I think that companies like Google
and you know they've come out and they
said that they're open office space was
a distraction and and I'm not saying
that you have to have a private office
with your own windows and fish tanks and
everything because that would be nice
but obviously that's not the case but
you know inside there there should be
some privacy to wear like you know if I
if I you know
if I want to eat at my desk you know I'm
not like oh you know I or maybe I could
like you know blow my nose or something
you know who don't like there's there's
things that we do as humans that will
annoy people and that you know we can't
really do if there's never any privacy I
mean these open office spaces it's like
you know the manager has like this
window where they can just peer in and
watch everybody working and it just
reminds me of like a sweatshop sitka
because most companies that say hey
we're going to do this open office space
and it's going to you know we're going
to bring in some you know nice new
carpet and things like that because we
want to open collaboration open
collaboration is one thing but if you're
simply just trying to squeeze as many
bodies into it into a space as possible
and then call it you know that you're
doing it for class early basically just
be upfront about why your knowing say
yeah you know we're going to save a lot
of money by having all this office space
you know converge into this open lands
landscape now because if you try to say
oh yes for collaboration when you know
it's not really for collaboration
because nobody can concentrate on
anything because everybody's wearing
headphones either to tell the people
that near them hey don't bother me or
because they simply can't hear because
there's so many distractions and that
doesn't even account for like the actual
visit visual distractions so no matter
what you do with your ears and things
like that there were all kinds of visual
distractions that take place in an open
office space and this kind of goes into
the point that I originally made where
it's like you know the community
communication being a major major issue
for me and I T is just simply that one
of the most difficult things is that
you're dealing with people that are not
programmers a lot of the people that you
are communicating things to have no idea
HTML from CSS to JavaScript to python
this tisha like they don't know about
you know web forms and posting date like
they don't understand any of that stuff
so if you're given requirements where
it's like hey you know we want you we
want some sort of status so you're going
to be done in the next two weeks what
needs to be done well this this and this
and when you say this is in this you
have to be very careful to figure out
who it who is
audience like is your audience leads
that you're trying to communicate with
that may not have any sort of software
development background how do you convey
certain like you know blocking points
without giving a clear you know because
a lot of times you simply just scratch
the surface would with whatever the
issue is and for example say you're
waiting on Team a and B to finish like
you know steps one two and three in
order for your four five and six to work
you're given your you're being asked
estimates and why haven't you come up
with a solution for four or five and six
when you know that your solution is
based on 1 2 and 3 working and then how
do you actually say okay well I've
talked the team is one two and three and
those teams have you know pending things
that that we've worked through and but
you can't really go into the weeds too
much with you with the actual
explanation I think that that's
something that I certainly struggled
with and it's something that I plan on
continuing to work work on and I hope
that uh that I can actually address that
you know and get better with it because
I think honestly it's just targeting
your audience is is just key I mean it
really need to jot down ideas
essentially and you can go in and be as
granular or as low level as you want to
be when it comes to okay I need to do
this this and this in order for me to
succeed but then you know then there
might be 15 or 20 different steps that
you know need to be done but there's no
reason why you can't say you know what
you know those 15 steps need to be done
now let me abstract this out into some
sort of you know rapper and say you know
if I'm talking to Leeds and manage but I
can simply say you know these 15 steps
can be summed up as we're waiting on
this and this and that's essentially and
if they start asking for granular
details you can pull out your list and I
okay well you know item 3 is waiting on
Team a B and C or something you know I
mean like so you you should but you need
to you need to record you need to be a
good record keeper I think and and i
think it's it's something that I've read
a lot about but effective communication
and I say not just communicational but
effective communication is so key and
it's one of the more difficult things
two nit because an IT you typically run
into programmers from all around the
world so there were programmers that
that can barely speak English and they
have a very hard time communicating what
it is that they're working on or
understanding what you're saying and
that's that's a constant struggle so
it's a it's really a struggle for them
too because in order for them to be you
know effective programmers like they
need to be able to communicate
effectively as well and if you can't
even speak proper English or speak
English hardly at all then it's just
it's a much much more difficult thing
like if I were going to go to Russia and
speak Russian like I mean I I would be a
terrible communicator over there because
I don't speak the language at all like I
would be you know probably you know
jotting down a few words and things like
that but then how do you take that
message and effectively communicate that
to managers or two leads or to business
analyst or to you know the black Belles
like you know it's just there's just
there's so many challenges when it comes
to communicating clearly and I think
it's something that is very very
overlooked because in most business most
businesses that you actually want to
work for now you could be a code monkey
that is literally just pounding out code
you know lines of code where you get
judged on hey I wrote 150 lines of code
today but for me I would much rather be
solving business problems and focusing
on how do I write software that's going
to help the business succeed and making
them save them money or satisfy their
customer whatever it is to me I'm I
would much rather be doing that but that
means that you're more than a programmer
you're actually you know you you you
carry attributes of open like an analyst
like a systems analyst a business
analyst a user experience designer
programmer software engineer software
architect lead a man like you you
actually have to wear a lot of different
hats depending on the code and or the
business that you work for and your job
title and for me I would much rather
prefer it that way but one of the
caveats of that is that you have to be
an effective communicator
if you're not then it's just it's a
major problem and not just you know for
leading people but for simply just
communicating with management on
statuses and things like that that is
very difficult to convey without going
into like I said the lower level so it's
something that I plan on working on
myself a lot more but i just thought i
would share that tip with you guys just
because it's probably not going to bite
you until it bites you but eventually
you're going to run into situations as a
programmer where you're going to you're
going to be giving presentations and
status updates to non-technical audience
so you'll see that on job and listings
all the time they'll say effectively
communicates you know technical
solutions to a non technical audience
and things like that and that's all
about taking what it is that you know
needs to be done and then how to
abstract all that into one or two items
essentially that can kind of wrap all
that up in a very big high level summary
to say this is what needs to be done
this is what we're doing and that's
simply yet you leave it at that and then
if you need like I said to go into the
to the nitty gritty details you can then
you know as long as long as you you know
have some sort of list because i would i
would say you should write down a list
because a lot of times too if you're
like me you might get put on the spot
and they'll be like so what's the status
on this and you knew what the status was
when you were thinking about a yesterday
morning but you know today you've
already written all this other new stuff
you've met with teams a and B there's
all these different things that are
pouring through your head you just had a
you know 6 inch or 12 inch sub from
subway and you basically just want to go
to sleep instead you just got asked on
the status of something where you could
have answered it perfectly clear the day
before but right now you know add the
spot think right then and there you know
you have and you know come up with a
situation or an answer that's where it's
good to pull out a list that you wrote
down and so you know yeah okay so we we
got these items and that would be my
advice really and that's something that
I that I do try to do to some extent but
it's certainly something that I need to
get better at because it's not even just
about leading teams and development
stuff like that it's also about being a
software engineer a senior software
engineer
to be able to effectively communicate so
the quicker you guys can I can jump on
that and try to learn effective
communication techniques then then I
would say you know the sooner the better
because that's going to help you a lot
of it all up in the job interview it's
going to help you when you get to the
company it's going to help you know it's
going to help give a better impression
of you to your team because ultimately
you need to make sure that whoever
you're working with that you can trust
them and that they can trust you and
there's there's many many benefits to
that because you never want to be in a
situation where somebody has a false
impression of you or or you've you've
created some sort of impression that you
know you think it's false but it's truly
what you've conveyed to other people and
anyway you just want to make sure that
you have you know your eggs and multiple
baskets and when I say multiple baskets
I mean like you can consider a basket
like a person so it's like you know you
have good communication with with not
just your managers but with the leads
and with other senior developers and
things like that so that they can that
they can trust that you have their back
and everything so now a lot of
networking is involved in programming as
well anyway that's kind of a different
subject but I thought I would just share
with today's thoughts on today's one of
those days where I'm just you know
really tired you know like I said I kind
of like that quote that I shared at the
beginning of the video I think that
that's very fitting for somebody like me
because I there are days that I'm like
that in and I realized that if the issue
is on me and not somebody else anyway
alright guys well thank you for watching
this video please subscribe please
upvote the video appreciate it and take
care also make sure you guys check out

out quite a bit I think so make sure you
guys check them out and and let me know
what you think take care bye hey guys so
a lot of you asked me how do I get my
foot in the door to become a programmer
and I just wanna take a moment to
mention dev Mountain coding boot camp is
a 12 week intensive course that focuses
on
technologies of the here and now for web
development some of the things that
they're actually teaching in the suevi
course it's geared to get you into the
industry by focusing on things like
jQuery nodejs react angular how to use
github so a lot of the things that
you're going to need to do as a
developer as soon as you start they're
going to be teaching you in this and
this coding boot camp and the entire
goal is to be able to get you into the
industry within 12 weeks so if you guys
are interested in learning more
