so what we're going to be doing in this
video is I want to show you guys that
you can actually use the visual studio
integrated development environment for
Python development so I think that's
really an awesome thing I do dotnet
development full time so python is just
a hobby type of thing but there's no
question Visual Studio is the best
integrated to build integrated
development environment out there there
does a lot of things for you like the
intellisense is better than anything
I've ever seen so if you're really
trying to get into enterprise level
software development and even if you
plan on using Python which is a lot of a
lot of corporations not consider to be
like an enterprise level language but
you know it obviously can be but it's my
opinion all the more need for a great
integrated development environments that
you can keep track of all your code your
classes your methods things like that so
anyway that's what we're going to be
doing right now so we're going to
install the Python tools so that you can
actually create a Python project within
Microsoft Visual Studio now Visual
Studio cost a lot of money but you can
download free copies of it and
eventually you know if you have a
company and you know you're paying
probably independent pay for eventually
but as far as a typical everyday
development especially if you're a
student then it's free just get the
Visual Studio Express Edition and I have
Visual Studio 2010 installed so what
we're going to do is just ahead of
Google where we go to get all of our
downloads and I'm going to do Python
for Visual Studio 2010 and it pulls up
right there it's the first thing all
right and we just click on download now
the one you're going to want to get is
the MSI so that means it installs it for
you since I have 2010 just go down here
and find the 2.0 Alpha vs 2010 MSI so
click on that
right this shouldn't take you long while
we're waiting on this to install I'll
just want to go ahead and give myself a
little plug in I had this website
crowdfunding so if you guys have any
projects or anything like that or if
anybody wants to help me write an
article or something you know give me a
backlink to your site or whatever but
this basically just decided I'm trying
to promote that I created in Python and
it's about crowdfunding so a lot of
these articles aren't right but she's
kind of interesting thing I do on the
side to try to you know just keep my
interest in the business field and
things like that so if you guys are
interested make sure you check that out
it's actually titled the same thing as
buying YouTube tutorial channels which
doesn't make a whole lot of sense but I
didn't really you know I have this new
bitch name because I had a bunch of my
move related things because I own a
company that's kind of named after that
but I you know I just basically didn't
want to use another domain name and I
was like oh well newb the kind of it's
what I'm trying to do so that's why the
tutorial channel and so come on Windows
Jesus Christ
sorry about that delay I got a shitload
of applications running right now it'll
they need to shut some down
and while we're waiting for this to
install I'm just going to go under stop
all right so now that we have it
installed it's just go ahead and pull
out Visual Studio again
tell you that I'm rendering a video
right now and it just bogs down
my system like like crazy it's just
faster very rendering and got patience
for this
anyway I hope y'all are going well today
actually subscribe all that stuff please
I love it when people subscribe makes me
feel like I'm not completely wasting my
condo in these videos
Holloway
it's becoming a parent that I cannot
render a video and pull a
visuals three at the same time
all right anyway now that we've
installed the Python tools we can go to
our project and can wait another 10
minutes
all right sorry about that so now that
we have that you're going to look over
here you go to other languages and we
have Python so I'm just clicking on
Python application
and it's simply HelloWorld
so we'll be debug from our visual studio
environment says the interpreter does
not exist so in the next video what
we're going to do is we're going to set
up visual studio so that I can find the
proper Python interpreter and then I'm
also going to show you a trick in the
next video which also because when you
run the Python program from the command
line if you have stuff that's printing
out it's going to close immediately
after a run so there is a basically an
option and the tools where you can leave
it leave the I'll get into that in the
next video sorry about the delay and my
computer trying to render that video at
the same time as I was recording it all
this isn't something I can do in the
future so thank you for bearing with me
and please subscribe taking</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
