this video what we want to look at is
why and using strict is important so
when it comes to using strict it's kind
of a weird thing and really the one
place that I had seen that before is
pearl because pearl that should get away
with so much crazy stuff that you
shouldn't get away with as a programming
language that they had this use strict
option to kind of bring some more sanity
to it well Java scripts kind of the same
way and one of the things that Java
Script will do which is very unusual for
a lot of languages is that if you try to
reference an unassign the variable or an
undeclared variable it will just go
ahead and create one for you so that is
something that is completely it's
completely crazy so javascript has this
you strict standard which won't allow
that to happen so let me give an example
of what's gonna happen here when you
declare a variable in JavaScript I'm
sure we've seen this before this is a
string so we'll just say test equals
hello world right so we've declared this
test okay so that's the normal whether
you should do it however if you did that
without declaring the variable and you
just try to reference it by saying hey
test equals hello world so you never
actually gave any sort of indication
that you wanted to declare this you the
way you wrote it you wrote it as if
variable tests had already been declared
somewhere so it's never been declared
and then if we went ahead and just said
alert which is how we printed this rain
alert test so what does javascript gonna
do here and this is the weirdness of the
way JavaScript works it's actually going
to go ahead and create this this
variable for you and the code executes
normally so you can see in the alert
statement that it did print hello world
which is a undeclared variable so what
happens if we do a you strict mode
typically you do not want something like
this you you don't you want to have your
variables declared that way the program
isn't doing any sort of unexpected
behavior because what if you spelled
tests wrong then you would just have
this like what if you had a typo then
all of a sudden you have this new
variable that you didn't even know about
that is spelled wrong and JavaScript
just created it for you without you even
knowing that it did it so
the to prevent that kind of behaviors
all you need to do is put you strict at
the top of your file just like that
that's all it is and you can actually
put that inside of your module too so
when we start looking at modules
individual JavaScript modules you can
have the U strict right inside that
module where it'll have the same type of
rules for that and in this particular
case you can also put it at the top of
your page so this entire javascript file
here is I'm going to be using the strict
Stamp standard and I'm just so you guys
know this is just a simple HTML page
that is referencing this test javascript
page which I'm using for this example
and then I'm just opening it in a
browser so that's all all that's going
on here so here here's this hello world
this undeclared variable JavaScript just
went ahead and created it for us now
what happens though since we use
strictmode
javascript is going to complain and it's
going to return undefined because the
variable wasn't declared before we tried
to reference it so watch what happens
now nothing happens the alert statement
doesn't happen and if you want to know
why did your JavaScript fail why is it
not doing what it's supposed to do
that's where you want to go to the
console and the developer tools and it's
going to give you the the problem right
there uncaught reference error test is
not defined that's because we didn't
declare it properly we didn't use the
var we didn't say that we wanted to use
it
javascript is not doing its magic of
just creating variables without our
permission
so typically you do want to do you
strict mode to prevent any sort of
nastiness especially if you start
getting into serious more advanced
JavaScript and where you have a lot of a
lot of JavaScript stuff being executed
all over the place all right guys so
that's you strict and that's why we have
it alright thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
