we looked at lists within elixir and now
we're going to be using are looking at
tuples and tuples are very very similar
to lists except in my opinion they're a
little bit less flexible but they are
faster so the thing about tuples is like
they're they're considered to be
contagious which means that they
everything is stored in an a in a tuple
is ordered from zero to one so if you
want to get the length of it or you want
it to get a certain value by index and
then the tuple is the way to go tuples
are immutable like we talked about with
lists so they're very similar but once
again there's just a little bit less
flexibility in my opinion when it comes
to adding removing and inserting
elements into two and two tuples but
let's go ahead and just briefly cover
them and the first argument will say my
tuple equals and tuples go inside these
curly braces and we could just pass in
any value so once again we could have a
string a number and a bowl which is like
true or false now if I wanted to get the
length instead of saying length to my
tuple that's not going to work because
my tuple is a tuple and on a list you
can see as a data type tuple so if I
wanted to get the actual elements of the
tuple then I would say tuple size which
is a built-in function with an elixir
and you pass in the name of your tuple
which is my tuple and it returns the
value 3 now if I wanted to just get one
particular element I could I could I can
actually say Elam for element and I pass
in my tuple and I give it a zero based
index is 0 is gonna be the first value 2
is the second value and then so anyway
it starts counting at 0 just like a lot
of things doing in programming languages
and then finally if I wanted to actually
get the or if I wanted to insert an
element into my tuple and let's just
replace string which is the first value
and we're gonna replace string with
Chris so I could say put
element and then I just pass in my tuple
names of my tuple and then we tell it
which you know which which index number
you wanted to actually insert this value
and then you pass in the value so now
you can see that the first element is
now Chris instead of string so that's
kind of in a nutshell but what tuples
are as far as why you would even want to
use them basically return data return
data that doesn't need that necessarily
or doesn't necessarily have to change
very often and probably a good idea to
return that like maybe an HTTP call that
is returning a status of 200 or a 500
error or something like that you could
pass back a tuple in that in that
instance so we'll get more into the
different data types as we go along
further and our elixir journey here but
just want to thank you guys for watching
and have a good day bye hey guys so a
lot of you asked me how do I get my foot
in the door to become a programmer and I
just want to take a moment to mention
dev Mountain coding boot camp is a
12-week intensive course that focuses on
the technologies of the here-and-now for
web development some of the things that
they're actually teaching in the Suevi
course it's geared to get you into the
industry by focusing on things like
jQuery nodejs react angular how to use
github so a lot of the things that
you're going to need to do as a
developer as soon as you start they're
going to be teaching you in this and
this coding bootcamp and the entire goal
is to be able to get you into the
industry within 12 weeks so if you guys
are interested in learning more
information about dev mountain coding
boot camp just check out the link in the
description tab of this video thank you
for watching and have a good day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
