we're going to go back into our
application and we want to create a new
item and we're gonna call this app Jas
really I can do things this way and then
with inside up dot J's we're gonna save
variable Express equals require Express
and this is just simply JavaScript code
and we'll say variable app equals
Express alright and then we're gonna go
ahead and add some URLs here at least
one URL just for the simple hello world
demonstration so we're gonna say app get
hello.txt function request response
response dot send and we'll say hello
world
close that off some of my functions
capitalized here I'm not sure why that
is all right so we respond with the
hello world and now we're going to
create another method here when it's a
variable server equals app dot listen
and we're telling it the port number to
listen to so we're going to say and
listen the port number 3000 I don't know
why the F this thing keeps capitalizing
but it's really pissing me off you are a
prick you are a prick there we go
function console dot log and then we'll
say a listening on port number and we
can do the shorthand a little argument D
for digit will say server dot address
server dot address
that poor
all right now let's go ahead and write
ooh run this file right after we do that
in order to actually run our server we
need to do it and say node I just simply
node and then the name of the
application so app jeaious so now we're
listening on port start 3000 so let's
pull up a browser and you say localhost
3000
son of a bitch
so we have to put our localhost
addressed in here is HTTP 127 dot 0 dot
0 dot 1 and then the name of the colon
your port number and then the actual
text URL here is um hello dot txt so
we'll say hello dot txt all right cool
so no js' is serving this webpage to us
alright guys thanks for watching I
appreciate it please subscribe and we'll
get into more stuff in the next video
bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
