thanks for watching this video
and what I'm talking about in this video
is whether or not functional programming
is the future in 2016 and beyond and I
did a top 10 video a few months back
back in August about the top 10
programming languages I think one should
learn in 2016 and I would I guess I
should preface this by saying that I
made that list with the web programming
world in mind for the most part although
I did not try to ignore some of the
trends that I felt were up-and-coming I
certainly didn't focus on niche areas or
areas of computing that might
revolutionize the way computing is done
you know moving forward maybe you know
not just a year or two by decades into
the future so I wasn't really trying to
point out any sort of niche industries
and what this video about is whether or
not a functional programming language
like Microsoft's Visual F sharp or Scala
which is they're both considered of
purely functional programming languages
and the question is whether or not one
of these two languages will actually
emerge as you know really a top ten
contender in programming like we see
with Java or C sharp or one of those
other already established languages if
you would read through the comments of
that top 10 video that I did back in
August there is probably at least 30 or
40 different comments about why why a
functional language or functional purely
functional language was not on the list
now one of the main things that I looked
at was whether or not you're actually
going to be able to find a job in this
industry so when I go to indeed.com and
if I were to type f-sharp like at the
moment of this video on this date right
now what I'm looking at across the
entire I'm assuming world this is mostly
United States maybe it's just the United
States but there is only a hundred and
eighty-one jobs matching the F sharp
description on indeed.com that's not
very good
if I type Scala which Scala is is
clearly the front-runner in the
functional programming world right now I
have 4300 jobs which is obviously a lot
better than F sharp but still not nearly
as good as one would like if you're
looking to get a job in the industry now
if I go ahead and try to find another
language like maybe Haskell a lot of
people you know will say Haskell maybe a
lick sir Haskell has three hundred
fifty-four jobs
elixir has 65 jobs so none of those
languages really speak to me is
something that I would want to learn as
a top 10 and 20 16 if I'm looking to get
a job now I need to mention some of the
key points of why you would want to use
a functional programming language
because there is certainly an industry
for it and it's certainly a growing
industry and it will become bigger and
bigger I think as we move into the
future and to explain that so I'll give
a description of what a purely
functional languages and this is
according to Wikipedia so take it with a
grain of salt it says in computer
science functional programming is a
programming paradigm a style of building
the structure and elements of computer
programs that treats computation as the
evaluation of mathematical functions and
avoids changing state and mutable data
in short you can think of purely
functional language as a language that
is built around functions that call
either themselves in a recursive manner
or call other functions and never have
to worry about changing state so it
makes things very very quick the biggest
benefit of a purely functional language
from what I understand is that the
modern-day computer processor is not
necessarily getting any faster more time
and attention as being given towards
computational processes you know through
a processor via multiple cores as
opposed to a single processor core that
can actually handle more processing
power and speed so you're actually
seeing processors become
you know multicores which is now a very
common thing here with like AMD or you
know intel with their i7 processors but
their multi-core processors but the
problem is a lot of the languages that
were invented decades ago they're not
built to take advantage of concurrency
and parallelism that modern multi-core
processors should be able to handle so a
purely functional language is supposed
to be able to fill that void it's
supposed to be able to maximize your
computer's potential for complex
analysis like data crunching so this is
big for anybody that's into the data
scientists here if you have to crunch
through a ton of data and you're running
things in parallel a purely functional
language is definitely where it's at now
in most cases though your typical web
developer isn't going to need to
actually write a purely functional code
codebase you know they could always use
probably some additional speed or
something like that but if I'm building
a typical website or crud application
that creates reads updates and deletes
you're not going to need a purely
functional language for that so the
bottom line is that most of the jobs out
there are not dealing with purely
functional languages myself I've been in
the enterprise software industry for
several years now I've never once come
across a purely functional language and
in my industry also at while I'm at home
and I'm building websites and I'm
learning new technologies
I haven't actually found the need for a
purely functional language I have dipped
into f-sharp just a little bit I think
it's very it's vastly different from
c-sharp although there are some
similarities luckily because I'm sure
Scala is nothing like c-sharp but the
point is you can do functional
programming and some of the older
languages that were used to and we hear
a lot about like JavaScript that is
considered a functional language Vic
treats functions as first-class citizens
meaning that you can have a variable X
and it equals a function so functional
languages allow you to do that not every
language does but javascript is one of
them that does so we've all probably
done JavaScript if you've done any sort
of web
so I guess my point is that the reason
why I didn't include a purely functional
language is because I don't see the need
of you know why that would really
replace one of the you know the top ten
languages that I did mention it is
something that if I were going to build
some sort of process and intensive or if
I was trying to build some sort of
cutting edge maybe web scraper or
something like that that has to just
crunch through tons of data a purely
functional language would probably be
pretty good however I can also write
purely functional code and c-sharp as
well so it's a little bit it's a little
bit different but C sharps codebase is
just as capable as f-sharp so you know
depending on the language that you
choose you may have the option of
writing in a purely functional way and
that may be something that you want to
look at but if I was gonna recommend a
functional language to get into and 2016
I would definitely get the nod to Scala
they have the most jobs they have the
best trend as far as growth and they
also have their footprint and the in the
industry they have a decent footprint so
far so a lot of companies are using them
f-sharp I'm not really sure I can't
really say that I would recommend that
at this point I would say if you're in
the the.net world and you're already
doing c-sharp you may just want to look
at how to do you know functional
programming in C sharp or give F sharp a
whirl but I've yet to see it be adopted
by a lot of large companies to date so
anyway guys that's my justification for
whether or not I think functional
programming is the future and the
immediate future the answer is I don't
see it yet but I'm not an expert and I'm
not a data scientist so I'm sure
different industries would would have a
different opinion on that do I think
it's a good language to learn definitely
because it's it's a completely different
paradigm from what you're probably used
to if you've never done something like
that before so it's something that I
would like to take up sometime and learn
but you know there's time as of time I
don't have a ton of time I guess and I
have to kind of choose wisely on what
sort of projects I want to work on and
when I dipped into f-sharp a few months
ago I just I realized that I still have
a lot to learn in c-sharp before
jump to f-sharp and I just I didn't I
didn't want to mix the two because I
feel like it wouldn't help me in the
immediate future but let me know if you
guys disagree and I appreciate you
watching this video just please
subscribe if you want I think everybody
that has subscribed so far and I
appreciate all the support if you have
any questions feel free to ask me I do
try to respond to everybody's questions
and if I didn't respond you I apologize
it's not that I did it on purpose
sometimes I just don't see the comments
alright guys thanks for watching and
have a good day bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
