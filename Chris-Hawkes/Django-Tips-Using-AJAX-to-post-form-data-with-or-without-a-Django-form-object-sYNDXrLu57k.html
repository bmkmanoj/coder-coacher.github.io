is another Django tip for Ajax post and
I wasn't really familiar with this so
hopefully this does help out a lot of
people but this is just like a sample
form I'm not using Django forms or
anything because I have restrict access
to this page just for administration
purposes and I'm not really I'm not
really updating an object that
corresponds to a Django model which is
the primary reason why you would want to
use a Django form is because generally
you're updating stuff that goes right
into a model I'm going to be doing
something a little bit more complex than
that a lot more back-end processing type
of stuff that I'm going to be doing so
really I just want to just simply give
it you know fill in some information and
on the back end be able to grab that
information and do something with it so
here's this simple test page that we
have and we're using a form zoom in on
this a bit so we're using a form that
just simply says on submit return false
that way it doesn't have any sort of
page refresh because we're going to be
sending the form data through Ajax so
what we do is instead of using a submit
button I'm just using a regular button
with class such as on click and call
this function down here and this
function is described right here so
we'll display an Ajax loading symbol and
then we make our Ajax call now the data
that we pass in and it's pretty simple
but a lot of people don't realize how
simple it is unless you play with it
this doesn't even need a comma there if
you don't want that but the data that
needs to be passed and you have to have
your middleware token otherwise it's not
going to pass and I have an ID here of a
blog title so let's just look at this
real quick what's going to happen is
when we submit it it's going to go to
this build movie listing and what it's
going to do is it's going to grab a ver
it's going to create a variable named
test which is grabbing the post data for
blog
title and you're going to see why this
doesn't work in just a moment but let me
go ahead and just show you what we're
looking at I'd say here this is so if
everything worked well you would just be
able to go like test and that works okay
actually that's not what I'm going to do
because I need to update script all
right so here we go so we have our blog
test right so it returns nothing and the
reason why is because this is expecting
a blog title object which doesn't exist
because we're not doing actual normal
Django forum post so when we go to our
actual HTML page we actually need to in
our jQuery AJAX post we need to say we
need you to pass along the value in blog
title so we can do that by saying blog
title and this can be whatever you want
and then colon and then here we're going
to use jQuery to say grab me the ID of
blog title dot Val
and you can see here that the idea is
blog title so we're just simply by hand
saying pass along that value and then on
the back end Django is going to pick
that up with the request stop post and
by doing this method it's not going to
throw an exception if that is empty or
not there at all it's just going to
default to an empty string that's what
this tuple here does so let's go ahead
and let me just merge up that file real
quick now when we go over here that's
the wrong one there we go alright so now
that we've explicitly passed in the
title we can pass them whatever we
wanted it's just returning it as a JSON
object so whatever yeah it just simply
passes it back you notice no page
refresh just to jQuery behind the scene
call so anyway that is how you pass
custom data i'm using jquery jason ajax
django alright thank you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
