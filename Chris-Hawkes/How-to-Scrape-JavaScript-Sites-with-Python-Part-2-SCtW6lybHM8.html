order to get started with this Ajax
thing we're going to need to install
something called selenium so all you
gotta do is easy install selenium and
this is assuming you have easy install
installed and configured on your on your
operating system so I do have previous
examples on how you're supposed to
install that joint but go ahead and make
sure you install it so you're going to
see that it says that it is installed so
now that it's installed we can go ahead
and use it and we're going to be using
it within Visual Studio now hopefully
this new color and everything is going
to be easier for you guys to see the
text so I'm hoping that anyways it's you
know I think it's better than the white
background so in order to get started we
need to go out and import a few of the
things that we're going to need to get
this scraper working to actually be able
to scrape the Applebee site so we're
going to start with importing mechanize
and mechanize is what we've used in the
past to be able to fill out a form for
us so that identifies form fields and
things like that and then we just go
ahead and upload that joint now we're
going to go ahead and import URL Lib too
and what this will request the web page
is for us we're going to need to import
time so we can give some time breaks
between our request for the web pages
and then most importantly we need to
import selenium and you can see visual
studio if you do have it which is an
optional thing but if you do have it you
can see that it is actually
so from selenium you can see that the
intellisense is pulling up things that
we want to say so if it pulls up with
the recommendation and you can just use
your arrow keys and press ENTER and it
automatically types in a lot of this
craft so it definitely helps out with
some of the redundancy now a few things
that we do need with selenium to get
this to work we're going to want to do
like from selenium we're going to say
and it's actually selenium common dot
exceptions import no such attribute
exception in selenium webdriver comm and
keys import keys keys actually allows us
to press keys and things like that
got that jump we're going to go ahead
and import OS just in case we need that
and then we also want to import our re
module which stands for regular
expressions and to get started on let's
go ahead and let's just set up our
opening browser so we need to go ahead
and request the web page but before we
do that we kind of need to spoof our
browser so it looks like we're not just
a robot connecting to the site and we're
going to go ahead and use mechanized for
that so the typical thing that I usually
do is be our standing from browser and
just say mechanized browser and then we
do open and close parenthesis and now
you've now instantiate a new object so
the BR now carries all the mechanize
objects so we're going to be our set
handle robots false set handle refresh
I'm going to make that false
and then we're going to go ahead and add
our headers to our so when we request
the page we pass in the spoofed headers
so it looks like our user agent is
Firefox so they'll think we're a Firefox
browser and this is just a list of two
items that were passing in and our
headers and then we're going to do we're
going to instantiate the selenium object
so we're going to go browser get
actually we need instantiate the object
my back to us a browser equals webdriver
got Firefox so this is instantiating a
browser object which is going to pull up
Firefox using the selenium webdriver
that we just installed and then we're
going to say browser dot git
and you can see intellisense is just
doing wonders for us already and we're
going to do H you have to spell the
entire web address type Apple I'm used
to see sharp now and so I'm putting like
semicolons and things on top of our on
top of our at the end of my statements
which we don't need in Python alright so
now that we have this let's just go
ahead I don't want to make these videos
too long so this is just giving us a
taste of how we import and in some of
the features that we're going to be
using with mechanize to spoof user agent
and things like that so anyway let's go
ahead and do this a browser dot
webdriver got Firefox and we're going to
launch this joint and watch what it does
took a little bit longer than I expected
but as you can see it launched up our
bra browser here and it went to the
Applebee's location within the URL one
of the things the selenium-webdriver
it's you can use Chrome definitely not
ie but you can use Chrome and Firefox
had the most support as of about a year
ago and I haven't been doing too much
edge - with selenium in the last
probably six or seven months so I'm not
sure chrome is any better but I tend to
use Firefox and anyway so you can see
that it pulled up the web page here and
because of all the applications I have
running on my computer it's kind of slow
but it'll probably be a little bit
quicker on your computer because you
don't have so much stuff running so
anyway I'm going to go ahead and try to
kill this
and another thing too is a watch I'm
hoping that the reason why they went so
slow is just because I'm taping
recording two different things I have my
screen being taped I have the webcam
being scraped arrived that's great but
tape so anyway that's how you end up
requesting a web page with selenium
webdriver and in the next page we're
going to go ahead and just fill out the
form and then I think in the next video
after that would then we're going to be
extracting the data that we need so
please rate subscribe only rate if
you're going to give it a thumbs up just
saying thank you all right guys good
