tutorial series what we're going to
learn is Express and Express J s is a
framework that's built on top of node
we're going to get a fully working
application a website that's running and
Express a note it's going to be easy
it's going to be relatively basic and
we're probably going to make some
mistakes along the way
so just excuse me if I make a mistake I
might swear I might not hopefully I
don't so the first things first is you
need to actually download nodejs on your
system you can use this on Windows Mac
or Linux just go to Google type nodejs
it's going to go ahead and run an
installer and the installer is actually
going to install a tool called
NPM which you need in order to be able
to use node it's a package manager it's
a really cool tool that you'll end up
getting really familiar with but node.js
can just be downloaded and installed on
your machine and once you have that we
need to go ahead and figure out where
we're going to create our project so in
my case I'm going to pull up a command
prompt and I'd like to put my projects
inside the projects folder of my C Drive
and the name of this project I'm going
to be creating is called cause Koz so if
I want to make a project called cause
the first thing I should do is make a
directory which is going to hold the
project and I'm going to say make Durr
cause on Windows and by doing that I can
then go into that cause directory if I
spelled it right and then I can look at
the contents and there's nothing in
there so the first things first when you
do a new nodejs project you need to say
NPM I knit and that stands for
initialized and what this is going to do
is it's going to create a JSON file
which and Jason is just a JavaScript XML
type of semantics which it's basically
just a data data storage thing or data
visualization technique I don't know you
guys know what the hell it is hopefully
it's a terrible explanation of what it
is but it stands for JavaScript object
notation
basically the web's alternative to XML
so that you can easily access data in a
easy to transmit between you know
different customers that might be
interfacing to each other with different
systems they can use a JSON standard
which they used to use XML standards and
you can still use XML JSON it doesn't
matter but basically it's just a
standard of communicating data so that
said let's go ahead and you want to use
some sort of editor or some way that
you're going to actually store and write
your code I'm using Visual Studio which
is free and what I like about it is that
I can download and I can say open
website and what I do is I just pick the
folder that we just created and when I
say open it on the right-hand side it's
going to show me all the files and
everything from my project so that's why
I like to do that I like to use an
editor you don't have to but it's easy
for me to be able to just double click
and then see the contents of the file
this config file was just created for us
when we ran that inet command and just
so you know the reason for that is
because you can have different versions
of your app so if you go to distribute
your app to somebody else you can say
this inversion 1.0 and maybe you release
a version 1.2 and you'll be able to
differentiate you know with your
customers different versions of your app
and stuff like that so that's kind of
just this is just a basic for every
application that they think a note
application should have and your author
here should be like you know your name
so Chris Hawkes and you can change all
this stuff after the fact so it doesn't
have to be you know changed when or it
doesn't have to be initialized or
entered when you initialize it for the
first time so you can always come back
and update the values now that we have
this package JSON file we need to
actually go back to our command prompt
we need to install Express J s and just
so you guys know Express J s is a mini
framework and it's built on top of node
and it's actually very very minimalistic
so if you've ever used something like
Ruby on Rails or Django
this is much more minimalistic it
doesn't have any sort of authentication
out of the box it doesn't have any admin
it doesn't have a lot of things that
you're going to need for a web
application and that's that's actually
on purpose it wants to be very very
minimal
and leave a lot of that implementation
detail up to the to the end user so what
that means for you is that this thing's
not going to hold your hand but at the
same time it's not going to get in your
way and tell you you have to do things
this way and that way it pretty much
leaves up leaves a lot to you and what
and the downside is that you have to
learn a little bit more about how things
work upfront but the positive is that
once you learn and you do a lot of this
basic stuff that like maybe a Django or
Ruby on Rails does for you out the box
your learning experience is gonna be so
much more valuable with something like
this because once you you know you spend
that you front-load that that time in
that effort to learn and when you have
to go to adapt it or explain why
something doesn't work or whatever then
you're going to know so much more about
your application just the interworking
so it's you're going to be much more
intimate with it so that said let's go
over to install and Express and what
we're going to end up doing is we're
going to use the NPM NPM tool which is
installed with node so you just have to
say NPM and we're going to say install
and then we're going to say Express and
then - - save and the reason why we use
- - save is because it's going to
install Express locally into our project
here and then it's also going to add
Express to our JSON file that JSON
config file I was just showing you guys
so if I went ahead and I reload this
this file over here you're going to see
it now has a dependencies and it adds
Express as well as the Express version
that we're using so that way when you go
to distribute this application then you
run an NPM install on it it's actually
going to install all the dependencies
that the application needs so that's why
the - - expresses or I'm sorry save is
important when you go to install
something now another thing to get
familiar with is that when we go to our
folder you're going to see that the
cause directory now has this node
modules so all your node modules that
express needs are going to be inside of
here and then there's also going to be
any sort of additional modules that we
install are going to be put in here as
well so a lot of this stuff actually is
just required by Express
all right so now that we have that let's
go ahead and create our first page for
our application what I typically do is
just do an app j/s file so I like to say
app yes and this is like your main file
so this can be considered like your
settings file if you've ever used Django
or like your web config if you've done
asp.net and if you haven't done any of
that shit then don't worry about it this
can just be your dashboard basically
first things first is we need to say
variable Express equal require Express
and what this does is note has this
require thing where it actually looks
for the there's a cache that's created
for all the modules that your
application uses and if your module is
being requested for the first time it's
not going to exist inside the cache so
note is going to find the module by
looking at the main directory it's going
to look for an Express it's not going to
find it so then it's going to fall back
to the MPM the modules that I was just
showing you these are node modules and
it's going to look inside this folder or
if you can give it an explicit location
to where the module is located and we'll
show an example of that in a moment but
for right now by saying require Express
it's going to look for expressing your
main root directory it's not going to
find it and it will fall back into the
node modules and it will find it in
there so node handles a lot of that that
for us now next thing we want to do is
we want to create an app an app is
actually going to say equal Express so
we're actually making use of that
Express module that we've just imported
now we're going to create a routes
because everything needs a routes and
this is where we're actually going to
give it an explicit path to where it's
going to be able to find the module that
we're talking about so we're going to
have a module and a routes folder and
it's going to be called index now that
doesn't exist yet so let's go ahead and
create the routes folder inside of our
main root directory and we're going to
call that routes now inside of there
we're going to create an index j/s file
so right click if you're using my editor
if not you can use whatever you want and
we're going to go ahead and create this
index.js file so let's go back over to
the app dodge is alright so now we have
those
in there next thing we want to do is we
want to go down here we want to make use
of the route so we're going to say apt I
use and then we're going to I don't know
what it does that we're going to apt I
use and then we're going to give it just
a back slash I realize a forward slash
and we're going to save routes which is
the the module that we've just created
so we're going to reference it here
we're basically just saying hey use this
routes module which there's nothing
there yet it's just an empty file but
we're going to add to that in a moment
next thing we want to do is we want to
call app dot set and we're going to be
setting the port that our application is
going to be using so the first argument
we say port and then one of the I'm not
going to explain this part here just
type this in for right now mother F I
don't know why that keeps doing that
anyway I'm going to copy and paste I'm a
copy and paste because my order is being
stupid we're going to tell this thing to
listen on port nine ninety eighty and
the reason why is that you can put
whatever port you want but I have
several applications and that's just the
port that I decide that I want the local
host application to listen to so when we
go to run this application node has to
know what port to listen to now we're
going to make use of this port that
we've set by saying we're going to
create this let me zoom out and you want
to just type this verbatim what we're
doing is we're creating a server object
and we're saying listen on port and the
port is set here so ninety eighty and
then print this to the line so that way
when we start the application this will
get printed and we'll know that it did
something that the application should be
should be started so now we could
actually run our application by going to
our folder and saying node app KS and
right now it's saying router dot use
requires middleware begotten object see
there's nothing there so what we need to
do is go ahead and fix that so let's go
over to this index folder or not routes
and we're going to add some stuff to it
so first things first is we need to just
like in the last file we need to make
use of the Express so we're going to say
variable Express require Express and
then the second line we're going to
create a router object and we're going
to use a built-in router feature of
Express so we're going to say variable
router equals Express router now we're
going to go ahead and tell it to listen
to just the forward slash which is just
basically your domain name so if you
have new movies comm this would be new
movies a copy your home page or
google.com or whatever it is and we're
just going to print out this straight
you know HTML test this application now
finally in order for a module to work
you need to actually export and this is
where the error message came along
because we had pointed to a file that
actually doesn't do this module that
exports which it actually needs to do so
what we're doing is we're saying export
router so we create a router we're
setting our router get method and then
we're also exporting it so it can be
required so now this isn't going to blow
up when we try to run you out so now you
can see it's app dot starter doesn't
blow up if we go ahead and we go over to
our localhost address by saying one two
seven and then give it a colon right
here and then the name or the port
number that you wanted to listen to so
we go here we should be able to see the
test this application the message being
displayed all right guys so we're gold
in there so now the next thing we're
going to do in the next video is we're
going to set up how to listen to CSS
files and stuff like that so we'll get
into that in the next video thanks for
watching guys please subscribe thank you
