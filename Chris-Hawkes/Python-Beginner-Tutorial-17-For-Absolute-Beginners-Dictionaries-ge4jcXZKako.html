this video we want to actually look at
Python dictionaries and this is
something that a lot of tutorials
actually took cover in the beginning and
I actually postponed it towards the
middle of this tutorial series and
there's not a whole lot of reason why
except for the fact that for me like I
feel like Python dictionaries are not
going to be used a ton you're going to
use them but they're not used a ton not
like some of the other stuff that we
focused on two dates but now it's time
to go ahead and touch on dictionaries
and dictionaries are just like the
dictionary book that nobody ever goes to
anymore because nobody reads books they
go online and whatever but you have a
definition and you have the actual key
word lookup so you have the the key
which is like the key so key is a smart
and yep your your value of that in your
dictionary it's going to be this
paragraph explaining what smart is so a
Python just like any other variable
we're going to say my dictionary which
could be any sort of name but this is
just a variable name and then we do
these curly braces so this is the only
time you use curly braces in the Python
languages with dictionaries and if I
wanted to then say my dictionary and I'm
going to do inside square brackets I'm
going to define a new key and my new key
is going to be called name and I'm going
to say equals Chris pause so now if I
wanted to print that I'm going to say
print my dictionary and then reference
name so if I press play it's going to
print out Chris Hawkes now this is
actually creating an assignment after
the fact where I said you know what I
said you know do this after name or my
dictionary has been defined I actually
don't have to do that I could do it this
way when I actually define my dictionary
by saying name and then with a colon it
separates the value now I can say Chris
Paul
so it's going to be lowercase that's
fine now if I want to add another value
I can say height so height and we'll say
six one right now we'll just do that so
let's start and print height you can see
it prints out six one now how do I
delete a value from my dictionary let's
go ahead and this time instead of
printing off everything let's go ahead
and print off the entire dictionary so
when we do this we can see it prints off
all the values there's only two we have
a name and an equal square Sox we have a
height and equals six one so what if I
say you know I want to get rid of height
and then I would just say delete which
is de elqui word I'm going to say my
dictionary and then I pass in the key of
the that I want to delete so it's going
to remove height from my dictionary so
when I go to the print down here you're
going to see that it no longer has
height so if I wanted to add it back in
you guys saw how I did that before I can
just say my dictionary height equals six
once and now it's back
so that is how you delete and keywords
or I'm sorry dictionary now how do we
look through all the elements inside of
a dictionary this is something that you
will commonly have to do well actually
you want to commonly do it because you
won't use dictionaries that often not in
my opinion depending on what you do you
know that may or may not be a true
statement but either way I don't use
them all that often but how do we
iterate over them and we do that using a
for statement like we've done before
we're going to say key value and once
again these are temporary valid
variables you can call them whatever you
want but it makes sense to call them a
key in a value because each item in your
dictionary which is separated by a comma
has a key and a value key value so we're
going to say in and this is where it
gets a little bit weird because we're
going to say my Dictionary dot items and
this is something that is different from
earlier versions of Python because they
used to say it er items which is weird
but we're using Python 3 so don't worry
about that
and we're going to say print key and
then on another line we'll say print
value so watch what happens let's go
ahead put a breakpoint here so we've got
to run this and here's our key height
okay so that's another weird thing is
that dictionaries are not ordered just
because you create them in a particular
order doesn't mean that they're going to
be read in any particular order so
here's the key height here's the value
prints them out here's the next one now
our key is name and our value is Chris
Hawkes so that is that is probably where
do you guys that it actually goes out of
order so that's the thing about
dictionaries there is no order to this
madness and typically you don't need it
to be ordered because you're looking
things up by the key if you know the key
it doesn't matter what order it's in
it's going to it's going to match the
key and it's going to be fine now that
make brings up the point what happens if
you define something twice I say name
equals new name what happens let's go
ahead and print
my dictionary and will say name so we've
defined this thing twice and the
interesting thing is that Python is not
going to complain about it but you
accidentally overrode a value inside of
your dictionary so even though this was
defined first and an order doesn't
matter it does matter and when the
actual value is being created so if you
ran this multiple times new name is it
came after the first name and it still
gets overwritten if we did it again you
would see the same thing I'll just say
pay so I was in my favorite band and my
dog's name and we did this again and you
can see it's Bayside so that is some
weirdness just thought I would share
that with you the fact that when you
actually go to retrieve those values
they could be in any order you want but
when it goes to like overriding values
by accident it doesn't matter the order
it it will grab the last one that got to
find and that's the one that goes in
alright guys so that's going to be it
with our dictionary tutorial in Python
in the next video we're going to
actually look at another reason why
dictionaries came first before I talk
about what we're going to talk about in
the next video
all right guys thanks for watching
please subscribe please share please
vote up thank you
bye hey guys so a lot of you asked me
how do I get my foot in the door to
become a programmer and I just want to
take a moment to mention dev Mountain
coding boot camp is a 12-week intensive
course that focuses on the technologies
of the here-and-now for web development
some of the things that they're actually
teaching in the Suevi course it's geared
to get you into the industry by focusing
on things like jQuery nodejs react
angular how to use github so a lot of
the things that you're going to need to
do as a developer as soon as you start
they're going to be teaching you in this
and this coding bootcamp and the entire
goal is to be able to get you into the
industry within 12 weeks so if you guys
are interested in learning more
information about Deb mountain coding
bootcamp just check out the link in the
description tab of this video thank you
for watching and have a good day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
