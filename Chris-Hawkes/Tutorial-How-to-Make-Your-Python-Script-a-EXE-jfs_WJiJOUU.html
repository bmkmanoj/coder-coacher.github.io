this video what I want to do is show you
guys how to install Python and also I
already have Python installed on my
machine so that the little tidbit here
is that you can have multiple versions
of Python installed on your machine the
latest version that I have right now is
three point six point one but in order
to make distributable software with
Python you need to have three four
because the holy library is out there
that will make it into an exe file for
your Python program as well as being
able to install it on users machines and
things like that you need to have Python
3.4 and earlier if you wanted to read
more and actually absolves why that is
the case I have a blog here on my
website which talks about some of the
Python bindings and then they recently
updated their bytecode and Python and
this actual update from the Python
community here ended up breaking a lot
of stuff
so unfortunately projects like pi to exe
which are very popular for making python
and the exe files is no longer you know
working on on python 3.5 or 3.6 so if
you want to check out more information
make sure you guys visit my web site
hipster koat.com there's all kinds of
blogs tutorials on everything
I'll just coder based it's coder based
web site so make sure you guys follow me
there as well alright so in order to get
Python that's good and just we're just
going to say Python 3.4 installer
because I'm of Windows so I like to have
a you know MSI installer second go down
here to the download page and I'm going
to click the
eighty-six installer however over the 60
border should work alright so this is
going to install you now once again the
interesting thing and this setup here is
that we're going to have two versions of
Python so I want to show you guys how to
actually get that all set up for you
alright so here we go we're going to
install for all users it's going to go
into the default Python 34 folder that's
fine with me let's click on advanced
real quick now all right so next and now
this side just I'm going to get this
installed
all right sir hello we're finished we're
done I'm going to open up a command
prompt roleplay Dante Python you can
still see I have the Python three point
six point one being found what I need to
do is go over to where Python is
installed and this is in my C Drive here
someone to go into the C Drive Python 34
what I want to do is I want to rename
the executable here to Python 3 4
alright so that way if I type if
everything is on the path here if I type
our open a command line and type python
3 4 that's not going to work so now we
need to add this to our environment
variables so if you're on Windows what
you want to do is just search for
environment variables and we're going to
go ahead and edit this we're going to
click on environment variables and then
inside of our path here what I want to
do is on edit disk and we're going to
add a new option here and what I want to
do is actually point to where this is
located also what I can do is actually
all right we're just going to copy this
C colon forward slash and we're going to
say Python 34 and the first thing we do
is say we'll just say Python 3 for going
to work and I'm going to add another one
which is C colon board slash right I'm
34 scripts ok close this down now that
we close that down but I open up another
command line and type Python 34 and you
should now be able to run Python 34 so
what we did there is we edited the
environment variables which is always
confusing for newer developers that are
just getting started but Windows has to
know when you type Python 34 it doesn't
just magically know what bites on 34 is
what you've done is you say hey when so
many types Python vary for we put this
path inside of that that
that we put this folder location inside
of the path and windows uses the path to
say oh you said Python 34 let me check
the path and see if python 34 executable
matches anywhere and if it does it goes
ahead and execute that program so that's
the magic behind why we can open up
command prompt in place take python 34
in run type on three four and we can
type python and going to run 3.6 so now
we have two versions of Python on our
machine so if you guys want to use pip
install with a specific version of
Python on a Windows machine what we
would do is a python 3 4 for the
executable - mm and then say tip and
that will actually use the Python
version that you that you want to use
for pip install because what we want to
do in this video is actually install the
Python e pi PI to exe project that
actually works with python 3 4 so let's
go ahead and say python 3 4 type in m
tips installed PI 2 e XE oh ux e
all right there we go so if I say python
3 4 and M 4 PI 2 e se then you should
have no errors now because python pi GFC
is now installed in Python 3.4 if you
ever wanted to to actually figure out
what's installed and everything if you
go to where Python is installed you
going to Lib and site packages you can
see everything you've installed so you
can see but I was running that command
we installed PI 2 Exe so it can be found
you know in that location that's what
happens anytime we do a pip install
alright so let's go ahead and figure out
well what we want to use for writing our
code and what I like you is Visual
Studio code because it's free so make
sure you guys check that out Visual
Studio code it's also open source which
is nice so it can work on all kinds of
different Brown and different operating
systems the devil it is I have Python
already
my machine so what I'm going to do is
open this up to say new a new window and
I want to open up folders so I'm going
to put all my projects that anytime I'm
doing tutorials everything I'm not just
to toriel here and we're going to go
ahead and put in here you know what we
can put it inside the pipe on folder and
we'll say your folder PI to e so in
there we're going to select that folder
so now I've opened it up into that
folder location so in order to get this
working what we want to do is go ahead
and create a new file and we're just
going to call this hello T Y and inside
here we're just going to say print hello
world and just a simple program
simplified on Scrubs I don't need to
worry about the winter and I'm going to
add another file here which someone is
all set up CY
this is the actual file that PI to where
Exe needs in order for this all to work
so I'm going to say from this to this
and dot for imports cut out and this is
something that was installed for you but
it's by default when you install PI to
exe so we also need to use hi to exe and
that's what I'm going to import that
here and then we need to say setup and
we're going to console equals and then
we just give it the location to to where
our file is located so since it's in the
same directory we can just say hello
ducky why I hate how it keeps asking me
that so we can say hello hello dot py
and it tells it to look here to actually
make the executable file so in Visual
Studio if I right click and say reveal
and Explorer I can open up the Explorer
I'm going to type in here CMD so it
opens up the command to that directory
so you can see we're inside the
directory now and what I want to do is
say Python make sure you called with the
right version 34 and I'm going to say
set up top CY and then I'm going to give
it the name hi UNC sometimes I have to
use the SE to create an executable file
and you can see that all this stuff God
has done and then
now if I look I have a distributable
folder here so if I CD into that you can
see that we now have its hello DMC
something like hello DMC you can see our
own telework so now what I can do is I
can actually take that executable file
and I can distribute it out to whoever I
want and all I have to do is just simply
click and then they're going to have a
working Python installation now however
there is one caveat to that and that is
that PI to exe does not guarantee that
this thing is going to run because
unfortunately especially on Windows with
Python you have to have a certain DLL
which is called if you look at the
documentation here this M Tim SVC our
DLL is necessary it has to be on a
user's machine in order for them to be
able to execute this Python script
because otherwise you wouldn't want to
expect somebody just have Python
installed in their machine or anything
and that's fine but this DLL has to work
in order for that Python executable file
to be to be able to be run so the best
thing to do is actually to use this
project down here which is called enno
setup which is free to use and this will
allow you to actually make that a
requirement to that venn dll file gets
included in an installation so when when
a user downloads your software they're
going to want to run the wizard and this
is what this project right here which is
free to use provides you with so you can
actually have the Installer and the
Installer can even install that DLL file
that's necessary on Windows so that your
executable does work the way that you
want it to work when you distribute it
now also once again this is not going to
work for Python three point five or
three point three point six so as of
right now as of this video's time and
date you have to use Python three four
in order for these projects to work so
anyway guys thanks for watching man have
