we're looking at is a MongoDB and we're
looking at the good and bad of MongoDB
so we're trying to figure out whether or
not this is going to be a good option
for us and really what we kind of
compare is we look at whether or not
MongoDB being what it is is it better
than your traditional relational
database that is like my sequel Oracle
Postgres cool or any of those other
relational databases so first we need to
look at you know what MongoDB is all
right so MongoDB is a database system
that was created several years ago the
company was created by MongoDB
incorporated and you can see it has a
few founders that actually went ahead
and built a company back in 2007 and
errata Palo Alto California so Silicon
Valley and they have a lot of venture
capital funding and they've had a lot of
help and being able to you know build
this it was originally built by Tenjin
which is the name of the company before
it became MongoDB incorporated and you
can see it over here so it's now been
changed to MongoDB incorporated and just
recently MongoDB has actually released a
new plan to be able to support more
corporate database structures so the
bottom line is that that MongoDB is and
was created by a large company the
company's growing and MongoDB is now
being adopted by a lot of actual you
know major websites out there from sites
that include like MTV Foursquare Forbes
comm and a bunch of other ones like the
GE company General Electric so there's a
lot of companies using MongoDB so we're
going to be looking at the good of
MongoDB like what are the good things
about it so number one MongoDB makes it
very very much easier to actually scale
your database out horizontally
which is also known as shorting and
MongoDB does that seamlessly where you
don't have to bring your database down
you can just essentially add another
MongoDB instance and MongoDB actually
handles load balancing between the two
MongoDB instances that you have and
maybe you have a hundred instances that
are using you know across different
servers on what MongoDB handles all of
that that complication for you if you
were using like a relational database
like my sequel it takes a lot of skill
and and expertise to be able to to short
out as well using something like when
you have my sequel where databases have
to be in communication with each other
as to what's being written to and being
read from and the MongoDB just handles a
lot of that out of the box where you're
not going to find that with my sequel so
if you're using one my sequel instance
and most websites are but if you you
know grow to become big when you have to
have multiple my sequel databases on a
cluster things get very very complicated
and MongoDB was made specifically to
ease that sort of transition so that is
one part in one area where it does shine
so MongoDB is schema lists so you have a
database schema which is your actual
database design so when you're in like
my sequel traditional relational
database you're going to define your
columns of end tables so you'll have
like a music table and then the music
table will have columns like music
artist genre location so you have all
that you know the database table defined
and then you go ahead and build that
table however everything you insert into
that table has to follow the same schema
so it becomes very difficult when you
have a my sequel database with millions
of records and then you want to add a
new column to your database table let's
just say you add a new column for a
label like a record label now you have
this new column and you have to update a
million records with this new data
because you can't just have you know
maybe you have a column where the data
can't be null so you have a million
invalid records in your database now and
that's known as
database migration where you end up
having to take an existing database
table and migrating it to a new database
structure because your schema has has
changed
MongoDB doesn't have a schema so you can
just change your document type and it's
just going to work you know seamlessly
without having to deal with following up
a lot of your existing data that's in
your MongoDB instance or database hi
MongoDB is Jason I'm sorry JavaScript
for the most part so javascript is
job-job
javascript object notation so jason is
the main data transfer language that you
have among websites now it's XML still
popular but Jason's now probably the
most popular with all the restful
services out there so the JSON data that
is being returned by your MongoDB
database can be used directly with you
know client-side frameworks JavaScript
frameworks that deal with JSON data so
frameworks like react or angular they
are all frameworks built around JSON for
the most part so dealing with JSON data
and being able to build components in
your website from that data
well MongoDB gives it back to you in the
format that you need so you don't have
to do any sort of transition from
getting a bunch of data from a typical
relational database like my sequel than
having to serialize that into a valid
jason syntax and return it from the
server so that's one advantage of
MongoDB is that that transaction is
already in JSON format that's a typo
there but MongoDB is no sequel database
so it's not relational at all so what
that means is that you and this is
actually a good and a bad because
typically when you have a relational
database you can have several tables
that are connected to each other so you
have like a person table and then you
have a let's say a band table and a band
table could point to multiple person
objects right well in MongoDB you
actually don't
have that you actually have one document
object so basically have one object
where instead of pointing to addition
other tables that are within well what
you would call a table in that
particular structure you're just going
to have the people objects be embedded
in your MongoDB object instance so it's
it's a little bit different and that
you're not pointing to these you know
relational objects I mean it's all just
within your MongoDB instance or your
object so MongoDB is very performant
however a lot of the benchmarks are
misleading so everything I've seen to
say that MongoDB is somehow magically
faster than relational databases the
bottom line is that there's really no
magic bullet just because you know some
query performs better in some particular
instance um a lot of that can be done it
can be you know the way the code is
written or the hardware on which the
code is being executed a lot of
different things that would you know
give you skewed results as to whether or
not a typical relational database is
faster or no sequel database like
MongoDB is faster so the bottom line is
that they're both a very performant I
just went ahead and mentioned that Mongo
is performant here all right now we're
going to get into some of the bad of
MongoDB it cannot do sequel joins
because you know there are no relational
there's no relationships in MongoDB so
like typically when you do a sequel
query you can sequel data from multiple
tables and then join all that data
together into one you know one object
and that's not something that MongoDB
can do you would actually have to do
that manually and doing workarounds to
be able to achieve a similar result so a
lot of people say you shouldn't be doing
a lot of joins in my sequel anyway
because they're not very performant but
the bottom line is you can't do it in
MongoDB so I'm not a database expert but
that's definitely a downside that I hear
from MongoDB
data designing to be thought out well
since it's not relational meaning that
you can't just add an additional table
and then point to that using you know
relationships in a typical relational
database are like you could in a typical
relational database and MongoDB really
need to think out how you know these
embedded objects are going to work and
and and try to you know get all of that
resolved while you're designing your
database so if you're if you know that
you're going to have a banned object and
the ban is going to have multiple people
embedded within it you need to make sure
that you don't want to eventually just
you know add a new record label object
and otherwise you know you could you
could run into some problem so basically
it's a downside that you're supposed to
be able to try to make sure that you're
not going to be having to change your
MongoDB database structure a whole lot
after you you go ahead and and think it
out initially this is one of the big
things that MongoDB is is not good for
is acid transactions so acid stands for
atomicity consistency isolation and
durability and basically it's a set of
properties again guarantee a database
transaction is either going to go
through fully or it's not going to try
to execute at all so basically if
anything fails and sort of like if
you're updating several areas and one
area fails the entire transaction will
be rolled back and fail and a normal you
know acid safe relational database
structure in MongoDB it doesn't do that
so you can have partial updates run into
some sort of error and then your
database could be fouled up to an extent
so you can have like an insert that you
did and only half of it got inserted so
essentially you lost the other half of
data and you have bad data in there
because you you only updated half of the
query and you never failed like in a
normal relation 'old eita base that's
acid safe it would go ahead and update
run to fail and then just retract itself
and that database entry wouldn't be
there so it's really bad that you can
end up having a messed up database
and that also goes into the the next
part here is that amount of DB has been
known to have lost information so you
want to backup your database often like
literally like you could do a
transaction and from what I hear half
that data could just you know just
disappear in the process so it's not
really proven or anything like that as
far as I know you know but they're just
bugs that are reported where apparently
it's not the data is not 100% safe at
all times so if you do complicated
transactions you could run into a
problem where your database is just not
or your data is not there like it should
be so that being said just make sure
you're backing up your data often if
you're using MongoDB so really guys
that's that's really the all the pros
and cons that I can think of with
MongoDB there's not a whole lot of
alternatives if you want to stick in the
JavaScript world something that's good
with nodejs the mount or DB is
definitely like a partner with node it's
part of the mean stack which you know
it's a node express Mongo and angular
and it's definitely getting a lot more
corporate support as of late it's
getting a lot more money it's actually
starting to find ways of being able to
make money to try to keep it so keep it
around for longevity there's a few other
no sequel alternatives out there but
none of them are or many of them are
actually much more complicated than what
MongoDB would be and ultimately you know
it's going to get better as time goes on
and it's still relatively futuristic on
the set of technology so if you want to
be in the here and now it's probably a
good idea to use MongoDB if you want be
a little bit more safe or if you're
building some sort of financial
transaction or you know some important
data like real time analysis and things
like that you may want to stick with a
traditional relational database and as
far as the sharding capabilities between
either relational database like my
sequel or using MongoDB a lot of
companies love you know simple websites
are never going to have to run into any
sort of scalability issues like that but
if you are looking to be big you can
succeed using both but you might have an
easier time as a smaller operation using
something like MongoDB then
trying to get database experts involved
in clustering and sharding a relational
my sequel setup alright guys thanks for
watching have a good day please

could please thank you bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
