video I've kind of changed my style a
bit today maybe i'm just lazy but I feel
like if I'm giving an example like
nobody needs to sit there and watch me
type of this stuff you just need to know
okay where can I copy and paste this
stuff to make it work and where can I
get just a quick run through of how it
operates and etc so I kind of went
through making Ajax calls and stuff like
that and instead of like you know like I
said watching me type I just feel like
it's so much better to say okay this is
the finished output line by line this is
what's going on and you know if you
somebody wants to copy and paste and
they just pause the video and type it in
since that's what they're going to be
doing it for following along and
watching me type except this saves in
time so anyway in this video what I'm
trying to do is show you guys what on an
AJAX call how we can make additional
calls and I found it kind of helpful
because I actually had a look on stack
overflow and stuff like that just to
kind of get an idea on how to make sure
that I wasn't firing my program too much
in bogging my website down so i have a
javascript function here that says a
need rating list and this is just a back
end page that i don't have publicly
facing or anything like that but when i
click on this link it causes this
javascript function down here and it
makes an AJAX call it displays my little
loading animation makes the ajax call it
gets a JSON object back this jason
message and then it passes that to
another function down here which is get
rating and it passes in the JSON that
message and what Jason that message is
returning it's returning a list of movie
names which is essentially a list of
strings that don't have ratings so then
I have a script that I need to fire
which goes out in it it uses my
algorithm to rank movies on new movies
calm for those movies that don't have
right rankings so that's what's going on
here so this second Ajax call it's doing
the progress show again
and then when you want to loop through a
list of objects using jQuery you use
this each method and then what I'm
passing in is my data my data is
actually the Jason messages and once
again it's a list of movie strings and
then it says for each one of those then
you're going to call this function which
passes in an object and an item and the
object or really i say item let me keep
the terms correct here item is going to
be Jason die message because there can
be multiple jason messages but in this
case there's really one so it says go
over Jason up messages if there's more
than one it would loop through those as
well but in this case we have a list of
strings so just try not to pay too much
attention to that and then I is each
item in an adjacent message so I is
going to be the actual movie string name
so once again this is just a big ass
bunch of strings of movie names this is
the biggest bunch of strings of movie
names this is an individual movie name
which is just one piece of a big-ass
list of movie name so it's going to go
into this function here it creates a
little timer and it just says set
timeout make the Ajax call which is just
standard it and this Ajax call goes to
my django back end and it actually fires
a script from my server and then you see
here after the end of the function we
just do a comma and we add another
argument here and this is actually
giving the time out between calls so
30,000 is 30000 milliseconds which means
30 seconds so what I'm saying is that
for every list of movie names that i
have in this jason object i want to
delay firing that script for 30 seconds
so i fire the script wait 30 seconds
fire the script wait 30 seconds fire the
script wait 30 seconds
so if you need something similar to this
you're probably just going to need to
just copy this down and and play around
with it this is making an AJAX call just
so you can see where it's going it's
going to a back end here where it here
it is so it's actually firing a script
here so you don't need to pay too much
as into this i'm not going to get too
much into this but this is it's just the
Django back in so that that's what so
that's where it's being called so to see
this thing in action let's go here we're
going to click get rating it's going to
give me a list of movies that I don't
have ratings for and this is a very ugly
list but because there's no separation
zorda limiters or anything like that but
don't pay attention to that that's not
the point of this and this isn't
publicly accessible anyway it's just for
me as an administration tool now if
you're using chrome you can right-click
and inspect element Firefox is similar
if I go to network i can see jquery
calls being made and you can see that 30
seconds has passed and now it's actually
fired this script so if i double click
on it or if i just simply click on it
you can see the headers and I said it's
firing a get rating script and it's
passing in a title parameter which is
the name of this movie here nine
millimeter so that's what it's on and
another 30 seconds passes you'll see
that this thing fires another script
there goes so you can see this this one
now is being called any double click on
that actually I mean to do it
there's our preview headers okay yeah a
million ways to die in the west so it's
all encoded or whatever so it's hard to
read but you can see that it's on the
next one and then it'll be on the next
one and the next one so if you have
that's how you you you pause execution
on I'm just going to kill this program I
don't want it to keep running so anyway
that's how you see what's going on with
Ajax call and and now you can pause
between execution on an AJAX call using
Django or really you're just using and
it's just JavaScript code but in this
particular case it is a jangle website
that's being called alright thank you
for watching I appreciate it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
