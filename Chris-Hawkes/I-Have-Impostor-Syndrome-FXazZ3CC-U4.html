this video of what I'm talking about is
impostor syndrome and in case you guys
have never heard about that
I mean impostor syndrome is actually a
feeling of being able to or it's really
the inability to internalize and
accomplishments and a persistent fear of
being exposed as a fraud so I think in
the IT industry at least for me
personally speaking this is something
that is very real I've actually I've
seen it with other people and then for
me I like to worry about things that
that I shouldn't even worry about but
this has certainly affected me when I
was first getting into the industry when
I was teaching myself how to program and
I would you know make accomplishments
and I learned a new technology or I get
my website up and running I was very
very proud of that but that was in an
arena of just myself essentially so I
wasn't competing with other programmers
and you know I I basically had a self a
sense of accomplishment that was
probably fragile I would say although it
seems like as time went on I I started
to understand that I was getting better
but that I wasn't nearly as good as I
you know as I wanted to be or as other
programmers and then finally when I
actually got a job at an enterprise
development where I was actually working
with other programmers that had been in
this industry for a long time a lot of
them had gone to top IT schools around
the country I was like there's no way
that I'm gonna be able to compete with
some of these guys because I am a fraud
like I don't know anything about well
really I did know about that stuff but
now that's my my ability to you know
internalize my accomplishments or to to
recognize my accomplishments that I've
actually made like I had no confidence
in myself whatsoever that I had actually
learned a lot of this material that
other people that I was working with
didn't even really know and and to some
extent obviously there were people that
knew way more than I did and that my
mind was completely blown at certain
things that we have to do in enterprise
development you know when I was first
starting things like you know just
repositories and and understanding how
code branches work multi-tier
architecture you know the fact that
there's like divisions and the large
company for pretty much everything so
there's a whole political game that you
end up getting involved in the way
businesses like term a lot of stuff like
things like agile scrum waterfall you
see you know different software
methodologies then like unit testing
hundred percent unit testing using unit
tests mocking frameworks and stuff like
that so all this stuff like it's very
very mind-boggling when you first come
into it and imposter syndrome like I
think definitely took hold of me and it
still does to an extent to this day
because I'm like man I'm not even very
good at algebra and like I haven't
really taken you know any calculus
courses and even though I'm using lambda
calculus and c-sharp and in Python and
and you know in other languages it's
like I'm not really recognized the fact
that you know I do do pretty new
advanced calculations at times now I'm
not a graphics programmer I'm not a game
programmer so I'm not doing a whole lot
of really complex math but I mean there
are some relatively complex you know
things that that I would fail to see
that I was doing you know to make me
feel like I wasn't an impostor so the
problem is though as I see it is that it
really comes down to confidence and and
for me personally I've never been an
overly confident person like I've never
been an overly overly confident person
in the way that that I look and you know
I've always felt you know kind of
nervous around crowds and it's just kind
of you know who I am I think and when I
went into enterprise development I was I
was definitely an imposter at times and
you know at first but I was able to work
my way through it now here you I am you
know four years into enterprise
development and I will still say that I
do still have that sense at times like
when there's there are certain things
that I just I feel like I'm never gonna
figure it out and the thing is is that
even though even when these times come
along and like I run into a problem
where it seems like I'm the only one
that has
this issue and maybe it's a it's a
problem with my machine or it's a
problem with my code or it's just some
other like you know settings problem
that I have to be personally responsible
for for figuring it out and I feel like
you know it may not even rest on my end
and like you know how am I ever gonna
find this problem and then it turns out
you know it's some sort of stuff that
you forgot to do you know and like all
of a sudden you know you get that done
your confidence is back like and that's
that's kind of a weird reality I think
an IT at least for me and and that's
because I do suffer from this impostor
syndrome I feel like I am an impostor I
didn't go to I didn't go to college for
this stuff I'm taking my first IT course
wasn't which is an intro to computer
information systems at a community
college right now and I'll tell you you
know the class is a joke like the
content is a joke I'm really wasting my
money for a piece of paper at this point
that that's the way I feel about you
know at least we know what I'm learning
so far and I guess that sounds like a
jerk saying that but I just I get so
basically I you know I'm not really
learning anything I'll put it that way
I'm not learning a whole lot and it's
just kind of you know just going through
the motions really and so so that's it I
you know this is the first computer
science course I've ever taken and I'm
working with you know intellectuals and
in a you know a very complex field in a
very large company and a lot of these
guys are super smart and I say guys and
I shouldn't say guys there's a lot of
you know women through that work that
are just as smart so there it can
definitely be daunting when like I
talked to somebody they went to the
University of Virginia or William and
Mary or you know University of Maryland
I know one person that came from you
know the West Coast thing is University
of California I work with he's a real
bright guy but you know all these
different major universities and and and
then even beyond that sometimes you have
these universities you have some guy
that you know that you think is like
some hotshot maybe because he is and
then you find out well he's been in this
IT game for twenty years for instance I
worked with a guy he's one of the better
programmers I've ever worked with and
and since we do a lot of remote stuff
and you'll find a lot of
remote things I I would listen to this
guy's voice and meetings and stuff and I
had envision like literally like a 22
year old phenom coming out of college
and that this you know God was super
smart and everybody went to him for you
know for answers and things like that he
you know he just has this level of
genius to him that like I feel like I
might never might never be able to get
and you know I would feel like an
impostor around him I'm like man he
probably went to some major college and
Here I am I'm self-taught I'm a Python
guy but we're doing c-sharp and mostly
these people don't even respect Python
and you know they I know about Django
but they don't know about Django but you
know that that's irrelevant you know in
this situation because we're doing you
know JavaScript and knock-out and
c-sharp and all this other stuff and and
you know basically my mind starts
thinking that this guy you know is a
certifiable genius must be some young
hotshot but then it comes to find out
that or comment I come to find out that
you know this guy's been working for a
consultancy gig for a long time for a
major consulting firm and he's been in
this game for almost 20 years so like
I'm not giving myself enough credit here
I am self-taught completely can't think
of the words like Otto died attic or
something like that basically when
you're self-taught I don't even know how
to pronounce that word because I never
went to school but anyway I've heard
that term before and somebody called me
that actually which I thought was
interesting I had to look it up and
basically means you're self-taught but
you know Here I am self-taught and I
don't have any confidence and I'm you
know I'm playing this guy up for being
even bigger than he is and you know even
though he's really good it's like he's
been there for 20 years and and it
doesn't matter at this at that point
which school you went to like you could
have went to Berkeley and if you're
working you know with me then it
probably means that you're not inventing
the new you know encryption algorithm
that you know the federal government is
going to start using to to spy on your
stuff and you know I mean like basically
sometimes we play up these things and
it's all just impostor syndrome at work
so basically how do you avoid this and
it for me the best way to do it is just
you know don't listen to the naysayers
don't listen to your naysaying
personality if you have one like me I
mean I I get into situations where I
feel like I you know I'm not as good as
other people and that's just you know
that's just a confidence that I'm a
going to get the better of me or the
lack of confidence anyway and there's no
reason for it there really isn't it's
not going to help anything all of us are
capable of learning this information and
like I said we're not all like meant to
be you know the person that's going to
discover the secrets to the quantum
world and all this stuff I mean there
are certain things that we do that we we
can and can't do and I mean if you just
if you focus on the negative you know I
think that it never helps but one of the
things that does get to me is that you
don't want to work with jerks because
there are jerks out there that will try
to belittle you and anybody that's
belittling you if you already have a
lack of self-confidence you should
probably try to find your way onto a
better team
because that can be an actual reality
work you will find that some people are
jealous of the fact that they went to
the college and that you know they feel
like they've you know they paid all this
money for a university degree and that
you know they feel like you are an
impostor because you came along and you
did this and and arguably you may do
things better than them and in some
cases and sometimes you won't but if
somebody does hold a grudge against that
and they try to treat you you know
poorly for that I would definitely
suggest you try to find a different
environment because I have actually
worked in situations like that where you
have somebody trying to belittle you and
and it's never going to help especially
for something you know as fragile as
this industry we're like literally our
information can become outdated within a
matter of weeks you know days he'll
hours depending on you know what
decisions that are made so anyway guys
it's definitely a real thing
just focus on your craft focus on not
you know not listening to what these
people have to say if father saying is
negatives and stuff it doesn't mean you
know don't take any criticism or don't
try to you know learn how to respond to
constructive criticism that's not what
I'm saying
I'm just simply saying that you need to
be able to identify when somebody's
trying to bring you down and you need to
be able to identify when these negative
thoughts start cropping up into your
mind we know why are they occurring is
it because you can't figure out a
problem is it because you didn't get
enough sleep is it because you work for
a jerk is it because you're not eating
healthy enough you're not getting enough
exercise you fought with your wife you
have your kids that are acting you know
or something there's so many different
things in your life that could end up
you know causing you to struggle a
little bit more with what your daily
tasks are so I think and in my
particular case I actually started
writing down a journal when I started
getting headaches because I wanted to
find out because I felt like it was it
was diet related and I've still really
pinpointed it down to like if I start
eating like junk food and stuff like
that like too much junk food
I actually feel those effects so at 34
I'm starting to feel those effects and
and I'm making note of it you know so
it's the same thing with this impostor
syndrome so I don't get plagued by it
nearly as much four years into this game
I feel like I can compete with anybody
out there given enough time and
opportunity and I don't expect everybody
to believe in me in fact a lot of the
viewers you know they respond with
criticism to some of the videos and the
things I have to say and that's fine too
but you know the whole point is that you
have to hit take note of you know when
things are bringing you down try to try
to be proactive and preventing that from
occurring and and ultimately just know
that you're not an impostor it's not a
real thing it's just it's just our minds
at work alright guys thanks for watching
and have a good night take care bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
