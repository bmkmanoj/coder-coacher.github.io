brought to you by dev Mountain I never
went to school for computer science in
fact the first time I took a computer
science course was for my Business
Administration degree that I took just
like a year and a half ago so that was
the first time I'd ever taken a computer
science course so like some of the
concepts and everything there was just
like outdated and it was just
interesting because I'm like if this is
what a lot of the computer science
classes are like then you can you can
understand why when people come out of
college like there they say they don't
really know anything but that's not just
specifically to the IT field like
there's a lot of different you know
attorneys would tell you the same thing
a doctors would tell you the same thing
as well so you know the only difference
between those two industries really is
that one requires a degree in
certifications and such and the other
does not so that is why in in 2018 and
really for the entire existence of this
channel and probably for the last
25 years information technology has been
like their career to get into we've seen
some of the dot-com like we saw the
dot-com bubble and everything we see
crazy stuff with like Bitcoin we don't
know where that's going and things like
that so obviously Tech is very fluid and
not that predictable but the simple fact
of the matter is though that with the
advent of the internet like every
business and in the industrialized world
started pushing a lot of their business
model over to the internet so they're
taking payments and everything through
the web you look at like e-commerce
platforms like Amazon that are putting a
bunch of pressure on in on Walmart
there's like technology changes and it
changes the way we do business you look
at uber putting taxi cab drivers out of
business or you look at red box and some
of the you know companies that are like
that that put companies like a
blockbuster out of business so we're
gonna continue to see technology change
and as technology changes it creates new
demand so no matter what wherever
technology is right now like I'm not
really sure that you could find a field
that that has the the least potential to
be audited to be saturated in the future
we in hindsight like a lot of times like
people are like oh you want to be an
attorney you want to be this you want be
that and then every once in a while we
kind of flood the market well I think
the thing that that occurrence still
happens in IT but it's usually
short-lived in
we'll have these down turn turns in
technology but then like new sectors
will pop up the thing is this technology
is always moving forward science
technology and we're always advancing
and that's always going to lead to new
opportunities and we're not dealing with
something that has been around for
hundreds of years like law or the
medical profession and things like that
we're dealing with something that is in
its infancy still especially like
computer programming languages like
we're in the infancy of computers and
programming and everything and you're
just going to see an explosion from here
you're gonna see new languages new
features new problems to solve from
robotics artificial intelligence it's
gonna be all kinds of crazy sectors that
you can get into and that's why that's
why you want to be a programmer and if
you want to be a web developer you
should check out like a boot camp like
Dead Mountain it's really just amazing
and hopefully that motivates to you guys
because you can do whatever you want and
if you want to be a programmer you can
be a programmer maybe you just want to
take programming and use it to apply to
some sort of business advantage that you
that you've come up with or that you've
noticed so there's all kinds of
potential there with NIT</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
