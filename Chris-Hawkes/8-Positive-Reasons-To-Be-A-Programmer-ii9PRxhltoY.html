going to be talking about a few of the
benefits of being a programmer so I'm
going to follow this up actually with
another video you know why being a
programmer is also you know has its
downsides because everything as well to
pause the different and negative I think
everything and what electrons are
positives and negatives and everything
anyway so you the job it is mostly fun
and I know that that sounds lame or
whatever but I take a lot of pride out
of figuring things out and tinkering
with things the satisfaction I've gained
along the way of figuring out certain
problems creating certain projects being
able to look upon that and be like wow I
created that right you have worked on
guys go comm writer this writer that
like there's a lot of satisfaction to
being involved and a lot of different
projects and you know that is ultimately
why I am a programmer like I found
enjoyment from the get-go there were
times I pulled my hair out every times I
cost in fact there were times I did
YouTube videos where stuff didn't work
and I started cussing some of you guys
like that about my channel and that's
how I grew but programming can be
frustrating as hell and then we're not
focusing on the negatives we're going on
the positives but but there are a lot of
positives as well so that's what I'm
trying to to drill home here number two
is that this job is designed not to have
to punch a stinking clock from my eight
o'clock to 4:30 in the afternoon some
companies are like that mostly
old-school companies but a lot of
companies are very laid back when you
have core hours you're supposed to be
there so you know between this time and
that time that's what you're supposed to
be there but if you're 50 minutes you
know late one day nobody really gives a
 you know if you stay 50 minutes
late to make up for that time most of
the time you're going to be putting in
more than your 40 hours a week anyway so
programming is is all about getting
things done so you're accountable and
you control your own destiny that is
well good and bad because there's not
going to be people holding your hand but
for the most part of you are competent
you're up to date then it can be very
rewarding that you can actually get most
of your work done even you know before
you're 40 hours and you can
you know spend more time in the coffee
shop or you know shooting the with
your your buddies and playing foosball
or
pinball and motels pinball then then
I've never seen a pinball in an office
but I'm sure that they exist but you can
play you know different games and things
like that that's why a lot of companies
have that stuff number three is you get
paid Bank man programmers make a lot of
money they especially in the United
States I mean if you're a senior
developer I think the average senior
developer in the United States right now
is making roughly $100,000 there's
there's cities like in Palo Alto where
Google is where it's not even uncommon
or unheard of for programmers to make
seven-figure salaries you know some of
them are obviously the best of the best
but then there's that there's a ton of
programmers out there that are making
you 120 hundred 30 on average you could
argue that there's a bubble there but
programmers for decades now has been
paid a lot of money so we continue to
see that to this day and the simple fact
of the matter is is not everybody can do
what is what it is that we do I mean
there are plenty of people that just I
mean they don't they don't want to give
it enough time a time or day to even do
a HelloWorld application or understand
anything like the level of complexity
that goes you know that basically builds
up from there just absolutely
astronomical so there is a reason why
programmers get paid as much money as
they do all right next one is it's not
manual labor now this comes from a guy
that you said the new construction I
said there dig ditches and I had a
new concrete work one time where I was
like raking a gravel across this like
six foot friggin ditch because you had a
lay a footing for yet a bunch of gravel
that then the rebar went down and they
would pour concrete but and that just
sucked ass some people do that day in
and day out and and that wasn't
something that I was I was you know
destined for even at my young age I was
like there's no way I can do that
you know my entire life typically if you
do that your entire life I would imagine
you're going to probably you're going to
don't golf or probably you know 56 years
old most likely you're probably an
alcoholic beating your wife I'm just
getting this joke and there's some
obviously good blue-collar people out
there just just a joke but the the job
was not for me I remember one time I
think I told you guys this but I was an
army crawling underneath of a crawlspace
ER and it was this house that was
probably built in the 1700s I have no
idea was in Old Town Alexandria and I
had a flashlight and I'd have to like
move the flashlight from the side put it
in the front arm across two more do the
same thing so I'd be you know crawling
past my flashlight reaching back picking
it up I was trying to run a phone line
underneath the house now I was actually
a a plumber culprit but did more HVAC
than anything else but I've also I also
on that job because it was a small
construction site I had to do stuff like
we did an installation one time this
company was so cheap they didn't give us
any masks or anything so we're like
putting up in our installation
everywhere and by the time we're like
done there's insulation just floating
around everywhere we're breathing that
 and like I remember I had a
headache for like two days and you know
probably end up getting cancer from it
or something like that I should see that
company but you know those are the kind
of sometimes you work for when
you're working for small companies and
manual labor types of industries and
it's not fun but anyway that army
crawling phone line underneath the house
I went down there man I saw this good
ass rat man like just humongous rat like
it was like where's your camera okay
show you guys something it was a big-ass
rat but he was dead but the problem was
exhibitors there were live rats down
there as well man and I saw him I saw
their eyes and I got out of there and I
told two dudes I was like I can't do it
I can't do it but even to this day man
there's no way I could do that I was
getting paid I think was $12 an hour at
that time and it was not worth it at all
number five we can change the world now
granted programming you're probably not
going to change the world there's
millions of programmers only a few are
known for major major advancements and
things like that but ultimately as a
collective whole we are changing the
world like even I can make it argument
there hey you know I've reached five
million people on this YouTube channel
as a programmer that's pretty impressive
there is those types of opportunities in
in tech and you know if you think about
a lot of the technological innovations
that have happened that have been
surrounded you know video gaming virtual
reality machine learning artificial
intelligence social networking
smartphones you know there's like the
things change the world and a lot of
that change that we see around us is all
based on technological innovation that
has been created by programmers so
almost in the same breath there's
multiple areas to study and in
programming so if you get tired that of
being a web developer in this modern
ecosystem you could always transition
and maybe start working on their Android
SDK or maybe getting in to game
programming the fundamentals are the
same the floor looks the logic the
construction of the classes objects
functional versus non-functional
presentational versus stateful then you
know there's there's all kinds of
different terminology and things that
kind of transcend genres of programming
so that there's multiple opportunities
for you as a developer and many of us do
end up changing our career paths along
the way so in the same sense that I said
we get paid bank some you know making
hundred 120 hundred 30 whatever you have
people that have literally become rich
you know billionaires from billionaires
look at the Minecraft created creator
Markus Persson he was working at a game
company in 2009 when he decided to come
to create his own adventure and ended up
creating Minecraft which he sold for two
and half billion dollars a few years
later walking away with nearly a billion
and a half dollars bought a house in
Beverly Hills for like 77 million dudes
like filthy rich he was only 33 you look
at Mark Zuckerberg one of the richest
people in the entire world he had
created most of that wealth by the time
he was like 25 Sam could be said he look
at the guy from snapchat Jack Dorsey
from Twitter even though Twitter
make any money you can still become rich
there's there's those opportunities and
I think that that does draw a lot of
people in that probably shouldn't be
your primary motivating factor but it is
cool to know that you can you know you
can actually it's like you can strike
that goldmine you know that goldmine
that you know people jumped on back in
the days of the railroad and you know
the days of the internet and now you
know the mobile apps and gaming and the
other these industries that come in and
you know if you hit the place that
they're the right place at the right
time you can strike it rich not a lot of
industries you know know that that
opportunity finally you can work
remotely now this is something that is a
little bit slow going unfortunately but
there are many of our many opportunities
now that and it's growing where
companies are willing to hire people
across the country and somebody could
work out of their home I'm like coastal
South Carolina and probably only demand
you know sixty thousand dollars a year
whether it would be making 120 somewhere
else you know maybe in Palo Alto or New
York City or something like that so it
could be a win-win situation for for
both companies and employees once again
it's one of those things where like it's
so you know it's slowly being evaluated
but in this day and age you know with
our global industry the fact that we
have so many different tools that allow
us to network you know over the over you
know YouTube video Google Hangouts
whatever maybe we don't really need to
be in the same room at the same you know
at the same time all the time so that is
going to be a trend that we're going to
continue to see but unfortunately you're
a truck driver there's no way you can be
a truck driver working remote at least
until you know artificial intelligence
drugs those trucks but at that point you
probably don't have a job anyways so you
got to see my point I'm sure alright
thanks for watching you guys take care
have a good day and bye hey guys so a
lot of you asked me how do I get my foot
in the door to become a programmer and I
just want to take a moment to mention
dev Mountain coding boot camp is a
12-week intensive course that focuses on
the technologies of the here-and-now for
web development some of the things that
they're actually teaching in the Suevi
course is geared to get you into the
industry by focusing on things like
jQuery no Jaya
react angular how to use github so a lot
of the things that you're going to need
to do as a developer as soon as you
start they're going to be teaching you
in this and this coding bootcamp and the
entire goal is to be able to get you
into the industry within 12 weeks so if
you guys are interested in learning more
