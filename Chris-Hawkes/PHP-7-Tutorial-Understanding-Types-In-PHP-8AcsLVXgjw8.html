video of the PHP tutorial for hipster
code calm and in the last video we
installed PHP and we also ran our first
statement which we use the echo which is
Khalif in ting to the screen and then
then we pass in this value so this value
is actually considered a string and in
PHP just like every programming language
there's things called variables where
their actual value can vary and
variables can be things like integers
they can be floating-point numbers which
are basically decimal type numbers they
can be boolean's which means true or
false a lot of stuff in programming
centers around is something this or is
it not so and then you also have like
entire paragraphs HTML pages or
sentences and those are all considered
strings strings can be multiple
characters or it can be a single
character but they're going to be
separated by a double quote so in PHP
which is actually quite interesting it's
very similar to Perl when you create a
variable you use the dollar sign which
indicates variable a lot of people they
don't understand why that's necessary
but PHP you're going to get used to
these variables a little you know these
icons because they do mean something so
this dollar sign you know whatever it is
dollar sign will say ant example equals
and this is going to be 1000 or 100
actually so that is declaring a variable
so we declared a variable int example
and then the value is an int so
programming languages are all about
types and types are just what I said as
far as integer floating-point strings
those are all different types and every
programming language has their own types
and what they call them and how they
work and PHP is no exception to that a
lot of times that you need to figure out
ok I'm dealing with some sort of
variable and maybe I don't know what the
value of that variable is because it's
not as clear in the code that you know
as clear as this that I'm assigning an
int which is short for integer
so a lot of times you have to figure out
okay what type of my dealing with so in
PHP we can do that by simply saying echo
and then we'll say get type which is the
keyword and this is a function so we
pass in a argument to the function so
that means to pass in the argument we
use the parentheses and then inside the
parentheses we actually pass in the
variable that we're trying to get the
type of every statement and a statement
and programming is anything that says
like int example equals this that's a
statement if I said ant example equals a
hundred x times 100 that's also a
statement and it's also a mathematical
evaluation so that the star symbol
meaning multiplied so a hundred times
100 I can say echo get type and then
this should actually return integer
spelled out in the application so you
can see that's actually being returned
from the built-in get type function that
PHP comes with out of the box so there's
other value types so the first one we
just looked at was an integer here is a
string example and a string this is a
series of characters and and this this
is just one sentence but it could
literally be thousands of pages of text
basically it can I mean it can be an
entire novel
it doesn't matter so now when we run
this oops what happened here so what
what this is this is actually a parse
error in PHP and whenever PHP is
executing a code and it runs into
something it doesn't understand it's
going to spit out an error message and
that's what you want whenever you're
developing but this is actually
something that you would want to quell
or hide in a production environment
because you do not want other people
understanding you know what is causing
your code to choke up you just simply
want to deliver you know a page not
found or a 500 something went wrong page
but whenever we're developing with PHP
this is actually something that's very
helpful so this tells us on line 12
there's a problem and when we look at
line 12 you can see that it got to 12
but that's where it puked but it
actually didn't puke on line 12 which is
weird it got to line 12 but it actually
puked at string example and the reason
why is because every statement needs to
have a semicolon ending the statement
that's how PHP knows that the statement
is finished so this is just simply
missing a semicolon at the end and if we
add the semicolon and we refresh the
page you're gonna see that it actually
works the way we expected so you're
going to constantly get programming
errors spit out at you by PHP whenever
you're programming and that's just a
normal normal thing when it comes to any
sort of development so the next example
of a type that we want to look at in PHP
is the boolean which I said before is
simply true and false which is a very
important feature of any programming
language and we could do that but we'll
say boolean example equals false so now
you can see it's a boolean type the next
one is there be a floating-point example
and that's considered a double
floating-point and doubles essentially
mean decimal numbers and they're used
interchangeably in many different
languages and there are differences
depending on the language that you use
and PHP that's all you really need to
know for right now that if you're
dealing with monetary values or decimals
just refer to it as either a double or a
floating-point the next example we want
to look at of a type and PHP is a
constant and the reason why constants
are important is because any sort of
variable it gets its name because its
value can change so that means that the
PHP compiler always needs to be aware of
the fact that during execution of a
program that a certain value can have
its value change during the execution so
it has to have additional memory
slaughter to be able to update that
value to a new value or to have a new
pointer in memory of of what the new
value is however and with a constant
it's some it's considered a global value
so it and its value never changes and
what that can do it can actually speed
up execution because PHP no longer needs
to worry about that value changing so
that's the reason for it and you will
see it a lot in any sort of PHP program
and but you can choose whether or not
you actually want to have you know the
extra speed boosts of being able to have
a declared constant it's going to be up
to you as to whether or not that is
necessary in your program but it's still
important that you understand how it
works so what we would do in order to
define a constant global variable and in
PHP is you're going to use the define
keyword and inside the define keyword
just like we did with get type you have
parentheses and then you pass in
arguments now the first argument is
going to be the actual constant value so
we'll just call this constant example
and it's actually
there's a precedence to use all
uppercase for any sort of constant
global variable that way you can
differentiate that it is a constant so
we'll say we'll just say example of
constant so the second argument is the
actual variable value that you know the
global value that's never going to
change so this never changes in fact you
know I'll just say this never changes
after its implemented okay and then now
we can actually reference it here and
this time we don't have to use the
variable of the dollar sign and we can
just simply say constant example now
this isn't going to actually print out
that it is a constant value but what we
can do is we can just simply echo the
constant example and we don't need the
parentheses now once again we made the
mistake of also leaving off the
semicolon so anytime you're declaring a
statement or anything you need to
actually have the semicolon but you can
see that the value is changed and we
could actually display the type as well
if we wanted to you can see that the
constant type is string so there's not
like a special type for constant it's
still going to be a string and it could
be an int to so if I wanted to do like
that you could do the same thing and
it's going to display as an integer so
the constant itself is not a type but it
is a way of declaring a new type
variable that's never going to change so
you will see that pretty often in PHP
code alright guys so this will end up
there this will end the second video of
the hipster code PHP tutorial series and
please subscribe please rate up so this
was all about how to get types working
in PHP and the next video we're going to
look at strings
in more detail thanks for watching have
a good day bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
