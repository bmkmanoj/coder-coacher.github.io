tutorial after you've configured get
home let's go ahead and head over to our
dashboard so that we can create a
repository and a repository is a place
for our code basically to live so that
we can go ahead and allow github to keep
track of the different versions of the
code for our project alright so we're
going to go back to our github
repository page and click on this new
little this little book here so we can
create a new repository name all right
now we need to go ahead and give our
repository a name now just for basically
craps and giggles I'm going to go ahead
and create a project in regards to an
awesome open source project that I like
which is Casper JavaScript I'd like to
maybe enhance on top of that maybe build
some sort of Python a cross between
Python and Casper and almost a new
project so I need to come up with a
clever name to name that project which
is what I'm going to go ahead and do now
now a project similar to what I was just
talking about exists already but well to
an extent so and I do plan on maybe
touching up on that but once again this
isn't really something that is all that
serious at least at the moment we're
just doing a tutorial so I'm going to
call the project ghost Python and it
looks like that is available and will
give a description will to say Python
project which works with Casper Jos and
we'll make it public and then initialize
this repository would they read me sure
and now we need to go ahead and figure
out what licensed to have to our project
here all right so I'm at this point I
don't even know enough about any one of
these licenses to make an educated
decision you don't actually have to
choose a license right away now you can
go to the website it appears that they
have one that might be able to help you
make the right decision I'm not I'm not
really sure about that but you'll have
to just kind of make your own decision
on that and I'm just going to say
initialize this repository were to read
me well let's go ahead and create the
repository all right and there we go
I've created the first project for
seahawk in here so-called ghost Python
hopefully that's a fitting name not
really sure but yeah anyway um this is
yep so you see the little description
that you put in here so that is our
first project so thank you for watching
and we're going to touch up on some more
stuff in the next video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
