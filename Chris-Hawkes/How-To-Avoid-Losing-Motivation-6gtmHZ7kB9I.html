just actually posted a video a few
minutes to go my latest video which is
um you know my IT exit strategy and
shortly after posting it I realized in
the video I number one I sound somewhat
bitter I guess because you know I've
been working all day I've been tired I
didn't get enough sleep the last two
days and on top of that I have a
headache and I decided to make a video
for whatever reason and the reason why I
decided to make a video is because I
didn't have any videos to release and
I've been doing videos probably every
three to four days and I just watched a
fascinating video from one of the guys
that I like the most on YouTube when it
comes to doing these types of videos
when I when it comes to talking about
being a programmer and that is a fun fun
functions channel I mean the dude is is
he's getting popular and rightfully so
he does excellent job editing his videos
he shows himself you know he's a very
very uh articulate speaker and in
addition to that I think he's got this
whole euro the vibe to him that people
are just digging in addition he's also
you know you can tell he's a very smart
guy so it's just very very well spoken
but he just made a video where he
actually went through and started doing
some research on actual keyword topics
so basically trying to use google tools
to figure out what is going to be a good
video to make based on search traffic so
that tells you a few things right there
number one it means that he's doing this
this channel obviously probably well I
don't want to actually put words into
his mouth or anything like that but my
interpretation is that he's doing the
channel because there's an ability to to
supplement his income now it sounds like
he's probably not hurting for income
since he's a senior developer and I
think he works for Spotify so he's
obviously doing pretty well for himself
so he doesn't really need the money but
I think at the same point his channel is
blowing up and it's growing rather
quickly I've had my channel 43
I'm not sure how long fun fun functions
at his channel he has more subscribers
in me and I believe those subscribers at
he's gained he's gained them relatively
quickly his videos are like I said her
phenomenal you should definitely check
them out but he just did a video last
week where he was doing this research
and he was trying to figure out what is
the best keyboard to make a video about
because he wants to get the most traffic
to come to his channel to get the most
views to grow it obviously to continue
this this trajectory that is his his
channel is currently on and as he's in
the process of doing that he questioned
to himself like why is he doing that
like he doesn't need to do it and all of
a sudden he felt like he was being
coerced almost into actually doing this
research and and he has really no reason
his mind why you would want to do it and
the reason why I find it striking is
because I've actually been in the same
situation in fact I'm in somewhat of a
similar situation now because like I
said I just released this other video
it's like 22 minutes of me just kind of
rambling on with a headache and a bad
day and like I just feel like it's a
terrible video I didn't even really edit
it and the only reason why I did it was
because I felt like I was almost like
expected to do it and and I think it's
funny because in most cases i love doing
videos and i love talking and things
like that but when i'm not feeling it i
shouldn't do it but there's something
that kind of pushes me towards doing it
even though i don't even need it so I'll
fill you guys in I mean anybody that's
making youtube videos out there they're
making money on doing it so fun fun
function he's making money simple
programmers making money the New Boston
obviously is making a killing and then
you have other guys like well I mean I
can name a bunch but I mean they're all
they're there they're making money
they've taken a tremendous amount of
time and effort to build up their
audience and some you know you can
clearly see her are motivated by money
and that's it's like ultimately why they
do it I will fill you guys in on the
fact that i never thought that this
whatever actually produce any sort of
income in addition I never thought that
I would ever have I think seventeen
thousand subscribers I mean I think
that's it's fascinating to me I can't
believe that I've had close to two
million people watched my videos some of
my videos like when I was first getting
started were absolutely terrible even
now like the video i just released was
not very good it was just me talking for
22 minutes without any sort of scripting
or anything like that funfun function he
is putting pressure on me it seems like
with you know bringing it to the next
level to do proper editing I shouldn't I
shouldn't be like you know stumbling
over my words and talking about this and
that with no particular direction in
many cases you see a lot of these guys
they'll clean up the video after the
fact but I wouldn't say that I'm lazy
but I've actually made a conscious
decision to not do that and accept the
consequences the problem is is that the
consequences are that a lot of people
are not going to take this channel
series they're not going to take me
serious they're going to get frustrated
by my might own the fact that my video
is all over the place and maybe I forget
to even answer their question about what
the video was about there are times that
I just kind of go off on a tangent I
think some people probably like that and
some people don't my channel has also
been a mix of okay do i do youtube
tutorials because that's originally what
i was doing and that's what the whole
channel was about and that's where i've
actually gotten some attention in fact
some of the tutorials i did were pretty
decent a decent enough to where like
pack publishing reached out to me Linda
calm I had amazon recruiter from amazon
at one point reached out to me so I mean
they've captured the attention of a lot
of different people and I never really
expected that to happen and I probably
don't even really deserve it because I
didn't even I didn't even script out
some of this stuff well enough so fun
fun function he's like he's brilliant
when it comes to like
talking from the camera he gets dressed
up for it he only does a video a week
but it takes them like five or six hours
to edit one you know 10 15 minute video
he's obviously making money on the
videos but now he's at this point where
he feels like it's his obligation to do
these videos and it's actually the case
with I think most people that start
doing these types of things where you
start building something and then you
don't even maybe really understand what
it is that you're building at first but
you see that something is growing and
ultimately it's like you know this baby
or this you know this burden that you
have to you have to continue to feed and
grow and and it's just it's just another
thing in life that you end up having
that you know it's another
responsibility and all that and and I
think that there may be a case where
it's no longer fun to do and I think
that is what worries me because if it
gets to the point where your audience is
you know large enough where you're
always getting criticism and you know I
I you know I'm just not sure where all
that is headed so I've been curious
about that when it comes to people like
fun fun function who has now 21 thousand
subscribers and is growing pretty well
simple programmer with John samas he
makes a lot more videos so it's harder
for his videos to capture the amount of
views that somebody like fun fun
function does when he's only doing one a
week but then if you compare all the
videos that San mez is doing he's
obviously getting a lot of a lot of you
know traffic on that over time with my
case I'm simply just doing it without
much thought and effort and I guess I
apologize to you guys for that because
you guys still watch my stuff I've seen
genuine interest from a lot of you guys
and I'm flattered and I still can't
really believe it and I'm certainly
grateful for it but we do make money off
of doing this and ultimately it becomes
a job in some sense so we're
feel devoted towards trying to expand
this channel towards trying to answer
all the questions to you no respond to
all the comments and it does take time
in fact if i were to put an hour scale
behind how much time I spend with my
channel I spend more time with my
channel than I do doing any sort of
other programming ventures that I used
to do like with movies websites and
things in the past I can tell you that I
had a website new movies com I wouldn't
I wouldn't go to it now I'm actually
going to redesign it doesn't even matter
that i'm redesigning it doesn't get any
traffic it's a terrible idea just having
any sort of movie database blog whatever
is just really not the best idea at all
but i was doing it because i enjoyed it
i also thought I could make money with
it it's not about making money anymore
it's about actually just having
something that you feel somewhat a proud
of which I wouldn't you know at this
point with you know anything with
anything that to have to do with that
website but my point behind this is that
when I was pursuing this and I was
spending a lot of time like sharing
articles and trying to you know expand
and write a lot and everything I thought
I could make money with it and I was
peeking at over 250,000 visitors a month
and that's actually about the amount of
people that I have that visitors channel
every month now so at the peak of new
movies I was getting that much traffic
it wasn't making very much money and it
took a tremendous amount of effort to
get there and then the end product
wasn't any better than any sort of
website that you would see that talks
about movies and art and and Hollywood
stars and things like that but it became
this this overbearing problem that they
wait on me it's like oh I haven't
written an article I need to write an
article all I haven't you know done this
or I needed to do this feature and all
stuff and all of it was it became it
became like such a burden that I didn't
want to do it anymore and I didn't and
then it just becomes this outdated
crappy website and you never end up you
know finishing what you started and the
motivation is lost as soon as it as soon
as you realize that this is
just like its work and it's in its work
that I don't even need to do and yeah i
think that i think that's unfortunate
because that sort of mindset carries
over even now I like talking to you guys
actually I sometimes get confidence by
doing some of these videos and trying to
speak in front of you guys and and by
trying to basically put out there what I
know and I've been wrong and people have
corrected me and I think all of that
eventually it takes confidence to do
that it also takes being humble in order
to see that you've made mistakes and
things like that and to try to get
better and I think that's what I'm going
to continue to do and I've also talked
about like in my last video the IT exit
strategy one of the things that you know
that that is helping me now is it's like
you know I could spend all my time
trying to manage you know a Content site
like new movies or I could spend more
time learning technologies and reaching
out to the you know to the programmers
in the world doing this blog channel
which i think is you a much better idea
at this point but it but it is starting
to become you know more of a job like I
can't respond all the time like I'm
going out of town next wednesday through
sunday so i definitely won't be able to
post any videos or anything like that
and that's ultimately one of the first
things that crossed my mind is that i'll
be out of town what am I going to do
about video i guess i'll have to post a
video tuesday night you know before i
leave wednesday morning and then come
back and maybe have one ready for sunday
night but you my point is that i don't
want to lose you guys as an audience and
I want the channel to grow but I'm also
not taking the necessary steps like fun
fun function to do things in a way that
that makes it grow as if it's a business
or something like that and I think as
soon as I start doing that that's where
it's going to become not fun anymore and
I'll lose interest and you know maybe
one day not even do the channel because
ultimately any money I make on this
channel is not nearly as much as what I
would just make it a full-time job we're
working you know obviously is I do work
at a full-time job so my whole point is
I don't need the revenue from this
channel
it's nice to have revenue an extra
revenue and stuff like that it's nice to
see your your views grow and your
subscribers grow and I think there's a
certain there's definitely some you know
a certain amount of enjoyment in that
but as soon as I start you know having
to spend four hours editing my videos
and each one that I do if I start doing
like a weekly video I think at that
point it gets it gets really you know it
gets really really hard to do and I
motivation will certainly be hard to
keep up in that case maybe you'll end up
seeing an explosion in the amount of
traffic and the views and you start
making money and you feel like it's
worth it but if your primary motivation
is not about money it's about reaching
out to audiences and I'm sure that's
what you know he's doing and I'm sure
that's what other programmers are doing
and I don't I don't know i think that i
think that i want to caution myself on
trying to pursue this so much to the
point where it's not fun to do anymore
and so far that hasn't happened even
though this is somewhat of a you know
second you know second type of you know
job in some ways and and and i think
that with what i do now i don't see too
much of a reason to ever finish my
movies website or finish my music
website and i don't know and that's just
the way I feel right now because that
that's where my motivation levels right
at right now in fact it's been that way
ever since this channel really started
expanding and taking more of my time
which would be back in probably like
September or not really around august of
last year this channel really started to
pick up in traffic and subscribers and
and i just found more more pleasure in
and doing these videos than then
actually trying to spend all my time
making content sites that nobody's
interested in so to clarify this whole
video you guys should check out his his
uh his
his video and I'm going to post it in
the description I think the dudes funny
as hell and number one when he's walking
around at quarry one of the things
that's funny to me also with that is
that i live in the united states i'm in
northern virginia near Washington DC and
he's like walking around this quarry
like this like it's closed because I
guess it's on a sunday or something like
that and he's in Sweden and apparently
you can just do that because it dude
climbs through a hole in the fence walks
around a construction zone in a quarry
without any regard to whether or not
he's going to get arrested it's funny
because in the United States they would
arrest you in a second like it certainly
in Virginia it's like a class one
misdemeanor to be on any sort of private
property like that without permission so
I just found that that that to be very
interesting but it's kind of stuff he
does like he'll get and start walking
and doing videos and then he spends
hours cleaning them up and and then
doing subtitles and all that stuff and
I'm just not interested in that and he
now feels this burden to continue to do
it and I totally understand that and I
would totally feel the same way and I do
even in some lesser extent with my
channel although I don't put nearly as
much pressure on myself with it as he
does I i think but i can't speak for him
in that regard but i think that's what
it is and anyway guys I feel like this
video is better my headaches starting to
go away I took some medicine and just
it's Friday have the weekend off going
out of town next week so anyway lots to
be grateful for and thank you all for
watching this video and have a good day
