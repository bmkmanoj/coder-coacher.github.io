we want to do is get into texture
atlases and essentially what it is it's
an image that's been being repeated over
and over again on one image so it's like
a bunch of different images to try to
the object is is that you're basically
going to be showing different portions
of that image so if you have a character
and he's on an image he's on their 16
times in like 16 different formations so
it looks like when you're flashing from
one image is being shown to the next it
looks like that actual characters
walking as opposed on when really it's
just a one image with different portion
being shown so that is called the
texture atlas and that's what we're
going to try to do in this video so I
feel like there's going to be somewhat
of a complicated task what we're going
to do is use this website here this some
the website i mentioned before on this
texture atlas and and he explains what
this is here that you have these
textures and 16 different images it's
one image so he says you can download it
here and save it which we've done so we
need to go ahead and add that to our
project and let's go ahead and do that
now so just like we've done previously
we're an add existing item smiley walk
now we have need to build our project go
individuals to do 2012 and existing item
get a little bit quicker with this now
and then go to properties
copy always all right we'll save our
project all right so now we're going to
do is we're going to add our first file
to the project or at least our first
class so you want to say add new well
not really add new just a tad and then
you see that there's an option for class
and keep the cs on there and we're going
to call it animated sprite got CS so
we've added that all right now we're
going to add to using statements
Microsoft XNA framework graphics
Microsoft XNA framework all right now
following along in the tutorial we want
to add these namespaces that goes right
inside of the class alright so the next
thing i want to do inside of my class is
i'm going to build a constructor which
means when this class object that when
the object is instantiated from this
class it's going to automatically build
this crap inside your your constructive
so just take a moment pause the video
and just copy that in there or you can
follow along with the website either way
alright so underneath this a public
constructor we just added we want to add
this new class public void update and
then we want to do a draw method as well
underneath of that so once again i need
a pause at or i would probably suggest
you just go to the website it's a pretty
good website and just copy it's probably
gonna be easier instead of typing all
that stuff all right now we need to go
back over to our games ES File and we
want to go ahead and copy an instance
variable up at the top where we've been
putting everything else and it's going
to be Freddy mated sprite for the class
that we just created
and now we want to go ahead and add
detection everything to the load content
area
and really I want to just so don't have
any more naming problem so i want to say
texture equals and then up here but i
will be instantiated put that namespace
up there so that way from the access
elsewhere within our program okay now we
need to do
now we need to add some stuff to the
update method
ok
and then now to draw our animated sprite
we need to go ahead and add this to our
draw method I'm going to keep Jim and
everything on there we'll see how this
ends up looking with Jim and our other
background image all right now let's go
ahead and run the game and see what
happens
ok we crashed
ok
all reason for our crashes and we're
actually using some of the stuff from
our previous example with the beginning
in the end and it looks like since we
bring in our animated sprite and you go
over to the animated sprite file it
actually calls its own begin and end so
it's most likely conflicting you know
I'm causing the game the crash let's
stop the debugger and let's just um copy
all this and we'll get rid of it all I'm
just some good in place what is
recommended in the website so it's just
what we had initially when we start the
project which is this corn fountain
flower blue background we only need one
draw call and hopefully this will work
now in future videos okay so all right
that's pretty cool so the whole
animation is um it would appear and this
stuff is like I said all new to me with
this math that we're calling here it is
showing a different portion the image
and a very quick rate which gives off
the impression that this thing is moving
around when really it's just showing a
different portion of the image and it's
fixed stated position right there so
that's actually it's actually pretty
friggin cool because if you think about
it we have you know you build one of
those images for like your character and
once we start getting in the controls we
start moving our character around and
we're running this sprite this animated
sprite thing you know to to show that
the things moving I mean we can move it
with our controls and it looks like our
characters are actually moving and
relatively a little bit of a little bit
of work involved there so I mean I would
be I guess the most time-consuming thing
is obviously trying to figure out the
math and then drawing the images but
once you have like a photo editor I mean
or some sort of illustrator program you
could probably just get an image and I
just kind of copy that for the most part
and just changed its limbs a little bit
here and there like with Jim I'll try to
get him moving eventually and maybe have
his arm dangling around or something
that would be pretty cool I guess
alright so I'm we're going to end this
video here once again is a great website
on be including
the link to the website and the video so
everybody can follow along because he's
obviously helping us get get it on get
our foot in the door here so anyway
