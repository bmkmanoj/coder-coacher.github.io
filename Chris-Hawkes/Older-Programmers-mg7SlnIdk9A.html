what this video is about it's about
older programmers and sorry to show such
an old bastard as this but this is a
free image so what can I say I didn't
actually draw it or anything and it came
from pixabay so it's part of the
creative commons and i gave all that
attribute whatever anyway so what
happens to older programmers a lot of
people talk about that they want to know
whether or not it's too late for them to
start programming when they're in their
50s how on the Internet and I haven't
talked to this person personally but I
know somebody that actually started
programming at the age of like 81 I
think it was it was either 80 or 81 but
they were in their 80s and I just
remember being completely blown away by
the fact that you know this person
actually started at that age of their
life you know 80s of the new 60s right
or 70s at the very least but just today
a famous astronaut died he'll I don't
remember his name because he was really
popular doing something I know he was
very popular in the 60s you know well
before my time but he um you know he was
on record as saying like you know a lot
of people you know fail to realize that
older people have ambitions as well they
have just as much ambition and goals in
their life and what remains of it as
younger people like we don't know how
much time we have young people could get
hit by a bus tomorrow and never realize
their goals and you know the simple fact
is that if you're 60 or if you're 30 or
if you're even you know 15 you have you
have an idea of what you're looking
forward to in life and hopefully you're
working towards something if you just
sit on your ass and you never do
anything then of course you know things
probably aren't going to you know go
your way unless you hit the lottery or
something but um people ask me you know
I like you a lot of people are talking
about you know I want to be a programmer
I started programming myself like me
myself and I've been programming for
about seven years now I started at the
age of 28 and and I did everything the
wrong way the first couple years I
didn't have a whole lot of direction and
I've been programming professionally for
over four years now so I feel like it's
been in a professional capacity for
closer to seven but it definitely for
years I have
my resume of saying I've worked for
major major companies for four years now
so the thing is is that I've work I work
with some brilliant people that are
older than me some some brilliant people
that are in their 40s and their 50s you
know very smart people and some of them
may not be as up-to-date on some of the
more modern you know JavaScript
libraries and things like that but they
are you know absolutely brilliant in
their own way
I'm just the other day I was talking to
somebody that was around when a lot of
the the assembly programmers were you
know basically building their own
compilers and and she remembers that day
and it was a female actually and that's
another video I could talk about where
there's not you know the discrepancy
between male and female and the
programming industry but you know she
was talking about you know these people
that you know they were very quirky type
of people that that worked in you know
these assembly languages that you know
they'd have to basically you know make
the computer perform to their needs and
things like that it wasn't C sharps
compiler that was doing all the work for
you or or anything like that it was
basically hardware was expensive back in
those days the programmers were cheaper
even though they had to do a shitload
more than what we have to do nowadays
now it's the opposite where programmers
are the most expensive commodity and
hardware is cheap memory you know add
more memory add more disk space all that
stuff is much cheaper than a programmer
salary so the thing is is that older
programmers are getting hired and I and
just yesterday and I wanted you know and
when I was talking to this guy like I
was like man I definitely have to tell
my audience but just yesterday I talked
to a guy that ended up graduating from a
pretty you know decent school and the
universe won't I don't want to give out
too much information but he went to a
West Virginia and university it might be
a college actually you know it screwed
its Bluefield college I think blue field
is what it was but he ended up
graduating from that in his 50s and
getting his first programming gig where
he had been working in the medical
industry for over 25 years so
you know that might be pie-in-the-sky
type of thing like I actually don't
think it was when I was talking to him I
was like I was talking to him about you
know the ageism that exists you know it
you know what we think exists in in
Silicon Valley with Facebook and and all
these other companies and and I was
asking him you know whether or not he
actually thought that that was a reality
because based on like you know books
that I've read recently I read that
disrupted book that talks about HubSpot
the Cambridge Massachusetts startup for
this you know buzzword inbound marketing
 that they do but this you know
this programmer didn't didn't feel
discriminated against whatsoever not not
for his age or anything else he was like
you know that he's like there might be a
remote possibility that they thought
initially that I was young because I had
just graduated but he's like you know
obviously they saw my picture and I had
you know code available online but in
his case this guy had been tinkering
with Linux for four decades actually
before he actually got into programming
so I guess he was always somewhat of a
curious hacker type and and maybe that's
you know one of the exceptions for him
but the thing is like he didn't really
have an online portfolio or anything
like that it wasn't until he went to
school for computer science and actually
graduated that he started building this
online portfolio where he was then able
to point to these projects that he had
created and and he talked a bit about
you know different projects that he had
and he was more into like the C++ and
ANSI level type of programmers you know
software type programs not like in the
web side of things but anyway I just
wanted to let you guys know that this
guy was you know well into his 50s and
he was able to get a job and a
first-time IT programming job in the
United States way though with a computer
science degree now that also means that
you know he had a computer science
degree so you guys have always asked
like you know should you get the degree
or should you not should you go to a
boot camp I I don't know I like the boot
camps you know day off they offer a lot
of value right I was talking to a
manager who actually hires and I said he
is I think I've told you guys this
before he's a software manager for a a
golf course
and mashed Berne Virginia which is like
that's where like the Redskins training
camp big it's big money up there in
Northern Virginia and in the aspirin
area but this guy is actually a
programmer for a like you believe it or
not an actual golf course has their own
IT staff so but he but he was saying
that the boot camps like he finds to be
very very beneficial for people that
have some programming background when
they you know when they take that
bootcamp like they you know they they
consider it to be just as good as
anything else so if you come from a
cobalt background and you do a guide
wire or Java or C sharp boot camp or
something like that the chances are
you're going to be very very hireable in
that case because you have that
programming experience now if all you
ever did was take it 12-week course I
mean at the time you know I think it's
going to take a certain amount of time
before the industry determines whether
or not that is actually feasible enough
in order to to have a job now that said
on the website of things like my sponsor
Deb mountain coding boot camp they focus
on the web world so it's not like
they're expecting you to work on rocket
ships after a 12-week course I mean
they're it's a like an action-packed
course where they're trying to drill in
the things that every web development
shop is using and really things that
I've seen firsthand where you have Java
developers or c-sharp developers that
don't have enough jQuery JavaScript you
react knock out using tools like grunt
Babel web pack things like that those
those skills can be taught relatively
quickly and for a lot of shops I think
they're starting to find out that it's
much better to separate your UI from
your backend so where we want it to be
all full stack and everything like that
javascript has created this new realm
where you really need to kind of focus
on the the UI JavaScript side and trying
to bounce between all these different
technologies is probably not going to do
you a whole lot of good when it comes to
being a JavaScript expert so you're not
going to be a JavaScript out to expert
in 12 weeks that is that is absolute
but can you be you know can you come out
very strong as a junior developer for
you know HTML CSS and JavaScript jQuery
type skills in order to build you know
simple websites websites that most
businesses need then I think the answer
is yes and if that's it enough to get
your foot in the door as a junior
programmer even if the industry says you
know what kids coming out of college
with a computer science degree from you
know University of Virginia or Virginia
Commonwealth University or something
like that where they have good IT
programs they say you know what with the
industry the way it is these kids are
obviously relatively smart even though a
lot of them can't program can't program
for especially in a big team
environment you know they still are
pulling in in some cases you know
$60,000 and and that said I also if I
can take a moment just to mention the
same lady that was talking about the
assembly programmers she has a daughter
that got hired out of college out of you
know out with a computer science degree
and she got hired by Amazon for ninety
thousand dollars right out of college
that is absolutely amazing money right
out of college now she hated Amazon and
only lasted six months there she said it
was actually she worked under a hellish
manager according to this this mother
that was explaining the story but that's
an interesting note so if some companies
like Amazon are willing to pay ninety
thousand dollars for you know top-level
talent coming out of school that most
likely can't even program for and a
big team environment you know an
enterprise Enterprise stacks you know
can there be like basically a new pay
grade for people that are going in with
the boot camp setter that are paying ten
thousand dollars for education that you
know gives them a good basis and a
grounding and in development and then
you know maybe paying them 35 or 40 and
then having them you know work
themselves up they should be
fast-tracked up by the way because if
they're able to do that stuff even at
that level I would think within you know
a couple years they should be up to that
you know that's 60 70 thousand dollar
range at least if not you know 100
depending on where you are and the in
the United States now I understand like
in London they get paid a lot
last nighti world for some reason even
though London's really expensive to live
in so there's obviously like you know I
guess I lied range of salaries that
exist across the world and mostly I'm
speaking for for the United States
because that's all I really have have
you know relevance and but you know that
I think this is obviously a situation
that happens across the board there I'm
sure there's going to be boot camps if
there's not already in different
countries I know Canada has boot camps
so I think the jury is out right the
jury is out on these things and it's
going to be you know the reputable ones
are going to be the ones that are
actually going to set this this trend
you know like Deb mountain coding boot
camp they actually have a parent company
you know this is a big-time company so
you know they're very worried about
their image they luckily for me that
they've chosen to have me or to sponsor
my content and hopefully I do you know
them justice and everything and you know
I think boot camps have a place but all
this said you know they're going back to
the original discussion of older
programmers I've talked first hand with
older programmers they're able to find
the job sometimes I think older
programmers run into the situation where
they just don't want to code anymore so
they go into management once you start
leading management teams or you're a
director of a managing department I
think it's going to you're going to be
kind of hard pressed to go back into the
development role so a lot of those
programmers you wonder where are they
well they're probably you know
consultants or they're starting their
own businesses or even you know they're
doing something else I know a guy that
lives in an old town Fredericksburg who
has a shop down there and you know he
does a consignment shop for like law you
know basically high-end furniture but
it's a consignment shop so you go in
there and you can buy like literally
high-quality stuff not just not to stuff
you're seeing in IKEA or Walmart or
anything like that it's very high
quality furniture that gates you know
hundreds of years in some cases and and
it's a common consignment shop and when
I was talking to him I was wondering how
he did that and it turns out he was a
retired accountant so he you know he
made his living as an accountant until
he was in his 50s and then ended up
retiring early because he made a
when he was doing that work so I think a
lot of programmers if you play your
cards right you know you can you can
retire if you have me if you keep your
expenses in check you're not driving a
beamer you know drive a Honda Accord or
a Honda Civic or something you know that
you don't need the BMW or the large
house and I say that and I have a pretty
big house probably bigger than I need
but I you know I don't know there's uh
older programmers have their place
another thing too is my father is an
example of somebody who has had
businesses and has failed at businesses
in some cases and the companies have
gone bankrupt and things like that he
always finds his way you know back into
doing something else but he's a
developer at heart but also mostly an
entrepreneur but there's been times in
his life where he's managed entire teams
and he's been vice president of
companies and things like that and the
when when people see that on the resume
it becomes harder to say you know what I
was managing this team I was VP of this
company a VP of that company and I was
CEO of this company but now I'm trying
to go back to being a senior programmer
for some company for you know $90,000 a
year you know I think that that
immediately throws red flags it's not
that they're not capable they're
probably some of the smartest
programmers you'll ever talk to even
when these Millennials who think that
they're great and nothing against
Millennials I mean that the Millennials
obviously like if you're going to be
writing game-changing software or doing
the read oxes of the world and stuff
like that you're probably you know fresh
out of college and have a you know great
mind and and things like that not nearly
as much responsibility as older people
but you know these older programmers
that you can learn quite a bit from them
and I've said this before as well one of
the first things that you know
businesses do when when they're startup
start to succeed you know the snapchats
and the Facebook's and the googles of
the world they go out and they hire the
gray-haired people that have been around
the block a time or two that understand
how to talk to people how to treat
people and and how to manage people so
anyway guys that's really my thoughts
tonight older programmers will be just
fine I plan on being a programmer in my
50s and my 60s whatever even if you know
hopefully I can live that long I hope I
can you never
like I said we don't know what our our
futures hold but I don't see myself not
programming at any time in my life at
this point but you never know I mean
people change and our our our hobbies
and interest change and and one of the
great things about being a programmer if
you can find success in it regardless of
what age you get into it I mean you can
make quite a bit of money in you know 10
15 years and and it's one of the few
professions where you can be learning
during your day job and building
something on the side you know should
you have enough opportunity and time so
it's almost like paying playing the
lottery in some ways like you know you
keep playing eventually you might you
might hit something maybe not the
humongous jackpot but there's plenty of
small jackpots out there in the IT and
business world that you don't hear about
I mean you always hear about the
billionaires and things like that but
there's plenty of millionaires out there
that have struck it you know rich on
some sort of small project and and I'll
probably feature some of these projects
that that I know of firsthand that you
know have made people literally millions
of dollars just on some simple ideas
that were only relevant for a couple of
years all right guys
anyway let me know what you think in
this video please up vote please and
thank you for all the patreon and for
the paypal donations that's really
awesome I do appreciate that guys you
have a good day take care bye hey guys
so I've talked about this a lot deb
mountain coding boot camp they are my
sponsor they're one of the reasons why
i'm able to do these videos and they
offer a 12-week intensive course that
teaches you the technologies of the here
and now they're gonna focus on a lot of
things that are actually being used and
websites things like jquery and they're
gonna be using stacks like nodejs the
12-week intents of course is to try to
get people in the job market so that is
their entire focus we've all we've
talked a lot about on this channel
whether or not a college degree is worth
it I'm not the one to be able to answer
that question for you I absolutely think
that college degrees are great
especially in computer science I never
want to convince somebody to say that
they shouldn't do that you know
obviously schools like Stanford and MIT
I'm you know
i'm an envy of all those graduates
however there is you know the bulk of
developers that don't necessarily need
to be the MIT graduates to actually have
success in the programming world I think
I speak relatively well for for that
type of person and with coding boot
camps we're seeing them you know try to
offer more skills more modern-day skills
because a lot of times when you're going
to a computer science course and a major
university you're learning technology
that's already outdated by the time
you're learning it with Deb mountain and
coding boot camps like what Deb Mountain
offers they're focusing on really what
is hot right now so and they also focus
on a relatively you know a small set of
skills in order to make sure that they
are teaching you what you need to know
in order to be productive in a in a
workplace environment so make sure you
guys do me a favor do yourself a favor
check out the link in the in the
description tab below for more on Deb
Mountain coding boot camp thanks guys
