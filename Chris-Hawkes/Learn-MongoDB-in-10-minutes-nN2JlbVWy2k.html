MongoDB in this video and I'm gonna try
to quickly get you guys up and running
with it mom or DB is a little bit more
complicated compared to other sequel
databases that you may have use just
because it's so different it's not even
sequel it's actually considered no
sequel so it's nothing like my sequel or
any of that other stuff what you need to
do though if you want to get set up with
MongoDB I'm on Windows but this would
apply to basically anywhere any system
that you're using
you're gonna go to Google and then go to
MongoDB and MongoDB is gonna have an
actual installer so you can go here to
download MongoDB and then you've got all
the different environments here covered
so Windows you can grab the 32-bit
version or 64 it doesn't matter whatever
sources to me one I'm on Windows 8 so
I'm gonna be using the 64-bit version
once you download and install MongoDB
it's going to put the project by default
if you didn't mess with where it gets
installed if you're using Windows it's
going to put it in C colon program files
and then down in a MongoDB and then you
can see it's inside this MongoDB server
so let's go ahead and navigate to this
particular directory in your command
prompt so open up your command prompt in
Windows and we're gonna go see Program
Files C space Mongo DB alright so now
we're inside this Mongo DB directory
after it's been installed if you want to
be able to use MongoDB you actually need
to be able to turn it on and I'll show
you what I'm talking about here so if we
go into the directory and then let's go
ahead and go into the server folder and
now into the 3.0 folder and then into
the bin folder and then here you're
gonna see a bunch of executable files
which mean Program Files and Windows if
you type Mongo it's actually going to
run your Mongo shell but the reason why
I was mentioning that we're gonna have
to do something in order to be able to
use it is because you can see that we
get an exception connection failed what
this means is that
you're Mongo server is not actually
running so you can't even connect to it
so if you're going to be running at your
monitor server you need to go ahead and
go into this 3.0 bin folder and you can
either use Windows or you can use the
command prompt but you need to run the
Mon God or Mongo d applications so this
mom-mom God is way I pronounce it so
anyway just double click on that and
it's gonna actually start your Mongo
server on port two seven zero one seven
which is the default MongoDB port so now
that you've done that you can go back to
your command prompt now you can actually
run a Mongo without the D just a Mongo
and it's gonna actually go into your
your Mongo database setup and here is
your shell so one of the things with my
sequel if you've ever done that and
you've use like a GUI like you know
basically a web website type of thing
that's built on top of the database to
be able to click and drag and view
things visually you typically don't do
that with MongoDB you're mostly using
the actual databases so what if you want
to see what databases you have available
you say show DBS and you can see in this
particular Mongo installation that I
have I have to I have this Intel form 1
and I have local local is actually the
default and will come with your Mongo
installation if you want to use a
database you just simply say use and
then the name of the database so now it
says I've switched to this DB Intel now
if I want to actually see what sort of
tables are in this Intel form one
database that I've switched to I would
say DB dot collection I'm sorry show
just say show collections actually and
you can see in this particular Intel
form one I have to I have accounts and
then system dot indexes so if I wanted
to see everything inside of the accounts
table I could just say DB for the DB
that I'm using which is in 204 one and
then I'll say the actual collections
which is accounts and then I'll just say
dot find and open and close parentheses
and that's actually going to query all
the elements
inside of the of the the database there
so if I wanted to specifically give it a
look up I could do that so I could say
username and then equals test I believe
that's gonna find something and I
actually did this wrong that's a syntax
error this needs to be inside of a
JavaScript object so what that means is
that you're passing in basically a
dictionary which is what a JavaScript
object is we're key value so here's the
key I'm saying username equal test so
you can see it actually did find this
particular example because if you look
the username equals test so that's
actually how you query something in
MongoDB if you wanted to just pull one
record back say there can be multiple
matches you just want one you could say
find one and that does the same thing
and it'll bring back the one object so a
lot of times that's what you want
because fine might come back with a
bunch of different objects if if there
were more than one match now another
thing that's really worried about Mongo
is I actually don't have to use accounts
like say I want to actually build a
table where I could say DB test dot and
then I can do insert so I'll just say
insert and then inside the I could spell
that right so inside of the parentheses
I'll do the curly brace for the
JavaScript object and I'll just say key
value
all right so now it says a write a right
resulted in turn into one so now if I go
ahead and I say show collections you can
see that there's now a test table so
just like that with MongoDB there was no
table there named test before but now
there is so if I went ahead and I said
DB dot test I find it'll fall I find all
records for the test so it's actually
gonna pull back the object that we just
added to this key value and it could
have been any particular thing we want
it so here's DB test - and we'll say and
say things get more complicated so we'll
say key 1 or say you're saying this is a
band right so we'll say it's a band
object in fact I'll make this a band
table so say we're doing a band here so
we're adding a name the name pays side
which is a cool band that I like will
say origin like where they come from New
York and then we'll say origin and then
genre and they're kind of like
alternative basically alright so if I
went ahead and I entered that so we in
we went ahead and we enter it so let's
go ahead and look at all the records in
the bands so we'll say DB dot band up
find and it's going to come back with
this new Bayside band object that we
just created so the thing about MongoDB
compared to a sequel database is that
you can just build your tables on the
fly where my where my sequel we have to
do migrations if you change your date
your actual table structure your your um
your item structure and these items that
were inserting can be thought of as
records or documents and typically
they're referred to as documents so
they're very flexible as far as how
they're laid out so with name origin
genre that's all part of your schema if
you're using something like a sequel
database like my sequel when you define
your schema it becomes very difficult to
change that schema with all the existing
data that might already be in the
database but with MongoDB it's a lot
more flexible so anyway that's one of
the main reasons for using MongoDB as
well as the fact that it's already in
JSON format because this all can just be
thought of as a a
an object and then there's also the fact
that MongoDB can scale very well so
normally with a my sequel setup you have
to set up like a cluster and a server
form it's very difficult to get my my
sequel to be able to you know share the
load amongst a bunch of different
servers now you can do it but you have
to be very talented at it with MongoDB
it was actually made with the mindset
you could just pretty much add some more
server instances and that it's all just
gonna work without actually having to do
a lot of crazy setup so that's really
the number one reason to use MongoDB
alright so let's go ahead and look at
then how we actually delete a collection
so I was actually showing this example
of how you delete a collection I
realized that the recorder was paused so
I had to add these two values back in
but anyway if we wanted to delete a
collection all we have to do is say DB
and then the name of the collection dot
drop open and close parentheses so this
will go ahead and drop the the test
table and we'll get true back and then
I'll do the same thing for the band
table that I showed you guys so now if I
go ahead and I look at the collections
you can see that the two collections
band and tests are now dropped and that
was that easy to do it and I want to
keep the video under ten minutes here so
please rate rate up if you would and
subscribe to my channel for more
information like this and I appreciate
all the followers and everybody that
watches my videos and everything I
definitely appreciate it thanks guys
have a good night bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
