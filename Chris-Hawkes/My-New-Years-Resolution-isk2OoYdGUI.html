noise here and all the videos that I
posted this week i actually created
before i even went on vacation I think
they were kind of rushed to be honest I
was like I've said this before but
already with the channel I felt like you
know there's some sort of obligation to
keep going and doing what I'm going and
one of the interesting things is like
whenever I go on my yearly vacation I
like to come down to South Carolina and
sometimes it'll be like different areas
of South Carolina but usually it's not
that farm it's rive so for me it's
better than like Florida and I like the
South a little bit better than I like
the North it's just a lot more laid back
I think but um I don't know it's like
it's always the time of year where I
kind of unwind and think about like
people have new year's resolutions and
my new year's resolutions typically come
after I take my my vacation just kids
have to go back to school and there's
just a lot of you have to deal with
when you get back then I mean and more
importantly the kids you know because
you got to make sure that they're ready
for the school year and you got to make
sure you're ready to help them with with
school work and all that stuff and I
don't know it's just I guess I kind of
put into perspective you know what it is
being a parent and having family
responsibilities in addition to these
personal aspirations that I have to try
to be
better developer and things like that
but I focus on you know what I
accomplished this year and really what
do I plan to do and the upcoming year
because the summer always just kind of
caps my ear like I said people of New
Year's resolutions after the holidays
but for me it's after I get back from
the beach and you know as we get into
autumn like autumn is one of my favorite
months because in Virginia you know the
boats start dying off and you can get
back outside you can smell the leaves
all you know there's like
and for whatever reason even though
autumn isn't like my favorite weather
when it comes to um well no it's not my
favorite season when it comes to things
to do because I feel like
give the most things to do in like
spring in the summer but you know autumn
is great for just kind of unwinding and
getting ready to go into the winter
months know where I am in the United
States I mean in the winter months it
gets dark at like five o'clock so your
days it's over relatively quick and for
me it I mean that's the time to start
coding getting into personal side
projects because I mean when it gets
dark so early you know they're just less
time to do stuff outside so another
thing too is my cold as hell you don't
really want to be able to
so anyway my new year's resolution this
year is just to become a better
developer for the most part like I don't
plan on responding to any sort of new
work opportunities I've had companies
reach out to me quite a bit in the last
year which I really think is fooled in
some ways and then other times where I
have actually responded back to them I
it's not what I thought it was going to
be or and I just realized that I'm
perfectly content doing what I'm going
even the gym youtube channel it's
probably the biggest success that I've
had personally and I've done other
things like hipster coating all that
stuff this year where where I thought I
would focus more on that but I'll be
I'll be perfectly honest it's not a
passion and if you're going to do try to
do a website it has to be a passion man
you have to want to talk about it all
the time and I've said before the one
reason why I've had even any success on
this YouTube channel is just simply the
fact i do have a passion for programming
and learning and using new technologies
and i continue to develop my skills and
things like that and I know that this
year is another thing where it's like a
reminder that I need to get way better
like I am I am not like you know I would
even argue man like in some sense on the
senior programmer in other since i'm not
there like I talked about it before like
I'm not big on algorithms and Matt Matt
vacations and stuff like that I don't
have to deal with a lot of that I'm
making a game with my son and for I
think that's going to help me a lot when
it comes to actually programming a lot
of mathematical computation that I plan
on going in to see shark another thing
too is I realize that I've devoted a lot
of time to see sharp I mean already for
years so like I'm not really trying to
up and leave and then join some Java
shop or something you know like I mean
for me as far as a back-end server side
technology like I'm I'm pretty decent
Missy sharp and it took quite a bit of
an investment in time and patience to
become good at it to where like you know
these job opportunities whether like
yeah we're a Java but we only need you
to JavaScript for right now and on stuff
I don't know man all that you know
like I'm content I'm content and I don't
really want to be joining amazon and
resting and spending two hours commuting
each way in DC and I've said this before
guys DC man the traffic is terrible we
have trains and stuff that you can use
but like if i were to commute from d say
from where i live which is only about 35
miles south of DC maybe 40 miles south
of DC it would take roughly two hours no
matter how are you go train traffic
just regular highways it doesn't matter
and that's where most of the jobs are
and I just realized that even though
they paid twenty thirty percent more in
the city it's just not worth the time
and um and if I could have my way dude I
would just continue to do what I'm doing
continue to do this YouTube channel
continue to just pursue my interest in
this new year and in just be content man
because I have a lot to be thankful for
so this new year man if you have job
opportunities you want to offer him
Timmy men don't even waste my time
because I'm nine marathon I actually be
wasting your own time I have no
intentions on leaving like the company I
work for or doing any of that stuff so I
am perfectly happy right now as far as
this YouTube channel is concerned I mean
I was doing videos like every single day
and leading up to this vacation like I
said I kind of rushed through a few
videos and I really just feel like they
weren't my best effort and I'm not sure
if I should continue to try to you know
do a daily video or just just doing when
I you know have the motivation but you
know some people like to hear from me
and just I just you know your will hear
about what I'm going man
so the daily videos I mean they're not
going to be the greatest obviously
because you're trying to pump out videos
every single day but I mean right now I
haven't given too much thought about
that but I might as well I mean I'm just
people were going to be interested in
watching me they get roughly separate
hundred views a day so there's obviously
about seven or 800 people that are
monitoring my channel even though I have
thirty one thousand subscribers and
millions of views you know those people
that subscribe they don't check your
channel or every day but obviously about
800 of you guys do is so that's pretty
sweet so I mean as long as I have some
interest there I have no problem doing
these videos every day I just you know
some of them aren't going to be very
good I mean that's just that's just the
way it's going to be I mean it's one of
those things to where I said in and you
know with with priorities and kids and
stuff like that man like I don't have a
whole lot of time for editing like one
of the guys that I watch every now and
then is fun fun function and even edits
his videos like crazy so he probably
spends I think he said he spends like
four to six hours know in one video and
if I did that I'd only spend I'd only do
one video a week but I don't know man
and he probably has a better return as
well so if you look at like his
subscriber base in how fast it grows
like people appreciate the time that
they gets put into the videos and other
people they just want to hear from you
you know it's
vlog and more or less daily update you
know so I follow people just like people
follow me
and I understand why they do it so
anyway guys met him in South Carolina
and today is Thursday and I go home on
Saturday so when i get back home on
saturday it's going to be back to work
and you know just the start of the new
year for me guys so thanks for all the
support on this channel and thanks for
everything and take care guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
