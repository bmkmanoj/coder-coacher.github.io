we want to avoid having to maintain a
ton of code as our application gets big
so what we're gonna do is build a folder
inside of our templates directory which
we're just gonna call base and in there
is gonna be where our base pages sit
we're probably just gonna have one for
right now but if you have a larger app
you might have more than one or if your
styles between pages fluctuate greatly
between one page so the next thing you
may need to have more than one but now
that we have that let's go ahead and
create our base page we're gonna into
our folder here actually need to include
this in my project say add new item
django HTML we're just gonna say base
so inside of here
all right so now that we have our base
page built I'm gonna go ahead and go
copy into basic HTML code I don't want
you guys have to see me actually write
all this out but
I just copied this stuff off the screen
if you need to do that see our title
here what we're gonna do is we're gonna
create a block now this this part is
important underneath our meta put this
block title this block title allows any
page that uses the the base page we can
have block titles in there and then
whatever is in those blocks will be
inserted in the page and I'll show you
an example of that in just a moment all
right
yeah it should be it for just right this
second Oh even I'll create one more
block and just say block content every
block has to have an in block otherwise
it'll throw an error
alright so base page has been built here
now there index page let's get rid of
all this and we're gonna go ahead and
say
sorry about that so we're gonna say
extends and then here we're gonna say
base base I think we just call it base
HTML I think I'm going to capitalize
all right that's it and then now that
we're extending from base we're gonna go
down here and we'll block title say
movie dough that'll be the title
whatever all right and then we'll just
say and block the end of the space is
this went between the percent signs as
well now you can have white space it
doesn't matter so if it's easier that
looks better to you you can do it that
way it doesn't it doesn't matter how you
do it as long as has a blog title in in
block and those block titles are in your
base page
then it'll work so now we have also a
block content block content and we'll
say welcome to movie
all right now let's go ahead and try to
request the same page and you can see
the outcome is the exact same even
though we just changed everything you're
in you're using two pages to display one
page it all works properly so if
everything and to know that that word I
mean obviously it wouldn't work if we
would know but you can also see the
movie dev title and everything so
everything worked exactly the way we
want and this is good because a lot of
this repetitive code can go inside your
base page and then the pages like index
all it needs to say is okay I'm filling
in a title I'm filling in content the
rest of all the other stuff is already
filled in and everything so it's uh it's
a good way to keep your code use to a
minimum all right I'm so that's really
all I wanted to touch upon in this video
I don't want to go too far into HTML
syntax and things like that since this
video is primarily about Django we will
definitely have to add some CSS style
pages to our header here and JavaScript
and stuff like that to make our web
application look nicer I'll probably
have some of that stuff in this tutorial
I don't really know it I mean if
somebody already knows CSS and I'm here
to learn Django that's really not gonna
be too helpful for them so I don't want
to get too much into that but in the
next video most likely you're gonna see
some tags and stuff in here for their
HTML and the CSS and all that and if you
have any questions with how to do that
just send me an iamb or something maybe
I'll make another video on how to do
that but it's relatively simple it's
just regular HTML and CSS stuff that has
nothing to do with Django alright thank
