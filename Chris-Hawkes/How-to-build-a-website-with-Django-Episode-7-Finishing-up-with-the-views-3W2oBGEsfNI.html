ahead and just finish up the methods
that we were going before to just get
everything situated here so let's go
ahead and just pull up our other
templates that we have just created like
about us and one thing that we do want
to update is our base page we have this
block title here every page should have
a title that's being implemented so
let's go ahead and put that in here so
the title is about us and we'll get rid
of this and then we'll just call this a
body block safe so every page is
essentially going to follow the same
method here back we'll just copy this
and let's go to contact us this change
the title attacked us
privacy policy terms are done about us
contact us and Eric scrubs index that's
all good all right so now that we've
done that let's go back to our views
file that's not the right one I'm sorry
I'm go back to the views file in your
main main project and it's going to in
query the database for the appropriate
terms for each one so we'll say this is
contact
I'll just going to finish this off real
quick privacy don't have the right name
yeah contact all right now it's going at
our dictionary here
alright so that we have everything where
I mean request out you're getting the
object for whatever page that you're on
any additional pages that are like
technical pages will just follow suit on
something like this it's a pretty basic
website but I mean we're pretty good
right now
alright so now that we've finished that
part off I'm going to go ahead and
finish this video so in the future
videos we're going to get into some more
like the finer tuning of the website and
I'll probably need some additional
information from the people that I'm
actually building this for to be able to
you know really carry on with it right
on i'll continue to to work on here in
the future i appreciate you guys
watching and have a good day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
