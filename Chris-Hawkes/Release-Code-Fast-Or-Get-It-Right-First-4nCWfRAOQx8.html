it's been a long week programming when
you've been programming like literally
all day like focusing on new things like
I mean it can really drain you for sure
now
I'm going to answer a question that
plane has I think it's a really good
question and I'm glad he asked it
because honestly I was like what should
I make a video about and I kind of went
back and forth on a few things I wasn't
really passionate about and then mostly
you know I'm going to read the comments
and sure enough so he says hey Chris I'm
curious about your opinion on something
at what point is an application ready to
be released when developing software you
could add X amount of features before
release and Y amount after is updates
it's difficult to find a balance point
though because the more features you add
to the release the better it is for the
user and more likely that we use it
however the problem is that you could
spend all all the time adding features
to a project before the release and then
after the release nobody uses the
software and you've wasted all the time
adding those features if you add all of
the features asteroids are released you
will save time developing but people may
not use your software because it doesn't
have those features I have run into this
problem quite a bit I just don't know
what to do before the release and what
to do after if people are using a
software so this you know this is this
is like a really good question this is a
question that comes from a guy that is
young age but has experience already as
far as like these things that kind of go
through your mind when you're developing
software especially as a business like
if you're going to do it as a business
model and it's something that has burned
me so many times now that you know the
latest burns that it's the latest time
it's burned me was because of my release
of a hipster code I tried to rush the
thing out the door I ended up
implementing like credit cards and user
profiles and all this other stuff and I
was just I was like I had been working
on the project on my spare time for like
three months and I was just I was
getting tired of working on it and it
was at that point where like I needed to
like just release it because I felt like
if I was going to spend more time with
it I might just disband it all together
and I thought that you know it might
draw some attention and and and
ultimately it didn't really so
but the thing is is like I rushed it out
the door and by rushing it out the door
immediately I started having eyes on it
I started getting people registering to
it but then at that point you now have a
database you have users that are now
logged in that database so if you want
to go and start like you know updating
your database table for the user profile
because you want to now accept emails or
like alternate addresses or something
like that you now have a database that
has a bunch of a bunch of data and is
that doesn't you know consists of this
new data that you need to collect which
means you have to do database migrations
and and anytime you're doing a database
migration if you didn't plan things
properly especially it's a one-man shop
like your database you could many like
I've easily screwed up my database like
ten different times in production
websites where literally the website was
down for like eight hours sometimes more
than a day or so and that happens in
production in real life sometimes but
the point is is like these these
features like if you don't plan things
out properly
it's ultimately going to burn you as
you're trying to develop a business
product now when you're in the business
and corporate world like every
corporation I've ever seen is like
rushing things out the door and it's not
just the companies that you know I've
actually had experience with or anything
like that it's it's like across the
board you look at video gaming nowadays
like EA when it released battlefield for
that thing was so buggy even though it
was a great game it was so ridiculously
buggy how often did we get brand-new
games where it's like you get all this
like scaled-down stuff but we're going
to release this humongous patch that's
like as large as the game itself Tony
Hawk's latest game which was an absolute
disaster for Activision it came out and
had a first-day patch that was larger
than the actual game itself so and it
was still the biggest piece of
you've ever seen so like that is like
almost like the mantra or the you know
just a status quo and video gaming but
it's also the same way amongst really
almost any software-as-a-service type of
startup they all have the same type of
functionality let's get you know a B and
C out what worries
D&amp;amp;F later on and a lot of times they're
trying to they're trying to rush into
the market to be the first to the market
the problem is is that sometimes when
you're the first to the market if your
products not you know head-and-shoulders
better than anybody else that could come
along somebody else can come along and
eat your lunch and stomp on your head
while you're down on the ground because
they have more money they can hire
better you know better engineers and
they can make a product and you were
trying to make but don't make it better
because they have you know better Ivy
League credentials you know the million
dollar VCS so that you know that is one
of the problems about rushing a product
out but at the same time I know a guy
that who reviews to use web frameworks
because he always thought that a web
framework was going to eventually
bottleneck him down the road and and
I've been an advocate of you know saying
that you can't afford not to use a web
framework so if I'm going to do a Python
like if I'm a Python website I'm going
to use probably Django or flex I'm not
trying to read all that from
scratch now eventually you can outgrow
the framework Django was originally the
framework that that Pinterest was built
on and Pinterest was at you know
eventually outgrew it now Pinterest
doesn't need a monolith web framework
and really nobody does anymore nowadays
it's like this push towards like
microservice API is like little tiny API
is all over the place and like those
very bare bones back in API using
something like nodejs and maybe
expressed but the the industry I think
swings back and forth it almost seems
like maybe I could be wrong about this
like I remember one of the windows
editions like one of the older Windows
like Windows 95 or maybe it was 2000 I
remember what it was but have like
58,000 bugs when they released it but
and back in those days it wasn't so
common it didn't seem like you had to
download this humongous patch but
computer games that seemed like always
needed to have patches whenever I would
mess with them so I don't know man I
guess I guess it's probably always been
there but it just seems like you look at
Erik rice or a restyle not pronounce his
last name but he did this book in fact
I'm I haven't read here the Lean Startup
there
something or another anyway he is like
keywords went into it in Palo Alto and
he was younger than my set and he really
coined this whole phrase like the Lean
Startup or it's like you don't try to
figure out what everybody wants you jump
to the market as quickly as possible and
you adapt and that almost seems like
that's what's like everybody is doing
these days so there's there's like
there's pros and cons to that man but in
his example I think they were building a
um some sort of like avatar thing like I
have no idea how like they even made
money with it to be honest with you I
don't I don't that still baffles me it
sounds like a terrible idea but that was
like their entire thing was that they
were they were going to build some sort
of user profile system but they were
like you know instant messaging was
becoming popular during the startup and
everything and and they were so they
were trying to work on an instant
messaging app but by the time they ended
up releasing I believe they ended up
finding out that like the profile system
that they didn't really have as like a
front running business model turned out
to be the more successful version your
version of their product and they ended
up going with that so sometimes you can
test the waters by releasing quickly and
getting that customer feedback and and
that's honestly like why game companies
will be beta betas and stuff like that
to get you know that get that free
community support for testing and
everything so yeah I mean there is
really no right answer to that companies
to me it seems like err or more of the
mindset of getting things out as quickly
as possible there's a lot of unrealistic
deadlines across the board and IT and
for me as a single man operation like
when I've run my own business and tried
to start websites and things like that I
would definitely suggest that you would
spend more time on the you know is on
the front end before you try to release
to get those features in because it's
going to be very very difficult for you
as a single person to then have to come
back and try to you know do a bunch of
to do's and
and redesign your database or your your
API or add you know a B and C features
when maybe you only have one or two so I
think that yeah that would be my
suggestion businesses are going to
continue to try to release as quickly as
possible while users are not or at least
they shouldn't all right well thanks for
the question that was a great question
guys you guys take care have a good
night thanks for watching make sure you
subscribe and thank you all for the the
well wishes with my daughter's video
that was actually quite popular alright
