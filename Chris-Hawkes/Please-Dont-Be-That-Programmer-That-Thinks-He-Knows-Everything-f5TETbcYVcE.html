good night and normally I don't get into
pissing matches with people but for
Christ's sakes some of the stuff that I
get from people I mean generally it's
it's nice and whatever but then other
times like it just kind of strikes a
nerve but it's one of the things I did
want to kind of clear up it and is you
know whether or not javascript is
considered a functional language or not
like I have this guy like who's
responding to you know this video of how
I taught myself to be a programmer which
is generally well-received I mean I'm
not like claiming to be an expert I mean
for Christ's sakes I taught myself how
to program so I'm not going to be some
sort of academic expert but he said I'm
really happy for you but there are
online resources that would teach you
the difference between a functional
programming language in an
object-oriented language javascript is
not a functional language so apparently
this guy is an expert because he says
that it's not a functional language and
I said actually and I don't know why it
does the apostrophe is this way but it's
actually you're wrong or maybe we both
are we might both be right who knows
javascript is sometimes considered an
untyped language but that's not true and
we've talked about types or at least I
talked about types and some of my
previous videos to this where you know I
explain what a type is and people will
say oh JavaScript's an untyped language
some people will say yeah well based on
the parameters it's definitely not a
type language so it must be a nun type
language well you know even Brandon I
the guy that developed the JavaScript
language was saying of course you know
these types have into these types it's
not an untyped language so there's the
people like I guess can get very very
specific about their philosophies when
it comes to coding and stuff and it's
it's sometimes annoying like when you've
worked all day you're tired and like you
know maybe you didn't know something two
months ago or maybe you know but either
way you have people that like you no
matter of fact this is the way it is and
they're wrong like they're not even
they're not even right and I you know
and I actually have this channel where
I've actually said things you know
incorrectly or have been playing you
know flat-out wrong before so I've never
claimed to be an expert or anything like
that but if we look at you know what a
functional language is right if we look
at the stack overflow generally if you
want to know you know what is considered
to be like you know like if you're
dealing with Python like pythonic like
I've had people asking about python is
the way you go to stack over
you get your answers like stackoverflow
is the best community that I've ever
seen online of being able to regulate
itself about giving advice and I mean
there are some of the smartest people in
the world that are on this website right
here and I mean just the discussions are
just like I just you know beautiful
really I mean it's just you know
academics mainly you know just talking
it out so this guy has a great answer
right 120 of Oh 53,000 score which is
really high and he says there's no
accepted definition of a functional
programming language if you define a
functional language as a language that
supports first-class functions and
lambdas then yes javascript is a
functional language if you also consider
the factors like support for
immutability algebraic data types
pattern matching partial application etc
then no javascript is not a functional
language so from what I've seen of what
people consider to be a functional
language the most important thing is
that functions are a first class citizen
so when we talked about types functions
have the same exact features as a
general type in the programming language
and given it an example of what I mean
we can just pull up a browser here and
do the coding example right into the
console where if I said like variable x
equals and then I can assign it a
function that says alerts hello world
all right so here's my function variable
X as a function if I actually said X you
can see that it actually returns the
function as a first class citizen and
that can also execute it as a function
where then fires and it's hello world it
prints to the screen so I can actually
pass X to other functions and you know
it works the same way so JavaScript for
many intents and purposes is a
functional language no matter what
people say so maybe eventually we'll
have some sort of you know perfect
academic example of what is considered a
functional language and what's not but I
wouldn't say people are wrong when they
say that javascript is a functional
language and when they say that it's not
so anyway guys I'm just a kind of a you
know point out there like you're never
going to know everything and there's
always going to be people that act like
everything and they they really don't
and as long as you know that they don't
and you know that you don't hopefully
you guys can get somewhere because
that's one thing that you will run into
a lot in the programming world
especially where you know people always
think they're right there's a lot of big
egos in the programming world and and
I'm not one of them to be honest with
you I have never been overconfident in
fact it seems like the more I program
and the better I become the less
confident I get and my abilities because
I start seeing you know complications
you know develop and and like I realized
that you know I've been wrong so much in
the past you know and I know so much
more now than I knew back then that you
know how could I know what I'm talking
about now because I know you know five
years from now or even three months from
now I'm going to look back and be like
well you know maybe JavaScript shouldn't
be a functional language I don't know
but would that particular argument I
really don't think that's going to
change in three months I think that I
think you know people can have different
interpretations of what something is and
programming is a very new field when it
comes to like if you compare your
programming logic to mathematics and and
things like that you know algebra know
stuff that goes back to like you know
like Jesus I mean I don't even know
actually I know it's like what a Persian
nation or something like that developed
algebra so I mean those are basically
tried and true formulas that they go
along you know they last for a long time
and then you know somebody like Einstein
comes along and they're like well you
know based on you know standard geometry
this isn't going to work for warp space
time and gravity all this stuff so they
have to kind of re you know formulate
opinions and things like that and and I
think programming is like that but it's
you know fast forward a million miles an
hour we're like things change overnight
especially like you look at javascript
and like all the implementation or the
fragmentation going on within the
JavaScript community where you know you
have all these different libraries that
claim to be the number one way of doing
it you have libraries like typescript in
darts and coffee script that claim
they're going to be the replacement to
JavaScript and you know they just fizzle
out you know just like everything else
so a lot of a lot of changing dynamic
and programming and just I guess be
careful when you try to act like you
know everything so you never want to be
that guy so anyway guys just just quick
advice hopefully I don't sound like I'm
ranting too much but I'm just kind of
looking for motivation i read that
comment i feel like i have motivation to
do a video so anyway guys thanks for
watching have a good night bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
