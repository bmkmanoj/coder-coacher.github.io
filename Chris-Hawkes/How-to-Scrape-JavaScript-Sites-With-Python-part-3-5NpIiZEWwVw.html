what we're gonna need to do is go ahead
and check out the Appleby's form here so
we can figure out how we need to enter
in the data that we need so what I do
when I'm looking at these elements and
I'm like okay I need to interact with
this so I'm gonna go to right click on
it and then in Chrome I can just inspect
element and I can see that this input
type it takes in characters just a text
input box and the class name is input
text so that's what I'm gonna be looking
for and it appears to be the only form
on the page so it should be we should be
good with it just searching for that one
thing so it's called input text so we
need to go ahead and then we're just
gonna create an element so I'll just say
you know M equals browser fine tell them
my class name and then we put in the
class sandwich for this input tag and
then we're gonna say got clear cuz right
now if you look there is something there
and then we're gonna go ahead and find
that joint again after we clear it of
any text that may be in there
so now element is gonna be that text box
I'm going to do a little bit of a sleep
pattern here so that we're not
requesting and data too fast so I'll
sleep for 3 seconds and
and then what we need is a just a simple
array so I'll say my array equals this
isn't a reaction I'm sorry I said more
it's a list and Python as was considered
so I'm gonna have some zip codes in here
too one seven seven one three two four
eight two two five
I guess so those are different zip codes
around somewhat locals for me
well this one's in Maryland so now that
we have that we could do a loop over our
race we're gonna say for I and my array
and then once we're in the loop we need
to go ahead and figure out we need to UM
remember we need to send the key so what
we're gonna do is we're gonna say elem
so we're selecting this is the box that
we have selected I'm gonna say send key
string I since it's a number we're gonna
want to send the string cuz that's
really all you can send and then just
say Keys dot return so what it's saying
is that send keys meaning the string I
which is the for each zip code we're
sending it and I really this whole thing
needs to be in a loop for I cause we
don't we want to only do this one time
for each so where they were going
through the right here I keep saying
 array but I it's a my list so
we'll go through the list one element at
a time and then we have the input so
we're inputting it and then we put keys
return
and once we do that let's just go ahead
and I'll show you what it does from here
see what's going on yeah we're missing a
parenthesis here my bad
price you're missing a parenthesis on
the end of this alright so now that we
run this what you're gonna see is going
to see the browser pull up and then for
each element within visit the array or
the list then it's going to go ahead and
put that into the the box and I'll
search for all three of those tiptoes
unfortunately this thing is a bit slow
with all the stuff that I have going on
I've said this in other videos if you're
just running this from your local
computer without doing as many things as
I'm trying to do on my computer then
it'll run a little bit smoother
another thing to ISM selenium-webdriver
of waits for things to occur before it
actually employed status so it actually
has to wait for the entire thing to load
before it tries to store something
actually gonna kill this program real
quick one of the things that you want to
get in that habit of going since for
each item see
I should realize that our URL because
what what's going on here is our URL
it's hitting we want Applebee's
locations that was the page that I
showed you before and we were hitting up
Applebee's so it was running into a bit
of a problem there so we need to change
this to Applebee's and then forward
slash locations and that should be
better okay let's try this again
oh damn it I'm gonna do it I changed the
thing because I didn't want to confuse
you guys with the array of the list I
mean it's kind of the same thing but we
changed it to my list so I will run this
again I apologize
so if you look at what's going on here
it's actually the top part so it's
finding the first element which really
it's not a big deal because they both
return the same data and so I'm not sure
hopefully you guys saw that but it was
putting in these zip codes up here and
so the next thing to do in the next
video we're actually going to extract
the data that we need like the addresses
phone numbers or whatever for each round
that it does and then go ahead and like
save those four text file so you can see
that it's actually working and thank you
for watching please rate positive and
subscribe to my channel I appreciate it
thank you guys have a good day bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
