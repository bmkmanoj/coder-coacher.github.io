welcome back so the first thing we need
to do is to get started is we need to
install Python right so let's go ahead
and pull up Google we're just gonna type
Python and go to the download we're
gonna use the 3 series I'm on Windows so
I'm gonna do python 3.5 point 1 this is
gonna install the executable now just to
kind of touch on some of the key points
of python 3.1 or 3.5 point 1 the 3
series is you know the newest version of
python so it's quite a bit different
from 2.7 so there's gonna be little
things if you've ever used or earlier
versions of Python where like when you
do print you have to put it in
parenthesis and it has better Unicode
support the newest version of 3.5 also
has a sink and a weight for parallel
programming making it a little bit
easier so even though pythons single
threaded you can still make use of some
functional aspects of it and Python 3.5
will make that easier so let's go ahead
and make sure you click Add Python 3.5
to your path that's really important
that way you're a program your computer
is going to know how to execute a Python
program so to give you as a background
on Python if it's an interpreted
language so python has an interpreter
which is like a compiler that you're
installing on your machine now so when
you write Python code you put it in just
a text file and we're going to use a
program to actually write our code but
ultimately all it is is a text file and
you tell python to read that text file
and it turns that text file which is
human readable into a machine level
language and then it actually executes
it and that's how it works so that's
kind of in a nutshell how it works
that's really all you need to know for
that so it's going to install this joker
now as far as what tool we want to use
to to work with Python there are several
editors out there a lot of them are free
so sublime text is a popular one for
Python and it's free for evaluation
purposes so it's not necessarily a free
program but the evaluation is somewhat
subjective as far as like how long you
want to evaluate it so I guess it
depends on what your moral compass is
there but sublime text is is free like I
said for evaluation and you guys might
want to check that out god damn this
computer slow so here's the sublime
website you can just download it and run
here's the Atom installer this looks
very similar to sublime so they're both
pretty looking like that my personal
favorite is Python tools for Visual
Studio Visual Studio is great for
c-sharp and other languages JavaScript
has a lot of tools and everything the
Python tools has really come a long way
so that's typically what I do
visual studio should be free the Express
Edition so you guys can get a get a hold
of that but you think if you're gonna
use Visual Studio you have to download
this Python tools for it and it's like
an extension that it adds on to it but
having a tool like this is really cool
because it has intellisense so it'll
kind of give you hints on what to type
and what you're looking for and what you
may be doing wrong it's just an
invaluable tool so there are several
options there and I'm not going to try
to press which one you guys should do
like I said I recommend Visual Studio
but that is somewhat of an acquired
taste and it's because I have to use it
for other languages and then you know
maybe a particular Python person all the
way may not like it because it's it's
more of a Windows product all right so
now that we have Python installed let's
go ahead and open up a command prompt so
if you're on Windows you would just
right click here and go to the not the
control panel godamn
command prompt and from the command
prompt here you should be able to just
type Python and if everything went well
because we added it to the path your
computer knows what Python is and it's
gonna go ahead and X enter into this
little isolated environment that all
Python installations come with and what
you can do is you can actually write
real Python coding here so I could say x
equals this is a string and then print X
and this is one of those print things
that takes a little while to get used to
compared to two and three you have to
put anything inside the print and in
parenthesis so you can see it prints out
the value of our string there so that's
just an isolated Python environment if
you want to exit out just press control
C and that will access it out of it but
if you have Python there then that's
good so with python 3.5 it comes with a
tool that we use to install packages so
if you've ever used any sort of package
manager and dotnet world you hear of a
nougat and in Python there's the pip
installer and then also a node is the
NPM package manager soap it comes with
the Python installation so if we say pip
install Django this Joker should go out
and pick up the latest version of Django
and you can see it's actually being
flagged by my antivirus hopefully it
doesn't do that constantly but anyway
it's actually reaching across the wire
through the web it downloaded the Django
framework and then it's gonna go ahead
and install so you can see that's all
taking place right now
and we'll just continue to go ahead and
give it a minute here
and just to give you guys an idea let's
go ahead and open up the file explorer
because I want to show you where
packages are gonna be installed if we go
over to our C Drive and we need to find
our Python installation and what's weird
as a security concern they no longer
install Python on like your root
directory so it's actually going to be
under your users if you're using Windows
and here's my user and then if I go all
the way in here all the way under app
data I think local then you have might
be roaming
son of a bitch I don't remember where it
installed
so if we looked it up online you can see
it actually puts it inside this location
so local programs so out data local
programs Python Python three five live
I don't live that's not a place on three
532 okay alright this is this is what we
were looking for here so in this folder
under your if you go under Lib and then
go down to site packages you can see
that this is where we actually have any
sort of modules that were installing
through pip and you can see Jango is now
on here this is the download file that
was downloaded and python has these
weird wheel files now which are kind of
replacing their old tar files and you
can see that this is like a temporary
directory where it reached across the
web downloaded django into this to look
directory and then it installed it so
you can see this is the actual installed
django this is the django core this is
everything that makes django tick so all
this code is written in an open-source
way so if we went to a django under
github
I apologize about my computer being slow
it's just kind of slow with like all the
the webcam and everything going on all
that stuff makes it a lot slower than
normal but if you've ever wanted to
inspect the code you can actually go
through and look at all these folders or
you can do a search on github here so
this isn't master we probably don't want
to do that we probably want to look for
a specific version you can see the
stable 1.9 so if we go down to that
let's expand this here and you can see
this inside the Django folder that's
everything that you see where I just
showed you so all that stuff right here
is all inside here so if you've ever
wondered here you can see the kind of
changes that you know individual files
and stuff like that have been that have
have been made you can see contributors
and all that stuff so it's pretty
interesting if you've ever wanted to get
involved in something like that
if you've also wanted to search a code
like say you get some sort of weird
error message you can actually type that
here and it will search inside the
repository and give you an idea because
a lot of times you may get some sort of
exception that's occurring inside of the
Django source code and it'll point to a
line and um and you can look that up
either in here it might be easier to
look it up in there and then kind of you
know be like oh okay it's in config
local and blah blah so anyway those are
just some tips some helpful tips on
where Django is being installed and all
that stuff all right so if we go back
down here you can see that it's now just
successfully installed so if everything
went well we should be able to run this
Django admin dot Pi and if you just run
that and press Enter
you're gonna get all these different
things that are available like DB show
migrate run server all it so what that
means is that it knows where Django
exists so everything is installed
correctly now we have Python 3:5
installed we have Django installed so in
the next video we can go ahead and
create our first Django project alright
guys thanks for watching please
subscribe vote up the videos if you
would I'm trying to get more views and
hopefully if you guys have any questions
feel free to reach out and ask me
I'm trying to be as helpful as possible
in this and I try to promote Django as
much as possible
alright guys thanks for watching have a
good night bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
