question here from prop poop poll
interesting name he says hey Chris loved
your videos man I've been learning by
reading books as well as watching
YouTube videos sometimes I feel like it
is almost inevitable to not copy and
paste the code from the book you were
reading or the YouTube video you're
watching and also because most of the
time these tutorials teach you the best
practice and also the books my question
is when do you draw the line how do you
actually learn when you were are a
beginner did you copy the tutorials and
then try to build something modeled
after the tutorial that you learn from
is it okay to copy and paste boilerplate
Thanks so here's here's the truth most
people copy and paste code most
programmers actually copy and paste code
that's what that's what we've done
forever before we had internet and Stack
Overflow programmers would actually copy
actual text files or you know whatever
sort of text editor file if it's a
Python file or something they would have
all that shit saved in a folder of how
they iterate files or us you know use
the OS walk there was all these
different things that they ran into time
and time again where instead of having
to to research because it was much
harder you know back in the day before
Stack Overflow made it very easy to to
find the answer to the question that
you're asking and really that's the
combination of both Stack Overflow and
guy I'm sorry Google because in most
cases people actually you know they're
searching and Google and Google smart
enough to find the right Stack Overflow
whereas if you were searching at Stack
Overflow you probably wouldn't have as
good of results at least that's the way
I do it so you know most of these people
they saved them to directories and
things like that and they weren't they
weren't great programmers like they knew
that you know if they didn't do
something multiple times that they were
going to forget and most of the time in
programming you're kind of doing things
you're not doing the same repetitive
stuff over and over again that's not why
you get paid a hundred thousand or one
hundred and twenty thousand dollars a
year to do the same thing over and over
again it's because you're moving into
this technology you're moving into this
framework you're moving into this
language it doesn't matter what you know
you're constantly moving around so it's
how quickly can you adapt how quickly
can you learn
quickly can you just hit the ground
running because a lot of that comes from
from copying and pasting now where you
you truly become a senior is where
you're like you know what I do obviously
know how to do a for loop in JavaScript
or in Python or something like that you
don't have to look up those examples
every single time now if you're trying
to do like an OS walkthrough all the
directories in Python because you're
mostly coding in JavaScript or in
c-sharp and that's perfectly fine to be
able to do that if you don't remember
how to use the HTTP web client that's
built in the c-sharp that's perfectly
fine to look up how to do that if you
don't know about like authentication and
authorization depending on what sort of
framework a lot of that stuff is gonna
be copy and pasted and and just to be
honest with you what separates the
seniors from the beginners or the
ignorant I'm really not ignorant but
maybe lazy is that the seniors at least
understand why they're copying and
pasting and they understand the the
benefits that they have gained from
copying somebody else's code without
having to reinvent the wheel you hear
that a lot in programming and then they
also understand how to tweak it to their
needs but because we all need a shared
state system in a react code base does
it all mean you know it doesn't mean
that worse you know if we're a supposed
senior that we're going to go out and
we're gonna build Redux because we want
to build a purely functional state
management system for multiple
components I mean we're not going to do
that and it's it's not expected that we
do that and it wouldn't be
cost-effective for the companies that
actually hire us to write code to do
that so to answer your question in this
day and age most of the job is
surrounding copying and pasting code
because if you're literally writing
everything from scratch you're wasting a
lot of company time and money and you're
having to you're probably not doing it
good it's it's its wife physics you know
and physics you know people like you
know let's look at it like even Einstein
I probably shouldn't get into something
like that I truly don't know a whole lot
about but you know Einsteins not going
to go back from square one he's gonna
learn based off of what you know
Newton's laws of motion had taught him
and things like that so he's you know
you stand on the shoulder of giants that
came before you want to
comes to programming just as it comes to
math and physics and things like that
you can't possibly understand all of it
and for that reason yes we're gonna be
copying and pasting and we should be
copying and pasting from good sources a
good senior programmer knows when he's
copying and pasting some shit because we
sometimes copy and paste some shit out
of haste or a lack of time but as you
become a better developer you start to
realize ma'am you know why is it doing
that do I really need to do all that oh
I can tweak this and I can tweak that
and that's that's a lot of what you do
now that doesn't mean and I don't want
to discourage anybody from like starting
their own framework or something like
that but one of the reasons why I even
created my own framework for it was a
git frame would not get but um it's on
github and let me pull it up here the
reason why I created it though is
because I wanted to learn so what I'm
saying is that if you truly want to
learn you want to master something then
you know build your own project but
here's base ijs it's named after my dog
named Bayside which is named after the
Bayside band the rock band so it's kind
of a lineage there that goes down the
line so I'm not directly impeding upon
the band's name but yeah the the band
name truly influenced this framework so
with this so I didn't have to do this
right I could have easily used express
or I could have used a million other
node.js frameworks that are out there
but I said you know I want to learn the
process of a raw node application that
does templating and data binding and
things like that so did I go out and
have to do all of it from scratch no I
didn't actually I ended up using some
dependencies out there that made my life
easier so if I look at the package J US
you can see that well in the dev
dependencies I'm using chai so I'm not
creating my own assertion library or my
own test Runner which is mocha I'm not
building my own HTTP request library I'm
using requests to do that also here's a
big thing none jokes that's a template
engine so there's a there was a lot of
code behind the template engine now my
experience of saying hey do I want to
use nunchucks or do I want to use
something else do I want to use pug or
mustache or any
like that but I chose nunchucks based
off of you know what I felt like was
experience and really I wanted to model
something close to the Jango environment
that I was used to and that was really
my my reasonings for using nunchucks and
some people had asked me why I did that
and and that's that's the answer to why
I did that
so so that's really it guys I mean
you're you're and you're never gonna
write stuff from scratch when you're
first learning you're gonna be reading
out of a book you're going to be looking
at Stack Overflow the best way to learn
is to build something if you're going to
be using a web technology spin up a web
application whether it's expressed yes
or any other framework out there spin up
the application and get your templates
in your static folder all that in
working order so that you can include
react files or knockout J's files or
whatever it is that you're working on
and just build stuff because that's
really going to be the way that you
learn and and really building stuff is
going to be copying and pasting and
using libraries and things like that but
it's going to be a definite learning
process like you're never going to be I
would say even for this framework which
is very very minimalistic I would have a
hard time believing that somebody that
literally is just getting started coding
is just going to be able to jump in and
build their own command line tool and
things like that or to understand even
what a command line tool is used for
those things just come with time and you
really just have to respect the process
of just giving it that you're your as
much time and attention as you can like
comfortably do and you know health you
know health wise be able to contribute
and eventually you'll notice that you
are making strides but once again last
last thing I'll say that don't worry
about copying pasting code the best of
us do it all right thanks guys what make
sure you subscribe take care bye hey
guys so a lot of you ask me how do I get
my foot in the door to become a
programmer and I just want to take a
moment to mention dev Mountain coding
boot camp is a 12-week intensive course
that focuses on the technologies of the
here-and-now for web development some of
the things that they're actually
teaching in this 12-week course it's
geared to get you into the industry by
focusing on things like jQuery nodejs
react angular
how to use github so a lot of the things
that you're going to need to do as a
developer as soon as you start they're
going to be teaching you in this and
this coding bootcamp and the entire goal
is to be able to get you into the
industry within 12 weeks so if you guys
are interested in learning more
information about Deb mountain coding
boot camp just check out the link in the
description tab of this video thank you
for watching and have a good day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
