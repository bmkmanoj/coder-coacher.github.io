thanks for watching this video and I'm
actually going to do a first answer to a
question that I received a guy by the
name of a beam if I'm saying that right
and last name starts with M so if a beam
m and he asks he's like I've really
enjoyed your videos and I just started
learning programming and then you talked
about Python and I chose PHP for a web
developer do you think I should stick
with PHP or change over to Python and
then he mentions that he is more
comfortable currently with PHP so one of
the things that that I would number one
look at is as far as where is the
technology headed into the future now
PHP the first thing I would caution is
that it for the last few years it seems
to be losing market share year after
year and it's giving that up to Python
and and Ruby for the most part when it
comes to the web domain so another thing
you know in that regard is that PHP is a
primarily web-based language so it's a
language that was invented for the web
and that's really the only place you're
going to see it get used is for web and
when you compare something like that to
Python Python is in robotics it's in
education it's in GUI app development so
actual software applications some of
them are written in Python it's a lot of
scripting is done for it so a lot of you
know file scripts you know to clean up
certain directories and things like that
you'll see a lot of Python there where
you wouldn't really see PHP
so definitely when it comes to having
multiple domains there's not even a
question about whether or not Python
and/or PHP Python is clearly the better
option now I'm going to borrow from this
website here the CAC MACNA org they
posted last year an article that shows
that python is now the most taught
integral introductory language and 39 of
the top computer science departments so
these aren't just small schools are
actually some of the largest and some of
the most distinguished IT schools in the
United States and I believe actually the
world I'm not sure you'd have to go to
this article here to get more
information to read through this
actually and read it through all of it
but I do know you're just to touch on
the highlight is that pythons now it
overtook Java and 2014 as the most
taught introductory language so PHP
isn't going to show up anywhere on this
list so unfortunately Python also has
PHP beat in that regard and the article
also goes on to mention some of that
schools so I'll go ahead and just
mention like Carnegie Mellon mell again
or some sort of Carnegie Mellon MIT
Stanford Berkeley a lot of these major
universities so it's not even just top
universities or some Ivy League schools
in there as well now you mentioned that
you are more comfortable with PHP
already than Python so that should also
be considered now a lot of people
they'll out they love to bash PHP they
say it's the worst language of all time
and that it will teach you horrible
habits and things like that and some of
that may be true but just want to touch
on a key point here that there are some
major web sites out there that are
currently running a PHP stack so I'll go
ahead and just give a shout out to PHP
as far as the top three that come to
mind for me number one is Wikipedia it's
a top 10 web site in the world so that's
using PHP now this isn't the most this
isn't the prettiest site in the world it
doesn't do much there's not much
functionality there it's it's an open
source encyclopedia so the the amount of
sophistication is I guess not that
impressive but the fact that it's so
widely used and that it is a top ten web
site in the world and running a PHP
stack is pretty good second in line you
have flickr.com so Flickr's used to be
the number one photo sharing website
it's owned by Yahoo and currently still
is pretty big and popular
unfortunately Yahoo is struggling with
profitability and they have been for
several years so we don't know what's
going to end up happening the flicker in
the future but for right now it's still
a pretty established brand and
as of last year it's still running on a
PHP stack and then finally the largest
one is going to be facebook.com so
everybody knows facebook.com/ they've
never moved away from PHP so they're
still using PHP and they're using my
sequel and although they now use other
languages like C++ and they even make
use of Python in Erlang and a couple of
other ones but they still do have a PHP
based stack so something Zuckerberg day
while he was at Harvard and obviously it
worked out pretty well for him now what
I mentioned when you want to look at
what kind of languages are going to be
there for you in the future I really
feel like PHP is time and Sun has
already has already taken place so I
really feel like we're going to see PHP
Sun setting over the next decade or so
but you're still going to see it around
for quite some time and there's always
going to be a demand for PHP probably
within your lifetime I would imagine as
a software developer but that being said
there is still quite a bit of demand
like I said and if we look at something
like github which is the largest open
source or not open source but largest
online code repository for open source
projects that gives you a real good
gauge of what languages are hip and
which ones are cool because ultimately
wherever you know the hip and trendy
projects are languages are you're going
to have a lot of a lot of projects based
around that so github gives you a good
idea on what's going strong and when we
look at github you can actually see that
PHP is ranked ahead of Python as the
most widely used language on their stack
so a lot of PHP projects they actually
have out pat are outpaced actually a
kind of flat line but they are ahead of
Python in that regard so PHP has more
open source projects on github than
Python at the moment
one of the criticisms of PHP is that
it's a very ugly language to look at and
I actually happen to agree with that I
try not to bust on people's languages
and give them a hard time about it but
when I look at PHP code I don't I don't
like it it's a it looks like it almost
looks like Perl it tries to I got a lot
of influence from Perl so there's a
reason for that like I hate having to
use symbols to declare arrays in scalar
variables and whatever they want to call
them but it just looks terrible having
to use dollar signs and and pound signs
and stuff like that I've always hated
that about Perl so here's an example
from PHP site and this isn't even as bad
as what you can see but when you start
getting hundreds of lines and you have
this garbage all scattered throughout
your HTML file I mean this is just this
is not even that bad but it looks
terrible so if I like look at a file
possibly and you just get a lot of this
kind of stuff here which is like I said
this is actually the same thing I just
showed you but it's just not the
prettiest language in the world so when
you start getting hundreds or thousands
of lines of code scattered throughout
the pages it gets a little bit difficult
to look at and on the contrary if I were
going to look at something in Python I
could actually say with open and they
give a path to the file as F for Line
and F and that what that's going to do
it's going to read through the file line
by line and you can see Python has
indentation in fact it you can see it in
PHP as well but it's optional in PHP
Python actually requires that you
endanger code so if you're just getting
started coding Python is a good language
just because it forces you to do that so
it actually forces you to learn good
proper coding standards to make it much
easier for you and other people that
might come along later on and read your
code so Python being the most taught
introductory language part of that is
because it does teach you these these
coding standards that you can't ignore
in Python but you can ignore them in PHP
and many other languages now the biggest
criticism of PHP in the modern day world
now is that it's not object-oriented at
all so strictly speaking it's kind of a
procedural programming language with
some sort of
object oriented type constructs which
are not object wearing it at all when
you compare them over to something like
c-sharp or Java and if you ever wanted
to get into enterprise development in
the corporate world you're going to be
dealing with a lot of c-sharp and java
and and those are entirely object
oriented languages so the actual
transition from PHP over c-sharp is
going to be huge and the same thing can
somewhat be said of Python as well
python is not an entirely
object-oriented language but it can be
completely object-oriented but the
transition is not going to be as bad
trying to move over from Python over to
c-sharp or Java but it will still be
somewhat of a headache because there's a
lot of differences between the two
especially if you're free just getting
started
and when I say python not being
object-oriented it's not entirely
object-oriented where you do have the
option of actually writing your code in
an object-oriented way or you can use it
as a procedural based programming
language now Python is not an entirely
web-based language like I mentioned
before but I would be remiss if I didn't
mention some of the top sites that are
now running on a Python stack and
usually this is done through a web
framework which PHP has many frameworks
as well but when it comes to the Django
web framework it is a top of the line
framework instagram.com is written on
top of it reddit comm actually uses
Python but I believe it uses the pylons
web framework and then you have
Pinterest comm which is also on Django
and that's also a top top to your
website so there's plenty more there's
actually probably more examples I could
come up with with a you know some of the
largest websites in the world using a
Python stack compared to a PHP stack but
overall there are way more PHP websites
out there from mom-and-pop shops on down
that are using PHP / Python so I'm not
sure if that is something that you would
consider being a good factor or not just
because something has more web sites as
opposed to the larger ones I'm not sure
how you value that but that's something
to keep in mind
so really that's about where I'm going
to wrap up this video my advice would be
to not use PHP to probably try to go in
a different direction if you do go to
PHP direction you might end up you know
finding yourself having to build like
WordPress plugins and stuff like that
and you're going to be doing a lot of
freelance jobs and you're going to see
demand continue to dwindle for PHP
programmers as we move into the future
Python is going to get you a little bit
more more up-to-date on an
object-oriented type language if you
wanted to go completely enterprise
development I would probably say c-sharp
or Java would be a good thing to jump
into even now but I don't really think
that there's too many people out there
that would debate whether or not PHP is
better than Python I think a lot of
people would probably give a nod over to
Python but you know to each their own
and I'm not going to be the first one or
I'm not going to be one to say the PHP
is a terrible language there's going to
be a lot of people that will say that so
I'll leave that up to them I mean I've
done a little bit of PHP programming I
can't say that I hated it but it
definitely isn't for me and I am using
both PHP and Python oh we give Python
the nod for sure but thanks for asking
the question and thanks for anybody who
watched this video please subscribe
please vote up if you would I appreciate
it and have a good night bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
