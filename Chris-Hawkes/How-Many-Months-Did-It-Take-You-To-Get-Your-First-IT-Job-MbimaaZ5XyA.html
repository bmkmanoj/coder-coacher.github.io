answering a question and this from this
dude incredible eatable non egg that's
funny all right so three days ago sorry
I didn't get back to you until now he
says what program should you start with
so I'm assuming you're talking about
programming languages so I mean I've
actually answered this several times and
I mean there's really no right and wrong
answer to this but I can say that
academia and also I'm just my own
personal thoughts is that you should
start with python python is easy it's
going to teach you some of the proper
semantics so of actually styling your
code when it comes to indentation and
stuff like that and a lot of that is
important for being able to read it will
teach you probably some bad habits just
a little bit when it comes to variable
naming when you compare that to
something like Java or JavaScript or
even c sharp and then it's also not
fully object-oriented so you're still
going to get your mind blown when you go
over to Java or C sharp from Python but
that said on python is still a great
language I use C sharp at work and I
still use Python at home i love flask I
love Django and pythons fun to work with
so and I don't use it at all it works
today that says a lot I think because um
you know I don't use it not one bit in
the corporate world at least where I'm
at and I still managed to find a lot of
use for it at home because it's fun to
work with so how many hours a day were
you studying why I work full-time also
had kids and a wife and I still do so
that you know you have to spend time
with your family have to take breaks and
stuff like that and and I would say that
I was a little bit probably insane when
it comes to the amount of time that I
was spending on it because there were
days literally when I was first getting
started where I would go to bed if I
couldn't if I couldn't figure out a
problem that's still one of my biggest
downfalls now if I can't figure
something out i have a hard time just
you know walking away from it because
that's typically the best thing to do is
just walk away from it for a little
while come back to it but it feels like
you're walking away a failure so that's
the reason why it's always hard to walk
away but
it or at least to me that is but I would
go to sleep sometimes and I'd literally
dream about some problem I couldn't
solve and then sometimes I'd wake up and
I just I'd have it solved I know and
look at it from a different perspective
and I'd actually write it in a different
way and I get my you know my results
that I was looking for so how many days
was I studying probably you know i was
working 40 hours a week with it a pretty
decent commute and uh i mean i was
probably doing two hours a night guys i
mean honestly I was doing two hours a
night maybe even more on the weekends
like I mean I was but I was also trying
to build something to so it's not like I
was just simply like putting my nose in
a book and trying to memorize like
phrases and statements and expressions
and stuff like that i was literally
spending most of that time just coding
and probably writing some terrible code
in fact I was definitely writing some
terrible code which is the best way to
learn you write terrible code and
eventually write better code and
eventually you see from others like how
so much of the stuff that you've done
can be simplified and and how much some
and eventually you're going to look back
at your stuff and none of it even makes
sense because it's so bad and then but
ultimately you write bad code and you
write as much courage to possibly can
and I was probably doing at least two
hours a night how many how many months
to take you get your first job it not
months it took years so and this was
somebody who had so much devotion to
actually learn you know two hours a day
and then also you know pull my hair out
as far as I maintaining actual stacks
and the google app engine cloud I want
to say stacks that means websites that
you're managing like databases you know
front-end back-end and all that stuff
and so I was doing that for at least ugh
i think was is of 2011 to well no 2010
um so at least two years of actually
running website so literally I was I was
practicing for three years or so before
I even got my first job I should really
write this down because honestly I get
this question a lot and I always have to
go back to memory and it's like well I
started when I was 28 and I got my first
gig when I was like 31 so like I mean it
took three years I mean of studying a
lot and it says how many so were their
apprehensions about hiring
you because you didn't have a formal
education absolutely so now you know i
will say that i'm close to getting my
two-year degree in business
administration so i'll have an
associates of business administration
which is having me call that what you
want but i mean i'm actually proud of
and I'm finishing it simply because I've
started something and I want to finish
it it's a pain in the ass to go to
school I tell you that much because I
honestly have no desires like I'm going
to school and I'm not even going to make
any more money you know once I get the
degree but that's only because I have
you know the current you know where
you're employed now but if you're out
looking for jobs absolutely the degree
is going to be a big problem if you
don't have the degree they're looking
for experience so it's it's really
really difficult to get your foot in the
door so getting your foot in the door is
you know the degree is going to get you
there at least pursuing the degree to be
it like to at least be able to say look
I'm going to school and taken you in one
or two classes all I can do you know
it's going to be a lot easier so were
their apprehensions absolutely are there
even more operations now with the
economy the way it is yes definitely
because I mean you got companies are
catching a lot of slack because you know
they're bringing in h-1b visas to fill
jobs like in the United States I'm
speaking of they bring in h-1b visas to
fulfill jobs because they can pay them
you know less money then then typically
what an American worker is going to
demand also there's ways to basically
almost entrap the person that you're
bringing in because they're not allowed
to shop around and shop for the best
price for their services are pretty much
you know stuck to a particular company
that is choosing to to honor that h-1b
so so there's there's a lot of
competition out there for that and you
have a lot of like stem graduates in the
United States what's you which is like
electrical engineering programming I
mean they're not even working in the IT
industry so the point being is that
right now with the economy the way it is
and way the way it's been really since
the great recession of 2008 there's a
lot of competition in the IT world but
there's also a lot of demand for it too
but the problem is right now is I've
actually done a video just recently is
that we may be seeing that demand
starting a lesson a little bit
which means that salaries can go down
and you know hopefully you don't have a
bunch of people standing in line trying
to land that job but because ultimately
if you have a lot of employees that are
looking for jobs i mean salaries go down
so yeah unfortunately that is going to
be a major problem most major companies
especially if you're into like trying to
get in with the government like I to
contracting for like a government
consulting firm or something like that
they're absolutely going to hold it
against you that you don't have a degree
most of the time if you have at least
the amount of experience that you need
like two years plus you know like maybe
a two-year degree plus T or three years
of being in the industry or something
like that that probably equates to about
a bachelor's degree coming out of their
computer science school but if you're
just trying to get that first bit of
experience I mean it's going to be
difficult so you may want to just try to
network you know what I mean like you
want to network online whether it's you
know the YouTube channel like doing what
I'm doing right now not to say that like
this has really gotten me like I haven't
really been approached with anything
actually you know it's a different the
different subject but the point being is
that you do want to get your name out
there you want to try to show you know
what you're capable of and you can do
that through maintaining your own
websites and stuff like that you gain
experience maybe even starting your own
company and saying look you know I've
had my own company for three years
here's the websites this is my portfolio
you know I don't have the degree but I'm
obviously I'm more than capable of being
able to do the job at hand but just
simply saying hey yeah i studied on
youtube and i did some code Academy and
udemy courses and I mean I'm a
programmer I mean that's going to be
really difficult unfortunately and I
don't know that anybody really has the
right answer for you it's going to be
about you know finding the right
opportunity so being in the right place
at the right time I think has a lot to
do with it unfortunately for even for me
in my success story is that they did
have a lot to do with being in the right
place at the right time so I mean best
of luck to everybody who's out there
being faced with the similar situation
if you're good enough and
you're literally hacking away I mean
there's I'm sure some of you guys
watching this video are better than I am
at programming in ultimately you can
pave your own way if you're really that
good but if you're you know just as good
as you know some of the other guys that
are self-taught or you know even in the
industry itself like it's going to be
difficult i think but definitely not
impossible and maybe if somebody
honestly that is in the position of
hiring people because I am NOT in the
position of hiring people I've never had
that position but maybe if somebody else
could speak up on this video as well
like in the comments and just let me
know if you if you do hold that against
other people that you might be
interviewing a job for and how much of a
factor does that play into your hiring
because I'm curious to know as well but
I mean if you look online like indeed
calm and look at a lot of the jobs and
stuff like that I mean they from what
I've seen at least in the Washington DC
area they want a degree almost like
eighty percent of the time maybe more
but it is still one of the few
industries where you can be a scientist
without actually getting a doctorate you
know or even a bachelor's degree or
master's degree alright guys so that
that's really it I just want to answer
that question I get that question a lot
and i'm sure i'll continue to get that
question i'm going forward and I don't
mind honestly I don't but thanks for
watching have a good day bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
