from one of my viewers and he was asking
me whether or not he should get involved
in quantum computing and and I so
amazing a brand-new because he's asking
this question and for just a quick
background like I'm not involved in
physics or anything like that so like
quantum computing is definitely on a
level that I'm not I'm not on but I do
know enough about it to know that like
only a few major companies are involved
in quantum computing right now you're
looking at like Google IBM Microsoft and
a few other companies but the like
quantum computing is an actual
breakthrough I would say of twenty
twenty seventeen probably one of the
largest technological breakthroughs I
would say of trying to mainstream and
having you know these major companies
like IBM and everything come together
with different approaches for how they
plan on building a practical quantum
computer and in it just so you guys know
like that it's as far as like bits you
know zeros and ones when you're dealing
with with computers like normal
computers quantum computers man think
they have these things called qubits
which they can exist in simultaneous
states so it could be a zero it could be
one it can be both simultaneously that
actually makes quantum computers
ridiculously faster than even the best
computers that we have right now so I
mean you're looking probably roughly a
hundred million times faster than some
of the greatest new computers ever that
we have right now so but the thing with
that though is that the technology is
probably still at least ten years away
from being any sort of mainstream
adoption so like any sort of new
programmer that's getting involved in
programming right now like and unless
you're going to school for like physics
and like that like I don't know
that you would be involved and too much
of what's going on in the quantum
quantum computing world but I will tell
you that then when it becomes mainstream
it's going to change everything because
it's gonna be able to crack you know
algorithms like you know hashing out
and things that we use for cryptography
it's gonna be able to crack those things
so much faster and everything's gonna
have to be redone so you're gonna end up
having like an entire probably
technological revolution I would say
probably 10 20 years down the road and
for those new programmers like that
we're getting involved in that and kind
of re redoing everything that we we've
done in technology up to this date you
know to get on board like I said with
the security and everything that's gonna
create like a ton of Drive and I think
you know an opportunity for people that
are getting involved for somebody like
me who's 36 I you know I would be at the
end of my career most likely when that
is um you know like like I said a common
thing where I would actually have a
quantum computer in my room or even a a
cloud hosting thing and that's another
thing too is like with these quantum
computers like it's probably very it's
probably not practical like that we're
gonna ever have one in our house
probably in our lifetimes the the amount
of technology that's involved in like
and cooling these things and things down
to like this ridiculously low
temperature that doesn't create
resistance and things like that that
they do to make quantum computing work
it's just not practical I don't think
inside of our homes but then you know as
technology advances I could be wrong but
I just don't see it so I think that if
we're gonna end up using quantum
computers as like regular developers and
things from home it's going to be
obviously through some sort of
cloud-based system you know through some
sort of API that you know is that we're
communicating with across the wire that
you know is sitting in google's building
or something somewhere that's how I
think our interactions are going to be
with it I think a lot of companies just
like we use AWS or Google App Engine
things like that I think we're gonna be
obviously it's gonna be the same thing
in the cloud with with quantum computers
and once again all this all of our how
hashing wrap algorithms you know the
sha-2 and all this stuff or sha-256
which is now what you know what kid is
um well I think it probably should be
updating the sha-256 but that's just say
a hashing algorithm for cryptography and
the all that's gonna have to be redone
you know as this becomes mainstream so I
think that will be exciting but yeah
we're still way now if you did want to
get like
I think probably in a position to be
able to to hit the ground running when
it becomes mainstream you would probably
want to look at machine learning because
machine learning is just all about
repetition and just you know just
factoring things over and over again to
try to come up with with meaningful
results and that is going to be like a
huge field with quantum computing
because our machine learning I think to
date is still rather archaic compared to
what it's going to be in 10 or 20 years
obviously so the the way that we go
about you know setting up our programs
to to machine learn to learn from itself
that probably won't change
I don't think of tremendous amount it
just did the actual hardware that we're
running those calculations on is what
the change is going to be but again it
not gonna be anytime soon so anyway
thanks for watching thanks for the
question and have a good day guys bye
hey guys what's up so this video was
brought to you by the tech Academy so
make sure you guys check them out the
link is in the description tab below
from the courses list here they have
Computer Basics overall software
development github html5 CSS database
and there's a lot more courses and
they're adding courses all the time so
make sure you guys give them a look once
again the link is in the description tab
below thanks guys have a good day bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
