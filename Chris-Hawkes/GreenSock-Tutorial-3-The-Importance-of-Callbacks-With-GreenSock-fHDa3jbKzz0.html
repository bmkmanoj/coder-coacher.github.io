series for green sock the JavaScript
animation library for hipster code comm
and in the last video we looked at how
we can pass in all kinds of different
key value pairs as a JavaScript object
and that green sock is able to interpret
that to change things like the rotation
or the X or Y axis or the height and the
width and we looked at the Alpha now one
of the things that you commonly run into
with JavaScript since it's a a
synchronous language where literally
it's firing one function after the next
without waiting for a function to finish
unless you explicitly state that it
should do something when the function
finishes that's known in JavaScript as
callback like it so you a callback is a
function that gets passed in because
JavaScript is a functional language that
says here execute this function whenever
you're done with whatever you're doing
so with the green sock library it's
important that when an animation
completes we probably want to conduct a
new animation or we might want to you
know resolve the animation to the state
that it was in before we actually ran
the animation so if you're flipping an
image upside down maybe you want to
change it back to its normal position or
you want to execute another animation on
top of that but you also obviously don't
want multiple animations running at the
same time so in order to solve that
issue the green sock library has a non
complete key value which will then
execute some sort of code once the the
you know the animation is complete so
let's go ahead and put a comma here and
it's just an argument so just like the
rotation and everything else this is
going to be called on complete and then
what we can do here is we just pass in a
function we could literally say function
in fact you don't even have to say it's
a function you could just simply say
alert hello Green sock
and we do want this to actually be an
anonymous function that we're just gonna
simply say
so now if we pull up our page and we
refresh you can see that once the
animation is done this function that we
passed in this callback function is now
being executed in many cases you're not
going to actually write your function
code here this should just be like a
reference to a function that exists so
this should say this should now you know
what let's just say complete function
and then we want to make sure that it's
defined before we try to reference it so
we could say complete really we can save
our complete function equals function
make sure we get rid of that curly brace
that did not need to be there so what
we're saying is just execute this and
you can see that complete function is a
function because we've defined it as a
function and if we rerun the code you
can see that it's just the same way it's
just a cleaner approach the separation
of concerns that you're not actually
defining the function inside of a key
value pair he was just referencing to an
already defined area because this could
even exist in a different page and
ultimately this function could also call
something very similar so we could even
let's just copy this entire so instead
of alerting the hello green sock we're
gonna go ahead and move this image and
we're gonna then change this and we'll
rotate it 180 degrees again and then
let's change it back to like its
original I don't remember what its
height and width was that he was 300 by
200 possibly I don't remember oh it's
right there actually that's the 300 by
200 and then we'll change this back to 0
and 0 so and then this time we're not
going to do a callback function because
otherwise it would just immediately keep
calling itself over and over again so
and I also want to wrap this in the
document dot ready so that way this code
is not trying to fire before the page is
loaded so we could just have it all that
exists inside the scope of this this
function block here and also since the
image flips upside-down if I rotate it
180 degrees it would also flip upside
down again so let's rotate it 90 degrees
so that way it will sit back upright so
now if I run this the first function is
called then it rotates back
yeah that's not right so instead of 90
degrees let's just rotate this Joker 360
degrees so now when we run it the first
animation then it flips back and goes
back to its normal size so by using
these callback functions it's it could
be a completely like interchangeable
thing or it can be completely repetitive
over and over again and you're not going
to like eat up memory inside your your
browser but you can do really cool stuff
so like if we said start function and we
and we made this just the same way we
made it a function and then we're gonna
do our tween Lite thing and we're gonna
like that so now we have two functions
and now we need to execute the function
on start so we're gonna say start
function so we're going to call this
function so all this code executes then
when it executes the first time it's
going to call or when it completes it's
going to call complete function and now
let's go ahead and add this argument to
this function as well and we'll say
start function so we'll say on complete
and then we'll say start function so now
this is going to be a complete loop so
it'll go over and over and over again so
if we run it flip upside-down like that
and you can see it just continues to run
over and over and over again so if you
wanted to do a loop I mean that's that's
essentially how you would do it and
that's why these callback functions
are extremely important that you wait
for something to complete and then do it
over and over again alright guys thanks
