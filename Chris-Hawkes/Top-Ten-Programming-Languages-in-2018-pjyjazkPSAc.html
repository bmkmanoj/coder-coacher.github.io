2018 so I want to talk about the most
popular languages and I've been doing
these videos for quite some time I've
gotten millions of views on them
actually and what I've done in this list
is I've actually taken the last few
videos that I've done on this so for the
last two years and I looked at all the
comments and we're talking literally a
million 1/2 views or so and well over
like 2,000 comments or so so I've been
babe I went through that I basically
comprised a list of what the most
popular languages are based on that
trial sample so I feel like it's a you
know it's a much better list but there's
definitely some no there's nothing some
hype and hip sternness to it so let's
just go ahead and jump into this list
you guys can see what I'm talking about
and once again this is based on that the
the feedback that I got from all those
views and comments so you don't once
again a lot of a lot of views there all
right number 10 is Elm this new purely
functional language created by Harvard
PhD student and a lot of hipsters love
Elms so it's still in its infancy and
everything but it's gonna get more and
more pop alright number nine is a lick
sir which is built off of Erlang's
virtual machine this is also getting a
lot of traction there's the Phoenix
framework that is using a lick sir so a
lot of people are talking about this
definitely a hipster language in 2018
number eight is go now this was in my
list that I did last this I had number
one definitely not a number one language
probably not I feel like it's one of the
best months to learn in 2018 because it
is growing but there's still not a
tremendous amount of jobs and everything
available this is mostly used by Google
and a lot of system admins and things
like that but it is gaining a lot of
traction and still makes the list at
number eight number seven is Java this
is probably the more Boehringer language
on the list but it's still the most
widely used in the corporate world and
definitely deserves to be mentioned in
top 10s and number seven is Java number
six is Swift so if you're gonna get into
Apple development which obviously a lot
of people are and they're interested in
and the Swift is gonna be your go-to
it's a lot easier than objective-c and
it's continuing to gain traction in
twenty eight
number five is rust this is a systems
level languages written by Mozilla it's
built with concurrency in mind it's a
great programming language a lot of hype
behind rust and a very strong community
still relatively I would say smaller
community than something like go but it
is definitely grown quite a bit and it's
certainly hyped up in 2018
number four is c-sharp so with a c-sharp
is still on this list there's a lot of
passionate Microsoft c-sharp developers
out there that are still promoting their
at their favorite language and with
c-sharp it's obvious that you can we can
do a lot with it from mobile development
games whatever but it's definitely it's
got a big following just because of the
amount of the Microsoft backing behind
it
number three is JavaScript so obviously
we know a lot of hipsters love
JavaScript everything is seems like is
JavaScript these days like there's
always some new framework replacement
and the last one with like one new
feature and everything we have to kind
of relearn everything just because
that's what we like to do but javascript
is certainly popular and a lot of
hipsters love it number two is Python
this is still a hugely popular language
it's been around for a long time since
1990 and definitely got made popular or
really popular by Google and Google is
now promoting go some curious work
Python is gonna be like 10 years from
now but for right now that Python is
still a very very popular language and
its user base like promotes Python like
I've never seen before except for number
one on this list which makes the list at
number one and it's just simply because
of the overwhelming amount of comments
and things like that that people were
like why not this one yeah people are
freaking out over this number one
language and that is Colin so Colin is a
statically typed programming language
that runs on the Java Virtual Machine
and it's used for Android development
Android still the number one mobile
operating system and if you're going to
write Android applications it's just so
much more pleasant to do it in Kotlin
versus standard Java using the Android
okay so anyway guys that's my top ten
list once again it's a little bit more I
think scientific just based on the
feedback it's definitely like hipster
focused like is not everybody and you're
not going to have a bunch of old
programmers who've been doing this for
15 years that are gonna be bothering to
comment on top 10 videos and trying to
promote their languages they just don't
give a anymore but the people that
do the young people that are just
getting in like this is a pretty good
representation of what the young people
think the top 10 languages should be in
2018 so let me know what you guys think
if you guys disagree make sure you guys
are putting your suggestions in the
comments below because I start I want to
start comprising those or compiling
those and and then trying to you can
present that data back to you guys so I
would appreciate if you do that alright
guys thanks for watching have a good day
bye so this video was brought to you by
a dead mountain coding boot camp they're
a boot camp that is based out of Utah
but they're also in Texas in Arizona now
and they have very good reviews so make
sure you guys check them out the link is
in the description tab below they offer
courses in web development iOS
development UX or user experience design
Quality Assurance and just a few other
ones in fact they're even getting into
Salesforce as well now so they're
continuing to adapt their courses based
on what the market needs are and major
companies are hiring some of their
