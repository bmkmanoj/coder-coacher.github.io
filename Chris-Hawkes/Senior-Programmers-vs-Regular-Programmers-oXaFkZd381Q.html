and talk about some programming stuff
like what have I been working on I've
been very busy I've been very busy with
the new job doing a lot of react es6 all
of modern day tools babel web pack and
in the process i think that react is is
a pretty good technology set but I do
understand people's attraction to
something like view when I was having
lunch day I talked to several other
developers and ask them their opinion on
view a few of you guys have asked me my
opinion on view and in my opinion is I
barely touched it but the moments that I
have spent time with it I'm basically
like well it doesn't really do anything
any better than like react or angular in
fact it does a lot less it's really
trying to be to the view which is what
reacts started out as being in my
opinion and and then react has now kind
of merged into this whole you know
ecosystem when you combine it with other
tools like redux or react to router
reacts router Rito so basically the
whole front end system that that react
is now capable of and now react has this
new react fibre thing that's making
their engine a lot faster and one of the
things that should be mentioned on what
reacted with react fibre which is much
better than what we've seen with a
angular 2 or Python 3 and they didn't
make everything all back backwards and
compatibly like there used to be with
Perl programmers Perl used to pride
itself on being a language that like
always considered backwards
compatibility when updating new versions
and it seems like you know with angular
2 like that completely went by the
wayside it's like we're going to
completely rewrite this thing up and
learn typescript
everything you thought you knew about
angular is going to be completely
rethought redone and people got pissed
off about that because they devote a lot
of time the older you get the less time
you want to spend screwing around
learning the same same old wheel just
you know once again but every time you
reinvent that wheel it just starts to
turn into like a square stone block like
we're going back into the stone Age's
we're just kind of you know bumps up and
down the road you know as a picture a
square fold or trying to you know to
drive like
sunstones let's kind of want to think of
it so that's funny because we know we do
come up with old solutions to solve
modern problems for some of these
problems I've been solving them decades
ago and everything but you know that's
that's fine that's perfectly fine we all
have jobs we have you know we're able to
make money and build stuff with
technology so that's cool but the funny
thing is I think is that basically is
that most people don't realize when
you're when you're just getting started
with programming like you don't want to
have to relearn the same thing time and
time again man because you're not really
you're not really getting anywhere like
you want to be getting I think to be a
better programmer and sometimes when
you're kind of learning oh yeah I did
that with this language in this language
and now we have this new hot language
and we're going to do the same damn
thing but we have to learn these new
terminologies these new rules and things
part of being a programmer really is but
it's oh it's not that big of a deal
especially if you get paid over a
hundred thousand dollars to do it but
you can even understand that when like
when you only have a certain amount of
time you know time is something that no
matter how much money you have or how
much you get paid you can't get more of
it so if you're spending more time
learning something that isn't really
making you a better or more productive
programmer you know and you know that
like you just know that based on
experience and ten things like that that
you know it's me that can be frustrating
I think sometimes so it's so well so
what is my opinion on view I mean I
think view looks a lot like like
knockout man I think that it sticks to
being the view it's supposed to like do
some of the things that react as well
even better and that's great I think
something like view that was going to be
popular just because we need something
easier for a lot of web developers like
a lot of web developers a long time ago
used to be able to just jump right in
with HTML you know they kind of relied
upon a lot of the backend programmers I
got paid more money to do a lot of
things but the front end guys were able
to use like jQuery HTML do some CSS and
and then like there was this kind of
this shift that happened pretty much
after the responsive web design craze of
about 2012 2013 where we went into this
like full stack front-end system and
that really I think starts with node
being released in what 2009 so node
allows you to write JavaScript on the
back end but also on the front end so
you know people that were able to get
crafty with something like a node.js
back-end they also were very crafty with
a lot of what they could do on the front
end using JavaScript and it just seems
like we took you know front-end
development it made it much more
difficult not a positive for people like
me and other people that do this stuff
is that you get paid a lot of money to
write react and write angular if you can
keep up with typescript and all this
other stuff you get paid a lot of money
and I know for a fact that older
developers are just as good as some of
the newer developers now maybe with you
know the fresh mindset and things like
that that it's easier being younger
having less you know less
responsibilities probably helps and
things like that but the fact is though
that older programmers in many cases are
going to be better than you younger
programmers it's just because they have
a lot of experience they've been
practicing and logic day in and day out
now if they're a bad programmer when
they were 20 and they're still bad at 35
because I've never had a passion for
programming they just kind of do a day
to day then that doesn't really count
that's not really who I'm referring to
I'm talking about some of the passionate
developers I've worked with that are in
their 40s even in their 50s that they
really know their stuff I mean if if you
went up to Guido van Rossum and Relais
hey do you don't know anything about
modern-day Python it would probably be
pretty insulting to somebody who
actually created Python but he may not
be in like the inner workings day-in and
day-out of the new Python language he
might be I don't know I don't follow it
that well but it's just like no no
company no younger developer is going to
like you know piss on Guido van Rossum
for not being up to date with the latest
standards of view or angular to using
typescript or something like that so I
think people need to I guess temper
their expectations of what they think
other programmers should be doing or
where they should be at and that's
another reason to why it's very
difficult in this industry to have a
senior developer and a junior developer
and then have this mindset where well
maybe the senior is doing the same thing
as the two junior has been doing you
know
well maybe not even Junior let's just
say a typical software engineer versus a
senior software engineer if the senior
software engineer is using a fresh
product it's only been out for a year
and the then that means that the regular
software engineer is going to have just
as much experience if not more with that
newer stuff then you know the older guy
but if they want to transition to more
of a you know a sequel server back in
like where they need to start writing
like maybe raw sequel or they start
getting out of es6 and start having the
right you know JavaScript or even
getting into Python or Django or some of
these other more you know more some more
specialties there are things there that
you learn along the way that make you a
better developer so that is one of the
reasons why you have senior developers
there's also the team leadership aspect
of things there's you know not being a
dick really I mean it's a trait to be
learned I mean there are programmers out
there that are that are just huge dicks
they really are they because it's a very
egotistical field you look at some of
the better developers they have no
patience for the juniors and things like
that they don't understand that they
were once you know in that position and
and it's I guess so you know wanted some
of the reasons why you could be a senior
developer and maybe be on par with some
software developers and a little lower
here but still get paid more because of
those reasons it's all around experience
it could be business experience it could
be once again it could be how you mentor
people the fact you're not a dick the
fact that you're helpful and things like
that so that's a lot of things that you
have to take into consideration when
you're getting into the industry like
you may run alone and I did this as well
when I was first getting in I was
working with some developers at Geico
and I was like thinking wow like I'm
surprised they don't know some of this
basic JavaScript or jQuery or or some of
the you know some of the advanced CSS
stuff that I was doing at the time and I
remember I was surprised by that but
then I wasn't taking into consideration
the fact you know they had eight or ten
years experience and these are things
like you know cobalt in and then also
writing like c-sharp and doing web forms
and even MVC net or just c-sharp in
general so I guess what I could say is
that
to caution yourself on like how you try
to stack up against other other
developers that are out there because
I've been guilty of doing the same thing
right look at like I said other
developers numbers Leia I think I'm just
as good but and you might be you might
be but there's a reason why I mean they
were higher maybe they're just a better
negotiator and they got a better salary
and a better title because you know they
were a better negotiator it can come
down to that it can come down to
sometimes you know the time that you get
brought in like you know sometimes
you're at the right place at the right
time you talk to the right people maybe
there's just there's a lot of different
things that separate I think regular
software developers from senior
developers and there's also a lot of
similarities too so I'll just keep that
in mind that would be my my basic advice
for this video so I mean what we should
be doing is we should be trying to
figure out how to make technologies a
little bit easier a little bit more
productive and I'm not quite sure that
we're there you know like I said before
I think that you know tools like react
and things like that you know reusable
components even web components with
shadow DOM if you're looking at polymer
or something like that I am curious if
those things are going to end up
manifesting themselves into something
that is like widespread right now though
I really feel like we're in somewhat of
a waiting period as far as like what the
next next technology boom is going to be
I don't actually see anything on the
horizon right now like I've been I've
been around for the dot-com bubble I've
been around for the mobile app bubble
when you know there was a mobile app
time where like everybody was trying to
get into mobile development there was a
time where we were all focusing on
responsive web design like we were
creating these new standards and then
like bootstrap came along and pretty
much simplified all of that and then
really when that happened to me it feels
it felt like there was a lot of like UI
UX designers that ended up losing out on
a lot of work because it was like well
why am I going to buy some template that
is all like you know overly complicated
when I can just kind
learn the bootstrap way of doing things
if I lay things out in the bootstrap way
like I can build a usable websites that
are that I work on you know all
different different types of devices so
in my opinion maybe just my own personal
interest changed over the time but there
was a time I used to be interested in
reading things like smashing magazine
trying to focus on the latest UX
standards and whatever happened along
the way I guess I became like more of a
back-end developer now more of a
front-end engineer I would say but I
lost interest in all of that stuff and
even though I still you know I keep it
open a year to that those types of
things and I see what the trends are and
I see you know some of the websites out
there and it's just like I I'm just kind
of waiting for like I think the next you
know a big thing to come along and I
hope to you know jump into that but you
know what is that next thing is their
view is it reactive in any of it
those things are already here so really
you should be focusing on whatever the
jobs are you know there's more angular
positions
you should probably focus on that if you
don't have a job you know so it's like I
would I would think that it's sound
advice or you know they could talked
about before you got to build stuff you
got to make things and and that's how
you can really separate yourself as well
from you know other other developers and
prove that you're a senior so you know
if you have tools open-source projects
whatever maybe if you're like me though
now you don't even have enough time to
get involved in some of that stuff so
it's like you can't hold that against
the developer either a fidelity if the
developer can get his job done and go
home after eight or nine hours or
whatever and and then and and he's not
coding on the side and that that should
be perfectly acceptable as well so I
don't know man this is the interesting
industry to be in as long as you're
learning you feel like you're learning
each day hopefully you're learning while
getting paid because that's the best way
to learn in my opinion but as far as I
try to become a senior developer just so
you know keep at it make sure you take
in a lot of considerations there the
experience that that person has whether
it's maybe an unrelated thing not just
necessarily the code or language or
framework that you're working with right
then and there
alright guys thanks for watching make
