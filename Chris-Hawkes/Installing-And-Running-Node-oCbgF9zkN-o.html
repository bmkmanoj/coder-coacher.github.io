tutorial series for beginning nodejs and
I'm using a Windows machine for this
tutorial series you can use Windows Mac
or Linux it doesn't matter I'm also
using the atom editor 80 om it's free to
download and install is just a basic
text editor so it's not going to get in
your way and I'm gonna put all the
project files inside of a beginning node
folder which is in my projects directory
so I have my hipster code and we have
the beginning node folder inside
projects hipster code beginning node all
right so what we need to do is we need
to navigate to that location and our
command prompt so just go to your
command line if you're using Windows or
whatever it is so here's my command
prompt I'll go into the project's
directory
all right now the first thing we need to
do in order for nodejs to work is you
actually have to install nodejs onto
your machine and if you just type nodejs
into your google search then the first
location that you're gonna see is for
nodejs so you just need to go ahead and
do the windows installer if you're using
windows or use the mac installer if
you're using mac but ultimately it's
gonna install to your machine and then
once everything is successful you should
be able to type in the keyword node and
that should you know pull up the node
command prompt you should also be able
to type in NPM which is a package
manager which just basically helps you
install things that you're gonna need
for your node.js project so when you
type in NPM you should also see that the
computer is thinking so that means that
Windows knows that NPM means it knows
what it means because if it wasn't
installed correctly it would say that it
doesn't know what it means and it means
that your installation didn't go through
correctly so assuming everything is good
what we need to do is we need to make a
config file which our nodejs application
is going to use in order to verify what
projects are being used by your
application and this makes it very
beneficial because if you move your
application from one computer to another
this config file is actually going to
state everything that that application
needs to install on the machine and
using NPM you can actually install all
those dependencies so it's it's really
just a management thing but we're gonna
say NPM I knit and this is going to
create the config file and I'm talking
about the config file is it uses a
format that's called Jason which stands
for JavaScript object notation and it's
very similar to something like XML but
all it is is a language that's used in
JavaScript to transmit data and and
really it's a key value pair so if
you've ever used a dictionary and other
programming languages or even in if
you've used a JavaScript object that's
all it is just key value pairs so here's
this first so a by default it's going to
use the name of the application as the
name of the folder that this is being
run from so we'll just keep keep that
the same
you know that because the space it's not
actually it's not URL friendly so we'll
just call it will put an underscore
there where the spaces that way it's
friendly
and you can put the optional description
in there if you want and entry point
index ijs that'll work and we don't need
to do all this other stuff so just go
ahead and say yes all right so now if we
do add or you can see that they've
created a package that JSON file so
that's the config file that I was
telling you that you can just transfer
to another location and it will just
work all right so now the next thing we
want to do is we want to install the
Express j/s framework which is built on
top of node and it makes things a lot
easier to deal with in order to get an
application up and running so let's say
npm install and we'll say Express and
then we want to do - - save and the save
by doing that it's actually going to
make sure that it gets added to the the
package config file so that way and when
you transfer this application it will be
in the config and install as a
dependency okay so now that nodejs is
installed or I'm sorry expressed on the
left hand side I'm using the atom editor
and on the left hand side you can see
all the files that are now inside this
beginning node project and you can see
the package JSON file so if I double
click on that it'll open it up because
we've said - - save you can see that the
dependencies are listed here expressed
got added to it if we didn't do that - -
save when we installed Express then this
would not show up in the config and then
when you go to transfer this project
somewhere Express isn't gonna know you
know which version you had installed and
all that stuff so you can see with
Express that there's four point thirteen
point four there's a lot of different
releases for it so maintaining you know
specifically watch what which Express
release you use is really important when
you go to try to move your project
around alright so in the beginning node
folder let's go ahead and create our
first file we're gonna call app dot J s
and then in here we're going to create a
variable here which we'll call Express
and then note has this ability to be
able to require and it uses module
loading in order for
to work so it's really convenient to try
to build modular JavaScript apps by
being able to do that let's go ahead and
create our app variable and then we're
going to assign it the Express object
that we just created and then we'll say
app dot git so this is actually how we
do all of our URLs if you've ever done
any sort of Model View controller we're
gonna say forward slash and that simply
means your root directory so like if I
was doing hipster code calm this forward
slash signifies hipster code calm if I
said example then this means hipster
code calm forward slash example so
hopefully that makes sense but they're
just a simple plain forward slash means
root directory now to this this git is
just a JavaScript function we've seen
this if you've ever checked out my
beginning JavaScript course but this is
a example of a function that is actually
taking in two parameters so the first
parameter is the URL path the second
parameter is a function itself and
because JavaScript is a functional
language you can pass functions around
like it's a string or an integer or
anything like that so inside this
function here this is what we're
actually going to say resource and we're
going to be using the resource object
that gets passed in and we'll say
resource dot send hello hipster code
all right now that we have this root
directory and it's going to return this
basic text message we need to tell the
server nodejs to listen and tell it what
port to listen on so we'll say app dot
listen and then the first argument is
the number that we pass in which is the
port number to listen to and then the
second one is another function so
there's gonna be the second argument
here and we'll say console dot log we
are listening on port 3,000 so that's
simply it so let's go ahead and run the
app and we do that by going to the
command line where this app dot J's file
now sits since we created it and we just
say node app J s and now you can see
that it listens now if you're on Windows
you're probably gonna need to allow
access because it's opening up a port to
listen and it's a localhost address so
if we go to Chrome we should do 1 2 7 so
127.0.0.1 then you into a colon and tell
it which port to listen to and remember
we said port 3000 so if we go here we're
gonna get the simple plain hello hipster
code text that gets returned to us also
one thing to note so when you want to
kill there can the server just press
ctrl hold it down and see and that will
exit out and I want to show you too that
we sent back plain text here but you can
also send back an entire HTML page like
I mean I could send the all the HTML or
I could just do h1 which is a header and
you can even put in CSS in here so style
color red this is called an inline CSS
but the point is that you can send that
back CSS in HTML now I have an error
there one second
oh it's because of this thing right here
so I needed to escape the string or use
a single quote alright so now we're
listening on port 3000 and you can see
it turns it red because we did some
inline style we inspect the element and
you can see that it's h1 being returned
now by default chrome will include the
HTML and head and on stuff that doesn't
exist so that's why it actually works
that way but you can actually send back
the entire HTML head and all that other
stuff and that's really all that you
need to do so you can use a template
engine and nodejs and Express which
we'll get into in later videos or you
can just simply return raw HTML there's
nothing stopping you from doing either
one all right in most cases you're never
gonna want to send back inline styling
like that like that's that's just
terrible we'll keep the the h1 here for
right now but what you can do and
Express because it makes it so much
easier we can just say app dot use
Express dot static and then here we'll
say just public by default
so another argument we want to do to the
app dot use is we want to actually give
it the URL that we're gonna use as our
static location so when we reference
static in our URL then it's gonna look
for this public directory which doesn't
exist so let's go ahead and create the
new folder for public and then inside
public let's go ahead and create a new
we're gonna create a new folder in
public and we'll call this CSS so now in
CSS we're gonna add a new file which is
just gonna be our main dot CSS file so
that way we have an external stylesheet
and let's just do the simple h1 color in
here so we'll say h1 color red so this
is just CSS language and then the app
j/s let's go ahead and just run this
real quick so we can see an example
all right so now if we go to forward
slash static you can see cannot get
static but there's no matching so if I
went CSS main dot CSS you can see that
it the because we're using static shoot
sorry about that I'm so because we're
using the static it's now resolving and
it says hey we can find that because
when we said hey looking the static by
saying static it's it's looking in the
public directory that we just created
and then it finds the CSS directory
within the public directory and then it
finds main dot CSS within that directory
if it found something else you would see
the standard cannot get it if there was
no filename found so that's why that
works it's very beneficial that express
j/s allows us just to simply specify our
public directory and then we can put our
CSS and everything else in there so how
do we reference it well let's get into
that in just a moment we need to look at
how to actually return an HTML template
and Express yet so it's unrealistic to
actually return HTML as just a response
end and the better thing to do is use a
template engine which makes things a lot
easier to deal with so express nowadays
its default template engine that it
wants you to use is called pogue like
the dog poke so what we need to do is go
to our command line and we're gonna run
the npm install and then - - well
actually poke is the name of the project
and - - save again so that way it will
add it to our configured configuration
file but pug is gonna make it a little
bit easier for us to actually return
some some simple template files in order
to suppress not have to write all that
HTML from scratch now the funny thing is
a pug just recently changed its name but
it was formerly known as Jade and Jade
was relatively popular name so I'm not
sure why they changed it that would be
probably a topic for a different video
but the former Jade template engine is
now called pug as of the time of this
video and it might be called Australian
Cattle Dog or something else later on
but
right now it's called poke so in order
to use the bug application we need to go
ahead and make reference to it in our
app file here so let's go ahead and set
the view engine make sure it's after the
app has been declared and we'll say app
set and then we say view engine that's
the first argument and then we give it
the name of the view engine that we're
going to be using next we need to create
a views and directory in our root
directory so it's going to be a new
folder called views and inside views
we're gonna create our our index dot hug
file which is really a silly name so
index dot poke okay and then inside here
let's just go ahead and we'll just you
know what we'll go off of the basic
example so it's go ahead and copy all
this in suppose the HTML head title
equals title and body h1 equals message
make sure you save the file and now in
our get we need to go ahead and update
this because we're gonna say instead of
resource Sen we're going to say resource
dot render and it's gonna use the actual
template engine and now we're gonna say
index so that'll tell it which view to
look for the next argument is we're
actually going to return a JavaScript
object with key value pairs that
correspond to the values here title and
message so if I go over here and I say
title first we'll call this hipster code
and then the second one is gonna be
called message this is a temp message
all right so just two values are being
returned to this index let's go ahead
and restart the server
and you can see this is a temp message
and if you look up at the top in this
it's kind of small kind of hard to see
but you can see hipster cocom is being
returned in the title so it's using the
Jade the Jade documentation and let me
give you guys the website for further
reference on that the good news is
though is that we don't have to use a
Jade template engine the Jade is a
relatively ugly bastard in my opinion
some people like it I personally hate it
I haven't been able to really grasp onto
it yet but you know it is what it is
with all the documentation as far as how
to use it as here but that would be a
separate tutorial series that I would
end up conducting on the new Jade
language alright guys so if you have any
further questions or anything feel free
to leave a comment but that's how you
get nodejs up and running and please
subscribe please check out hipster cocom
for more tutorials and thanks for
watching guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
