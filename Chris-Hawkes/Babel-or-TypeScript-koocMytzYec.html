and uncut on my cell phone so if there's
any edits or murder well there's not
gonna be any edits so if there's any
mistakes that's just the way it's gonna
be
one of the things I wanted to talk about
is uh this whole babel versus typescript
thing so number one I had actually said
in one of my topless
program what languages to learn
basically in 2017 that the typescript
would be an emerging language which the
reason why I thought that was because
typescript offers obviously type safety
so it's it's a lot easier for people
that are more familiar with the
object-oriented concepts like Java or C
sharp to be able to transition over to
two types for it and um and the fact
that that angular you know Google's pet
project basically decided that they were
gonna use typescript for its advantages
they had said basically I figured that
that it would be a pretty good language
to learn now the problem that I see is
that when you look at something like
babel which is really the alternative so
if you're not gonna use typescript to
compile your large javascript projects
then you're gonna end up using something
like babel and the thing with babel is
because it's more open source oriented
than I would say Microsoft typescript is
they they push things so much faster but
if you look at the core concept of what
babel is like it's using all these
different plugins that are just for
little things like somebody made a
plugin for the promise yeah so basically
because promises aren't supported in the
browser's you know they make this small
project included in there they're there
Babel config or Babel puts it in their
config and they use it so anytime you
use NPM you're downloading literally
like sometimes 10 15 20 different
modules for something that you think is
just one module and there's nothing
wrong with that but my point is is that
uh you know the babel is the alternative
essentially CoffeeScript was like the
first one that said hey let's build this
new language that compiles down to raw
JavaScript to make JavaScript a little
bit more saner to deal with and then you
know that that set off the whole thing
typescript was really I think created
after that and then now you know we see
Babel as being like the number one
option and I had said and in that video
I was like well maybe you know
typescript is gonna be this immersion
language to learn and and here's the
thing guys I don't even know types for
that I've never written in the you
know so I don't really know if it's good
or not
I know Anders Helzberg who actually
designed the language did a pretty
phenomenal job with c-sharp and I
imagine that they did a pretty good job
there but the reason why I'm feeling
today like I just really for myself
don't see it being a good long-term plan
for me is because at Babel what is it
doing it's allowing you to write your
JavaScript code using Beckmann script
6.0 and even some 7.0 features and
they're even talking about adding 8.0
already so you know these things that
they're talking about doing in the
JavaScript specification years down the
road are already being supported and
babel so you can write them and stay up
to date on these new standards and then
it gets compiled down to JavaScript that
works on some of the older browsers the
difference with with typescript though
is that you still are doing things a
Microsoft typescript way and then you
still have to run it through a what is a
preprocessor or whatever the hell those
things are called and it's turning your
typescript code into JavaScript that
works so typescript is is typically a
few steps behind Babel and it probably
always will be and then on top of that
you have the fact that in Babel you're
actually writing what is considered to
be relevant javascript or at least that
will be the standard javascript a couple
years down the road when it's more
supported in all the browsers
whereas typescript never will be so if
you're a typescript developer you're
really banking on the fact that
typescript is gonna be around for the
long term and if you're a Microsoft guy
you know that you've been burned on
things like Silverlight and I would even
argue with some of the things like WPF
and stuff which I mean it's still
unclear whether or not they're gonna
continue to support WPF so you know it
could just be one more Microsoft
technology you end up getting burned on
and for that reason
that's really the main reason I think
that Babel is just a better alternative
I mean if you're gonna you might as well
write the and and something that is
gonna be supported later on and that way
the syntax isn't gonna be this big you
know hiccup for you now another person's
gonna argue that typescript is gonna be
a better choice for a larger project
because you have that type safety and
that's much more sane for people that
are that are viewing complex code that
they can see you know what a method or
function is returning I mean they could
see what type of parameters are being
passed them because if you add a
parameter X and another one y I mean you
don't know if X is a string or if it's
an enter or something else you know so
that type of type safety is the main
reason why typescript is important and
and people people say it is anyway but
you know JavaScript developers they
they're kind of used to doing this you
know this being able to just you know
infer what that is doing just based on
your looking at the the the the function
block you know the the block statement
everything but I don't know man the
whole JavaScript community is a complete
complete radical mess I think honestly
you know you have this new everybody is
coming out with their new pet project
every single weekend and yeah I don't
know how you can possibly keep up I mean
somebody decides to build something one
day you know when they're bored on a
weekend and then next thing you know
it's included in the Babel project and
and you know I it's just it's very very
difficult I think that you just stay
up-to-date and JavaScript it's really a
pain in the ass sometimes you know even
things like classes right there's no
classes in JavaScript it's just another
way of putting like a nice little
wrapper around the prototypical
inheritance and making a little bit
clearer for people to look at but then
you know from somebody like my you know
from my perspective I'm looking at I'm
like well I've been writing JavaScript
for quite a few years and that is
like very foreign to me I don't I now
have to become acclimated to it which I
mean it'll take a little bit but I I'll
get it I'm sure and
yeah man that's my thoughts man I really
think that that my recommendations are
the release got wrapped up around me I
think my recommendation of going with
typescript is probably misguided and you
know what I'm just talking man I got a
talk right you know so I'm gonna say
 on my channel that isn't relevant
or maybe inaccurate hell I might say
stuff that I don't even believe but you
know that that is my thoughts man I
would just I would probably stick with
Babel just for the simple fact that
you're not gonna have to be learning a
new syntax you're learning you know the
JavaScript way all right guys let me
know what you think man thanks for
watching thanks for all the support on
this channel and you guys have a good
day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
