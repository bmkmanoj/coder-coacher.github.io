to talk about the short shelf life of
certain technologies that we deal with
in the IT world and programming
specifically and whenever I see like a
language or something that is
immediately adopted I usually am a
little skeptical of that because I want
to make sure that my time and everything
that I'm investing in this somebody
technology is going to pay off and I
really expect to be able to use it
professionally at least for a couple
years for it to be worthwhile so in this
video specifically what I'll mention is
CoffeeScript so CoffeeScript it's
technically its own programming language
that that transpile is JavaScript too
but basically it's a language that trans
piles to JavaScript so very similar to
if you are more familiar with the modern
tools like what babel is knowing so if
you're using babel to compile your es6
javascript the latest greatest version
of javascript and using it to port it
over to older browsers it's going to use
more of the es5 syntax and therefore it
will then work in older browsers and
stuff like that so it's a very similar
thing but CoffeeScript was basically the
first to come along and try to do what
would Babel is do is doing so well now
and the bottom line is that it's it's
already dead so it's dead after you know
a mirror it's been in existence for
eight years it wasn't popular for eight
years hell it was only pop it was
popular a couple years ago but in in the
couple years since its you know since
since that time basically it's been dead
for about two years ever since Babel
came along ever since the latest
versions of es6 came along we don't we
just don't need it anymore
now clearly the the people over at the
CoffeeScript project would not want to
hear me saying that and in front of all
my audience but the fact the matter is
it's just it's absolutely true
CoffeeScript didn't keep up with latest
es6 standards they're trying to do that
they're trying to I think make efforts
there now but it's really it's just too
late so I don't foresee any projects
being made in CoffeeScript and I would
definitely not recommend anybody use
CoffeeScript for any sort of new project
I just don't see why you would do that
over something like Babel now one of the
things I do want to mention with this
project is that
CoffeeScript wasn't a shitty product
project it actually had a lot of promise
and everything I mean we we obviously
saw that a need for being able to write
JavaScript and make basically a more
robust way javascript when you break it
down it can be very difficult to read
some of it is due to the functional
nature of it the the fact that it
doesn't have strong types and or static
types or anything like that or any any
sort of type checking whatsoever it's
it's dynamically interpreted there's all
kinds of things that make JavaScript a
bitch to deal with and that's why we now
have things like typescript we have
CoffeeScript we have babel and es6 that
are trying to solve some of those
problems with the language CoffeeScript
was founded about eight years ago by
Jeremy here and he works at the New York
Times so he's a genius developer he's
one of the better ones in the industry I
mean the guy created an underscore and
backbone as well as CoffeeScript so
that's a that's a hell of a combination
there and this guy's is definitely a
good programmer so I'm not trying to
shit all over CoffeeScript in this video
it's just simply two more to point out
that there's just no future and the
shelf life behind it is just it's
absolutely crazy how so many people
invest their time and effort into it and
then we have to just completely do it
all over again and let me give you an
example this quill j/s editor which is
created by I think Jeremy Chen at
Salesforce another great product great
code this is like a microsoft word that
actually runs inside the browser and it
works fantastically well use it for my
website which is hipster code so like in
this particular case this was a writer
that was working for me which is Mark
Allen and when he was writing for me I
created an editor I'm using quill
basically just a back in Access and it
allows the blog writers to use quill to
write the blog then I'm storing the the
contents of the blog and a JSON format
which is what quill uses and then I'm
able to take will and display it but
anyway that's what quill is all about
quill is pretty awesome
now when quote was first started back in
2012 he wrote it using CoffeeScript so
when I was looking at some of the
initial check-ins and everything you
know you
clearly first jumping on the gun just in
2012 jumping on the CoffeeScript gun and
and and then just you know using it for
a project that would you know then be
you know incorporated in the sales
forces workflow and everything and and
then having to refactor and rewrite all
that stuff why because he want to use
the latest and greatest stuff probably
had a reason to do so at the time but
the thing that sucks is that all that
effort and everything that went into
learning CoffeeScript and even writing
all that code in CoffeeScript didn't
really pay off I mean I'm sure that he's
a better programmer because he learned
it and everything it's not like you're
gonna like Rick refs because you're
using some technology that's gonna be
quickly outdated it's just that it's
probably not the best use of your time
and I think that with so much technology
in the wind it's how fast it changes and
the fact that we have such a basically a
complicated industry with a ton of
competition a ton of really smart people
we need to make sure that we're using
our time wisely especially when you have
companies that are abusing you know the
amount of hours and ever been basically
abusing their their employees into
working ridiculous hours and taking less
benefits things like unlimited PTO and
all this bullshit that never really
seems to depan out too well for most
companies with all that in the taking
into consideration like I'm just trying
to get the job done in a professional
capacity and go home at the end of the
day so I can be you know with my my
children and everything so it's so once
again it's just using time wisely I feel
like that is so important in this
industry that a lot of people just
aren't using their time wisely we're
hurt animals so we jump on the latest
latest technology like CoffeeScript
whatever everybody starts using it we
become better but we kind of waste that
time where we probably should have been
focusing on maybe something else like if
we would have spent that time focusing
more on like c-sharp or net or Python
Django or anything maybe not Django but
you know with Python even with
JavaScript just vanilla JavaScript that
you probably would have been better off
I think then then spending all that time
writing in CoffeeScript and let's be
honest here that the name CoffeeScript
sucks ass man that is a terrible name
and I understand it's a knocker because
the JavaScript and then Java scripts a
terrible name too because everybody
confuses it with Java and you know
they're completely different language
and then CoffeeScript just trying to
continue that at least with typescript
it said hey you know what we're bringing
types of JavaScript so I went with types
where it makes more sense I think the
name typescript CoffeeScript is just
kind of a stupid name that is very
similar to JavaScript yes I'm an
opinionated asshole but that's why a
6,000 of you guys follow me and
hopefully more make sure you guys are
voting up my videos and subscribing I
appreciate that
definitely appreciate all the support
all the comments everybody that reached
out to me over three months obviously
I've been dealing with stuff and I know
just it's it's awesome like I feel like
I'm definitely friends with a lot of you
guys like I just know I've known you for
so long that like the same familiar
faces even if it's profiles and things
like that I feel like I know so many of
my of my audience I'm you know the
eighty-six out there's at least probably
I could I could think I would I would
probably be like able to identify just
even by looking at the profile their
username or whatever probably for a
thousand different people it's not more
yeah and like I said it's it's great
that the support that I get
so here's CoffeeScript too so and once
again not trying to shit on the project
if you guys want to use CoffeeScript and
waste your time go ahead feel free
you're I would not recommend it once
again obviously you guys know that but
CoffeeScript 2 is trying to they're
trying to make up for some of the missed
opportunities with es6 and everything so
read up on that more if you're
interested I'm personally not I'm not
messing with it but good luck to you
guys if you do and make sure you guys
once again vote up and subscribe and
have a good day bye so this video was
