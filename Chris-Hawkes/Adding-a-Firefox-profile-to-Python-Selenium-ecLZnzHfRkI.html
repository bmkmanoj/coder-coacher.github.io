to touch on going back to Firefox as our
web driver except this time I want to go
ahead and go through the process of
enabling a profile so that way we don't
have to log in over and over again to
different websites out there so the
first things first is I have this
project directory and I created a empty
file called profile inside there I have
test1 and that's just going to be the
Firefox profile that we need to create
so if you're using Windows I'm using
Windows 8 so I have this search feature
here and you want to go ahead and copy
in this search term and it's called a
Firefox Exe - profile manager space
another - no remote so I'm going to copy
this will be in the source code and if
you want to copy and paste from the
video below anyway so once we go ahead
and press Enter we're going to get this
dialog box and we're going to create our
profile and it says default user is I'm
gonna call this guy I'll just call it
Chris from my name I guess and I want to
choose the folder so that way I can
pinpoint where its add a little bit
easier so let me go to where my projects
directory is located right now and I'm
just going to select that folder we have
the profile name Chris
all right and just going to make sure
you do have the don't ask it startup
selected and then just go ahead and
click to start Firefox we should have
our new profile currently stored and I
don't want it to make my default browser
and here let's go to Google real quick
and just save that as a favorite all
right so we can see that this profile
does have this saved as a favorites all
right so let's close that browser and we
want to go ahead and alright so I'm
gonna go ahead and close that browser
and pull up my IDE here you can use
whatever you want but I'm using Visual
Studio and we're gonna create a method
called build Firefox driver should be a
fox in there okay and in order to import
our profile we need to say F P equals
webdriver dot Firefox profile and then
inside here is going to be the argument
to where it can find your actual profile
object that we just created with the
Firefox a little pop-up helper and where
that's located on my machine is in this
directory
okay and now that we have that because a
driver equals webdriver dot Firefox and
then the argument to that and we're
gonna say Firefox profile my one word
I'm sorry Firefox and then profile equal
our FB object that we just created and
since when you saw that the Firefox was
up that we saved Google as a favorite
we're gonna go ahead and pull up Google
just to make sure that is still marked
as a favorite
and in order to fire this method we're
going to say build a Firefox driver
let's go ahead and run this here if
everything goes well we're gonna see
that the browser is still gonna have
fire for google calm as a favorite which
you can see it's still marked as a
favorite all right now watch what
happens if we actually did not have our
profile added here Firefox uses just a
generic like default anonymous profile
so that any of your favorites cookies
things like that that you do in the
browser session will be cleared out
every single time so you can see here
that we we're going to call the same
page without actually loading our
profile to see what happens and you can
see that this is not marked as a
favorite so that is how you import a
Firefox profile into selenium webdriver
in the next video we're going to discuss
logging into a website using selenium
okay thanks guys bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
