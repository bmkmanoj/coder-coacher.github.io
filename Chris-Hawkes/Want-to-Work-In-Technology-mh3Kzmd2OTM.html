up going to the Bayside concert in
Richmond Virginia I'm not sure if any of
you guys made it out you guys know I was
going there but um anybody did the show
was sick it was it was it was a lot of
fun and for me it just it it's very like
I guess reflective because when I was
four when I first saw that bass I
concert there was November of like 2009
that's when I decided I was going to
make a rock music website which ended up
I bought new music and tried to build a
website everything long story short it
didn't really you know pan out or
anything like here's a few pictures from
the show that was that and it's always
like a small venue so this is like
enrichment you have it's a basic you
know mosh pits kind of break out not
really you know nothing major or
anything but I'm just fond like nobody
gets busted up like I've been to
concerts and stuff where people have
actually come out bleeding and that's
not cool or anything but anyway so with
Bayside like their their music is uh
they're a much better live performance
man like when you see them live like you
typically respect what they do a lot
more than what you would maybe you know
consider just like listening to them if
you were going to just randomly listen
to one of their songs or something like
that basically the fans were very
passionate and when you're around set of
passionate fans you kind of like you
really get to feel the vibe in my
opinion but the reason why I find it
like reflective is because like I said
this band is the reason why I became a
programmer and it's kind of like a long
story
but I can just essentially sum it up to
say that yeah because of this band like
I decided to make a web website and then
in the process I ended up becoming a
real programmer so you know so what I
want to take a moment to talk about is
Oberon and how wonderful this product is
like I mean I'm not trying to sell I
wish whoever was paying me to say that
but for the for a while I was like I
don't understand the hype it over I
understand people use tacky and things
like that but ever since I started
working in you know City like Richmond
and being being like more parking is a
major pain in the ass like just the
other night I ended up parking at my
work and then ended up taking an uber
from my work over to this this national
club to see the Bayside show and each
time within like three minutes of just
pulling out my phone and requesting an
uber ride to go probably eight to ten
blocks or so now I was waiting for three
minutes even coming outside of a venue
where there was probably a couple
thousand people at least two thousand
people there there was no weight
whatsoever like somebody was below the
convenience of uber is absolutely
unbelievable one of the things that it
kind of brings to mind is red box when
red box came around for the longest time
I wasn't using it I didn't understand
DVDs in a box like when it came out like
they revolutionize the way rentals work
right I mean they were able to take what
used to be rental rental stores and
charge like three dollars a movie and
completely cut out all of the the
brick-and-mortar expenses employee
expenses probably everything like you
know even like having to deal with
probably individual property insurance
and workers compensation insurance and
all those other stuff that goes along
with having a large workforce working
for you and then make automated boxes
that spit out these DVDs so they could
only they only had to charge a fraction
of the price so it ended up being a
major reason why movie stores like
Blockbuster that used to be on every
corner it seemed like just completely
disappeared the thing is is like things
became more convenient now though with
red box I love red box like it was
created by Coinstar or least bought by
coin started coming that that in fact I
believe McDonald's was actually one of
the early investors and even the coin
star app and possibly even red box I had
to look that up and so I have a little
bit of a cold so with uh with this
company that they revolutionized the way
DVD rentals will work right it was so
much more convenient however now they're
up against there like between a rock and
a hard place because they are competing
now with like the likes of Amazon and
Netflix or any sort of Amazon
specifically where it's like so
convenient to just rent a movie from
Amazon and even though it's you know two
to three times more expensive than a red
box movie you also don't have to drive
to the location you don't have to worry
about returning the DVD or anything like
that it's just click of a button boom
you end up having that that rental right
then and there so I think red box is
going to be in trouble because I myself
who used to go to red locks all times I
don't really go to red box very often
now it still is like the only location
you can go to rent PlayStation games and
things like that you're into that kind
of thing
because that was a very big convenience
I think back in the day where you used
to be able to run a game before you know
you've made the decision to pay $60 to
buy it so you know that that's something
that I think red box is done well on but
the thing is like technology changes
these industries and sometimes it can be
like overnight the things that we
thought we're never going to go away I
just end up going away like overnight
and and I think one of the cyllage
transition into over Sobers had a lot of
patches bad publicity lately like an
ogre engineer killed himself a guy who
could work for Apple and also that stuff
has a family
it's unfortunate circumstances and who
knows what kind of you know other issues
you may have faced or anything I don't
know anything more than just a fact that
apparently killed himself and his wife
is actually blaming a lot of ubers like
the hardcore working environment
everything to to him actually committing
suicide and things like that
and it's you know it's sad thing I'm not
sure if it's if it's like a I don't know
how legit it is like I said I don't know
I've never worked for / or anything I
will say it's interesting I got this
email from uber saying that the uber is
coming to Washington DC to interview for
a San Francisco location they're looking
for engineers and they reached out to me
so that's kind of cool but I don't plan
on working for Oprah I don't think I
would actually enjoy such a fast-paced
environment it's like if people are
truly working 16-hour days and things
like that and you know employees might
not get a handle and maybe even to the
point where they're killing themselves
life's a little too short for that in my
opinion at least at this stage in my
life I think if I maybe 24 25 I might
reconsider that but you know as a 35
year old with a couple of kids and then
you know home mortgage
and just kind of a happy life at the
moment it's not really something that
appeals to me I don't think now this saw
off the transitions into like Tesla a
lot of people love to have so they love
Elon Musk and here's an interesting
quote from Tesla where he says a must
must also says that Tesla should not be
compared to major u.s. car makers and
that its market capitalization which
means how much the value that company
has on a stock market which is more than
50 billion is unwarranted this is
actually a Elon Musk saying is
unwarranted I do believe this market cap
is higher than we have any right to
deserve he said pointing out his company
produces just 1% of GM's total output so
Tesla from a market capitalization
standpoint what the stock is trading for
is more valued than GM where GM actually
makes money and Tesla does and Tesla
loses massive amounts of money and it
only produces 1% of what GM's total
output is so people are crazy that they
absolutely are crazy the Wall Street
fanatics like they're out of their minds
and like I have a guy that writes for me
on hipster cocom he hates all the
notoriety and everything that Elon Musk
it's because of the you know simple
things like you know people saying
Tesla's more more valuable than the
General Motors where it's like 1% of
value things like that no so he takes
some you know some shots at Elon I think
that's just kind of I don't know it's
kind of his thing like it's got you know
I I don't know I like Elon Musk I really
do I think SpaceX is is a terrific
company I think you know Tesla vehicles
are also and everything so I love what
he's trying to do and in some ways I
think that you know he's on cloud nine
with some of his ideas and things like
that like even the boring company the
boring company if you guys have just
heard about that is a company that Elon
Musk's just recently started where he's
going to be drilling tunnels underneath
from basically San Francisco to Los
Angeles and and his whole idea is that
like we're going to get into these pods
and go like you know 150 200 miles an
hour if he's a little pause and things
like that and other and I was reading a
hacker
conversation where somebody was label
maybe they can like connect multiple
pods together and have like a few people
in each pod one person commented they're
like congratulations you just submitted
the Train like we clearly have trains
and tunnel systems and things like that
but Elon Musk a lot of people are saying
well you know clearly a lot of
ridiculously smart people that work for
Elon Musk thought out this problem and
stuff like that but the story goes that
Elon Musk was sitting in traffic on his
way to Los Angeles and got tired of it
and ended up founding a company that
very same day to drill tunnels
underneath the ground and then start
digging a tunnel underneath the parking
lot of Tesla so I think you know that
actually goes to show you that maybe a
lot of what Elon Musk is doing we're
talking about is just simply the vegies
a billionaire and kind of done it can do
what you want look at Trump he's
president so just because you're a
billionaire doesn't mean that like
you're absolutely genius and everything
you do but that said I think SpaceX is
great I think I think you know Tesla
like I said it's pretty cool but if we
could go onto this next paragraph he
describes his working conditions where
people are talking about like passing
out on the floor of the Tesla factory
where there's like 10,000 people working
he says we're a money-losing company
must get it this is not the same
situation where for example we were just
reading capitalists who decide to skimp
on safety in order to have more profits
and dividends and that kind of thing
which is a question of how much money we
lose and how do we survive how do we not
die and have everyone lose their jobs so
that is on that's a tough thing for a
CEO to say clearly that they're talking
about like we're not making money our
company's not profitable and as much as
people love Tesla it is a money-losing
operation you bring it back to over uber
as much like ubers have a lot of
negative publicity as well like just
recently female software engineer was
suing the company speaking out against
sexual harassment from within the
business yeah over exactly that
executive but a software engineer kill
themselves with family and everything
you have a lot of other things like the
CEO getting the arguments with uber
drivers things like that so there's been
a lot of negative publicity and on top
of all that if you look at the amount of
over lost last year I believe it was
around 2.8 billion dollars so while uber
is transforming the taxicab industry and
it is a very convenient and an awesome
product lyft is also a good product as
well which is owned at least a good
percentage of it is owned by GM which is
interesting but anyway it's just it's
really interesting all the stuff that
goes on in technology now like it can
really change the world but some of the
things like you can't just go out and
build it over a competitor I've always
kind of told you guys as my audience you
have to start small you have to start
somewhere but you can't just be like hey
I'm going to build an uber if you want
to build an uber you better you know
like you're going to spend more time
having to build connections to literally
hundreds of millions of dollars because
that's what it's going to take I mean
over in this case is any possibly you
know 40 50 billion dollars something
like that I mean I'm not sure what its
net income or net earnings were or
revenue we can look it up I'm not sure
if it's a scoop of revenue so they made
6.5 billion but like I said if you look
at their net income losses exceed 1
billion
ok so trying to figure out see low loss
exceeds 800 million in third quarter on
1.7 billion
what's a billion in net revenue okay so
maybe I looked at that wrong either way
they lost about a billion dollars or so
I probably look at that wrong my bad but
yeah a billion dollars 2.8 still it's a
lot of money and it might be right I'm
not sure if I'm not going to look at on
the fly right now so there clearly a
money-losing operation as well so if you
look at a company like Amazon Amazon
Jeff Bezos is on his way to becoming one
of the richest people in the world he's
probably going to be the richest person
in the world pretty soon but there were
many years where Amazon didn't make any
money in fact for like the first 10
years of its existence it never earned a
dime of profit and then even some of the
times where everybody knew Amazon just
couple years ago it still lost money so
they're all about growth in capturing
the market and even though they trends
transform the entire
ecommerce experience you know and really
put many small businesses out of
business and put pressure on even giants
like Walmart who's also done a number on
on small business and everything they
have clearly been able to compete in
things like that but they still like
don't like make money hand-over-fist
like if you compare that to something
like Google who actually made about
twenty billion dollars in profit
Microsoft makes more than Google in
profit look at Berkshire Hathaway um
Berkshire Hathaway net profit or net
income net income by the way is about
the profit twenty four twenty four
billion dollars in one year this is the
company that owns a Geico and a bunch of
other places like Dairy Queen and things
like that so they're there's a lot of
money-making organizations out there for
sure and uber and Twitter and Amazon and
a lot of other guys that you would think
are making tons of cash like are not
making the type of money there it's not
it's not normal business that we've come
to know after all these years and things
like that so technology is a crazy crazy
industry to be in
for many reasons you know you always got
to keep in check like what it is that
you're trying to build Elon Musk I mean
wondering why he's even a billionaire is
because like you know he was one of the
early people that got in on PayPal and
things like that so a lot of people got
out of PayPal and actually made quite a
bit of money even the guys that founded
YouTube were out of PayPal I believe so
alright guys I'm kind of going on and on
but this is just kind of like my
Saturday night going you know going into
the whole news of the technology
industry lately but I could really talk
about this a lot longer to be honest
with you but definitely check out my web
