Day and this is my special New Year's
Day a video that I am going to talk
about stuff that is coming up in 2017
and instead of doing some sort of power
point I'm just simply going to use
websites and just kind of talk about a
few things that come off the top of my
head and this by the way is not
something that I really planned too much
in advance for so I'll probably missed a
few things but these are just things
that I think about day-to-day and where
I think things are coming in going so
one of the the interesting things to
note is that this Fame bit company they
were trying to hook up YouTube creators
with sponsorship deals like companies
are looking to get their product in
front of people in order to you know
promote their stuff and and the thing
that that's interesting about fame bid
is that Google has for the longest time
made a ton of money like they're a cash
cow and they make their money off of
AdWords revenue so you go to search for
something you see little ads on the top
of it on the right hand side companies
are paying a lot of money for those ads
they're paying effectively you know
millions of dollars or billions every
day I have no idea what their actual
revenue is that Google has but I know
that you know the profit is ridiculous
that they make and it's mostly off of
that it gives them enough money so that
they can do all kinds of stuff that
doesn't make any money in return and
that's a very good luxury that Google
has now that is somewhat at risk I think
when you have content related websites
that used to be able to make a lot of
money off like blogs and writing and
things like that and they just don't
make enough money because of adblock and
stuff like that so let's look at on you
know you always heard about all these
different bloggers and things back when
the internet was first getting popular
becoming really rich and a lot of
bloggers some did make quite a bit of
money off of their written content but
it's so easily copied and the same thing
is kind of happened with YouTube where
you know YouTube's given these people
the ability to get in front of a camera
and actually talk and it's a little bit
more personal than just me writing
because you actually hear it straight
from the horse's mouth and sometimes
writing and even sometimes these videos
can be taken out of context but for the
most part there's just a little bit more
of a human feel to YouTube than what
we've had in the past with just you know
simple
writing of blogs so in the past we could
write blogs and we could advertise maybe
we can make money on Adwords and then
all of a sudden you know we have this
you know humongous popularity number one
of people understanding how the internet
works and they could spot ads better
than other people because let's face it
a lot of people were clicking on ads
because they know any better when I was
first looking at the web back in like
nineteen ninety-six I'd go to like a
yahoo search page and it was literally
like flashing lights it look just like
the idiocracy movie where he was
watching TV where there's just banner
ads and everything all over the place
and then you'd have to scroll like all
the way down the bottom where you had
this little search bar and I'd build a
search in there but I didn't even know
as a new user to the internet you know
what the hell I was doing and I think
for a long time it took them you know
people content providers would be able
to take advantage of some of these
things and people didn't even know that
they were clicking on ads and but you
know then obviously adblock came around
people are more aware and and companies
just weren't making as much money as
they used to on ads like you know even
companies that right you know newspapers
like the New York Times had a really
hard time trying to you know then they
still have a hard time making enough
money to make ends meet so you look at
youtube and there's this whole new there
there's this whole new variety where we
can get in front of a camera we can talk
we can mention products and things like
that companies that we're mentioning can
then you'll pay us money to mention
their products and to do reviews and
things like that and people have had
quite a bit of success on YouTube and
and granted everybody now chases after
that little bit of success but it's
going to be interesting to see where
this goes because famebit sort of
competed with Google for a moment there
where it's like you know instead of
companies paying a ton of money youtube
to add which advertiser google to
advertise on youtube they could just pay
the content creator to get their product
mentioned and if you look at something
like even when my channel does I mean
400,000 views a month if you had 400,000
review is like four hundred thousand
klicks to see your product in a given
month you would pay probably hell I
don't know mean that would probably be
20 25 thousand maybe more I have no idea
but it would be a ton of money and a lot
of people don't recognize the
you know the brand awareness that can be
brought about by you know YouTube and
content creators on these new platforms
so that's going to be something to watch
I think in 2017 because famebit was one
of the first ones to do it Google just
bought them and I really feel like they
bottom to do to try to hold down the
competition because Google doesn't want
you know those types of deals without
them getting a cut so I don't know it's
it's it's a tough situation there
because also Google doesn't pay enough
to the content creators because
companies just aren't giving enough I
think credibility to add to ads being
placed on videos and I don't see why
there's so much you know less comfort
and video ads vs. a web ad because it
seems like a web ad is even easier to to
you know skip out of and you know being
commit fraud or whatever but anyway so
that is something definitely to watch
and 2017 another thing is this
autonomous vehicle so just the other day
there's a international self-driving
truck I was reading about and this was
something that it's freightliner that
was their own by Daimler out of play
against Germany i guess but uh needs to
be damned like riesling i think they
broke off but anyway freightliner has
this fully autonomous truck and they
called the inspiration truck so they're
looking really to disrupt the entire
autumn you know auto well trucking
business which I mean there's like
millions of truck driving jobs in the
United States and they could be one of
the first ones on their way out with
self-driving vehicles so we're seeing
all kinds of car makers from everybody
from Honda to like to Volkswagen even by
do the Chinese search engine is now
coming out with their own self-driving
vehicle and a lot of them are gearing
towards 2020 as being the year that they
plan on coming out so it's going to be
really interesting to see you know what
that does to the trucking industry and
whether or not there's potential that
can be made on the web as far as trying
to to either you know have a website
that
is you know selling parts or I mean who
knows what it may be but these these
industries get changed you can even have
a website that's more informative of you
know keeping you know keeping truck
drivers up to deal with these new Newton
these news stories and things like that
that could be affecting their livelihood
down the road so I mean those are those
are things that it seems like a lot of
people don't really you know see until
it's too late sometimes and the one
interesting thing too is a goober
self-driving car so uber has completely
disrupted the taxicab companies and you
know they hate it work taxi capitate
overs how many taxi cab job so we have
in the United States alone not to
mention around the world in hoover
allows any average Joe now to be a taxi
cab and now you have these autonomous
vehicles that are going to be coming out
and already are out and that's you know
aiming to disrupt the industry another
thing is look at what red box did to the
DVD movie rentals nowadays even really
it started with both netflix and redbox
where you could redbox fully automated
the process of dvds and then you know
netflix was shipping DVDs through US
mail and things like that and they found
that it was more lucrative for them to
stream so streaming video is now like
the commonplace for me I remember when I
I balked at having to get a DVD / VHS on
my oh why do I do that and I love all my
VHS is eventually I'm just like screw
that I throw them all the way on me care
and then like my DVDs now are a hassle
like I don't really enjoy watching DVDs
anymore because our hassle it's so much
easier to watch Game of Thrones on
Amazon when you're streaming it and then
having to deal with DVDs and stuff like
that now granted when you switch
providers and you can't access your
content that sucks but if you have a
stable company like Amazon you buy all
your streaming media from amazon or some
other company then it's just so much
less of a hassle so I think that we're
going to continue to see more streaming
opportunities in the 2017 so anything
that caters towards that even if it's no
strictly you know what what can I get
how quickly can I get that stream to me
we'll see if there's going to be any
headway there another thing 2017 is
going to bring in as there's drones
people are buying drones all over the
place I mean there's drones that can
cost you a couple grand to a lot of you
know ton of money but they're doing
1080p so you can fly your drone around I
constantly see people trying to get
their drones out of the trees and I
laughs hysterically but you know these
these drones are going to continue to
get more popular in the 2017 next is the
internet of thing so we're going to see
a lot of this container go on and I've
said before that we still need to get
our security under control but Internet
of Things I mean best buy i went to
there and the computer of extreme
youtube or dot the computer with the the
refrigerator can stream youtube on a LCD
screen on the front of it they can order
new goods and things like that walmart
now has grocery checkout where you can
order your groceries online and go to
the store and it's already bagged and
ready to pick up for you that's
something new obviously you know these
are you know same day deliveries and
facilities from amazon are going to be
extremely important so Walmart's can be
trying to compete with Amazon I'm trying
to get you the product faster walmart
has 24-hour locations where target
doesn't so there's there's a lot of
competition there for me being able to
order something and get it almost right
away internet security is still going to
be a problem especially with Internet of
Things have already mentioned so if
you're in the security ecommerce or you
know any sort of cyber your combating
cyber warfare things like that that's
going to be a huge industry to get into
you like sis certifications things like
that I've talked about certifications
and some of my previous videos but
expect those jobs to be very very
lucrative coming into the end of the
future more than more so than they
already are artificial intelligence is
going to continue to grow what we're now
approaching you know things were
artificial intelligence you know just
recently read an article about how
artificial intelligence came up with
song lyrics for x and it came up with
some lyrics by looking at a picture of a
Christmas tree so
here is Lucy this was the article that
was released by and video which this
thing came up with these lyrics this was
completely artificial intelligence by
looking at this photo and if you read
the lyrics it's very interesting you
know what it thought but basically it
was looking at like women thought were
flowers on the tree and and you think
that it's very very primitive but it's
still very very creepy that you know we
have a computer system that was able to
learn and often and you know try to
understand enough to know that there's
something celebratory it going on with
that tree so the thing about artificial
intelligence is that a lot of people
worry about like you know the
singularity where once we get to the
point where machines can start learning
from itself that it ends up increasing
into this ever-growing drive to continue
to get better and better and and get
better to these unfathomable if I can
see that right Heights that are beyond
human comprehension because we obviously
have things that we can understand if
you guys have ever seen like the the
movie interstellar with Matthew
McConaughey I actually love that movie
but in that movie there was this uh you
know they needed to go into a black hole
in order to get some of this data from
whatever sort of I guess life form or
whatever that was communicating with him
but the the data they you know the here
the physicist that was left behind it or
if he had figured out that he couldn't
solve that problem but I guess what I'm
trying to say is that there are certain
problems that we haven't been able to
solve another mysteries to physicists
and scientists around the world and you
know sometimes we get to solve them
sometimes we feel like we may never
solve them but if you actually get a
self-learning artificial intelligence
intelligence machine that can literally
learn from itself you're going to end up
like creating this new technological
drive to the finish line where the
computers are going to be re-engineering
their own coat or at least that is a
theory that's out there that says that
once we get to that level that I mean
the computer systems would reach
unfathomable heights and that we would
just wouldn't be able to comprehend
and our world would be completely like
completely different I think it'd be
pretty cool because then you know we'd
be able to find out some of the
mysteries that you know sometimes our
brain limitations you know may hinder
you know what i mean and or hinder us
from understanding certain things and i
don't know the questions gonna be
whether or not even a computer will be
able to relay that information over to
us as if it was smart enough you know to
be able to dumb it down for for humans
but you know that that's going to happen
by machine learning and by building true
artificial intelligence so how does that
happen and that really brings up you
know the next big thing which is big
data and big data we've talked about it
for quite some time but it's going to
continue to to play a big part in the
2017 and really the thing that big data
makes artificial intelligence and
machine learning much more easy because
they can learn from such a large vast
amount of data now who has access to a
large vast amount of data and that's
really Google and Amazon and I've also
mentioned in the past that you kind of
have to work within their API is because
they have the benefit of being able to
take so much content that people are
delivering to them whether it's voice
commands to search commands to different
linguistic styles and things like that
and they can say you know a hundred and
fifty million people search for this and
we were giving them one two and three
but you know predominantly they were
going to 45 and 60 like they're able to
you know to adjust their search results
just based on sheer like just you know
raw like I guess computation and really
you know just they have the luxury of
being you know ugly a about the way
that they can they can comprehend that
data because they have so much of the
data which gives them an unfair
advantage and that's actually a concern
that I have you know that there's an
unfair advantage given to some of the
larger tech companies out there and
they're going to continue to have better
products because they have so much data
now that there is obviously the outliers
that might be able to truly work with an
open source you know AI initiative that
can actually you know compete with you
know with these bigger companies with
less data so you know there's always
that pasta
but you know for the most part what I've
seen with AI and big data and machine
learning it's all just simply through
raw humongous amounts of computation and
and those are things that like I said
companies have an advantage of over
individual developers and other smaller
company virtual reality is going to be a
huge part of 2017 the PlayStation VR was
a huge success I'm not sure about it
financially speaking as far as like what
it's made for sony i thought i thought i
read that they were doing pretty well
but i didn't do a whole lot of research
on that so they don't have the better
capabilities over the HTC vive or the
oculus rift but the PlayStation VR is
relatively affordable in the fact that
you can get it for 400 bucks sim you
have the camera and the handheld devices
along with your PlayStation 4 that makes
it much more of a cheap option compared
to the oculus rift which is going to run
you 700 bucks and then you still have to
have you know brand new awesome computer
in order to be able to run it so your
PlayStation has has brought it to the
masses and I think that you know this
could be a potential now is so far what
I've seen of the PlayStation VR there
are some really cool things but a lot of
the games really suck ass and some of
the really fast moving games also make
me nauseous and I have a pretty strong
stomach so I'm curious to see how they
plan on resolving that but I would think
VRS is going to continue to be a big
force in 2017 education is ready for a
disruption not just across the world but
definitely in the United States some of
these colleges are so effing ridiculous
abele expensive it's unbelievable now
the Stanford's of the world I've already
said that you know they've always said
that they have their places that some of
the best and the brightest are going to
be going to some of these places but you
know the not everybody needs a college
education not everybody needs to spend
150 thousand dollars in order to get a
college education I think that's
 so we're seeing things that are
popping up educational disruptions all
over the place one of them is uh my my
sponsor which is Deb mountain coding
boot camp this is a coding boot camp
that's aimed for 12 and 16 week courses
that are completely drilled on specific
technology like know Jas angular react
how many things that companies are using
right now
and the focus is you pay a fraction the
amount of money you're still able to get
yourself into the industry and it's only
12 to 16 weeks of intensive learning and
then you continue to learn and grow from
there a lot of people coming out of
college they tell you like yeah I spent
all this money and I to learn all these
different courses and granted they have
a pretty well-rounded education they
learned a lot of things that they're not
really going to apply to them in their
day to day job and many of them
including computer science professions
come out and they still don't know how
to program very well some find out you
know they come out and they get in the
STEM jobs and find out they don't like
the stem field at all and you know
really I think a 12 and 16 week course
probably would have benefited them
pretty well to figure out hey do I
really want to be an iOS developer or UX
designer so you know definitely check
out that mountain if you guys are
interested the description or the link
is in the description down below they
are my sponsor and they sponsor this
video so you're going to see the
education system continue to be
disrupted I think just because it's so
expensive and not a lot of people are
getting that return on investment and
that's something that is it's very very
concerning I think because not everybody
can be a programmer one time I did a
video on this this dumbass senator from
early wasn't Center he was like a state
senator from Florida that attributed the
same thing as learning python to
learning Spanish he thought they were
both languages and that you just kind of
learn it and that you should be able to
substitute of foreign language with it
with a computer programming course now
it's great they want to teach computer
programming in high school but let's get
some brains behind some of these idiots
that passed our policies in the United
States and at least learn the simple
difference between a spoken
language and a logical programming
language like it's just so idiotic with
some of the people you know the people
that we elect to make decisions for us
and not just the United States but
around the world so that's something to
look forward look forward to really the
education system being disrupted we're
seeing a lot of success with Kahn
Academy people like me doing YouTube
videos on educational things that people
are finding inspiration and knowledge
from a lot of knowledge sharing going on
these days we're going to continue to
see Kickstarter
applications the crowdfunding of all
different levels of me a patreon like my
patreon page people are contributing to
my channel in the description below
there's a link to patreon font awesome
just recently went to Kickstarter and
raised a crap ton of money they raised
over a million dollars to build the next
font awesome publication and that was
just from the developer community
obviously the people that created the
oculus went to Kickstarter raised money
sold themselves a Facebook for billions
of dollars and the rest is history and
they kind of kick started this whole VR
crave so a lot of things are happening
through crowdfunding and crowd
inspiration including like I said even
the patreon page that i have here where
I have 11 patrons where it's already
donating 45 dollars a month to help me
contribute content like this every
single day so continue to see more space
planetary travel especially from
commercial companies companies like
SpaceX which was founded by the same guy
that created the Tesla company which is
Elon Musk and they're also doing a lot
of stuff with with satellite net
satellites but um solar powering and
things like that this falcon heavy rock
it's going to be the next phase of their
Rockets really the most powerful rocket
i think ever to be launched from the
world and they're looking to launch that
and the 2017 so we're looking at the
possibility of sending humans back to
the moon also to Mars and there
hopefully the near future so we're going
to continue to see that also another
thing to be excited about and this may
not I've been waiting for this for long
friggin time and it's still not ready
but that is the James Webb telescope and
it looks like as far as I know this
could be delayed all the way into 2018
or so I haven't gotten any updates on
that yet but uh anyway we're going to be
able to see further back towards the
origins of you know the galaxy further
than we've ever seen in the past
anything you no further than anything
that the Hubble can provide and other
satellites that we have currently in
space with Trump winning the presidency
already they're talking about a trillion
dollar and
ruk sure spending paddle in the United
States which is going to be like
overhauling airports bridges and things
like that apparently has bipartisan
support meaning that both Democrats and
Republicans supported so we actually may
see something get past which can end up
in creating opportunities for companies
that deal with infrastructure within the
United States so this video is longer
than I had initially anticipated and I'm
probably going to go ahead and cut it
short here but those are just some of
the things that come to mind when it
comes to 2017 where we're headed some of
the opportunities a little bit you know
more broad than just simply programming
but a lot of it is technology and intact
relate and I think that new anything
that I mentioned here you know there's
an opportunity for you know niche areas
that you could end up getting into in
some way shape or form you know you're
doing website or mobile development
something like that anyway guys thanks
for watching make sure you subscribe
