there is there are things called global
objects and those are built-in types
that JavaScript has which are like
undefined or null null is its own type
there's also a not a number type which
is really weird and then there's an
infinity type as well so those are all
global they're considered global
properties but that's not to be confused
with the actual global namespace so what
you hear about a lot in javascript is
that a good clean modular design
prevents pollution of the global
namespace because in JavaScript you can
actually add things to your global
namespace very easily and it can create
some real headaches for you down the
road but first we need to actually look
at what is the global name space so the
global namespace is actually just a
global object in the global scope so
what we need to actually do to give an
example of this if we pull up our
developer tools and we pull up the
console just on any google page or
really any page for that matter it
doesn't matter so if i pull up this
console setting so the global object if
i just type this it's going to return
this this global window object so really
this is this is everything attached to
the global name space right here a lot
of this stuff goes back literally a
decade or more and how some of this
stuff ends up being in the global
namespace right right here we have all
the stuff about SVG like I mean it goes
on there's some WebGL stuff which is
some relatively newer stuff you have all
these different I mean there's just a
ton of stuff in here right an absolute
ton so what we need to talk about now is
the pollution of the global namespace
and why that's a problem and JavaScript
I can easily attach things to that
global namespace by simply saying this
and then we can just give a name that
test equals
hello world and JavaScript just allowed
us to do that so now if I actually type
to this keyword the global object now
has attached to it if we go all the way
down to the bottom you're going to see
down here under the t's that test is now
part of this global object so one
particular variable a string variable as
simple as hello world is now attached to
that global object so what if I rename
test and I have that test and I actually
overwrite that variable in the global
namespace and then I reference it and
not knowing that i overwrote it weird
stuff like that I will it allows that to
be done in JavaScript and Java Script
doesn't complain about it so polluting
the global namespace is typically a
no-no and that's why we tried to have
modules in JavaScript with something
called closure so that way variables and
functions that exist inside that module
only exists inside the module itself and
that they cannot be accessed from the
global scope unless the module opens it
up for access so we're going to see in
certain module patterns that modules can
have both private and public functions
and how that goes about so but it's all
all that design philosophy is all to
prevent the global namespace collisions
and clashes and the pollution so it's
really weird I know but that's
essentially what we're talking about
when we want to prevent the pollution of
the global namespace alright guys thanks
