what we're going to be doing is showing
you how to get up and running with a
basic asp.net website as well as using
react and babel and web pack which is
really the the three tools that you're
going to use a lot whenever you're gonna
be writing react code you're gonna need
babel to compile your JavaScript and
you're also gonna need web pack in order
to be able to handle your modules and
we'll get into that more as we go into
this but this is just gonna be pretty
much a one video demonstration of how
you would want to really just give a
suggestion of how you could set up your
project to use both asp.net and reacting
and with asp.net we're obviously gonna
be using C sharp which is Microsoft's
like flagship language it's their most
popular language and by far and I really
wanted top five languages out right now
probably so in order to be able to
follow along on this you're gonna need
to have something to write your code in
and since we're using asp.net you're
probably going to want to use Visual
Studio and there's a free version so you
can download that here at this webpage
you can also get dotnet core we're gonna
be using actually got in at 4.5 Somnath
dotnet core but the it will come with
your install so just go ahead and make
sure you have Visual Studio installed
the next thing you're gonna need is
you're going to need to have no js'
installed because that's how we're going
to install our tools like babel and web
pack and react so make sure both of
these are installed your machine I'm
gonna be using Windows but you can
probably follow along just fine on a Mac
or Linux machine too so once you have
Visual Studio installed and I went ahead
and opened it here you're gonna be
greeted with this start page and what
we're gonna do is just go to file new
and create a new project and then inside
here what I'm gonna do is just you can
highlight web if you want so you have
less options to deal with and we're not
going to be using core again we're gonna
be using dotnet 4.5 so that's why I'm
selecting this version here you're going
to want to go ahead and create a place
to put it here I'm not gonna use a git
repository that's just beyond the scope
of this this this tutorial here I like
to put my projects and a folder on my C
Drive just so I have a safe place to
reference them I put them right in here
so
I have a c-sharp folder already here so
I'm going to go ahead and just select
that folder and here the name this is
the name of the project that you're
going to be titling so my crooked case
it's going to be react demo I guess I'll
just call it react demo alright we'll
click OK and now here what we want to do
is select MVC but we're going to do
actually going to do an empty we don't
want to have any of the boilerplate or
any other stuff that it comes with so
we're just gonna do an empty empty
website I'm not gonna add unit tests
that's once I can probably beyond the
scope of what I'm trying to demonstrate
here so let's just select the empty and
clear click OK alright so here it went
ahead and set up the project for us
there's not much here on the rights and
a right hand side here the solution
explorers where your actual the contents
of your project are located there's
gonna be a lot of Microsoft specific
stuff in here that might be confusing if
you've never gotten started with asp.net
before I like the web.config and and
just well that's probably because it's
empty that there's not gonna be too much
confusing stuff but how do we have
selected the regular asp.net website
you're gonna have authentication and
everything all built in and working for
you and that can be sometimes difficult
to figure out what's going on there but
let's go ahead and create our controller
because what we want to do is when the
application starts we want to have just
go ahead and have a look at an initial
greeting page so I'm gonna go ahead and
right click on the project and I'm going
to say add and we're gonna say new
scaffolded item and we want to grab an
MVC controller and we're just gonna say
that it's empty
and we'll call it the default controller
that's fine
all right so that went ahead and added
quite a bit of stuff that our project
needs because now that it knows that
you're a d2 controller it's like oh well
when you do it and add all this other
stuff
like the route config we'll get into
that in just a second but this is
actually how your application is able to
hit the controllers that you add to the
project this just explains how the
routing is supposed to work because you
can customize that quite a bit
but we're not going to get into too much
of this basic stuff and really it's not
basic at all it's just it's what every
project and asp.net needs so at least
for MVC dotnet and we just we don't need
to dissect all those pieces here we just
want to go ahead and get moving on
because this is mostly about how to
integrate react with your asp.net
project all right so let's go ahead and
in the controllers folder there's now
this default controller and you can see
that it's returning this view so we have
just one index and in order to return
something because right now we're gonna
return essentially nothing because there
is no view and the default folder down
here in the views so we want to go and
create that and there's a shortcut to be
able to do that if you have this
controller file right and hover over
view and right click and then just say
add view and then here this is we're
going to go with the default we want to
have the index match the the method name
which is indexed so make sure that those
those is acid it has to match up
otherwise it's not gonna be able to find
the right template and we also want to
have this use a layout page selected so
we're gonna go ahead and select the
layout page that's supposed to use and
that's going to be right here and the
reason why we use layout pages is just
for code reuse so that way if there's a
lot of stuff that all the pages share
you can have that sitting in the layout
and just have the you know the pages
that derive from that not use everything
or not have to be duplicate all that
stuff that's in the layout because it
just it uses the layout plus of you know
the additional code I'll explain that
more in detail we're going to click Add
so this is gonna add our view and you
can see now under the default folder we
used to be empty there's now an index
file and this is gonna be what has
changed
to react tutorial alright and an inside
here this is actually called razor
syntax so if you've no in fact if you've
never used a speed on that you probably
want to follow along on a different
tutorial before you even get to this
because this is mostly once again about
how to integrate react with a speed on
that alright what I want to do though is
customize this layout folder or the
layout file so inside shared the layout
we're going to take out some of the
stuff that I don't want in the project
right now taking out those two lines
down here I'm going to go ahead and get
rid of this stuff here we do want this
render section down here so I do want to
keep that and I also want to copy this
line and I'm going to put it at the top
of the head here or actually at the
bottom of the head and inside we're
gonna change the name of it and the
reason why is because we want to have
two sections that we're going to use if
we have the footer section and the head
section and that's all we're doing here
we can go ahead and change our
application name so we'll say react
I wish I could spell tonight all right
and let's go ahead and just click play
but before we do that let's see yeah
yeah we're let's go ahead and click play
things definitely kind of slow alright
so when it finally actually opens up we
don't have this this root root file
pointing to our default template but if
we went ahead and we did forward slash
and just did default for the name of our
controller that we created now you're
actually going to hit the tutorial that
we changed and because we took out all
the CSS and everything like there's no
there's no good styling here so let's go
ahead and fix that real quick and just
so that we know what's going on inside
the layout I'm gonna go ahead and go to
the content folder and we want to drag
in bootstrap and then under that we also
want to drag in the site CSS now this
was actually happening under the covers
but I wanted to explain really just what
I didn't want any sort of that magic
going on I just wanted to be very
explicit about what files and everything
are being loaded because we're using
bootstrap we also need to actually use
both jQuery in bootstrap is such a
bootstrap requires jQuery so let's go
ahead and bring that in first and all
you have to do is just click and hold
and it'll actually map it for you and
everything and then we're gonna drag in
bootstrap here alright so we should be
able to just not close it down so let's
just go ahead and stop it and rerun it
so that way I can open in the browser
and you can see that we have much better
styling this time and it's even
responsive so that you have the
responsive navigation which there's no
items there but anyway that that is
working so if we want to fix that issue
where it's opening up the first page and
it's not actually finding it then mobile
you do is go into our route config which
is in the app start folder and if we
double click on that inside this this
instantiation code right here what we
want to do is add another argument which
is controller and then we're going to
give the name of the controller that we
want it to default to which is our
default controller and then now when we
go ahead and start it it's actually
going to find that default controller so
we don't want to put that in the URL we
can just it'll find there for us and go
right there from the root directory
there boom all right so now that we have
that out of the way let's go ahead and
go into our project folder structure
here and what I want to do inside the
scripts is actually where I'm going to
put our react project I'm going to
create a folder inside of here and we're
just going to call it our react folder
and let's go to navigate to where that's
located
so here's the react demo folder so if I
if I go you can see I'm just inside my
projects folder where I put this project
so if I go inside of the scripts not the
script yeah scripts sorry scripts
scripts folder then we're gonna go
inside the reactor folder in this
address bar type in CMD and it's gonna
be a shortcut to open up your command
prompt to that that folder now what I
want you to do is if you installed know
like you know like I told you the
beginning of the video then you when you
type in NPM it should actually pull up
information NPM is a package manager and
it allows us to to install things like
react and stuff like that it's gonna
reach across the web and grab the latest
react code and and it handles like
dependencies that certain projects need
so that's why we needed to install node
because we needed the NPM tool so if you
get information like this it means that
you've installed NPM and node correctly
so you can continue if not you need to
go and reinstall that so that he can get
that working and the first thing we need
to do inside this folder now is we're
gonna create an initialization file so
in an it file so let's go ahead and do
that now we're gonna say NPM and NIT
I'll make just a little bigger so you
guys can see alright so uh so down here
let me try to shrink this a bit
there you go so we're gonna type I NPM
and Nik which is short for
initialization we'll just well you I
don't want to call it react actually
we'll just call it tutorial so that's
the name of the the project that that
NPM is gonna reference and we'll just
say version 1.0 that's okay I will say
Chris now here's the starting point
we're going to call it our starting
point is and don't worry about the test
command where to get repository or
keywords and I'll put my name
there you can put your own name and then
we're gonna mighty license and that's
good alright so now that we've done that
it created this package JSON folder now
in order to write react code you're
going to need to get a better editor
than Visual Studio so unfortunately the
support and Visual Studio at least with
2015 it certainly didn't work let's go
ahead and try with Visual Studio first
and see how ugly it is but inside this
our project folder inside the reactor
you can see that there's nothing it
looks like there's nothing inside of
react folder or even though we can see
that we just created a file called
package JSON and in there but it's not
showing up in Visual Studio the reason
why is you need to click this little
button at the top it says show all files
and then you can see that it's showing
you that they have this package that
JSON file is in the project but because
it's grayed out like that it's not
included in the project so in order to
do that we want to right-click and
include in the project and the reason
why certain files are included and not
included is like you'll see in a second
when we go and install note that we
don't necessarily want everything and
all of these folders to be added to our
project and having you know Visual
Studio have to keep track of the files
and things like that and I'll explain
that more in just a second here you'll
see why but inside this package that
JSON file this is going to be
responsible for keeping track of all
your dependencies so when we install
react react has dependencies on all
kinds of other different projects that
it's going to install for us and that's
why I'm p.m. just makes that so much
easier to get things like react working
and so we'll see in just a second here
that this is this file here is going to
grow as we install stuff so the first
thing is let's go ahead and install
react and where is a NPM install - -
we're gonna say save and now I want to
say react and then space react and dog
all right so once again this is reaching
across the web it's going and it's
installing all the different
dependencies and everything because we
did save it's actually going to add
those two things that we installed to
our dependencies location of this config
file and that's why I was telling you
that it keeps track of the versions that
you have because if you have react 16.2
you can't have react Dom 16.5 or
fourteen points something or another
you're gonna have all kinds of problems
but NPM is actually it's it's following
the dependency structure pretty well so
it handles all that for us now what I
want to show you because I was telling
you about the reason why you don't want
to have all these files included in
Visual Studio there's now this node
modules folder which all these these
different things got installed into and
the reason why was because we installed
react but react has all these
dependencies so all this stuff has to
actually be downloaded as well in order
for react to be able to work in react
Dom so even though we didn't say to
install these things they did anyway
because they need to be there in order
to react to work and if we go back to
visual studio and we refresh you can see
the node modules folder but I'm not
gonna right-click and include that one
because there's just too much stuff in
there I don't want Visual Studio keeping
track of Visual Studio is a memory Pig
so the thing can run out of memory at
any random time and just like crash it
happens all the time ask any windows
developer alright so now that we've done
that we need to go ahead and install a
few other things and these are our
development tools so instead of actually
saying that they're a dependency they're
actually a development dependency as
we're working on this project so we're
gonna say npm install and because it's a
development dependency we're gonna save
saved of instead of just saved and now I
need to add we're gonna say Babel or I
know it's a confusing as the bees over
here but it's Babel core Babel loader
and they need to have a space between
all these things webpack we're gonna say
Babel
pre-set P&amp;amp;V and then a babble preset
react alright that should be everything
so we click in alright 20 button install
all those as are the development
dependencies I'm going to pause the
video because that's a lot it's gonna
have to download a lot for that alright
guys the next thing we need to do now is
go ahead and we need to add a new file
to the react folder called it's our web
pack config file I'm going to say new
item I'm so JavaScript file so I'll just
say web pack dot config dot J's alright
so inside of here I'm gonna paste this
ends our just pub pause the video for
second make sure you copy don't copy
this yet but in just a second copy it
what we're doing here is we're actually
setting up this configuration file that
web pack is gonna use and let's see
actually gonna need half at all this
should be fine the entry point is going
to be our app is starting point and then
we want our output to be in this
distributor it will keep the output like
this let's go ahead and test this out
real quick let's add a new app Tijs file
to this because that's gonna be the
starting points that's the entry point
that's looking for so career app dodgy
as file and inside here we're just gonna
use some sort of new standard some new
syntax this is a new feature so if you
want to write the latest JavaScript then
and you want to use keywords like
constants or arrow functions and things
like that it's some of the latest
version some of the latest standards
over the JavaScript language it doesn't
it doesn't work on all the browsers so
that's why Babel is gonna allow us to be
able to write in the latest form of
JavaScript which includes classes and
things like that
and it's gonna compile it or process it
down to older JavaScript that still
works in the browser but it does it for
us so we can still write modern
JavaScript but have it work in older
browsers and that's why we're actually
setting up all these tools but you'll
see also that it's a it's pretty
imperative that you have these tools in
place because most of the tutorials and
the documentation you're going to see on
react these days and they're using
classes and things like that which means
that you have to have babel and another
thing too is when you're writing JSX
code and all that stuff it's gone it's
it's impossible to do any of that stuff
and just straight JavaScript I mean
you'd have to be a ninja so we're gonna
be using JSX and you'll see what that is
and then uh you know as you get into
react and everything but the babel makes
all that possible all right so let's go
back to our package JSON file what we
need to do under the scripts we need to
actually tell it how to execute web pack
because we didn't install web pack
globally we want to go ahead and add it
here and this basically just tells a NPM
hey I'm gonna look inside my node
modules folder from from the same folder
of where this config file is located so
it just automatically knows to look in
node modules for the web pack that we
installed and not some global version so
that's why we're adding it to the
scripts file here and if everything goes
well we're gonna see this thing try to
compile so now we're going to say npm
run web pack and it did not see
alright the reason why it's not working
is our config file here I'm sorry I
missed the module I was just copying
this from the web page and we need to
save module that exports alright that's
if you could see that visual studio was
even trying to warn me of that that it
was complaining because in order for
this file to actually be usable about
web pack it needs to be exported so it
can import it alright let's go back here
and try to do that alright so now you
can see that it did went ahead and
compiled and it put out the bundle j/s
so if we go inside here refresh we're
now gonna have damn there's another
reason why you don't add two node
modules folder look at all this stuff
that's now inside node modules there's a
ton but now you have this dist folder
and we do want the dist involved in the
project so I'm going to say add or
include a project alright so inside here
you can see this is a bundle file this
was created for us by web pack and now
this was just web pack that did it for
us and you can see that it's still using
cost and cots doesn't work in all the
browsers so we didn't actually use babel
yet where babble is not being used by
web packs so what we need to do now is
add that portion to our to our web page
alright so I'm gonna be copying this as
well and after the output here put a
comma and I'm gonna paste this in we're
adding this module and this actually
tells it to use babel but we want to
change a few things because we're not
using power i'm gonna go ahead and
remove that and we do want it to say use
babel loader also this needs to be this
needs to be babel preset P&amp;amp;V and if you
remember earlier we installed that and
we also installed react so we need to
say babel preset react and react uses a
syntax called JSX which is like this
hybrid of HTML and javascript and the
thing is is that it has to be compiled
to regular JavaScript so babel can do
that for you but you need to have babel
preset react
you need to tell babble how to use that
and that's why we're actually setting
that up here so this is now going to it
should work but let's go ahead and and
check this out here I want to make sure
there's no problems now when we run this
with the config alright now one thing
that you'll you'll notice it's actually
annoying that we have to actually run
this every time we want to build it but
we'll see in just a moment that we can
do something they continually have it
watched for any changes that we made in
fact we'll even do that now so after the
modules let's go ahead and say we're
gonna say watch and then true so now
that we've done that when we go ahead
and we've run a web pack instead of just
stopping and see it's not waiting and if
we look here what's going to make it
change so that web packing a web pack
and pick up on it alright so watch on
the left hand side so as we make a
change here
now I'm gonna ctrl s to save it and you
can see that web pack picked up on it
and it recompiled and it now has a new
bundle file that it's created you can
see that this is now added now another
thing you can tell that babble is not
working because it took out the
constants keywords and it's using this
strict mode which this is all older
versions of JavaScript that still work
in the browsers and that's why Babel you
can see is now is now compiling
correctly for us now to see react in
example let's go ahead and add something
here
and I'm just going to type in react
tutorial because this isn't a
specifically a react and tutorials is
set up at least at this moment so I want
to use some of their getting started
code to get our feet wet as well
all right this is what I was looking for
other documentation here what we want to
do is we want to copy this file here all
right at least that portion and we're
gonna go to our app da GS and get rid of
all that and now we're gonna save that
now this is the JSX code that I was
telling you about the browser has no
idea how this is and nor does JavaScript
the JavaScript managing can't compile
this but what it does is with the react
development extension for Babel it's
going to take this JSX code and turn it
to regular JavaScript then it's going to
compile the newer JavaScript to the
older JavaScript so it does all that
magic for us on the fly so if I go ahead
and save it and you look inside the
bundle file now you can see that there's
quite a bit more in here now than what
we had before because all this stuff
like it just went ahead and said oh
you're using react and all this stuff so
okay I need to bring in the react
project I need to bring in the react Dom
project and just a lot of stuff going on
there
now this is an important part now in
order for we have to actually be
rendered what we need to do is we need
to say okay this document dot get
element by ID root we need to go ahead
and take a note of that because what
we're gonna do is add that ID to our
webpage so that react can bind this
component to the to the root node and
it's best to just give a demonstration
so inside here let's go ahead and create
our div ID and we're gonna call this
root and that way react with like I said
it will render all its code inside this
element now we also need to say we need
to add our our bundle file to this this
index file here in order for wrapped
actually works so let's say it's we're
going to say at symbol and then section
and if you remember from our layout our
section for the footer was called
scripts so that's what we're going to be
extending here so we're gonna say
section
scripts just like that and then inside
here this is what we're gonna drag in
our bundle and you want to make sure
it's in the scripts because with this
bundle you want the Dom and all every
all the elements everything to load
before this file actually loads that's
why we put it in there and you know just
before the closing body tag all right so
now let's go ahead and run the project
all right and we have hello world now
this is actually being rendered by react
so if I right-click dock this at the
bottom here you can see that the route
now has this h1 the hello world that we
added to it and that is all inside right
here so if we would have changed this to
something else we could do that in fact
we'll see in future tutorials I'm going
to do on react that there's quite a bit
you can do here but now react is now
actually working so this is a you know
full example really of how you get
asp.net along with react working and
once again you guys should tune in to my
react tutorial I'm gonna go into
building quite a bit of stuff with with
react but this whole initial setup is
some of the biggest pain I think to
getting involved in a lot of modern
client-side development these days the
technology changes I've done videos on
this subject not even a year ago and
they're already out of date so like
things just go out of date so quick with
with some of this stuff but the initial
setup is is generally the hardest part
and then from there you can really start
you know looking at a lot of examples
online a lot of tutorials like mine like
books things like that that will really
help you along because a lot of the
syntax of react itself isn't changing
but the tools and everything you use for
your project do change quite a bit now
one thing I will suggest also when
you're doing react development there is
a react Chrome extension you definitely
should check that out this react
developer tools I mean you absolutely
need it if you're gonna use redox you
have to use that tool as well okay
you're just gonna pull your hair out
with some of the debugging and things
you don't make your life any more
difficult than it has to be when you're
dealing with some of this stuff like
this is gonna make your life easier now
let's go ahead and see I could probably
close this down
all right so now if we right-click and
we inspect we now have this react
