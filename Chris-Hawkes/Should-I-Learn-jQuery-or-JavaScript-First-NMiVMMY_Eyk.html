to talk about jQuery versus JavaScript
in one of the previous videos I had I
had mentioned that I believe what I had
said and I'd have to go through and hear
a Bourdon forward but what I I believe I
had said is that I had recommended that
when one is just starting out with web
development that they don't spend a ton
of time learning JavaScript before
jQuery if they were trying to get
something done so I have always
advocated that one shouldn't learn the
JavaScript language you should obviously
know what an array is or how to create
variables you should know how to do for
loops and you know basic for loops and
just a lot of like the basic syntax that
exists in every single language so I've
always said that you should learn that
and and JavaScript before jumping the
jQuery but in one of my previous videos
I had said that if you're trying to get
a website up and running and you're
trying to use you know I guess you know
more modern UI approaches with plugins
like light light boxes for images and
things like that that I felt like it was
an important thing to try to jump into
jQuery as soon as possible because most
major websites are out are using jQuery
in one way or another and it does make
things so much easier to deal with in a
cross-browser compliant way where if
you're just starting out and you're
trying to go the JavaScript route I
don't think it's a bad idea I really
don't think that there's a right and
wrong answer but if you go the
traditional JavaScript route you know a
new newcomer may end up you know working
on a plugin and then finally they you
know they get it working to the way that
they think they want it and maybe
they're testing in Chrome or something
like that they're probably not going to
be testing on Android and on iOS and you
know not initially anyway or Safari or
Mozilla or ie or edge or whatever you
want to call it and they're gonna
quickly notice once they start doing
that that that there are JavaScript code
isn't cross-browser compliant so it's
it's working in chrome but it doesn't
work in this or this works in that and
it doesn't work in chrome so those are
the the cross browser headaches that I
was kind of referring to when somebody
is just starting out that jQuery is
going to save them a lot of that hassle
when it comes to actually running a
website but you're probably asking if
you want to be
javascript programmer and you want to be
you know cutting-edge and writing
cutting-edge modern JavaScript like
advanced javascript what is the better
solution and in that particular case i
would say that javascript is definitely
the way to go because there's so many
nuances and things in the javascript
language that are very unusual compared
to other programming languages the fact
that javascript can also be considered a
functional languages one where you're
passing in the functions as arguments
and and then there's things like
callbacks
there's prototypical inheritance a lot
of that stuff is going to be well over
the head of the program are just
starting out so it really just depends
on where you want to be I mean do you
want to be a full stack web developer
that has experience in you know Python
and Django or flask and maybe dealing
with a UI library like angular or you'll
react mixed in with some jQuery and
maybe something you know a bit of raw
JavaScript here and there well then in
that case I think that jQuery would
probably be the better option or even
why not just learn you know react if
you're going to be using react react
uses JSX and JSX is unlike anything like
jquery or you know raw JavaScript it's
it's a it's this mixed mash of HTML and
JavaScript into this new language they
call JSX and I'll admit the first time I
ever saw it I hated it I hated it with a
passion the second time I tried to give
it a shot I hated it just as much maybe
not maybe more and then like three
months later the third time I tried I
finally started seeing some of the
advantages of JSX and I realized that it
was actually a pattern that I could you
know get behind and it made my complex
UI development easier so learning raw
JavaScript I would say probably helped a
little bit when it comes to something
like react but react is going to be
completely different than then writing
just raw JavaScript if you're if you're
using JSX
now if you do want to be like I said
cutting edge or even understand you know
how jQuery came to be and how it's
considered or the different module
patterns and things like that for for
modular develop
in JavaScript I think it is going to be
hugely beneficial to to concentrate on
JavaScript more than anything else I
personally think javascript is the most
important language right now and that's
coming from a guy that writes a lot of
c-sharp code for you know full-time
employment and then I also write a lot
of you know Python and I've done some
note and everything else and notice you
know obviously a JavaScript API but I
would say you know right now and where
we are I mean there's a lot of
developers that have a lot of like Java
back-end experience or they have a lot
of c-sharp experience but unfortunately
if you lack a lot of JavaScript
experience you're going to be kind of
limited to what you can do with anything
related to the UI and the UI is very
important we're actually seeing the UI
layer become just as important as the
backend tier and because we now see so
much of the work that used to be done on
the server is now being pushed to the
client everything is you know the
restful api is and client data binding
to your views and stuff like that so for
all those reasons I think javascript is
a extremely important language so I
think you need to ask yourself just I'll
sum this up you ask yourself do you want
to be a JavaScript expert or do you just
need to get a website up and running and
working because if the if the latter is
your goal then I still think that jQuery
would be a good way to go I'm not saying
don't do any JavaScript but just you
know jQuery with you know some
JavaScript knowledge is going to
probably serve you pretty well if you
want to know about all kinds of closures
and like I say modular JavaScript
development you want to create the next
react library the backbone or the
underscores or knockouts or whatever
libraries you want to be involved in
then that's absolutely gonna take a lot
of in depth javascript knowledge and
it's not going to come quick or easily
so if anybody tells you that javascript
is a simple language they're full of
shit I mean to the core because
JavaScript can be very very complicated
and it has like I said nuances that
other languages don't don't have it
doesn't have the you know the brow or
the integrated development environment
support like something like c-sharp or
Java where you can just start stepping
through stuff I mean you can do that in
JavaScript with
Chrome and blade that's almost an
entirely different skill set as far as
how can you utilize browsers to make
your debugging life easier with complex
JavaScript code so anyway guys that's
that's basically my thoughts I don't
think that there is a right and wrong
answer there's going to be people that
give you opinions in either one and
really just ask yourself that I
personally do want to be an expert
JavaScript developer one day and I'm not
there at all
but that's why I am focusing more and
more on in-depth JavaScript code but the
libraries are just as important as well
so you're going to find libraries differ
very very very much from one to the next
and they all take time and attention to
learn so anyway guys that's all I got
today so thank you for watching have a
good day please subscribe bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
