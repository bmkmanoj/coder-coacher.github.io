series I'm going to be looking at the IT
job market for programming related tech
now this isn't a perfect list by any
means but it is some research that I've
been putting together and as this video
series expands month to month I plan on
adding more in-depth features to it but
for right now we just want to look at
essentially the the what the job market
looks like for the top programming
languages that are out there right now
and I'm not sure that this is going to
be too surprising but I guess I was a
little bit surprised by some of the
numbers here as we get into it you'll
understand why I think so starting from
Louis you know lowest amount of jobs
working our way towards the highest we
have pearl developer and indeed com
least 5,000 867 jobs now dice calm is
supposed to be one of the top related IT
jobs websites out there but I may have
to look to replace dice in the coming
months with what different with a
different website basically i found that
dice seem to list way too many jobs for
a given technology p some it compared to
other websites like stackoverflow
careers or indeed com I really feel like
dices numbers might be a little bit
inflated so I'll look into that more but
right now I will mention dice and these
slides so you can see though the two
that really should be looked at the most
would be stack overflow and indeed calm
because they seem to have numbers at
that kind of quick align with what I see
from other websites so we'll incorporate
more in the future but for right now
this is what we have pearl is going to
make the bottom of the list there's
still a decent amount of jobs out there
and these are open job job listings by
the way so companies are looking for
these developers these aren't just how
many jobs exist so these are obviously
there's probably a hundred thousand
pearl developers out there may be more I
don't know but there's currently almost
6,000 jobs available on indeed.com next
one is ruby developer ruby is making its
way towards the bottom of the list now
the problem with ruby is that it's
really
a one-trick pony with its Ruby on Rails
so it's mostly just its web framework
that supplies these jobs but it's still
quite a bit of demand out there if
you're a ruby on rails developer and I
heard rails developers make quite a bit
of money as well just because it's more
of a niche area but currently almost
7,500 jobs on indeed.com and 231 on
Stack Overflow careers next we have PHP
so PHP just barely edges out Ruby which
says a lot considering that PHP still
powers a lot of websites out there it's
not the most popular language when it
comes to like proper language design but
the PHP developers that are out there
they are passionate about their language
and there is quite a bit of opportunity
especially for freelance developers so
we look at about 8500 jobs in 276 on
Stack Overflow the next is going to be
C++ which has a decent amount more than
PHP at 12,000 187 on indeed 207 on Stack
Overflow careers then we have C
developer so C is the grandfather of all
languages still quite a bit of jobs and
see a lot of times when your a/c
developer you're working on other things
but see actually it just barely edges
out over top of C++ which I actually
found surprising I thought that there
would be more C++ jobs and see jobs but
I was wrong about that I mean stack
overflow careers has 180 jobs available
next one is C sharp developer and this
is a relatively big language this is
Microsoft's language it's almost 21,000
jobs available on indeed.com 36,000 on
dice and once again the dice numbers
just don't vary enough for me to be
swayed by their numbers 314 on Stack
Overflow careers now one of the things
with C sharp is they're commonly
referred to as net developers because
net is the run time in the library
system of the Microsoft technology stack
so if you look at dot net developer
there's quite a just a few a few more
jobs on indeed.com and actually less
jobs as dot net developer on Stack
Overflow career so
so that's interesting but they're
they're pretty much the same between
those two the next one and I also found
this somewhat interesting which is
simply the fact that there are fourteen
thousand 139 jobs on indeed and Python
should not be listed ahead of C sharp
I'm sorry that is mistake on my part
Python should be behind c sharp but
ahead of C++ so those are two things
that I am surprised about although there
are more Python developer positions on
stack overflow for Python than there are
for C sharp or C++ next one is Java so
Java you can see there are quite a bit
jobs available almost 40,000 available
open positions 505 foot 515 on Stack
Overflow careers so Java is obviously
ahead of all the other languages that
we've mentioned and then you have
JavaScript which just barely edges out
java for Stack Overflow careers and
still makes a pretty good dent almost
catches Java sorry I'm sorry java on
indeed.com so I did list JavaScript
ahead of Java just just slightly but in
many cases when you're a JavaScript
developer you're expected to know C
sharp or Python or Java or whatever sort
of web stack you're using but you could
argue that Java should be ahead of
JavaScript as well the next one is a
sequel developer so sequel coming in at
the top it wasn't the most on Stack
Overflow careers that that spot is held
by Java but 47,000 positions on
indeed.com now once again seek will
somewhat like JavaScript where like if
you're a sequel developer it doesn't
necessarily mean that you're a DBA like
it so it could just mean that you do
some sequel work or you're using an
object relational mapping to the
framework or even something like Django
is object relational map the thing is
though is if you are a good database
person you should have no trouble
finding a job somewhere there's so much
so many jobs are related to extracting
data reading data storing data so you
know whether it's big data or small
all data or access databases there's
plenty of opportunity for any sort of
sequel developer alright guys so that is
the list and let me know what you think
as far as any sort of recommendations on
what you'd like to see me add in the
future and this is something that I just
want to visit at least once a month or
so alright guys thanks for watching and
please subscribe have a good day bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
