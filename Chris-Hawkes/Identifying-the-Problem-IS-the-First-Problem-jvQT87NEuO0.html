in the life of a programmer tonight I'm
sitting here messing with a programming
problem that it's basically let me
explain the back story a little bit so I
have two different and development
environments I have a Windows
development environment and I use
windows and people are like why to use
Windows well I use windows because I'm
a.net developer and I do a lot of
windows stuff plus let's be honest
ninety percent of the operating systems
out there running on windows so if I'm
doing gaming and like that you know
it's common than I use or a common that
you know that windows will be supported
beyond that though I have to do it for
my job so that being said I do a lot of
Django development on a Windows machine
so if I'm doing local development i'm
not using doc or anything like that
because i'm just i'm working by myself
so i don't really feel like i need to
use docker but I end up developing on
Windows and essentially i have
toggleable features of my website they
say if I'm running locally then use this
database use these connection strings
and all this other stuff and so I have
you know basically two different paths
and luckily I don't have a team of
developers working around me but I have
essentially what i'm doing locally and
then what I'm doing deployed in a
production environment and it's really
weird that I do a production environment
inside of Windows but the you know but
my actual my actual production servers
are on linux operating system so here
are the two differences they're both
running side by side and you can see
that there's really not too much of a
difference there there did if you look
at this one there's no available courses
and then this one there is so those are
the two dif this is the production and
the reason why is because this one is
using a local database and the local
database tonight was given me a problem
where it was saying that these tables
were missing the tutorial tables here
they were missing and django out of the
box has this make migrations where we
used to use this thing called Python or
Django south and it was a separate
project that was maintained by several
people outside of the Django project
in South like it was great when it
worked and when it didn't work
especially as a programmer several years
back were like I knew even less than I
didn't I do now oh my god when what
problems happen like I don't know how
many times I've just deleted my entire
database and started over luckily they
were usually problems at the beginning
and I didn't have any sort of like you
know major database to deal with but I
always found it easier to just delete
the whole entire thing instead of trying
to figure out what the problem was so
tonight I get a little bit of a you know
blast from the past where i get this
same type of error where it's
like this to this table doesn't exist
why doesn't exist ok so i make
migrations and i migrate in it i can see
my tables are being created i have
tutorials and the installed apps and
everything so there's no reason why it
shouldn't work as far as i can tell and
then the error message is vague it's
just well it's not really vague it's
saying that the table at the table
doesn't exist so if I go in and I looked
at my my post crest I could see the
tables don't exist and I'm like well why
the hell is that so you're looking on
Stack Overflow you're looking at all
these different blogs none of them
really applied to what you're trying to
do and even somebody like me with seven
years of experience in programming and
damn near that entire seven years in
Django programming I look at that and
I'm just like oh I'd have no clue
and then that's when I start costing a
little bit and I start getting irritated
because if I can't figure it out I'm
pretty damn sure nobody else on the
internet is gonna be able to figure out
my specific problem because that is the
issue with being a programmer sometimes
your problem is so specific to what you
have going on that you can't even like
it would take you a ton of time to even
explain the problem somebody else and
then by the time you're done explaining
it they'll be like I have no
clue I mean that's just the life of a
programmer it really is and it's the
type of stuff that we have to deal with
day in and day out so the only thing you
can possibly do is to just be positive
and to you try to enjoy the experience
but most of all try to avoid getting
upset and I don't like get upset to the
point where I like a breaking stuff or
punching walls or anything like that but
you know I will eventually be like
this you know like I'll just start
basically mumbling under my breath about
how it doesn't work and you know and I'm
not I what I'm doing that I'm not
actually focusing on what is the issue
so when I was getting this what I
considered a vague error message and it
probably wasn't vague at all but in my
you know state of mind tonight being
tired working all day coming home
getting ready for the holidays whatever
like the error message was not clear as
to what the issue was like I could see
that migrating was perfectly fine i
could see that tutorials was involved
but when i started stepping back and I
looked at it I will never won my tables
don't exist why don't the tables exist
Django is supposed to create the tables
for me when I'm running these make
migrations and you know clearly this
table should have been in place and i'm
looking online for like an hour where it
feels hopeless and it's just when I like
think you know there i'm really not
gonna be able to get it like what am I
going to do maybe start the whole
database over again it comes down to
running so you can see all these
initials and fakes those are things that
we used to do back then but by saying
make migrations and then the actual to
the actual app name force this thing to
create a database entry in a migration
for that particular app I you know I
never used to have to do that for like
if I would have blanked this database
out and started over from scratch I
would want to run make migrations one
time and it would actually create all my
database tables tutorial included so I
don't know what made me think okay let
me just try to specifically give a named
argument to make migrations i just
happen to play with it i didn't even
look at you like the docs or anything
but the thing is is that this is an
unexpected problem but sometimes finding
the actual problem is a problem of its
own you know like there's there's times
where I'm looking at it and I just don't
understand what the problem is so if you
don't understand what the problem is
it's almost hopeless to go out there and
try to search for the answer to some
problem that you don't know what the
problem is like so the first thing you
got to do is just cinch essentially you
know drill down and if the documentation
is shitty then you might have to go into
the source code and try to figure out
what the hell is going
on but unfortunately with something as
large as django and like the the object
relational mapping django uses i'm done
an expert on it and it would take me
forever to try to go into that source
code and try to figure out what the hell
is being done and why i'm getting
certain areas and this particular error
was very easy but i've never had to
explicitly state what app i was trying
to make a migration on but for whatever
reason only on the Windows operating
system which is different from my
production like I said that I had to do
this explicitly in order to solve the
problem and then once you do it like it
seems like everything's fine but there
was just a bit you know those were just
a few issues that i ran into tonight
work for a moment it reminds me and it
takes me back to these places that I get
every now and then and I think every
programmer gets there where you're just
like god damn I don't know how to fix
this apologize any sort of religious
people out there I don't mean the stake
out a lot and the but you get into this
point where you just like I have no idea
how to fix this and then when you get to
a certain level of programming where the
programmers around you you never want to
think that you know they can't solve
your problem sometimes they're going to
be able to see something that you can't
but every once in a while you're just
like you know what I know that they're
not gonna be able to figure out some
sort sort of issue because I'm supposed
to be the expert on this particular area
or this language or framework and if you
don't know it almost feels hopeless
because you know that other people
probably don't know as well and there's
just there's a lot of weight that gets
put on your shoulders especially when
you're looking at multi-million dollar
systems you know things that could
result in lawsuits you never know what
type of stuff you're going to get into
an IT I mean you can be working in
financial industries legal industries
government military we'd all kinds of
different things that could end up you
know putting even more pressure than
just trying to solve a small programming
problem luckily for me tonight this is
just a personal pet project that you
know I run at home and doesn't really
matter but I haven't run the the local
website for this and so
for months and tonight was the first
night I was going to do that and then I
run into this issue and I'm just like
why and I didn't quite see the problem
at first once I saw the problem I didn't
see the solution and then I just kind of
guessed on the solution without even
actually finding any sort of answer or
anything on Stack Overflow that tells me
how to do this so I find it interesting
i'm sure i could have read the
documentation better i'm sure i was
overlooking things but i am not like I
wouldn't consider myself a django expert
like i do Jang go for pet projects and
things like that but I'm not in it day
in and day out so for maybe experience
Django people they probably be lie you
should have known that but whatever I
don't get paid to write Django code so
anyway those are just my thoughts
tonight man if you're in that's that
place and you guys have told me you've
been in that place before as a
programmer we've all been there man and
and when when you're first starting out
you could be there for simple things
like not closing a file or not putting a
semicolon on the end of your statement
or referencing some sort of some sort of
object or attribute on an object that
doesn't exist or something like that you
never know what it's going to be you're
going to get you're going to get these
head-scratching problems that seem so
trivial and so easy and to be honest
with you I don't know that that ever
goes away because I was talking to a
programmer that had been in the industry
for over 20 years the other day and it
was something as trivial as adding a
class to some some markup and honestly
in depending on the day the time the
frame of mind the amount of stuff on
your plate the amount of you know
positive aura that you can give or that
they that you know the state of mind
that you could be and could end up you
know causing one of these things to snag
you and it just happens man it really
does and and the best thing you can do
is just your work through that I would
say as I start maturing as the developer
and I feel like I have a long way to go
but one of the things that I've noticed
that i do now a lot less than i did
before is i will tell myself I'll figure
it out I don't never say that I just
give up you know what I mean like I
never just give up and think that it
not ever going to be something I can
solve I always think that I can solve it
sometimes when I'm when I know I can
solve it i just can't that night it can
drive them crazy i'll spend an extra
hour to maybe trying to debug something
right probably should just taking a
break I'm very stubborn about that type
of thing and I've seen you know other
programmers do that as well where they'd
rather bang their head against the wall
instead of just taking a break stepping
away recharging the batteries coming
back and try to figure out the problem
anyway anyway guys let me know what you
think and thanks for watching this
channel make sure you subscribe make
