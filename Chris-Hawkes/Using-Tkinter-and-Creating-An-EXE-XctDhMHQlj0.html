the second attempt to do the tech enter
video since my last one was jacked up it
wasn't showing what I was typing and I
got that fixed so now let's go ahead and
create a simple hello dot py file which
is going to be our GUI application using
tech enter and all it's going to do is
open up a GUI window and display hello
world
so we'll say from a capital T and then
Kenter import star which means import
everything root equals T Kay open and
closed parenthesis W equals label with a
capital L and then in parenthesis we're
going to say root and text is what we
want it to say on the screen so we'll
say hello world and then W dot pack I'm
still learning what all this crap means
to be honest with you I don't like I'm
going to get all into this later on but
these are standard things you have to do
including the root main loop which means
I'm keep the the program open otherwise
it would close like immediately once you
run it so that root main loop keeps it
into a constant loop so the GUI doesn't
closed on you all right so that's all
there is to the hello world application
and I'm saving it to my training
directory like I've done in all these
tutorials under my C colon projects
training alright so now we're going to
be using a program called a PI to exe
it's not a program but it's like a
Python module that you have to install
and you can use that you can use them so
they have like standard Microsoft
install files which I've already posted
links to the video and I'll make sure
it's going to be in the summary of the
video there's going to be one for Python
to six and one for Python to seven
hopefully you're using one of the two
both for 32-bit systems even though I
have a 64-bit system I tend to use
32-bit systems or at least 32-bit Python
just because there's really you know
they can do everything that the 64 can
and it's
there's better support still for 32-bit
systems especially like when you're
trying to find an older module or
something you'll find a lot of them you
know work for 32-bit but 64-bit you know
there's some sort of problem or they
don't work so I got sick of dealing with
that so I just basically said you know
when we use Python 2 7 32 bit or Python
2 6 32-bit so that's why I do that but
anyway let's go over to once you install
the PI to exe you can then use it so
we're going to create a setup file using
PI 2 XC and we need to go ahead and
number one import from this doodles I
can't really say that but it's spelled
like that import I'm sorry I'm so sick
or I always forget that import setup and
then import PI 2 uxc so you want to make
sure you install that and then all we're
going to do is just one simple command
setup and then in parenthesis we're
going to say console equal and then like
the list bracket we're going to say
hello dot py so what we're going here
when we say hello Tuppy why we're giving
it the path to the hello file that we
want to turn into any XE so let me pull
this up here so you guys can see this so
under my sequel projects train
you know I put things under my hello
all right put I made a tick enter
directory I don't know if you guys know
do as well because I got a lot of other
stuff going on the training directory
right now
Saturday morning good few years matters
but you can see the two files I just
created here hello and set up so I'm
sent some hello and or I'm sorry I said
setup is in the same directory as hello
that's why we only have to just say
hello dot py otherwise I could learn
like training I'd say four words I'd say
forward slash projects forward slash
training hello dot py but so since it's
in the same directory we don't have to
give it any sort of more specific path
so let's run it and then let's go ahead
and get into the program directory so
I'm getting in this tick enter now I'm
going to say let's say python
and then the name of the program so
setup py web - I went out like a pie -
yech see I think this is right
yeah I was like okay I guess on that one
alright so um it's going to do a bunch
of crap like this
another we did that when we go in and we
do the directory we can see that we now
have two directories created for us
there's a dist which I'm assuming stands
for distribute and then build the build
is like a working directory so you can
make changes to it and won't break to
distribute its kind of so you can edit
your your your files everything after
the exe has been created but you can
delete the entire thing - it doesn't
doesn't matter so we go in here you can
see all these files here I'm going to
show you a trick here to get essentially
one exe file so when you're distributing
this you know exe file you unfortunately
have to distribute all of this crap in
order to make it work because it's got
to import the Python modules and all
that stuff so when you're distributing
it has to have all this this crap in
here so I'm going to show you guys just
a little trick to get it a little bit
smaller to distribute but let's go and
double click on our exe application
which is hello
my computer's thinking it's apparently
having a hard time
there you go you bloody bastard all
right so I clicked it twice but here it
is on the GUI application so you can see
simple hello world point printer screen
and a GUI based system we also could
have if I um I could have just run the
hello I probably should just showed you
guys how load up you why I'm so you can
see that this is the way to Kenter
program ran without it being an exe file
so it runs the exact same way now one of
the things I want to show you is I'm
going to copy and paste this coding
because I actually just found it online
so we can replace the entire contents of
the setup file and we should probably
use this now what it does it's systems
dot argument append its appending PI to
X C so all you have to do is just say
Python and then the name of whatever
program you're running to make the exe
so in this case it's setup fpy so all we
have to say python setup wy and then it
appends this PI to exe it's just a
time-saver you don't have to do that if
you don't then you would have to do the
full thing like we just stay where it's
at Python setup that py space PI to exe
so that's just an optional thing now
this setup here is a tuple and insided
you can give basically I guess
configurations and I'm in here under the
options you probably just want
copy/paste code because once again I'm
actually going to learn this whole thing
myself but when you create a zip file
you just say you wanna make sure it says
none and then by giving it this bundle
files option 3 I tried bundle files one
where it only creates one exe file and
unfortunately that doesn't work
apparently there's some sort of bug or
something but if you do bundle files 3
there's there's three options I'm not
gonna get all three of them but one is
supposed to only create an exe files who
I think just excludes like the Python
files or something and then 3 includes
the Python but it does simplify the
output here so let me
just give you a quick demonstration of
that we'll get rid of both of these
directories that are just created and
then we will just go in here let's run
this and we'll say same thing we set up
like I said last time except we don't do
that pi to exe because remember we're
appending it to the system argument so
python instead of wy and it's running at
the exact same way well different
actually but it's similar to what we
have and didn't take as long and then
when you go to the distributive rectory
you can see we have a little bit less
stuff unfortunately these details need
to be included and hopefully they work
out the bug which you probably want to
count on it but you know it did
hopefully they work it out but anyway so
this is a similar directory you could
change it the change name of instead of
it being disks we could say you say cow
balls and then you can run it the same
way so just click on it so you don't
have to name and distribute or dist or
whatever just some name of cow balls
naming your mom staying suit you know
whatever it doesn't matter so whatever
the name of the program you want it to
be called and then any people are you
know you tend to see this I mean when
you get like a new game or something you
see all this stuff you know you're
you're looking for uh setup py witching
they probably want an image set up that
py instead of a hello if it's going to
install or something I will don't
actually know if we'll get into installs
later but yeah whatever you know
whatever so if this was like a game it
would say you know Sims or something
like that I would know oh yes and let me
click on that and you'd have a little
picture of a stem you know so yeah it's
not uncommon you have all this extra
stuff but it would be nice if you didn't
have to but you know we're kind of
dealing with limitations I guess sort of
the modules that are available to us and
to be honest with you when it comes to
Windows forms applications I mean I
think that I mean obviously if you're
going to be developing for Windows I
mean you'd have to take a pretty strong
located Visual Studio and and on the
c-sharp language but
you know I'm personally a big fan of
Python but I do plan on getting into the
c-sharp and you actually I want to try
to create a nice looking forms
application in Windows using Visual
Studio and c-sharp and then also within
that program it would be cool to call
some Python you know exe s that I could
I like bundle up and include into the
Microsoft install directories just
because they do a better job of like
packaging up the setups and stuff like
that so that's something I may end up
looking into and I'm not sure but like I
said I mean I'm loyal to Python but
there's always every programming
language has its strengths and strengths
and weaknesses and you know I think feel
like when it comes to a Windows GUI
based system I mean probably can't get
any better than then C sharp and
microsoft.net all right well anyway I'm
gonna go ahead and kill this video guys
thank you and please subscribe and
hopefully you can rate the video to
hopefully it's a good rating or don't
bother hopefully and that's it talk to
you guys later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
