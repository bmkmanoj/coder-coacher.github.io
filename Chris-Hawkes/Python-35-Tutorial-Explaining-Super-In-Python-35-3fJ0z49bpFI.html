we talked about multiple class
inheritance before that we talked about
class inheritance and then we talked
about classes before that the third
video or this is the fourth video
actually is about the super keyword and
the super keywords a little bit
confusing in Python it's been confusing
for decades now and it's going to
continue to be confusing as we move into
the future it's just something that's
confusing with Python if let's take a
look at this code that we have here we
have class a and then the object you
don't don't worry about that that's
referring to itself it doesn't it
doesn't mean anything it's not
inheriting from any other classes class
B is defined here so there's no class
inheritance going on these are just two
separate classes and then we have Class
C that is using multiple class
inheritance which it's inheriting from a
and B and then in inside the classes
themselves you have the I Nate method
right and this is an important method in
Python it's it can be seen as like the
constructor method and something like
c-sharp or if you've ever done any sort
of programming like that but it's it's
code that's executed when the object is
created so if we run this code and the
interesting thing to note with multiple
class inheritance since we're creating
an object of C which is right down here
the only I knit that's going to be
called even though C inherits from all
these other classes and the only one
it's going to be called is going to be
this one right here so let's go ahead
and run this real quick so we can get a
look at this and you can see the only
thing that got called the only ein it
was with C so a lot of the times though
you don't want that to happen you're
like oh I need I need execution code and
the parent class to be executed even
though I have a class that's inheriting
from that parent class so it's a common
thing and and that's where the super
keyword comes in so I can say you know
what I want the base class I need to be
called before my I knit by using the
super keyword or I can even do that I
can call it even after but in this
particular case we're going to do it
before so before this is our execution
stuff now obviously it's a simple print
statement but in most real cases you're
going to have a lot
stuff I mean including maybe database
calls and who knows what whatever sort
of complexity your product your program
has now let's go ahead and use this new
super keyword and by the way this has
changed in the Python 3 series
especially pertaining to this tutorial
series of Python 3.5 but you used to
have to pass in arguments to the super
keyword you no longer have to do that a
lot of people don't seem to know that so
anyway we have I knit and you're calling
super with no arguments and then that's
it just open and close parentheses so
what we're saying is super refers to the
parent class the parent base class and
the reason why it's important is because
you don't have to actually explicitly
call you know class a I'm it for the
execution to take place without having
to refer to the base class by name you
can just simply use the super keyword
which doesn't which it just it allows
things to be not so explicitly typed out
so verbose and it's just a benefit here
so when we do this this is now gonna say
you know what before I call my own I
knit you know stuff well technically I
knit was called but it says before I do
all this crap call the parent and run it
sign it code first and then continue
with your execution so if I rerun this
program you can see over here that first
was called then third so even if I step
through it you can see sees called it
calls super so that's why first gets
printed then it continues with its
execution and calls three and it carries
on its way so you're gonna see a super
keyword a lot whenever you start getting
into more advanced complicated Python
programming code which has to do with
object orientation and any sort of large
systems the object oriented programming
becomes very difficult
and python has a lot of flexibility with
the way objects are inherited from each
other and the fact that you can use
things like the super keyword to call
the base class and stuff like that so
it's an interesting feature it's
probably something that you're not gonna
use a whole lot most like I said you
unless you're doing like Enterprise
programming or writing some more
complicated Python applications you're
really most likely not going to see this
a whole lot at least that's my opinion
anyway because I've managed to program
in Python for quite some time without
having to resort to the super keyword
alright guys thanks for watching please
