video I want to go ahead and style our
our desktop navigation and the same way
that our mobile navigation is style to
basically use this same gray style so
that we can have this like a gray bar
above our application so we're going to
go ahead and do that now let me close
some of these files that I don't need
open so here's our base one dot HTML so
we're gonna do it inside the standard
now so see if we can do that now so
standard nav is gonna be sorry I got way
too many things of them just closing
them right now
so here's our main dot CSS so standard
now give it a height of about 100 pixels
I think color of pound ffffff for white
fontsize background and we'll go ahead
and update that we want to take the
standard nav
we want these out list items to
display:inline similar to what we did
with the footer actually you want to go
margin adjustment make it a width make a
width of what a hundred and fifty pixels
maybe text-align:center and let's see
what that gives us
all right it looks ungodly
let me see it's that's way too big
I'm going to copy this here because the
anchor tag itself needs to be white
needs to explicitly be stated that it
should be white and then this the height
is way too big it should probably just
be like 30 pixels I think
it's probably too small but you know
what before I go and change this again
I'm just gonna do this in here and see
what 50 pixels looks like
okay and then we need need to work on
these li elements that don't seem to be
working playing very well with each
other so it should be
display:inline-block their line height
should be the same height as their
parent which is 50 pixels so that way
it's kind of centered in the middle we
definitely want the text decoration to
be none
really I want a bigger font size font
size should be at least 18 pixels
and then we may want to put a border on
our li I'm not a hundred percent sure
this is gonna look all right or not but
then we'll really just border right some
border right then solid black
okay
and I think I can live with that so it's
good and um copy these styles over here
we'll make some adjustments here in a
moment
so this we're going to do first child
and this is a new CSS thing so that way
we can do the border on the left-hand
side of it so it won't look weird so
this will be border left
so let's merged that up and see what we
got going on here now we forgot to
change the height of the nav back to 50
all right so there we go I definitely
don't like what we got going on on this
one here with
all right the reason why we have this
little gap here is we need to remove the
padding from the UL and the header
so just say padding:0
all right so now we have that going on
it's pretty good and then once we rink
down you can see our alternate menu then
pops up with similar styles and stuff
like that
okay I want to end up changing the font
size to this from 15 to like I think
it's on 15 I'm not sure
they're probably 18 pixels I think
we also need a hamburger icon here
because this toggle menu is like very
unintuitive and everything so it's not
gonna not gonna fly well at all but now
here's the start of our basic responsive
navigation so we're making good progress
I think so let's go ahead and continue
on in the next video
all right guys talk to you later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
