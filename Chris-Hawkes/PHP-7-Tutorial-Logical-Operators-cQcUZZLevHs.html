fifth video of the learning PHP
programming tutorial series for hipster
code comm and the last video we looked
at arrays and how we can add values to
an array take values from an array in
this video we want to look at logical
operators how do we loop through every
element of the array to display an
element one at a time and what we do is
we is a for each conditional operator
and we say for each in the first
argument is the actual array itself
which is a little bit backwards compared
to a lot of languages out there but we
actually say for each value and then we
say adds and it can be as value or it
can be anything you want to say this is
arbitrary it can be anything but it's
the name of a variable that we want to
reference so we're going to say echo
that arbitrary value
so if we go ahead and pull this up you
can see that listed it looked throughout
every element in the array and it
printed it so if we want to actually
have better spacing let's go ahead and
add the newline character so we're gonna
do a string concatenation like we did
before and we're adding a newline
character onto it and by doing that we
now have you know prettier format of
where it lists every single element
followed by a new line now the for each
loop in a pot in a programming language
is never quite as fast as a typical for
loop so in PHP there is a typical for
loop that you can do which is very
similar to other programming languages
NEC based language and you say for and
then you define a variable you say x
equals 0 and make sure there's a
semicolon there then you say X is less
than or equal to and then you need to
have a value so if we know the amount of
elements in our array we could say 4 and
we'll say X plus plus so what we're
doing is we're actually going through
and we're telling it while X is less
than 4 increase the value of X and then
we can just simply say X our echo and
we'll say crazy array and then we can
reference X as the index number
and it will print the actual value of
the element so you can see it's actually
doing all of them again we should do
some string concatenation to make it a
little prettier so we can say plus new
line and that'll make it a little
prettier it's still going to run into a
problem though and the reason why is
because it says undefined offset so what
happened was is that because everything
starts counting at zero we need to say
if it equals less than or equal to three
go ahead and stop and we're not going to
get the error message anymore because
member starts 0 1 2 3 we said 4 and it
looked for a fourth element in the array
and it didn't exist and that's why it
threw the error so that's going to be
the faster way to loop through but a lot
of times you're like well what happened
then I have to know the length of the
array every time that I you know I want
to do that method so instead of saying
less or equals 3 it's probably better to
say use the sizeof key function and PHP
and then you pass in the actual array
that you're looking at so you can simply
say if it's if it's less than the actual
size of the array loop sir that way you
don't have to know in advance how big
the array is now one of the things that
the sizeof does which is really weird is
that the sizeof is going to return the
elements in the array not counting 0 so
you would actually have to say less than
1 in order to make that make that work
so that could be it seems rather hawkish
but that's ultimately just the way
things are they so you're going to see
that it's still going to be better to
shorthand it and just say you know what
just you know move remove one since we
know that it starts counting at 1
instead of 0 when you're actually trying
to get the size of the array next we're
going to look at the if and else
statement inside PHP so if we say if
crazy array and then we're going to give
it these 0 index so we're gonna say grab
the first element equals bayside
and we'll say echo holy crap so if the
first element equals bass I which it
does it should echo the statement holy
crap and you can see that it does now
what if I said if it equals crap it's
not going to equal any it's not going to
equal that so it's not going to do
anything so that's why you're going to
see in programming languages a lot
you're going to see else echo your mom
so you're gonna see the else condition
was was hit because it didn't match and
the else path was taken so basically the
if-else is a fork in the road do you go
to the left or do you go to the right
alright guys so that covers logical
operators inside PHP that you're going
to run into day in and day out if you
have any questions feel free to leave a

have a good day thank you for watching
