need to go ahead and we need to install
this joker so we're gonna go to the
meteor website click on install and
since I'm on Windows and you don't have
to be on Windows a lot of people don't
like it but I have to use Windows
because I need to be able to remote into
my actually you know what I use Windows
because I'm used to it but I also have
to use it for work so anyway I'm using
Windows 8.1 you can use whatever you
want but since I'm on Windows it has
this nice little installer that we're
gonna use so I'll click on that and then
as a bad gateway that's not cool no
there it goes
now I downloaded to alright so hopefully
hopefully the rest of the meteor website
works better than that but here we go
we're gonna go ahead and install this
thing now you're gonna need to have
MongoDB installed on your machine so
while we're waiting on this what you
need to do is go to mama DB and click on
the first link and if you're on Windows
there's going to be a download and
MongoDB installer so you can go ahead
and get all that set up once you have
MongoDB set up I've only used it a few
times in the past so I'm not a very big
expert but what I do is I create a data
folder under my C Drive here and then
inside the data folder there's a DB
folder and then here is actually these
are all MongoDB databases so when we
create a database that's going to show
up inside of here at least that's the
plan
now in order to actually start your
MongoDB you have to start the mom god
which is a really weird name but Mongo
dee executable file which actually
starts your MongoDB server so your mama
DB is a database just like any sort of
sequel database like my sequel or sequel
server or whatever they all need to be
running in order for you to be able to
interact with it so you have to go to
where MongoDB is installed I think mine
is under Program Files but I'm not a
hundred percent sure there's been a
while okay here it is down here MongoDB
and then under server I'm going to 3.0
going
to bend and then this is as manga Exe
file do I have to actually run in order
to start the server in fact we'll go
ahead and do that now just for craps and
gigs so go to control not control panel
but go to command prompt and then we're
gonna CD all up in that joint
so he's base MongoDB and that's not even
the right place oh wait we're in
projects or no Program Files he Program
Files she's based MongoDB C space server
C space 3.0 and C space Bend and then we
can just say mom god exe or just say mom
god doesn't matter now if everything
goes well and I'm going off of memory
this thing will start up and it's
actually you know waiting for
connections on port 2 7 0 1 7 which is
probably the default port for MongoDB I
haven't changed any of those settings so
anyway that is how you start your mama
DB server so you heard it here first
alright we're still waiting for this
thing to install it's taking forever
alright so it looks like it's finally
been installed if you're running Windows
8.1 you may need to restart your machine
I hope not okay alright so let's go
ahead and we're gonna start with just
the tutorial here just see if we get an
actual application set up here and we I
want to go ahead and point out the fact
that a meteor has something called blaze
which is like their whole UI framework
but a lot of people actually are kind of
turned off to meteor handling the UI
framework they're more interested in
like more modern projects they're not
really modern but real popular projects
like react JavaScript which is made by
the Facebook guys that's gaining a lot
of steam and that's actually something
that I would prefer prefer to do myself
so here's this you have these to-do apps
and you have like the regular to-do app
and with angular and we react react I'm
gonna go with react now just because I
like it and if you haven't checked out
react you should definitely check it out
it's pretty cool alright so next so
first we need to do when you go ahead
and create the app and and
put it in the location where we want to
put it so let's go ahead and create a
new command prompt item and I like to
put my projects under the projects
directory my C Drive so I have all these
projects here I'll go ahead and make a
directory and we'll call this meteor so
I'll just have an entire meteor folder
which will have all my meteor projects
in it and then now let's go ahead and
woah alright so we'll say paste trophy
dammit it's not working I want to copy
this paste so meteor create simple tool
simple to do is react so let's just go
through and see if we can get this
working on our machine meteor is not
recognized as an internal or external
command that sucks alright so what we
probably need to do then is it probably
means that meteor is not added to our
environment variable so let's go ahead
and and see if we can add that so in
order to add it to the path what we need
to do is we need to actually go to this
location where it's your username app
data local meteor so really if you just
copied this value right here in place it
in here this will show you this meteor
batch file and that's actually what
needs to be gained access to so what we
need to do is we need to add this to our
path and in Windows we're gonna go ahead
and right-click go on control panel go
under system and security and then click
on system then click on advanced system
settings then go to environment
variables and we're gonna edit the path
of our user here so go to edit go to the
end it looks like it's already there so
I'm not sure that's probably part of the
reason why I need to restart I can also
down at it to the system path down here
so I'm going to do that as well make
sure there's a semicolon after the
latest thing and then just paste that in
there I'd put a semicolon after it too
just in case press okay we're going to
close out the environment very
let's go ahead and close this command
prompt and we'll open up another one and
then let's go ahead just tighten meteor
all right so now meteor is found it can
do something that's good so let's go
back into the project directory that we
just created projects meteor and now I
need to go here and copy this and we'll
paste it
all right so it looks like it created
the project for us let's open up a file
explorer just to view the contents of
that folder
all right so this is all the stuff that
I created for us a CSS file an HTML file
and a JavaScript file now we need to
open up some sort of editor that we plan
on using I'm gonna use Visual Studio it
doesn't matter what sort of editor you
want whatever you write code and just go
ahead and use that you just need some
sort of syntax highlighting that works
with JavaScript all right so if you're
using visual studio which is a free
option it's definitely not something
that you have to do but it can be a
little bit daunting I think for
beginners too there's a lot of stuff for
you when it comes to actually writing
code especially if you're doing like
dotnet and c-sharp stuff but we're not
gonna be doing any of that here so this
might be overkill for you so hopefully
you don't let the editor itself deter
you from what we're trying to do but I'm
actually just opening a website so
basically it opens it as almost like a
project in Visual Studio so that I can
access all the files from Visual Studio
without having to use Explorer and such
so let's go ahead and open that up real
quick all right so here now I can access
all these files you have this meteor
folder and then this is just simple CSS
file with nothing in it and then one of
the good things about editor is like
when I click on it I have you know nice
syntax highlighting and stuff like that
so that's what I like about it
alright so following along with the
tutorial here that's go ahead and test
this out and see if it works so we need
to actually go into succeeding into the
tutu's app that we just created all
right and then we just type meteor and
that's actually going to run the
built-in server server that it has it'll
tell you what port it's listening on so
we're going to need to open up a browser
if this if your firewall stuff hits you
up I'm just allow access it's fine
alright and it's still thinking so it's
firing up everything
I'm assuming when it's done here it's
gonna tell me what port it's listening
on in the meantime let's go ahead an
open up a browser while we're waiting
it's gonna be on some sort of local host
address so you're gonna do localhost and
then colon and it's gonna be a number
whatever sort of port is listening to
all right so it's actually listening on
port 3000 so let's go ahead and pull
that up and that's wrong and it's three
hundred so three thousand
all right so it's just a basic meteor
app now running and it counts how many
times you click it and when you refresh
it since it's not stored anywhere this
is all just existing inside the client
browser so it's considered to be non
persistent or or stateless so if we
wanted to kill the server which we do
just press ctrl C and then terminate all
right guys so now that we have this
working meteor app installed and it's
running and we've confirmed that it's
running and everything I think that's
good progress here to end this second
video and we're gonna try to get deeper
into this in the following videos all
right thanks for watching have a good
day and bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
