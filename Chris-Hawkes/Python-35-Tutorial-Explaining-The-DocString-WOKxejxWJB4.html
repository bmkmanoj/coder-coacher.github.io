talking about object-oriented
programming in Python 3.5 and we're
getting into a lot of the core object
oriented nature of the language itself
and what I want to discuss now is the
doc string and Python the doc string
dates back to the original
implementation of the language and it's
all about documenting your code similar
to other keywords in Python that we've
seen the likeéi init method which is
really their constructor method of an
object and then you have this doc the
underscore underscore doc underscore
underscore and what that's supposed to
do is it's supposed to be able to print
out information on what a method is
supposed to do so ultimately every
object or every class and every method
on that class should have its own doc
string in Python and one of the weird
things for me coming from c-sharp is
that instead of actually documenting
above your class the standard to use for
documentation with python is actually do
it under the class or under or inside of
the you know method definition so let me
give you an example and just in case I
haven't touched on this in the past
there's two ways of doing commenting and
python comments or for your own personal
code and it's ignored by the Python
interpreter when the program is run the
this is the standard way so just using
the pound sign and then anything after
that is the standard way and then you
have the multi-line comment where this
can range multiple lines and go like
that so I'm sure I've already covered
that if I haven't that's those are the
two ways you comment code now with the
doc string there's a third way under the
class definition you would do triple
quotes and you can see that the editor
actually has it in a different color so
it can be multiple lines it doesn't
matter but it has it in a gray matter
instead of the green that you saw before
because it is a different type this is
something that only the doc string can
reference so this is a this this
explains what the class does
now the important thing to note is that
you're not supposed to go into detail
into how the class operates and how it
works it's about what what it does and
the same thing with every one of these
definitions inside these these methods
that you have inside of your function
this can just be this is the net and
then we'll go ahead and on down here on
the second one we'll do it actually I'm
in the habit of doing it on top and it's
down below which is weird for me this is
what it does now that's a terrible thing
obviously you'd want to give it some
sort of explanation of what this thing
does but you can see it doesn't do
anything it just passes now in order for
the end user to be able to access that
they can actually say okay here's my
object and I can get information about
and method on that object by saying my
object dot and then the name of the
method so second method and then I just
have to say underscore underscore doc
underscore in fact what I want to do is
probably wrap this in a print statement
so you guys can see what this thing
actually prints off so we'll go ahead
and run this and you can see that this
is what it does so we could do the same
thing on the actual class object itself
we don't have one on the sea I put one
on the a
so you can see it shows up now alright
guys so that's really all there is to it
now I will go ahead and cite this
example on the web here and you can see
how docstrings can get very very
detailed into how something-something
works here so you can see this is a like
right here is a pretty large docstring
so you're gonna see a lot of that yeah
that's really it guys so if you have any
questions regarding that just leave a
comment and please subscribe thanks for
watching have a good night bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
