to show you guys how to install Postgres
and set it up for Windows Windows has a
basic installer that's going to have
everything you need and it's probably
best when you do go to the install page
right here if you go down to download
you're gonna want to get the your latest
stable release so version 9 4 or 5 is
probably the best version at this point
and I'm gonna grab the 32-bit version it
doesn't really matter I have a 64-bit
operating system but typically my Python
development is done a 32-bit so I'm just
going to keep my database there as well
this is going to go ahead and download
the install that we're gonna run as soon
as it's done all right so after that
downloads go ahead and just go ahead and
run it in fact I just double clicked on
you're gonna need to run it as an
administrator if you're on Windows 8.1
it's gonna prompt you with this which is
essentially the same thing but if you're
on Windows 7 you may have to right-click
on the actual executable and run as
administrator
all right so we'll go ahead and go
through this setup wizard' we're going
to put it under Program Files like it
like it wants to do and continue to just
click Next through all of this this is
where you're going to want to set up
your actual admin password
and go ahead and use the default port so
you don't have any sort of confusion and
I'm gonna change my locale to English
United States since that's where I'm
currently located which I probably will
continue to be located for a long time
can't imagine myself leaving at this
point and we'll go through the next and
it's going to take just a few minutes
here to install everything
all right so once this is done this is
gonna actually try to promote its stack
builder tool which is an optional thing
and most people probably don't want it I
certainly don't want it so I'm gonna
uncheck that and just click finish and
now if everything went well let's go
ahead and since we're on Windows 8.1
let's go and search for Postgres and
unfortunately if you're on Windows 8 one
I still missed Windows 7 that I can't
just like look at my installed programs
but when we go to search what we're
actually looking for is a PG admin which
is a part of what was installed for us
that can be thought of as the PHP
myadmin for my sequel which is hugely
important or the hell I can't remember
what it's called but I'm sequel server
has something similar as well but it's
just a console it's a GUI console to be
able to manage your servers and stuff
like that all right so located on the
left hand side here you're gonna see the
Postgres 9.4 and this is the localhost
address so it should be the default port
that it asked you for so that just means
that the server is running so if we
actually wanted to go into this server
we would just double click on it and
it's going to prompt you for the
password that you just created and then
now you can actually see that we're into
that database server which is gonna list
all the databases that we have on it
which we currently don't have any so
what we're gonna do here is we're
actually gonna create a database name
and we're gonna assign it it's gonna
have just a default role which is your
Postgres role and you can see here if we
actually go under login roles and we
double click on Postgres you can see
that it is a super user so ideally we
could use something like our Django
application and then just be able to log
right in as the super user which is what
I plan on doing here so let's go over
under databases and if we right click we
can say if we have a database to select
it right click and say new database and
then here we're gonna give it a name so
I'm gonna call it new movies since
that's the name of the website that I'm
going to be using and then the owner I'm
just gonna assign it to the super user
which is Postgres and then just play it
click OK
and it's gonna take just a few moments
here all right so now you can see that
we Newton we now have a new database
table or an entire database I'm sorry
and if we wanted to add tables to it we
could do that but we're going to get
into that in a different video this
video is just about how to install
Postgres on windows 8.1 and create a
database if you wanted to create user
roles you can do that you would just do
the same thing right-click create the
role name and stuff like that you can
assign roles to a particular database
and more documentation is available on
that online but this like I said is just
kind of a straight to-the-point video on
how to install and get your first
database setup with Postgres cool
alright guys thanks for watching and
please subscribe have a good day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
