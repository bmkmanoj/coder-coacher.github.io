everybody who was positive over the last
couple days on these videos I just had
to put it and put some videos out there
honestly like the there are some stuff
that I've been doing on this YouTube
channel and people talk about what I can
do and what I can't do and all this
stuff and like and and and it's funny
because like you know I've been thinking
about it since since Jump Street really
like I've known from Jump Street what I
could do with my channel and what the
benefits are and things like that it's
not like I'd ever want to walk away from
YouTube I really don't but I also as a
content creator have to kind of speak up
a little bit when you know YouTube
starts doing some stupid stuff that is
affecting people and it really is and
and it boils down to their algorithm is
just not it's not working very well
right now so maybe I should give them a
pass just the update in case anybody's
interested cause I'm not gonna doing
more videos on it but you know YouTube
has come back and they basically said on
every one of the videos they're like
yeah it's no problem but I don't know
man
I shouldn't have to like wait for videos
to go through their little you know
algorithm check before I actually post
them you know so normally I'll create a
video and post it right away and and
sometimes I'll have it scheduled out but
either way like I don't I don't normally
check all that so it's like normally you
have to kind of put the video in it well
it seems like if the algorithms gonna
continue to be a problem then you have
to put it in like a holding container
where like you know normally I would
release it right away but I have to wait
like two or three days to try to figure
out whether or not it's gonna be a
problem and try to address the problem
before I release it at least that's kind
of the plan I could have going forward
but dude there's no question man like
I've always looked at the YouTube
channel and and the success that I've
had here and the thing and the things
that I I feel like I've done well and
I've looked it's really just through
trial and error like okay the tutorials
like some of the tutorials I've had are
very bad but some of them are very good
my Python tutorial is being used in
computer science courses and the UK
Europe I know the Europe is a UK's part
of Europe but I consider the island a
little bit separate but either way like
there's there's computer science courses
and the actual college computer science
courses that are using my my Python
tutorial series and you know what it's
in and even that dude that that's being
used for free I'm not getting any money
on that the only thing I get is
credit if they end up using some of my
tutorials or whatever then they they
have to cite the reference but
apparently that's the only thing I get
out of it but you know what that's fine
with me because like I said before I'm a
programmer man programmers make pretty
good money now we always want more money
but that's just our you know greed
talking and things like that so I'd like
to keep things humble if I can and and
with you know the fact that these
tutorials are being used in the UK I
think it's absolutely like like dude
that's just awesome like it really is so
what have I been working on man right
now what I'm working on is I'm gonna be
making some changes to hipster code I
have not started on that yet I'm working
with somebody else on that but
eventually there's gonna be some work
that's gonna be done to hipster code I'm
probably gonna end up creating my own
platform as well I'm not like YouTube
platform nothing like that but but
something to I guess you know kind of Co
align the channel with a website
basically so I say that because the
hipster code the like you know even the
name of the domain I'm not you know
hundred percent yeah I was I was never
sold on it but like hipster is a very
common term in the IT world and encode
like if you'd find me a domain that is
actually available that I can buy for a
reasonable price like $15 which is what
most domains go for per year and and let
me know if you can find one that
actually makes more sense to than
hipster code you know that has two words
that's it no more than two words like
your domain should be two words it
should probably be about eight
characters or less mine's more than that
but either way like that was the best
that I could do and the thing is is
there a certain there's certain domain
names like that are just bought up you
know like you can't do much where they
say so that's kind of the reason why I
went with with hipster Co but now
hipster code like I ended up hiring some
writers and I had writers writing for me
I had the tutorials on there I started
integrating some like certificate type
of thing the thing that I think is a
problem for me is that I don't want to
go through all the effort that I went
through with hipster code right now
because I know that any sort of platform
that I create isn't gonna be really any
it's really not gonna be worth anything
and
never be worth anything and it's gonna
take a tremendous amount of effort and
everything to do that so it's like the
question really boils down okay if I'm
gonna change hipster code like maybe I
should just change the entire direction
all together because you know selling
tutorial selling you know quizzes
certificates things like that and none
of that stuff has actually worked out
you know well enough for me to want to
continue that so I think there's
definitely things that I can do and
there's things that I've learned along
the way that are gonna be really helpful
forward now as far as like the whole
sponsor a lot of you guys think I'm
bitching about about the money and all
this stuff but I'm really not
Deb mountains gone but there are other
sponsors I've been working with I've
worked with people like Tech Smith that
created Camtasia site one two three at
onyx that obviously in that mountain for
for over a year and and there's other
other other boot camps that could be
working with there's there's there's
product companies like all the time
Sammy products and things like that they
want me to mention on my channel for
free and I try to tell them like no I'm
not gonna do that for free because I'm
charging other sponsors money to be
putting your product in front of people
it's like if I was just gonna do that
for free number one I'd be spamming you
guys which I'm not gonna do and number
two like why wouldn't I just put my own
product up there you know so it's like a
lot of people want me to join their
platforms and things like that so that I
can make a commission base like it's all
Commission based that way a company
never loses money but what I like to do
is have a flat fee Deb mountain was
paying me a flat fee for their promotion
other other companies that I've worked
with like TechSmith
Edwin excite one two three template
monster those guys they paid flat fees
and some of them I'm not going to
mention specifically but some of them
were more difficult than others to work
with and it became a problem for me
because here's the thing like a lot of
people want me to help them in their
business and things like that but dude I
have to make at least $100 an hour for
this to be worth it I really do so if
people are asking me to redo promotional
little you know snippets and things like
that it's a no-go for me man it's a
no-go so I'm easier
I have I'm better off just using
Google's monetization because honestly
like hardly anybody and the few that do
donate to the pay of patreon in fact let
me go ahead and mention that so here are
the few and the proud and supporters of
this channel and honestly big shout out
to everybody here David lipnick's at
Luther Curtis flurry Rodrigo Sosa
Michael McKay Blair and Adagio so if any
of you guys did it like everyone of you
I recognize your names and definitely
yeah in a dive I get dodd like he's he's
been on my channel as long as I
remember I think as long as I've had a
channel I it's hard to remember but you
know he's just like I can't picture a
time where he wasn't involved in my
channel and and he's donating a dollar
every a dollar every month so I mean
it's just like it's it's something that
he hasn't retracted like and right now I
have a few people that that are donating
and I've had a lot more in the past and
and I you know people drop off and I
understand all that so it it perfectly
find you but it but definitely thank you
to you guys I mean that is you guys do
not have to do that and I would not hold
it against you if you guys way through
that money you guys know that I'm not
like literally feeding my family off of
the few dollars I'm getting off a
patreon but that said like the the nice
gesture of doing this I mean that do
that speaks volumes it really does it
does so if any of you guys that have
ever donated to me whether it's it's
PayPal because a lot you guys have
donated PayPal as well any one of you I
have a list and everything so feel free
to reach out to me at any time dude
seriously I will get back to you that's
just you guys have my email if not leave
a comment I'll give you my email but you
know definitely make sure you you guys
are reaching out to me if you have any
questions concerns whatever because I my
hardcore followers I definitely want to
do whatever I can to make sure that I'm
you know I'm giving back and repaying
the favor that you guys are doing to me
alright so let's go ahead and get back
over another thing too you know you were
you've arrived when
the computer guys actually responding
back to you I've been a fan of Eli for
years man and uh and I don't even know
that like the conversations and the
communication I've had with him through
mostly his YouTube channel I don't think
that he's ever known that I've had a
youtube channel probably but but now we
know so did love Eli the computer guy I
hope he does well with failed normal and
then you know when he decides if he ever
decides to come back to YouTube dude
open arms to him I would definitely
collab and all that stuff but but I've
always been a fan of what he does a lot
of what I do is based off of what he
does as well so anyway alright so what
am i working on right now guys I have
other stuff in the bag man I got I got I
got several sponsors that I've been
talking to and communicating with like
long-term stuff like people that are
interested in multi month you know type
of contracts and things like that it's
still almost like a part-time job which
is why I really have a hard time and I
struggle with all this stuff like I'll
have a communication with a company and
then because I have to go to work
everyday like I'm not able to check my
email respond back to people until I get
home so it's like it's very difficult by
the time I get home I'm usually you know
I gotta do chores you know there's stuff
around the house it's got to be done you
gotta help your kids with homework like
there's so much stuff that you have to
do that you barely get any time to
respond back to some of you people so
that's why it's like don't take it
personally if I didn't get back to you
and sometimes it may take a month or
something for me to get back to you it's
just it's a it's that way I've almost
not I have like 850 videos or something
like that and you got to think like on a
new video if I post a new video I'll
probably get 50 comments in a day maybe
more so you have all those 50 comments
and then you and that's just on the
newest video not to mention 800 and some
videos that are also getting you know
450,000 views a month so that's yeah it
gets a little bit difficult to deal with
okay what else am i working on I'm gonna
be publishing a book actually believe it
or not it's gonna be a coding book and
I'm actually working with a actual real
live professional production company for
publishing so that is exciting for me
and I can't reveal any more details on
that right now it's still in kind of the
early stages but
but I will be weren't writing hopefully
a book here coming up and I'm you know
I'm really excited about that it's not
about the money really isn't there's not
gonna be any money probably made there
beyond you know at least in excess of
the time that I spend on it so it's
really not about the money but I'll give
more details on that and in the coming
future also I'm going to be working with
some major companies at least one major
company on some future tutorial videos
that I'm gonna be doing so I know that I
have two companies in the bag right now
that in fact there's a third as well
which is a typical you know sponsor
sponsorship deal but one sometimes these
things just don't don't don't have and
they fall through for one reason or
another but but as far as writing the
book I'm working with a major technology
company on tutorials and then also maybe
finding an a Deb mountain replacement
which is really what I'm hoping to do at
some point because I like that case I'm
just kidding uh no I do I do but the the
Deb mountain thing the boot camps all
its stuff we'll see where that goes but
hopefully hopefully that isn't you know
something that's gonna be collapsing but
it looks like it is to be honest um so
let's let's figure that out I guess
figure out where that goes uh anyway
guys besides that like it's really not
all bad I know I bitched about YouTube a
little bit and once again the update on
that as YouTube is actually you know D
monetizing videos but then in the manual
the when you ask for a review of it then
they're they're over overriding their
their their censorship there so or at
least their ad censorship anyway guys
thanks for watching thanks for the
support you guys have a good day take
care</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
