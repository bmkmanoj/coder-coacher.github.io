perspective from Chris Hawks because
I've adjusted where the camera is
sitting on my desk I can see I'm shaking
this damn um I'll have to work on
that anyway I just got back from a
cruise I went on vacation I went to the
haunt Bahamas Nassau Freeport and also
place in Florida and one of the
interesting things I just saw that they
had come to mind when I was on this
number one for the money like you would
think that the cruise is is it is a
great deal i think it's a good deal
don't get me wrong i think it's a pretty
good deal but I I didn't really sleep I
don't think very well the entire trip
because we were on a floor that was
right below the the main deck and being
right below the main deck it means that
there's constant action going on
upstairs and now i'm not talking about
like dance clubs or anything like that
i'm just talking about people jumping
around moving deck chairs and stuff like
that and it just seems like all the
sound and everything just amplifies
through the entire boat so I guess I'm
not a very heavy sleeper but because
when you could combine the actual motion
of the boat that's constantly moving
around on the Atlantic and then you add
in the noise and things like that just
like I couldn't really get very good
sleep it seemed like I wouldn't sleep
for more than like five or six hours
maybe at a time like max I mean they
were probably nights I had even less
than that so um you know after getting
done with a vacation I almost feel like
I need another one but uh you know over
all of it was nice and I'm when I was in
the Bahamas like i was looking at
basically an economy that yes i was in
nassau and i was also in freeport
Freeport was more of like an
industrialized like 40 kind of town I
would say very similar to the you know
shithole Baltimore that I was leaving
out of but I guess I what came to mind
is that there are so many people that
have so much less than others in this
world and then that it's uh it's
sometimes you know it's easy for
everybody to kind of lose sight of what
they already have you know when they're
seeking what they want and we're always
seeking something else we're always
won't we want something more I mean when
you get to some sort of level your
program or like you want to be a better
programmer
you want to make more money and you
think you should be more of a senior
developer maybe then an architect or a
manager you never liked we typically
want to continue to move up and do
things for ourselves and it's just
amazing though like what what some some
of the people are willing to do in order
to even have jobs like I was talking to
a lot of people from Indonesia and the
Philippines and they would do these
these seven month contracts with the the
Carnival Cruise Corporation which is the
name of the cruise line that I was on
and I never do these seven month
contracts but they were literally away
from their entire families for like
seven months and then they go home for
two months and then they're gone for
seven months so I can't imagine that
they're being paid like an extreme
amount of money but I would also bet
that they're making a lot more than
probably what they could make maybe in
their home country I'm just assuming I'm
guessing because otherwise like why
would they do it maybe they like travel
maybe they liked it you know being away
from their family for seven months but
it's just it's very interesting and it
made me think because I'm like I happen
to actually live and work in the same
town which is something that's
relatively rare in the DC area and like
in DC especially south to DC and the
Virginia side of things like people
there are a lot of people that will
commute a long time in order to get
higher paying jobs in DC and then some
of the people where I live actually
commute to Richmond and in both are
relatively big cities and they're both
semi well-to-do when it comes to tech
tech startups and things like that
obviously DC as an edge over Richmond
but Richmond still has quite a bit of
tech opportunity down there as well and
you know when you factor in the commute
and things like that and like those are
the things that I've taken into
consideration when it came to getting
different jobs and you know essentially
having the opportunity to make more
money at another company or you know at
another location as they get taken that
the geographic that traveling and
everything and and it's difficult to
gauge what type of monetary value you
should be putting on something like that
because I've said before time you know
you don't get more time like so you have
to choose your time wisely whether or
not you know you're choosing that time
spending learning a particular language
or a framework or library in order to to
be more proficient
maybe more employable things like that
there's things that we learned that we
don't really want to learn but we're
learning it because everybody else is
adopting it using it and you don't want
to be left behind so you know those are
I think some people get bitter about
that like I said in the past and past
videos is because you know we don't have
that extra time and we're spending time
away from our families or doing other
things that we may want to do because we
have to make sure that we remain
competitive and that's something that's
it's pretty much status quo if you're a
programmer that you have to you have to
get your nose in the books and continue
to learn new things and you have to
really like that you have to be very
curious and and I think that I've always
been curious type so I think that that
actually suits me quite well but it
doesn't suit everybody that's for sure
but it was just it was surprising though
that you know these people are willing
to actually move away from their
families and be away from their families
for seven months at a time but they do
that because that is that is the cards
that they've been dealt and they're
probably making the best decision that
that they can from not just themselves
but their families and it's just it's a
tough thing man one of the toughest
things I think is uh is having to be
because I don't talk about this on my
channel very much I won't share a lot of
my personal details with you guys but
you know being a father and a husband
and an employee and all this other stuff
like that is that is probably harder
than even learning how to program so
there's there's things in life that I
don't know you have to make tough
decisions in order to actually better
yourself and some of these decisions
I've made a long time ago even to become
a programmer it wasn't just for my own
self interest and things like that there
was a monetary value there was there was
the monetary opportunity it was the the
excitement of programming it's the fact
i'm a third-generation programmer that
didn't decide you wanted to be a program
until I was 28 there was a lot of
reasons though why I wanted to be a
programmer it was also a market that I
saw that was you know extremely
lucrative I saw a lot of people you know
there's a lot of demand for being a
programmer was one of the few scientific
areas that you can actually you know
beat be or get your foot in the door
without actually going to college
getting you know your PhD or a master's
degree or you have some sort of
doctorate degree or something like that
you know but you have to do that with a
lot of other things you know like
electrical engineering or being you know
medical doctor even a chiropractor at
Dennis or any of those things I mean you
have to go through all those proper
channels in order to be able to get
there but with programming you could be
some guy that like the guy who created
classmates.com or maybe it wasn't in
class mate second it might have been
classmates knock on that bottom I
remember he was like 20 years old when
he started a website and installed it a
few years later for 13 million dollars
now those are the smaller success is
that you don't necessarily hear a whole
lot about and I just literally went off
the top of my head and I do this a lot
where people are like why would you sell
your sources or do your your background
well god dammit I didn't plan to say
that but I said it just now so you know
now in the back of my mind like I read
something eight years ago and I'm trying
to remember the facts by believe
classmates.com bought this thing it was
like 13 million so I'm sure somebody's
going to go out there and link to it but
the point is i'm lazy damn it i'm not
trying to do all this like I'm not
trying to do all this research in
advance of a video but I'm just talking
you guys like I'm your neighbor or your
body or whatever so I'm just like we're
two programmers at the water cooler
that's what we're doing right here and
that's that's all I'm trying to do with
it but uh the thing is um you know those
are the smaller successes that are very
very common and the business world they
even you see people i can look at that
look I showed you guys on like to buddy
right I'm paying too buddy twenty nine
dollars a month for a website that it's
kind of cool that the product itself is
rather questionable it's only going to
be relevant for a short period of time
until you know eventually Google you
know provides these features that what
you know the two buddy is providing and
then I'm going to drop them because
they're twenty nine dollars a month and
I don't feel like paying but right now I
need to have that I need to have that
service and I can't imagine that company
has a whole lot of people involved in
but i would think that those guys are
ultimately millionaires by now you know
there's other successes to look at the
guy that created a five nights at
Freddy's you know that a small app that
doesn't even have a whole lot of
animation or movement or anything like
that your literary component clicking
buttons to turn your flashlight on and
off
closed doors and then there's a few
animated cutscenes and it's very very
creative very you know II really like
chucky cheese type of thing but now they
have merged and all this stuff and I
haven't even bothered to look that up
either because once again I'm lazy but
there's no question whoever started that
is like I mean they're probably even a
larger success now they're probably
fifty hundred million dollars your nose
but you know the thing is is that
there's all kinds of business products
and things that need to be filled you
know just the other day John sometimes
was talking on this video about some guy
that emailed him saying that you create
an algorithm and his company what the
company he worked for one to buy it from
for five hundred thousand dollars and
you know that's on one single algorithm
but I think that's probably you know a
little bit more rare rare type of a
circumstance there but the thing is is
like you know this market provides that
opportunity where others don't like it's
not like you can be a self-taught doctor
and like you know hit it big on one
patient and all of a sudden you're your
maid or something like that but in
programming you have that ability but
the thing that also you know sucks and
one of the reasons why I got so pissed
off of that Joel's boast the article is
let's be clear I understand what he was
saying and he was talking out of both
sides of his mouth and explaining both
sides of the equation but what I was
saying and the reason why I felt like it
was somewhat of a dick move to even
mention it is because the dude has a lot
of stature in the development community
he's obviously idolized by other
entrepreneurs on every other you know
tech startup type person and to me it
just seemed like you know it just seemed
like I don't understand why he you know
he had to bring it up and say it but you
know the main thing I want to drill a
drill on was that he said that if the
companies did not follow that procedure
it was you know they were most likely
mismanaged and you wouldn't want to work
there anywhere you shouldn't want to
work there something up to that effect
and I mean it's not even just that he
said that but what I'm saying is the
whole situation sucks i equated it to if
you're a developer and you work for
Pixar and you're doing you know 3d
animation or computer animation then you
go home and you draw some paint on a
canvas those two things are not related
to each other and just because you're
you're an artist
doesn't mean that you can just be bought
and sold like a goddamn slave I mean
nothing should work that way and for the
most part it doesn't work that way in
any other field and I think from a legal
perspective a judge in a most likely
competent jury would also aside with the
Creator but it doesn't mean that you
know employers you know can't be pricks
about employers typically have more
money than a typical you know developer
or an artist or something like that so
you know that was my main point was that
why raise awareness to such a you know a
shitty policy you know I mean we should
be raising awareness on what a shitty
policy that is so I also said on hacker
news and Redick I'm not sure if I ever
got a response because I've been
literally gone for a week I haven't
checked anything but I was saying that I
would promote any sort of a website or
opportunity to try to raise awareness
for that type of type of thing on my
channel I mean obviously do that for
absolutely free because they you know I
feel strongly about it I certainly don't
have and I don't really have time to
build into a project to try to raise you
know awareness or you know shine the
spotlight on these companies that you
know that think this is necessary or or
that literally take their employer or
employees to court over cetera you know
crappy tasks now at the same time I
understand you know the safeguards I
need be put in place because if you're
if you're developing something that is
even remotely similar to what you're
doing at work that is a conflict of
interest and I agree without a hundred
percent so you can't be allowed to do
that you can't be working in banking and
creating your own banking gig on the
side or something like that you can't
even be using the same code base at your
work and also use it on the side I mean
that you shouldn't be using your
computer your company's internet or or
time or anything like that you should
have a clear separation and assuming you
do those things you should be allowed to
pursue your own interests like we can do
in almost any other thing in a free
world so I mean I understand not all
countries and things are created you
know equally or fair and equal fairness
or anything like that but you know it
should just be a basic human right that
you have the ability to express your
creativity and also be able to profit on
it but I'll pretty much leave it at that
for right now now Johnson has also did
make a
a video in response to the developer
side projects video so i went ahead and
i updated the link to that in the
description I I need to spend some time
and listen to it i'll probably do a
follow-up to that video as well but
other than that yeah so people people
will make it you know they'll make
exceptions though they'll make
sacrifices in order to do things for
their family I feel like I've done the
same thing it doesn't necessarily mean
that you're a good person for going it
though because then there are there are
mistakes and you can take things too far
so you know have I felt at times that
I've worked you know too much and then
the answer is yes I mean I you know I
felt that I put in quite a bit of work
and maybe too much work and you know I
don't want to really have those regrets
when I get older but at the same time
you know it's difficult to because life
is also very difficult if you don't have
you know the means of getting by or the
means of putting your child through
college or helping with you know child
or your child through college if you're
even if you have that luxury which I
didn't have so you know yeah it's just
it's does a tough subject number i mean
i guess there's too much to talk about
in that that particular subject even
trying to intertwine it into this video
but the main thing i just want to touch
upon was that I thought it was very
interesting that people are willing to
do the seven month contracts and you
know obviously people have a way worse
than that but you know that that is
something where it's like whoa you know
if the wife replies i'm working too much
you know these guys are doing seven
months away from home and then you know
I kind of factor that into the whole you
know do I want to commute to DC or
richmond you know i'm adding am adding
time and maybe i can add twenty
twenty-five thousand dollars my salary
but you know what is my time work you
know this time that I that I don't get
back and do I really need the money you
know that much is there because i think
it there becomes a point where like you
have to figure out whether or not you
actually need you know that i need what
it is that you think you desire i guess
eh if i could say that properly
basically i think that i make enough
money and that i probably don't need
more
money but at the same time everybody you
know obviously wants to have more money
so I don't know man that that's a that's
a tough thing to say because I
definitely I do a lot better than I used
to do and I should be very very happy
with that and that's something that I
feel like I personally need to work on
but at least I understand it I recognize
it and and that's typically the you know
the start of how you can try to correct
something but other than that I did I
reached out to my sponsor day so I just
what I mention that this video sponsored
by Death Mountain coding boot camp make
sure you guys check them out if you
wanna learn jQuery nodejs like your
modern nodejs stack they're going to
teach you all the relevant skills you
need to learn to get into the industry
throughout a Provo Utah and also Dallas
text is they have options where you can
actually live on campus and enter
constantly adding new technologies and
things like that so it's definitely
check those guys out there in the
description tab below and I was going to
say in addition you know the
arrangements that I have with them is
that I continue to do videos and I
promote that but on one of the things
that will be interesting is that a night
I'd love to keep the sponsorship going
as long as I can but I don't have any
real control over that especially if
it's not being you know it's not a
lucrative thing for them but assuming
that that that wasn't the case i would
probably slow down a little bit on the
youtube thing maybe uh I don't know that
I would do a video every day I'm
actually thinking you're in 2017 i'll
probably do a video every other day or
so I mean I've tried different things
too like with the tutorials I would
release tutorials on a weekend and all
that stuff it was just it was too it was
too confusing I'm trying to keep track
of all that stuff so I feel like like I
just did an open car tutorial and it was
mainly just showing how I set it up on
my bounty server and also on Windows but
actually I don't know if I released the
windows one that's a good question but
yeah there is gonna be another video for
them because they're template monster
wants me to try out this new this new
theme that I'm going to be doing some
building my
website for her art she's an artist and
does a lot of like painting and things
like that so that's going to be the goal
there but in my mind is that um I don't
I don't I don't plan on keeping any sort
of like tutorial in the weekend types
guy so I'm just going to do what it is
that feels natural definitely in the
2017 so if it's if it's a video a day
it's going to be a video a day if it's
every other day if I missed three days
you know it's just going to be the way
it is but I want it I want it to be
natural I don't want this year this was
always just a side thing that I enjoy
doing and um and I don't want it to be a
job or anything like that so I think
that would I actually take away from you
know the overall appeal as well too so a
lot of you guys you know I talk to you
like I said like I'm like you know we're
sitting right next to each other so like
I feel like I'm talking to you and not
just talking to a camera and that's a
that's a cool thing I think that's that
YouTube's been able to do that but I
want it to be natural and I don't want
it to be forced or feel like it's some
sort of job because you start to lose
what it is that I got you involved in it
in the first place I really don't think
that's a recipe for success long term
anyway so that's that's about it though
guys thanks for watching this video make
sure you subscribe vote up and thank you
