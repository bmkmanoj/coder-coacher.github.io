want to look at is babble and babble
a relatively complex subject I think for
a lot of people including myself when I
was first getting started using it in
fact for the longest time I had a hard
time understanding exactly what Babel or
Babel was doing for me in fact I called
it Babel for the longest time and I
still do because for whatever reason I
just I see that word and I think Babel I
don't I'm not a religious guy I don't
know anything about the Tower of Babel
or anything like that but anyway what
Babel does for us guys is it allows us
to write modern JavaScript that works in
older browsers and the latest version of
JavaScript is es6 also known as Atma
script 2015 JavaScript is really just
ACMA script it's the standard equus crip
is the specification which is like you
know basically the dictionary or the
Bible of what javascript is and browsers
implement those specifications to the
best of their abilities however they
always trip up and they do things
differently so Chrome renders a little
bit differently from Mozilla Mozilla and
and and I Internet Explorer never gets
things right they're always lagging
behind the other two chrome is in my
opinion the best browser out there
especially for debugging and then you
have Mozilla would be a second place and
then you have ie and a distant third
behind fourth actually behind Safari
probably so the fact of the matter is
though that Babel will allow you to
write code in a way that will work in
the older browsers and that's really
important when we start looking at the
latest standards and how do we actually
write modern JavaScript right now so the
Ekman script 2015 standard is right here
it actually got finalized in December of
last year and so far chrome is the the
closest to being able to render a lot of
this stuff but even some of the stuff
that's supported is actually not a
hundred percent supported compared to
the you know what the specification
calls for so if you really want some dry
reading and you want to be you know a
super JavaScript nerd then you know it
might be a good idea to check out the
specification but if you if you're like
me and I've been programming
for about seven years in JavaScript for
about that whole entire time I'm not a
JavaScript like expert to the point
where like I feel like I can just crush
that specification and understand
everything that's talking about to me it
takes trial and error and also I don't
really need to understand that entire
specification it was designed by
hundreds of developers and many
different companies all coming together
to come up with these standards and even
if you understood those standards a
hundred percent it doesn't mean that the
browser actually works and renders that
javascript according to that
specification so the answer though at
least as close to the answer as possible
right now is that everybody is using
Babel to compile their JavaScript so
let's go ahead and look at how do we
actually get Babel installed in order to
be able to use some of the latest
standards like arrow functions and which
is an es6 standard that babel will then
compile into an es 5 version so that way
you can write this modern code and get
it working so number one let's go ahead
and I'm gonna open up a new window for
my visual studio code if you've ever
watched my tutorials in the past you
know that I've been using Visual Studio
code lately it's a really good product
from Microsoft believe it or not that is
it's just a really good editor it's very
simple it doesn't try to do too much
so with this editor here I'm going to go
ahead and create a a project folder so
that we can talk about this and I'm
gonna put everything under my my
projects directory under my C Drive so
that's here and then I went I'm gonna
have tutorials folder down here and
click on that and then we'll go ahead
and create a folder here which we'll
call Babel the babel tutorial and then
inside here i'm going to open up this
folder press CMD inside my windows
explorer i'm using windows 10 but this
should be the same for anything windows
7 and beyond so here we are in the
command line the first thing that you
want to do when you build a modern
JavaScript project especially using
something like Babel is you want to make
sure that you have node installed on
your machine because node is going to
all your npm which is a package manager
that everybody is using for JavaScript
so if you haven't heard of it and you do
JavaScript development you're either
brand new or you've been living under a
rock
but NPM is a package manager and if you
just installed nodejs for your machine
whether it's Linux Mac or whatever
you're gonna have node and NPM working
so by typing NPM EIN it it's going to
create a standard jason config file so
that's what all the web development you
know people are doing nowadays they
create this config file which is then
responsible for telling the project
what type of plugins that you're using
and what's a plug-in it just means a
chunk of code and Babel is a is a chunk
of code so when we install babel or some
other tool even jquery or react or
something like that this config will
keep track of all of that now one of the
things you'll know is that you'll notice
real quick cuz you can't have spaces or
capital letters when we're giving this
thing a name so we're just going to call
this babel a babel tutorial with the
underscore for the space and make it all
lowercase and we could say is version 1
that's fine we'll say a babel tutorial
by chris pause and we'll make the entry
point indexed ijs that's fine
it's that by default so i can just press
enter test command don't worry about it
I get repository don't worry about it
author I'll just say Chris Hawkes and
I'll make at MIT I don't care all right
so now we have this package jason file
if we open up a lot of people pronounce
it JSON I've always said Jason I don't
think it really matters but let's go
ahead and open the folder for this
project that we created so babel
tutorial will select that folder and by
doing that Visual Studio will now open
up this folder and you'll be able to see
the documents on the left-hand side once
this thing actually starts working what
the hell is going on oh I see i sees
that so on second let's go to tutorials
all right there we go
all right so here's our package.json
file and I'll go ahead and zoom in so
you can see it and that's all the
information that we just entered in so
now when we install things it's going to
install them and add them to a local
node modules folder and then we can then
access you know the version they'll be
installed from our package config so let
me go ahead and explain what we're gonna
do here we're going to install babel and
now babel has a few different plugins
that people are using there's babel CLI
which stands for command-line interface
there's also babel core and then babel
es2015 something or another and I don't
even remember what it's called babel
preset yes 2015 so enough with the
bullcrap let's go ahead and talk about
this here let's uh let's npm install and
we're gonna say babel 4 and then space
and then we're gonna add one stall the
babel preset es2015 now what babe a
babel preset 2015 does is it's actually
the module for babel that says hey I'm
gonna take your es6 and I'm gonna
compile it es2015 so in order for that
to actually happen you have to have that
package installed and that's what we're
doing right now
now another argument I'm going to do
after that babel preset es2015 I did a
space I'm going to do two hyphens and
I'm gonna say save - dev and this just
means that these tools are for the
development of this project so if I go
to distribute this project somewhere
else these tools aren't necessary for a
project that uses my project to have to
download because it's only used for the
development of this project so that is
the difference between - - save and - -
save dev because if you know that you
don't need this package to be part of
your application then then make it you
know part of save dev but if it's a
requirement
that this package is installed in order
for your stuff to work then yes she
would put it under - I can save now
let's take a look at what happened to
the package Jason you can see these two
Pratt these two entries were created
under dev dependencies so not under
normal dependencies but dev dependencies
and you can see Babel core and Babel
preset es2015 so now that that is being
done what we want to do and I want to
explain and harp on this because this is
something a lot of people don't really
understand when you're using modern
Babel development you want to actually
have everything installed locally and
not globally so globally means that if
you install things without saying - -
save it's actually going to install them
in your global node modules folder
instead of the node modules folder from
where you executed the command so long
story short you don't want to share node
modules with other projects because node
modules may be updated and all of a
sudden because you're referencing the
same folder for eight different projects
you could have eight projects completely
screwed up over one simple you know mess
up of an update or you know or you know
just deleting a dependency so don't do
that you do everything locally and if
you just follow along with this tutorial
for all your development needs and
you're gonna understand this is an
easier way of doing things so here's
this node modules folder and look at all
this crap that got installed with bable
bable is actually a pretty huge project
and it requires all this crap that it
went out and installed for you when you
said that you needed to install it so
that's another reason why you want this
under dev dependencies and not an actual
dependency because then otherwise
projects that use your project are going
to download all that crap and they won't
even use it so they're gonna be like why
am i downloading sixteen Meg of data for
this crappy project by Chris Hawkes I'm
not going to use it and then I'm not
going to get rich and I'm not gonna make
any money off this tutorial or any of my
websites or anything like that so it's
just a bad idea now let's go ahead and
look at what we need to do in order to
be able to then execute babel locally
and what do i mean by i mean it means
that babel by default is going to try to
find your global installation so right
now
babbles only installed locally so in
order for us to be able to it to run the
local babble version we need to go ahead
and add to our scripts here and we're
going to say in double quotes we're just
gonna say babble and then same thing
here babble and make sure there's a
comma there because this is the first
argument as a second so now we have this
babble now if we go to our command line
and we say npm run babble what it's
doing is it's actually going to execute
this script and it says oh look for
babble and it's going to look into the
local node modules folder for babble so
it's not going to run it globally which
is good now you can see here that we get
an error and it says babble is not
recognized and the reason why is we
actually need we need to actually pass
an argument and we need to babble CLI
tools as well so let's go ahead and add
the install for a babble CLI tools so
same thing npm install fab babble CLI
and once again there's gonna be a dev
save for dev dependency
all right so now that's installed let's
go ahead and run this again npm run
babel now because the command line was
actually installed you can see that it
actually knows what you're trying to do
you're trying to run babel from your
command line that's what we need this
project for now it's going to hang
because it doesn't know what you want to
do so press control-c and print and
press y we need to go ahead and tell
babel to work a little bit differently
we need to number one we need an index
dot JSP file because you can see here
that this is this package that says your
main starting point of your applications
should be index IGS so it's going to
create that now so in our folder we can
press new file and say index is now
inside here I'm just going to go ahead
and create a what's considered the it's
called the arrow function in es6 and
this is something that babel will
compile the es2015 if we do everything
right so what we'll say is we'll say VAR
x equals and then it's just an anonymous
function arrow function that is just
going to return alert hello world so
this is an arrow function this is only
you know modern es6 that supports this
arrow function here so let's go ahead
and now we want to tell babel I want you
to compile this index crap and make an a
separate out file that we're just going
to call bundle and let's go ahead and do
that now so we're gonna save NPM run
babel now one of the interesting things
to note is that we need to say two
hyphens in order to pass arguments to
our locally running babbles so now we
can actually say you know what babel I
want you to compile index J F's and I
want you to say you're out file which is
gonna be - o is going to be bundled Jas
so now by using these two hyphens we're
actually passing arguments to our local
babel installation now if you look at
what happened here we went ahead and it
actually compiled this bundle j s now
one of the interesting things to know
is that it did not actually convert it
to es2015 or I'm sorry es es five older
versions before 2015 the reason why is
because we actually need to tell Babel
to use a preset and in order to do that
we need to actually create something
called a babel RC file so we're gonna
say add new file and it's going to be
just called babel RC I'm sorry and use a
dot babel RC so i know that's really
weird and then here is just gonna be a
simple JSON object and we're gonna say
presets and this is going to be a list
of different presets and we're gonna say
es 2015 if you remember though we've
already installed the es 2015 preset
that babbled needs and that's what we
did earlier in this video so now we're
telling babel and it's going to look for
this babel RC file any time you execute
to say okay here's all the presets that
are available but we need to do
something in addition for that to
actually work we need to actually pass
the preset argument to our arguments so
another two hyphens after our first
typing because remember these first two
events tell it to pass arguments to our
scripts i know this is confusing but
eventually it'll make sense but we're
passing arguments to this statement
right here by using the first two
hyphens and then anything following the
first two hyphens are the actual
arguments that we're passing so the next
two hyphens we're gonna say preset
preset es2015 and it might be presets i
don't remember
looks like that might have been right
alright good so now if we look at what
happened here i actually guessed on
preset instead of presets i didn't
remember but anyway i know what i'm
talking about i just didn't know the
exact spelling anyway here is a bundle
it turns out I was right so I guess I'm
great
this use strict this is what babble is
actually doing it says oh you know this
is part of the yes yes five standard
we're going to use strict that way it
doesn't allow undeclared
variables and things like that var X
gets turned from an arrow function to
more traditional function which this is
just a function named X and it returns
hello world so let's go ahead and create
an standard index.html page
and inside of our HTML page we're just
going to do our simple HTML and here
we'll do our body alright
so it's just to make sure that things
are working so it's not just an empty
page and then we'll close off the HTML
so that's all we need now we need to
include our actual bundle j/s so I'm
going to drag that oh I can't drag it
damn it I could do that in visual studio
so now I need to actually do it the hard
way Script we're just a source equals
forward dot forward slash bundle bundle
j/s and all right so there we go
and now that we've done that we can open
up our folder and we can double click on
index and if you have your browsers to
fall here's the page and let's view the
page source make sure I'm not the page
source but inspect element right-click
it stay inspect go to console I just
want make sure there's a 404 error that
means that our JavaScript is being
executed so if I said X you can see it's
actually returning the function and this
is the old-school function not the arrow
one so if I called it as a function you
can see it says hello world so that is
how we use babel and a modern-day web
project in order to run everything
locally and then be able to take
modern-day es6 and compile it down to a
working es5 version and what I'm going
to do is I'm actually going to create a
tutorial series on es6 because I've been
dealing with it quite a bit it's going
to be posted on hipster code comm so
some of the tutorials I have on here are
actually outdated in some sense
want to actually do some some updates
here some of these tutorials are pretty
decent like my flask has gotten some
good reviews as well as this Python for
beginners tutorial and getting webpack
working and all that stuff with babel is
going to be a separate video here but i
want to make sure that well i'm gonna be
posting an es6 tutorial on this this
website here so make sure you guys check
that out for all the latest tutorials
for me and other videos and blogs and
things like that also make sure you
subscribe to this channel and once again
i'll go ahead and make another video for
how to actually configure web pack with
babel in order to do exactly what we
were doing before but except get module
bundling and things like that that we're
gonna need to deal with in order for you
know even more more flexibility when it
comes to modern-day complicated
JavaScript applications alright guys
thanks for watching and take care
hey guys so I've talked about this a lot
Deb mountain coding boot camp they are
my sponsor they're one of the reasons
why I'm able to do these videos and they
offer a 12-week intensive course that
teaches you the technologies of the here
and now they're gonna focus on a lot of
things that are actually being used and
websites things like jQuery and they're
gonna be using stacks like nodejs the 12
week intensive course is to try to get
people in the job market so that is our
entire focus we've all we've talked a
lot about on this channel whether or not
a college degree is worth it
I'm not the one to be able to answer
that question for you I absolutely think
that college degrees are great
especially in computer science I never
want to convince somebody to say that
they shouldn't do that you know
obviously schools like Stanford and MIT
I'm you know I'm I'm an envy of all
those graduates however there is you
know the bulk of developers that don't
necessarily need to be the MIT graduates
to actually have success in the
programming world I think I speak
relatively well for for that type of
person and with coding boot camps we're
seeing them you know try to offer more
skills more modern-day skills because a
lot of times when you're going to a
computer science course and a major
university you're learning technology
that's already outdated by the time
you're learning it with Deb mountain and
coding boot camps like what Deb Mountain
offers they're focusing on really what
is hot right now so and they also focus
on a relatively you know a small set of
skills in order to make sure that they
are teaching you what you need to know
in order to be productive in a in a
workplace environment so make sure you
guys do me a favor do yourself a favor
check out the link in the in the
description tab below for more on Deb
Mountain coding boot camp thanks guys
