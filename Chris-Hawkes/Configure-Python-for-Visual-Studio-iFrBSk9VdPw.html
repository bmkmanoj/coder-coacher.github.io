video we installed the Python tools so
that we could use Python within Visual
Studio because Microsoft has this really
good integrated development environment
also known as an IDE so in this video
what we're going to do is we couldn't
compile the application because it
couldn't find the Python interpreter so
depending on what version of Python you
have installed you just need to go over
to debug and then click on options and
settings and then when you look down at
the left-hand column here you're going
to see ok down here at Python tools you
click on that and then just go to your
interpreter options and then your
default interpreter that's in my case it
was set to the wrong one yours you may
not have to do this depending on what
Python you have but I have Python 2 7 so
I'm just going to go ahead and click OK
now watch what happens when you click a
play like it ran the program and
immediately killed it so to prevent that
from closing you're going to want to go
to tools and then options and then what
we're going to do is go back to the
Python tools we're going to go to debug
crap I was just in this earlier and
okay here it is sorry wait for input
when process when process exits normally
okay so basically watch what this does
basically it has an additional command
on the command prompt for every program
that you run so what you just have to
get a button to close it so press play
and you see press any key to continue so
that's how we end up installing Python
the work within this IDE so that that's
it so anyway please subscribe and thank
you for everybody's support and the
videos and things like that so
appreciate all your help and you have a
good day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
