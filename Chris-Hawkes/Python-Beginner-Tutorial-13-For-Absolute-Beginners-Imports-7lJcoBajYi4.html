this video we want to talk about the
import statement in Python we actually
saw some of this stuff in the previous
videos when I was giving it
demonstrations on how to actually write
files and and things like that and when
we imported the Syst and everything now
one of the ways of making a PI program
in python much more flexible is to break
up your code into different files
instead of different functions within
your file it's best to have different
files that handle different pieces of
functionality and another reason for
that is because you could have hey Bob
you work on this function and that in
your own file and I'll work on my own
file as well and you can have entire
teams working on different files and
stuff but it's never a good idea even in
enterprise development now with all the
tools we have available for multiple
teams to work in the same file at the
same time it comes in that's where like
we get all this conflicts and merging
stuff when we have source control
whether it's github or TFS or something
else but that situation sucks so it's
ideal to try to separate your files out
into different teams and developers and
have them work on it so how do we do
that in Python let's go ahead and we're
going to keep all this in place so this
is my smart function we talked about in
the last video and we're going to create
a new file and the only file I have in
my directory is called first file which
has this function and we're going to
just do some terrible naming and call it
second file dot py and inside here we're
going to look at the important so we're
going to say import from I actually know
we're going to say from first file
import and then we're going to import
the name of our function my smart
function or and say import that so now
in this second file I could call my
smart function and once again I'll say 5
+ 5 which is going to be add because I'm
going to pass in this third parameter of
add so it's going to take these two
numbers and add them together so it will
print out 10 to the console if
everything goes well so let's go ahead
and go to our debug screen and press
play and we were able to take my smart
function from another file and import it
into this second file and then we're
able to call it just as if it was in our
file in here at
output it to the screen 10 so that's
pretty badass right I mean that's how
all the Python programs are created you
have all these different files if you go
to any sort of complicated Python
project they're going to be broken up
into all these different files you're
going to have all these import
statements at the top and that's all
that import stuff is doing now here's
another thing you can do we imported
just this one function from the file
then what if this file had 15 or 20
different functions well in that case
let's create another function where we
said define another another function and
we'll say print holy crap this is
another function alright so now we have
to but what happens if I said you know
what I wanted I wanted what did we call
this another function what if I said I
want to call another function and we
don't have to pass anything into that
function is this going to work I'll tell
you the answer to that before I even run
it and that is not going to work because
we did not import it we only imported
this one function from the file so when
python gets this you're going to get
this name error it says another function
is not defined it doesn't know what the
hell another function is because you
didn't define it in this file and you
didn't import it from another file so
how can you import everything now we
could obviously just simply say another
function and that would solve the
problem but that's not the purpose of
this example here I want to import
everything and how do we do that we do
it with the star so we're going to say
import all so now if I run this it went
to first file and it grabbed everything
that was in there and that way it knew
what another function was so it sets
holy crap this is another function now
one of the things about doing this
though is what if well really another
good thing about this is that you can
import all the code from first file but
say you know what I
I want everything in first file because
I want to be able to call my smart
function so what do we call this we call
my smart function we're like this is
defined perfectly I love it I love what
this is doing here and I want it I want
that but pretend there's a ton of other
crap in this file and
and this part right here you don't
really like you don't want it but you
still don't want to have to import every
single function if there was like 25 of
them in here just because you don't want
this one so the better thing to do would
be able to override override what this
is and you could do that simply by
defining it from within here so you
could say import all and that way I can
call my my special smart function will
do the same thing five plus five and
we'll say add five will make it more
will do some difference they multiply
and that's going to return 25 obviously
and now we're going to say you know what
I want to call another function but
let's go ahead and just define another
function so I could just define the
function over again in here and override
it by saying define another function
print I overrode this joint so if I said
print already know how to say no I'll
call another function now so even though
imported another function I overrode it
in the file here and it's not going to
call this one anymore because another
function got redefined to this so let's
go ahead and play it and you'll see it
prints out 25 there and then the second
one I overrode this joint so this and
the reason why I'm getting into this and
functions meat is because you can do
this in function functions but when we
look at classes in Python this is going
to make a lot more sense because there
is going to be a ton of different
occasions when you get into more complex
Python programming where you're going to
need to override class methods that you
end up importing so you import a class
and you're like you know I need to
override what this is doing here because
I need it to do something more in some
cases you want it to do everything it
was doing but you're going to add to it
instead of just completely doing
something different but there's multiple
reasons why you need to you need the
flexibility of being able to override
these things so that is the purpose
there all right guys that's the import
statement and what that is all about in
Python
let me know if you have any questions
please subscribe please share this video
please up vote thank you bye hey guys so
a lot of you asked me how do I get my
foot in the door to become a programmer
and I just want to take a moment to
mention dev Mountain coding bootcamp is
a 12-week intensive course that focuses
on the technologies of the here-and-now
for web development some of the things
that they're actually teaching in the
suevi course it's geared to get you into
the industry by focusing on things like
jQuery nodejs
react angular how to use github so a lot
of the things that you're going to need
to do as a developer as soon as you
start they're going to be teaching you
in this and this coding bootcamp and the
entire goal is to be able to get you
into the industry within 12 weeks so if
you guys are interested in learning more
information about dev mountain coding
bootcamp just check out the link in the
description tab of this video thank you
for watching and have a good day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
