question all the time in my tool to
start programming so I actually want to
take a few moments to just kind of talk
about a few things that I think are
going on right now number one some of
the channels out there there's a lot of
channels like mine I think it seems like
that are just there they're everywhere I
guess they maybe they've always been
there I don't know but there are
definitely a lot of a lot of programming
channels out there that um I think in
some ways can give false hope as to like
what you know what somebody's able to do
and what what they're not able to do and
things like that so I'll be perfectly
honest in Blowing were you guys in this
video I started programming when I was
28 a lot everybody knows that if you've
been watching this channel for a long
time I started really late I had already
had kids I had marriage I had a house I
was actually in a financial crisis which
I haven't really dealt too much into
that but there was a lot of things going
on in my life and I made sacrifices I
learned how to be a programmer but
before that like there was there was
little things that I would also do that
I would end up finding success in like
getting my first white-collar job took a
lot of like you know basically
bullshitting and going from being a
plumber and a truck driver and a guy who
installed appliances around the DC area
to to them being able to get my foot
into the door and into a fortune 500
company
granted on the business side now
basically what I'm saying is that I feel
like I'm a hardworking person I'm
somebody that that strives to do the
best that I can so you know I say that
and and obviously I'm not perfect like
there's nobody's perfect but like that
user has been sacrifices obviously by
the time with the children with the wife
and and some of those things you know
you'll never get back and you have to
kind of judge what you know I guess in
the end whether or not it was worth it
or not but you know before I get into
some sort of philosophical or go down
some philosophical path I'm just going
to simply flat-out say that I don't
think that anybody is too old to
and start learning on a code now if
you're trying to like if you want me to
be able to say hey you're going to go
take some bootcamping and three months
later you're going to get a job making
$80,000 a year it's like a you know a
mid-level developer somewhere I think
that it's it's just you know next to
impossible and least in the United
States now that said there are all kinds
of different paths that you can go down
so if you go to a coding bootcamp it
gives you a much much greater
opportunity to get your foot in the door
as like a bottom level junior developer
maybe in web development mostly focusing
on the UI like CSS JavaScript and when I
say JavaScript not this client-side
complicated as front-end stuff that we
do these days but more along the lines
of like you know what we used to do some
jQuery a lot of business needs still
have that basic requirement where web
development I think was much was much
easier than what it is now because I
mean what it is now is like hell you can
see when I'm monkeying around with right
now which is you know map dispatch the
props and map states probably wonder
what that is but that's Arita react
Redux projects which ends up well
actually it's Redux but then react Redux
users the connect function era to end up
mapping the stuff together but the point
is like front-end client-side
development is much more complicated
these days now so and that makes it even
harder for self-taught developers to
just feel to jump in do I think anybody
can just literally learn in three months
and do what I'm doing right now I don't
I really don't but that shouldn't be
your mindset like you shouldn't be
exactly you know trying to replicate
somebody that has seven or ten years of
experience you have to keep things in
perspective you can't learn to run
before you can you know crawl and walk
and things like that so there is a
certain progression so if you start now
and you you really try hard eventually
if you are truly passionate about this
stuff like I consider myself to be like
you can almost let you almost get to
this point where you can't envision
yourself as not being a programmer so
people might you know kick you in the
balls while you're down when you're
trying to get into the end
tree and things like that and if you're
anywhere like my upbringing you're going
to run into the same type of things how
thick of skin you have and even in this
YouTube business I feel like it's given
me thick skin because sometimes you know
I get some of the nastiest that
people say about me and I see some of
the dumbest stuff on YouTube sometimes
that people are following and getting
success off of and it just kind of to be
sometimes I'm just like mad if if my
stuff is compared to their stuff than
like you know whatever you know what is
the point this whole thing is a waste of
time but it's really not like that
that's just kind of the negative part of
me every once awhile that comes out it's
just like I can't believe people are
having success doing what you know what
they're doing but on the adventures
YouTube in general like how many people
have literally made you know tons of
money off like you know weird cat videos
and even my son has done some like
really terrible videos but so it all
goes back to really how hard you want to
work at this thing like how passionate
are you at being a programmer
programming requires solving complex
problems day in and day out so it's
going to be something that if you do end
up getting that day job where you are
actually getting paid to do this it's
like a dream come true if you truly want
to be a programmer because you're
getting paid to do what you would do in
your spare time most likely and also you
get better and you get paid to get
better you're basically getting paid to
go to school almost it seems like and
that's one of the best parts I think of
actually getting a full-time gig now
there are downsides over like you have
to solve complex problems you have to
deal with a lot of different
personalities and you have crazy-ass
deadlines and you have you get to a
certain point where like people can't
really solve your problems you can
bounce ideas off of other people but
that should be somewhat of like I
wouldn't say a rarity but like if you
have to rely upon somebody else to look
at your code all the time to figure out
what you what it is that you need to do
because you can't solve problems for
yourself and so like that there are
people that have that struggle at that
and like I don't know if sometimes they
just naturally get better at it or they
just find a gig that just allows them to
kind of be what they are but the
are certain gigs out there where it's
like you have to solve these complex
problems and you don't have anybody else
but yourself to turn to and the amount
of stress involved is ridiculous I mean
so even if you're getting paid access to
$100,000 that is like a ridiculous
amount of stress and that's not for
everybody so I made a video about why
it's great being a programmer there's
also some downsides guys like there is
downsizing the fact that I spent a ton
of time learning how to program where I
wasn't getting paid
I've spent a ton about a ton of time on
this YouTube channel where now it's
starting to make a little bit of money
but like we're still talking about chump
change when you talk about like a
programmer salary in the amount of
effort that has gone into like you know
to making this channel luckily I enjoy
it but if I didn't enjoy it then I mean
it's certainly not worth it and honestly
I feel like I have success because I
have enjoyed this ride but there are
like I said there's it seems like it
seems like some of the stuff that people
are talking about doing it's just like
what the but alright yeah I'm not
going to go too much down down that down
that path there but yeah I think anybody
can pick up programming I once talked to
a guy online that would have I think it
was 80 I don't remember Zach
he was excess of 80 years old he might
have been 80 on the dot
definitely 80 sticks out of my mind but
this dude was just picking up coding and
and I mean that's probably our like an
extreme case it's not like he's gonna
try to be darker burg or something like
that but you know he was trying to do
that because he wanted to learn about
what you know what coding was all about
and things like that I think he had you
know an educated background and just
wanted to try to you know push his
horizons I at one point I wanted to be
an author and I was you know kind of
short lived but I don't know it's good
to dream you know what I mean like you
should be a dream for some of the best
innovators in the world they dream to
make the world a better place so another
question you need to ask yourself is
like if you come from a plumbing
background or a HVAC background or
you're in you know education or
something like that you don't
necessarily have to strive to be a
senior level programmer if you're a
great marketer I mean
Steve Jobs I mean he was a genius
marketer but he wasn't very good at
coding and he relied upon other people
to get that stuff done for him just
knowing a lot about coding I think you
know it opens up a lot of doors for you
whether it's like us user interface
design user experience things like that
even like you know basic web web design
with HTML CSS I mean there's plenty of
people you know that make a good living
doing that stuff so you know you have to
ask yourself it would is like what
exactly are you trying to accomplish now
you could also be a successful
entrepreneur where you like you don't
work for anybody but you you're managing
you know different people's accounts
like one of the industries that I think
is like the biggest piece of is of
is any sort of medical service provider
within the United States like it is so
terrible how many times like when you
have to change insurance companies you
have to find me doctors and like you're
calling around the doctor's offices
trying to leave voicemails like they
never answer the phone they're always at
lunch when they do answer the phone
they're rude everything's got to be in
mail you're going to stop by in person
like they don't have this entire online
setup and I want to talk to a company
that was out of Bethesda Maryland and
they were trying to create like a new
HMO and then you had venture capital
startup funding and stuff like that but
they were trying to create like a new
basically a new HMO that they managed
where doctors would end up you know
getting into their network and their
network was all about automating all
that that currently is being
done by you know receptionists and
people that just really don't seem to
like doing their job it seems like for
the most part and I don't blame them I
wouldn't want to do it either but anyway
there's always like you know whether
it's an HVAC or something like you had
HVAC experience you might be a damn good
salesman to be like you know what I'm
going to be a business analyst because I
know all about plumbing and stuff like
that I know how plumbers and plumbing
companies can definitely you know use
this technology in order to you know
expand their business and things like
that you end up you know doing that for
one or two clients and next thing you
know word-of-mouth you have a company
going and you're an entrepreneur and you
may be like you know
vo core lower level programmer and
that's fine you know what I mean that
might be the best that some people are
striving to be so I can't make promises
once again but I think everybody needs
to work hard they need to be a dreamer
and if you dream with it like for the
stars like you know you might end up in
you know the edges of space wherever
you're still going to be damn damn
higher than you were when you started
out on your endeavor so I'm the only
thing I would definitely say is don't do
it for the money and and that's so
cliche everybody says that money is good
dude I am NOT going to be the one that I
like more money the better you know
money doesn't buy happiness but it's
sure it makes it a lot easier to attain
that happiness because nothing sucks
worse when you're like how am I going to
pay my mortgage or I'm losing my home I
have credit card debt out there you know
off yeah it's like that's never cool and
and for all the rich people are like oh
the owners not everything yeah live it
live a day in that life you know but
anyway alright guys that's all I got for
tonight you guys take care and thank you
and please subscribe bye hey guys so a
lot of you asked me how do I get my foot
in the door to become a programmer and I
just want to take a moment to mention
