talking to two IT workers who live in
the Northern Virginia area in fact one
actually commutes to DC and does like
security information security and stuff
like that for the federal government but
they don't work directly for the federal
government actually just work for a
contractor who works with government
contracts you know so they're working in
government facilities and apparently you
know there's one lady so she's she's a
woman that has this job up there and
then her husband or fiance or something
like that I guess her fiance I'm not
married yet but he uh he works also in
Northern Virginia and apparently he
works for a smaller defense contractor
and he was talking about how the other
day he got a phone call from a
representative and he was he didn't
remember if it was like a booz allen
hamilton or Raytheon or one of the other
major defense contractor employees but
apparently this guy was working on her
client site and the client was the
federal government and and he was this
buddy that i was talking to he was
trying to send this guy an encrypted
email using either outlook or whatever
sort of email client he was using and he
was saying that the guy from raytheon or
Booz Allen or whoever was was saying
that their federal government facility
was still using something like lotus
notes from if you've ever heard of lotus
notes say it's this IBM notes thing that
got created 27 years ago and you could
see it handles like emails and stuff
like that so the buddy he was like he
said he never laughed before but
actually started laughing you know on
the phone with this with this potential
client and he was just baffled how like
how this facility you know using the
services of one of the largest defense
contractors in the world that makes
laser guided missiles and satellite
systems and stuff like that was working
with you know such old technology that
you know after all this time and all
these other you know because most people
use an Outlook or now they're using
Gmail or just basically something
besides some
this is something like Lotus knows which
is just it's crazy but um he was he was
basically just stating that um in many
cases the government works so slow and
they adapt technology you read a
ridiculously slow pace so some people
will tell you that okay if you're in the
DC area and you want to be a government
contractor that it's great because you
get your top-secret clearance you can
bounce between one employer to the next
and never have a hard time finding a job
but a lot of people like a lot of you
know less newbies and people that you
may have an interest in programming at
home you know like me doing this channel
and trying to teach other technologies
and learn other technologies I'm just
generally interested in that but it
seems like I may be bored out of my mind
if I ever worked for an employer like
that that literally had to interface to
some of these crazy old technologies
that you know that haven't been updated
you know our decades overdue it's just I
think it would drive me crazy but this
other lady that I was talking to who
commuted up to DC she was saying that
she essentially goes into work every day
for the last like year and is rewriting
the same thing over and over and over
again like so apparently up the chain of
command they decide that you know
something has to be done a little bit
more efficient and then she'll just do
the same process over and over again so
she said she's working on the same exact
thing and has done it over and over like
a hundred times so she hates her job
needless to say she commutes all the way
to DC probably gets paid really good
money since it's a government contract
and and is looking for any way out like
so she hates IT and and just wants a way
out and I think that's that to me that
was very interesting because when I see
like a booz allen or a lockheed martin
or something like that i see that you
know that F F should I can't remember
the name of the fighter pilot but you
see all these different you know
technologies the laser-guided missiles
you see the satellites and everything
and you're like whoa that's so awesome
you know the robotics and everything but
then there's there's so much of the work
that you do that apparently you're just
you know doing stuff over and over and
over again you have the smallest tiniest
piece of a humongous project and you
never really see it through to its
completion you don't you know what i
mean so it there's
it's I guess it's not all it's cut out
to be in many cases a lot of people want
to be IT contractors for the government
and and you know I've talked to a few
people that say it sucks and last night
I went to my first star party which I've
never done that before but I bought this
telescope I told you guys about like
seven months ago now and I've been
meaning to try to get out to like a star
party to try to get out to an open dark
area and see if I can you know check
some stuff out and it definitely paid
off because I met like a lot of really
really nice people there in fact one of
the the president of the group actually
was a software engineer he made a joke
that he just writes PowerPoint
presentations for a living and then
another guy he worked at a government
facility in Quantico and and he was he
was basically stating that he hates
ideas well he has a business degree and
a bachelor's degree in business
administration was talking about how his
wife is pursuing a PhD and how he just
wants to get out of of IT because
apparently he works at a government
facility and is just setting up or
monitoring like their network systems
and and things like that so I guess the
point of this video is to you know maybe
caution government contract leave her
dal OTT of good things about government
work and then I've heard a lot of
terrible things and it sounds like for
those who are very ambitious those that
like to deal with new technologies learn
new things and that it would probably
drive you crazy and and for the most
part a lot of these companies aren't
really going to hire anybody without a
bachelor's degree anyway it at least a
lot of them that I've seen but I think
that that's you know that it's really
interesting I think it kind of sucks in
some ways that you know that in many
cases I'm sure small groups and pockets
of their development teams are dealing
with some of the latest stuff and then
you know the good majority probably is
just you know older stuff that's just
not very interesting so all that being
said I can tell you though from a person
that's NIT myself you know I actually I
like iti think it's great I mean I've
always said that I think it's a great
career I've had some terrible jobs I've
done truck driving i did pizza delivery
when I was really
I delivered and installed appliances for
a while yeah I mean I've done a lot of
different things and and probably the
worst stuff when it comes to like
dealing with stuff that you just don't
want to do it would be probably when I
was doing like HVAC work I was supposed
to be an actual plumber but I was doing
more hvac stuff but we kind of did all
kinds of stuff because we're just in too
small a small like a small construction
company so we're just dealing with so
many different things so I'd solder
pipes and stuff like that but for the
most part I was climbing and
ridiculously hot attics trying to pull
out air conditioning units and then i
would also and i was just really a grunt
work or to like you know pounding
together ductwork and stuff like that
and then on one of the worst things I
ever had to do was drag a phone line
underneath a house I was like 200 years
old an old town alexandria virginia and
as I'm crawling under there all I have
is a flashlight and it's it's a mud like
ground bottom very cold very damp and um
you know as I'm crawling through there I
see this dead rat and it's like right in
front of me because every time I have
two army crawl and then move my
flashlight to the front of me and then
army crawl pastic reached behind me grab
it put it back in front of me and then
when I did that like I saw his dead rat
like not you know couple feet from my
face and I and that just freaked me out
but then I ended up flashing the light
around and I saw these eyes man there
were other rats down there dude was it
was friggin terrible I it's probably the
worst thing I really in fact after that
moment I really feel like that was one
of the moments where I was just like you
know what I'm working with a bunch of
assholes and construction you know
people that treat each other terribly
and other they're racist towards
Hispanic workers that are on the job and
I'm you know just some pretty rough neck
people you know a lot of Roughnecks and
that kind of industry and um and I was
just like you know what I'm smarter than
this I need to do something you know
something else and I started going to
college and I was able to get my foot in
the door and you know major major
company in my area so I don't know so
yeah the shitty jobs man those jobs I
could do the same thing over and over
Bergen and IT for some government
contractor I for me like I could deal
with it just because I would go home and
still do what I do but you know I guess
it's all just your perspective on where
you want to be because things can always
be worse and for any of you guys that
are trying to get your foot into the
industry I mean you'll take whatever you
can get but for the most part like I
said these companies they don't really
hire you know self-taught without you
know a lot of Education and a lot of
experience I mean so you're probably
better off going with a different type
of company anyway but i just thought i'd
share this story alright guys thanks for
watching and thank you for helping me
