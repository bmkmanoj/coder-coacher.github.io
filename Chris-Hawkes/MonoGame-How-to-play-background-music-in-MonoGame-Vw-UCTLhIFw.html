and this game that we got going on here
it's a very basic game all we're doing
is bringing in a image in this video
though it is geared towards getting a
background song to play preferably like
a mp3 which a lot of people have on
their machines just FYI I don't have
copyright or anything of the song this
is for demonstration purposes and
obviously you need to have permission on
whatever sort of music you plan on using
if you're going to distribute a game for
public consumption but that being said
let's go ahead and add in this this
music so what we want to do a sense it's
an mp3 I want to play we're gonna say
private and we're going to bring in song
and I'm just going to call this
background music alright so we got this
joint and you'll see that if you do that
you have to import media so if if you
did not prompt you to do that you need
to do that so now that we've done that
we need to go ahead and load the actual
song and we plan on using so just like
we loaded our image from the tutorials
before we want to go ahead and load this
song and we'll go ahead and say
background music equals content load and
then in here we're saying what it's
loading it's a song and then we give it
the location where it's going to be so
we'll say sounds and then we'll say deer
tragedy is what we'll call it right and
inside sounds I'm going to go ahead and
say add existing item now I want to go
ahead and find out wherever my audio is
that ain't it
alright sorry music iTunes itunes music
Bayside Bayside and so we're bringing
this
okay I want to change the name so it
actually matches not sure what the hell
in m4a is that I hope that works I'm not
actually tried that before if that does
not work what to do like an mp3 I'm not
sure if this will work but the actual
fundamentals of getting at the play
would would be just fine
but that might be a problem so let's go
and continue on for right now and the
final thing we need to do is we actually
need to play it and we're going to do
that a lot of times we need load stuff
you end up doing things in your update
but in this particular case we're gonna
actually say right after we load it will
say media player dot play and then we
just say background music okay I know
that should be it let's go ahead and try
to run this here and see if it has a
problem
so it says
yeah it looks like that is gonna be a
problem all right so that failed
miserably let's go ahead and get rid of
that in for a maybe a problem or
definitely is a problem hopefully just
work around I don't know at this point
so let's go ahead and we'll describe
another file which is definitely an mp3
here I want to change this will just
call this I'm gonna keep it one name so
all right so it's name in the file and
we can go ahead and start it and it
should play it's building right now if
you don't know some build succeeded
all right so that is all there is
through playing music so we went ahead
and we set media player stop or media
player I'm sorry play enemy and give it
this song to actually play as far as the
mp4 a or whatever the other thing is we
could work on building a converter or
something for that later on but right
now it looks like that is not supported
so you can say media player if at a
later time in your game you want to stop
you can actually tell it to stop you
know at any sort of time that you want
or to play something different but
anyway guys thanks for watching and
please subscribe bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
