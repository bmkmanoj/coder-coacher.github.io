want to show you how you can send casper
arguments so that instead of actually
hard coding the thing that you're
actually searching right here we can go
ahead and just send it an argument when
we fire up our casper program so when we
start interacting because later on these
tutorial is going to show you how to
integrate Python with Casper which I
find the best way you know have a lot of
used python the process a lot of things
and evaluate what is it going to do next
and then you know i essentially have
Python calling casper scripts and and
reading the output so one of the one of
the things you have to do in that case
is you do have to have variables that
you can insert into your casper program
so that it responds appropriately all
right so here is our search feature so
all we got to do is just say casper dots
elig it and then in here we're going to
give it the argument number so in this
case we don't have an argument that we
this is going to be argument one because
we start counting it at zero so let's go
ahead and try to run this program the
same way that we did before so we're
going to take one extra step so when we
run this we need to give it the argument
and the argument needs to be in quotes
so we're going to go ahead and just say
noob movies com so it's the exact same
thing that we searched before except
this time Casper's getting that argument
from our command line and inserting it
here in the search all right so it's
going to run this
alright so it appears to have ran the
same way that it ran before let's just
go ahead and make sure that it worked
yeah it did work so grab the exact same
thing you can see that is different at
the top so it's a different screenshot
it worked work just like we wanted to so
that's how you add a variable to your
Casper program thank you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
