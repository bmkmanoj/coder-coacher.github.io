give my thoughts on the latest
distributed denial-of-service attack
that occurred in the United States today
which took down the playstation network
at different times it took down like
major websites like to New York Times
Netflix at sea a ton of other including
Amazon actually they were all targets to
a major major denial of service attack
and this may have been like the largest
one ever seen it's a relatively
interesting one and I'm not a security
expert or anything like that but I have
been saying for the longest time that
cybersecurity is going to be a huge huge
huge industry and if you guys are
looking to make a lot of money and you
truly want to be experts in your field
if you're an expert in cybersecurity
like you will be in the most demand
problem it's so fluid and but at the
same time I feel like it's going to be a
stressful last job tube so I'm not sure
how much you value you know stress and
how well you handle it because I feel
like if you can't handle stress very
well it's probably not the best industry
so anyway what is this denial of service
attack I'm not an expert at this but I
do know from the distributed denial of
services you have these things which are
botnets botnets are infected PCs a lot
of times you won't even know that your
pc is affected and you could just you
could be a part of a botnet and not even
know it so essentially though if your
computer is affected one person at the
click of a button can send all the
infected people and sometimes it's
hundreds of thousands to hit one target
and by hitting all the target it can hit
the target with a bunch of requests and
the request can be packets of data that
are sent across the internet but tcp/ip
I guess anyway sends these packets and a
lot of times that the data is bogus and
it can't handle it it just gets bogged
down until it doesn't work anymore
typically what we've seen in the past
though is we've seen these DDoS OS
attacks against certain targets like a
couple years ago we saw that PlayStation
Network attack which I mean that
really pissed me off because right
around Christmas everybody's getting new
games I remember me and my brother had
off
work we're going to play you know some
video games some of the new stuff we got
and everything and we couldn't nobody
could I mean these this at these
assholes from the lizard squad tried to
ruin it for everybody just for the lulz
you know just to be a douchebag
but he ended up they were targeting
basically a few specific targets
PlayStation Network xbox and they were
doing it just to be a prick and all they
had to do was basically get access to it
infected botnet which is it really i
think they got it through a service that
i already had all these infected
computers and then they can essentially
just hit a few key commands and just
flood the playstation network servers
and an xbox servers to the point where
they come crashing down and they can't
handle any traffic so it's not a very
sophisticated threat but it's almost
impossible to prevent so there are
things that are put in place to prevent
and I guess try to sniff out when large
amounts of traffic are being directed to
it at one time that maybe it can go off
service or go offline until the attack
stops because once it starts I know that
I've had a situation where my server
starts olm in which stands for like out
of memory or something like that so it
starts reading from disk and by the time
it starts doing that it literally
becomes unresponsive I can barely
communicate with it I can't even tell to
restart sometimes I have to go into my
virtual private server and I've had to
actually reboot the entire system
because that was the only way to
actually get it and if you reboot like
your entire network whether it's
playstation network or whatever it could
take a long time for these things to
come back up there's probably tests in
place to make sure thing that guys suck
so in this video so I ready to make sure
my videos don't just play right after
I'm done editing them but anyway so that
that whole situation it just it sucked
over there and the end of the kid that
was responsible was this kid here man I
mean he's just I don't know why I man
but he's just a dick so he ended up
getting arrested and charged with a
bunch of bogus stuff he was a minor and
I'll be honest like so the point to put
the real question that was asked him it
was like how do I feel about this and
the thing is is that in a way I'm like I
don't give a what people's cause is
you are like when you're when you're
encrypting an entire file system for a
library and people might die because of
what you're doing even if you hurt you
know some economy you're hurting like
everyday typical people for your
 cause so whether it's like in a
lot of times like you know oh yeah you
can't play your video games big deal
well what about all the money that like
Sony lost all the game makers that
actually produce content a lot of these
 actually enjoy you know they all
lose money when goes offline like
that so today was a day where people
probably lost you know accumulative
billions of dollars not just in the
United States but across the entire
world that ends up happening effect on
smaller people so that brings up the
next point what do you do about these
people and the comment that was made was
like you know this could be a cyber
warfare is almost as dangerous and
almost as deadly and bad as an actual
war where we're killing each other so
it's like the next thing that comes to
mind is like do we start using these
guys to start dropping bombs on these
little that are doing this from
you know whatever country or hiding spot
that they're doing it from and if it's
in the United States or whatever else I
mean the thing is is like people have to
be brought to justice for doing what
they're going because if they don't like
this is it's a game but at the
same time it's like well how is our
internet and as sophisticated as we are
in modern-day society why is our
internet built on these these protocols
that can come crashing down so easily
like why can't we stop one of the
easiest hacking attempts that exists in
mankind and you know it's just it's
something that idiot trolls can actually
do and they always get caught by the way
too so anybody who thinks oh yeah I'm
going to be cool i'm gonna get my name
like eventually you might get killed is
what's going to end up happening you're
going to end up pissing somebody off to
the point where people are just going to
get they're going to go missing that's
what's going to end up happening because
they're causing way too much damage look
at Kim calm chem calm was the creator of
megaupload a German citizen lived in
Thailand I believe at one point or Hong
Kong or two I don't remember but he ends
up being in New Zealand which is a very
very neutral country it doesn't really
abide by a lot of the
the laws of the united states of
extradition and stuff and typically if
the United States wants somebody they
can typically get them i mean you can
ask Pakistan and Osama bin Laden I mean
they flew Apache helicopters into a
nation without even warning them and
took out Osama bin Laden they they mess
with Kim calm all the way over in a
country that should have been like you
know worshipping and praising him
because he had like a 30 million dollar
mansion or something like that on their
beautiful countryside and the thing is
that Kim calm was doing that other
people weren't because he wasn't the
only service at the time that was
ripping off American and worldwide
copyright in order to you know they knew
exactly what they were doing basically
and a lot of people use megaupload they
used it for books they use it for movies
some people could afford it and they
just you know they chose to steal some
people probably couldn't buy it in their
country and chose to to download it
whatever the reason may be this guy was
basically laughing in the face of the
United States government when he did
like his music video where he's on a
yacht and he's got you know these
dancing women on his yacht and
everything I he's basically smacking
everybody in the face and eventually the
FBI was able to get him I mean to the
point we're like they've made his life a
living hell for the last several years
ever since his the megaupload was taken
down and it's still it's still taken
down if you talked to Kim calm about it
you know there's some harsh feelings
towards the United States government but
the thing is is like eventually I mean
you can't you can't do some of this
you know what I mean like I mean it's
affecting too many people like we are
it's affecting people's way of life and
I don't really care what somebody's
personal ambition is for doing it all I
know is that it sucks when I can't come
home and I can't turn on my playstation
or my son can't play the playstation or
something like that because some dick
just wants to be a dick you know that
sucks and I think that it needs to be
dealt with but I'm not really sure how
you can do that and I don't really think
that somebody deserves to die over it
but at the same time you're doing more
damage in many cases and then actual
small wars so what can be done I mean in
this particular case this this appears
to be and it could watch
I don't know what it appears to heard a
rumor that with the recent things that's
happened with WikiLeaks and Julian
Assange is the the swedish hacker a very
good hacker who very smart hacker who
was able he started wikileaks he's been
seeking asylum and the ecuador embassy
in london for the last like four years
because he doesn't want to face sexual
assault charges in Sweden which he
denies but I think they're secretly he's
worried probably that if England or the
UK gets their hands on them or the
United States somehow gets their hands
on him that he's never going to see the
light of day again because he's
absolutely hated by a lot of these
nations where he's released a lot of you
know government secrets and things like
that secrets that have had major major
implications on all kinds of different
things so he he had his internet
disconnected just couple days ago it was
big news and people were like you know
as he dead and all this other stuff well
if we remember back several years ago
when WikiLeaks funding got cut because
of some of the releases that they did
with like the Bradley Manning thing and
all that stuff I remember anonymous came
in and they started attacking credit
card purchase as well as Amazon they
were trying to bring amazon down they
couldn't do it but through the same
means of a distributed denial-of-service
attack they were able to bring like Visa
and MasterCard all these people down
because they had cut like I guess
funding donation funding to the
WikiLeaks project because you know they
were seen in such unfavorable light and
the United from the United States you
know because the government was so
pissed off so you know there was this
retaliatory strike so with the latest
news a couple days ago if his internet
got shut down a lot of people are saying
that his you know this is like the the
repercussion or the the revenge being
sought by his followers who are
basically trying to shut down the entire
Internet of the United States in
retaliation for the reason why Julian
Assange got his internet cut down by the
Ecuador embassy and a lot of people are
like well why is that happening is it
because he's releasing so many of this
you know so many secrets and all these
emails and things from Hillary Clinton
and people think that it's all related
possibly and I don't know for sure but
I probably shouldn't even be speculating
on my channel because I get enough
traffic on this that I could end up
you're perpetuating things forward I've
talked about this as well I don't want
to be the source of some you know
 that spreads across the
internet but I just think it's
interesting if that were true I'm not
saying it's true I don't know anything
about it but it's just you know it's
it's mysteriously a couple days after
what happened to him and I know in the
past that you know Anonymous has come to
his rescue to try to attack you know
people that have gone after him now the
thing that that is different about this
distributed denial-of-service attack
though is that the attacks occurred at
the DNS level so they went after a
company that handles dns records and dns
records or how it's basically the phone
book right so it's the the ability that
if you go and you put in google com that
you it's going to use DNS search
settings and search records that tell
you which IP like actual IP address to
go to go to a Google server so that is
all done through dns settings and
there's major companies that are being
paid to handle dns records for major
major companies like Netflix and Etsy
and Twitter and all these other
companies and when they so they weren't
the source of the attack it was actually
there you know their company that they
thought that that that does this well
for them was actually the the attack
target and it turns out it was very very
very effective so you know whether or
not it was the Russians or anybody else
I mean who the hell knows but all I know
is that it's it's majorly devastating
when it comes to how expensive these
attacks can be and you know whether or
not it warrants in and somebody you know
being put to death or anything like that
like it's it's it's a big deal like I
know during that whole I remember
hearing it during that whole thing where
North Korea was mad about that movie
that Seth Rogen had released called the
interview with James Franco where they
were upset because it was portraying
their you know their leader in a bad
light and they ended up you know
attacking sony and Sony Corporation of
America actually even though there were
Japanese country they they you know they
do a lot of business in the United
States everything and and they did some
major damage to the sony corporation
obvious
the Sony executive vice president lost
their job and things like that and in
the United States apparently in
retaliation was able to essentially
disconnect their entire internet for
their entire country and they did it for
like a day or two through the same means
that we distributed denial-of-service
attack but it was done through these on
DNS I think records and China or
something like that or because there's
basically like for DNS companies or I
don't know the specifics of it but I
know that North Korea gets their
internet through the through the actual
through China so they were able to take
out effectively the entire internet for
their entire country anyway hopefully we
can all get past this one day or at
least come up with a protocol that's not
so subsist susceptible to you know easy
attack hacking and things like that let
me know what you guys think and take
care of have a good night bye hey guys
so a lot of you asked me how do I get my
foot in the door to become a programmer
and I just wanna take a moment to
mention dev Mountain coding boot camp is
