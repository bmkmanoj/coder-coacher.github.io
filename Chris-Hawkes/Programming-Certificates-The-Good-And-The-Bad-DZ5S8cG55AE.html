several times I get this question all
the time
and it really I just want to focus on a
little bit different I want to make a
different point than the points that
I've made in the past and I may have
briefly mentioned this but basically I'm
going to call myself out there as a not
an intentional bullshitter but that you
know somebody that can and
maybe me and not intentionally
let me explain okay so somebody asked me
what they what I think of you dasa T and
you know basically he said he got an
Android certification in Udacity and he
doesn't know if it was worth it so
there's all kinds of different you know
degrees that you can get and Udacity I'd
never gone there so I'm not an expert by
any means on this this project here or
this this platform but let me go ahead
and take a look at something here so 750
dollars for 3 months of access ideal for
one to two so basically this isn't
expensive this is an expensive course I
mean $750 a lot of money and you can see
it's citing base salaries of Android
developers going from 44,000 all the way
to 150 so they're trying to sell some
false hope there I mean I think that you
know that you take our Android course
you're gonna be some sort of expert I
think if you go to Udacity and you take
an Android course the next thing you
need to do as they you're gonna need to
build some Android apps and get them
into the app market so the question is
do you need Udacity to be able to do
that or can you just go ahead and
release Android apps to the to the
market one of the ways you can release
Android apps to the market one of the
things that I was working on was the
unity engine so the unity engine you
don't have to know Android you know that
Android SDK front and back Android SDK
typically people are writing in Java and
using you know that whole nightmare
which I feel is a nightmare because I'm
not a big Java guy but with unity I mean
you have this nice little engine you can
create some basic games or even apps
maybe you want to do a trivia game look
a trivia craft was so popular for so
long
unity can make you in fact you can even
download entire trivia applications that
already been written and just kind of
reface him if you wanted to I don't know
that you're gonna learn a time doing
that you're probably gonna have some
major frustration I would start off
small and go big but the point is is
that Udacity isn't the only place that
you can learn about Android programming
there's also the you know the fact that
Android studio is free you can even
create stuff on react native but this
video isn't really about whether or not
you dasa tea is the best place to learn
Android development Coursera is
obviously getting very popular and it
has a lot of the major universities you
can take these courses you can get a
certification from places like Penn
State Johns Hopkins Stanford all these
different places and and a lot of these
courses are very very involved and I
wish I had time to actually take them
and and study for them but damn I'm
trying to finish my own degree at this
point but these these Coursera courses
are interesting because the other day
I've read an article where somebody had
said you know what they have learned
after ten thousand interviews of
interviewing coders for programming jobs
and they were looking at you know the
major criteria of ten thousand people
interviewed you know what stood out as
being one of the most helpful helpful
criteria that basically paid off or
panned out for the employers that were
looking to hire the talent so when I say
ten thousand I actually misspoke I was
quite a bit office 3000 it's still a lot
especially when you're interview three
thousand separate people that's a lot of
interviews but it's off of this blog on
interviewing that I oh and she was
basically saying some of the criteria
she explains all different criteria she
looked at but one of the three things
that were that stood out was that the
the best candidates had courses from
both Coursera and Udacity so that I
think is very very telling I mean I'm
interested to see whether or not it was
a fluke or whatever but a top company
means you know did they work at Google
or Microsoft or Facebook or one of these
other major IT companies and top school
is obviously Stanford or MIT or
something like that so those three
criteria were the three most important
criteria like didn't give a about
founder to start
four years of experience or master's
degrees and you can even throw in a PhD
at that point but this isn't like set in
stone information but it is very very
helpful for people that want to maybe
consider Udacity or Coursera for their
courses the problem is neither one of
them are free and they're both
relatively expensive and really the jury
is still out on whether or not these
things are going to pan out
now there's also coding boot camps which
is my sponsor death mountain coding boot
camp they sponsored this video by the
way and make sure you guys check out the
link in the description tab below if
you're interested they have courses on
angular react they focus on top
technology that companies are using
right now and it's 12 and 16 week
intensive courses so that by the time
you get out you have you know your brain
filled up with all the modern technology
that that is relevant to the industry so
comparing some of the stuff that you can
learn about on Udacity coding boot camps
whatever I have compared that to like a
CIS course that I took at my Community
College in Virginia and it was a it was
a friggin joke you know the information
I was learning about like cloud
computing like it was some brand-new
thing you know and here we are you know
we've been talking about cloud computing
for damn you know what ten years now so
you know a lot of the that they're
teaching you in these colleges I mean
it's already outdated by the time you
even get out into the industry and you
know there's so many different things
like if you learn some basic c-sharp
that doesn't mean that you're going to
be prepared to be an asp.net web
developer that knows how to do sequel
queries and what a object relational
mapper is or how to use entity framework
and let alone CSS and JavaScript and all
the technology that goes along with that
or source control repositories
multi-tiered development you know you
just don't learn that in college
you end up learning that when you get
out of college now what college is going
to end up teaching you that you know
people like me don't have there's a lot
of the you know the theoretical things a
lot of the physics and the math that I
lack
I can I can get up to date in fact I do
do math on Khan Academy to try to get up
to date on certain things but I'm still
quite a bit behind I feel like if where
I want to be when it comes to math but
as a web developer I don't need to do a
whole lot of math
so there's not a whole lot of math
involved I just I'm personally seeking
that from my own ambition now here's one
of the main points I want to drill upon
when I first started this video I was
talking about it
Udacity offers these sort of
certificates and so they're not
like as far as I know they're not signed
off on by like the Department of
Education none of that stuff even exists
I mean we saw what happened when the US
federal government with ITT Tech which
was basically a course really
an entire school that was just selling
 degrees to people to get money
from the American taxpayer for federal
aid and these kids were going to the
school
they wouldn't learn they'd come out
and everybody knew anybody that went to
ITT Tech was you know probably not a
very good candidate for the job because
it was a joke of this school now with
hipster code this is a website that I
created so I have courses that I have on
YouTube some of these courses are
relatively highly regarded I mean like
my Python for beginners is very popular
I went ahead and I created an option for
people to be able to sign up and when
you take the course and usually actually
go through the entire thing it's all
optional but you can take the beginning
Python quiz so you take the quiz you
move your register you login you take
the quiz this thing used to take you to
the quiz that you were on now that's a
mode that I have whatever anyway you
take the quiz you can you can if you get
a passing grade you can get a
certificate and the certificate was not
meant to be like hey hang this on
the wall and tell all your friends you
got a certificate of achievement from
hipster cocom it was about building
skills about you know being a little bit
more interactive on my website it's
something I'm continuing to develop and
work on but my point I'm trying to drive
home here is that Chris Hawkes as a
business owner in Virginia as somebody
who's interested in tech and and
probably somebody that is certified to
at least give their opinion on tech may
not be a certified teacher but you know
I'm not claiming that anyway so it's
like you know it's all it's it's up to
individual people whether or not they
want to take these courses or whether or
not they even want to pay the money to
get signed up it's like ten dollars for
a year and even then I have so few
paying customers that I'm probably going
to give them unlimited acts
for the amount of time that I have on
the site just because you know there's
so few of them and I've had the site for
like six months now but you know that's
that's not a big deal but you know this
whole certificate thing it's it's no
different than Khan Academy coming up
with a point based system where you get
like you know points that you earn and
and they're so arbitrary they don't mean
really much of anything at least at the
moment but eventually points do matter
like where points one didn't matter with
Stack Overflow
they matter now or at least they used to
matter there was a time where people
were like trying to focus on like what's
your Stack Overflow score now we know
that there are flaws and things that you
know there are problems with the way
Stack Overflow is run and and the
advantage is that people that were
getting into the door a long time ago
have over newbies and things like that
but the point is is that if you're John
ski on Stack Overflow you could get a
freaking job anywhere because anybody
that's on Stack Overflow and has c-sharp
questions
knows who John skeet is dudes certified
genius you know he's like he knows
everything or Eric Lippert you know he
knows some of the craziest about
c-sharp why because you know he happened
to be developing it at Microsoft but
these guys are absolutely phenomenal
even Daniel Rosemond from the UK and the
Django framework I mean there are guys
that you know they build up this point
system which used to be this arbitrary
kind of game type of thing where you
know now it's a big-ass deal so maybe
hipster code is this you know fledgling
little one-man startup bootstrapped
operation that I created from my own
home one day it could be a bigger thing
you know you never know audacity has
grown quite a bit Coursera is growing
quite a bit the jury is out on all of
this stuff all I know is that the
American college system is a complete
 racket the amount of money that
you have to pay for you know these these
courses these books that where
they have 27 editions of accounting 1 so
that you can buy a new book from
mcgraw-hill every six months that
you know then it's such and
kids are coming out of college now
strapped with $100,000 in debt many of
them can't get high-paying jobs
granted programming is a very lucrative
career right now we don't know where
it's going to be 10 years from now we're
quickly trying to automate as much stuff
as we possibly
and we've made programming much easier
than it used to be.we offshore we have
global competition at least in the
United States everywhere you know it's a
lucrative field right now but we don't
know how lucrative it's gonna be 10 15
years down the road we do know that
college though has gotten ridiculously
expensive since really in the 1980s it's
just exploded in cost and it's just not
paying paying off and dividends and when
it comes to IT and computer programming
I was talking to a buddy yesterday and
you know this guy's been a contractor
for major defense firms throughout the
United States you know major defense
contractors some of them you know the
major ones like Northrop Grumman things
like that and um you know this guy is
like I you know he's been an IT now for
12 years or so and he said the smartest
guy that he's ever been that he's ever
worked with by far was a guy that went
to high school never went to college I
mean so computer science you know
creative drive that stuff can sometimes
trump you know even you know raw skills
I mean look at some of like some people
might you know lack raw skills when it
comes to math and we've talked about
whether or not it's genetic or
hereditary and and things like that but
there are certain extent examples of
people that you wouldn't want to be like
that are so goddamn smart that so for
instance look at Kurt gödel one of the
smartest mathematicians to ever exist
and I mean there are things in in math
and logic that that are still attributed
to him he went there was a time he was
at Princeton with Einstein
we run Stein constantly you know
glorified this guy's you know instinct
sort of natural intellect and and they
would have conversations walking and
things like that eventually this guy and
maybe it was just mental you know
degenerative Nisour whatever but he
ended up he ended up getting these
phobias and things where he would refuse
to eat unless his wife taste-tested the
food or prepared food for him and when
she became hospitalized for six months
and is later part of his life like this
stupid was just working constantly and
his attic and and refused to eat and
literally starved himself to death so
you know there there's there are certain
people that have such a beautiful mind
that
it could even be you know a travesty so
when when I'm gonna continue to drill
upon this I think you know this year at
least I'm on this kick right now that
let's focus on making awesome things
focus on doing what it is that you feel
like programming is gonna do that you
can contribute to programming I don't
care if it's in you know industries that
you feel like you know whether it can
make money or not make money or maybe
it's not as good as some new tool or
something like that the thing is is like
people just need to focus on I think
building things and making things better
and you know don't worry about any sort
of natural intellect that you may or may
not possess I think through hard work
and dedication people can overcome
certain things and beyond that that's
really all I got for the night guys so
is who is Udacity worth it I don't know
is hipster code worth it yeah sure I own
it so I'm going to promote it but you
know the average Joe might tell you I'm
full of and you know I can go
myself so it's up it's up to you guys
you know people will eventually make
their own assumptions about it and
hopefully it'll get better but right now
it's not anywhere near what I want it to
be but an IT project is never finished
so the only problem I have right now is
I don't feel like working on it all
right guys take care of have a good day
