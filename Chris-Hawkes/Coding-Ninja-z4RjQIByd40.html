I'm immediately skeptical of is when I
see a job or a recruiter or something
something along those lines reach out to
me for a position where they're like
we're looking for a programming ninja so
I was like I've seen it many times where
they they list a job a JavaScript ninja
like seven years of the samurai the
secrets of the samurai like coding rock
star all this like I
immediately might decide to become
skeptical of any job that has any sort
of recruiter that is reaching out form
to me for something like that so for
whatever reason I've been getting a lot
of recruiters reaching out to me like I
mean a lot a lot of different companies
it's mostly recruiters sometimes it's
from like straight companies in fact one
of the cool things I thought was was
Facebook summer herder that actually
worked for Facebook reached out but she
probably doesn't know what I do is for
Instagram is New York City and on stuff
but anyway the recruiters that are
reaching out like I have one person it
was like coding and something ninja or
something another and I even the company
his name was like ninja something or
another and I guess I shouldn't blast
them on this channel but dude you you
have a terrible name for a recruiting
company and to be honest with you man
with senior developers like we joke
about this kind of thing because like
coding rockstars and ninjas and
don't exist man like it's just it makes
our entire profession sound stupid so if
you're looking for like senior level it
like to meet it jumps out to me that oh
you're looking for a junior developer
you're looking for somebody who's got a
little bit of like react and angular
experience and can set up some stacks
maybe in nodejs or something like that
you're not looking for like you know
some experience dotnet developer or a
Java developer an Android developer
anything like that you're looking for a
newbie so maybe you're not looking for a
newbie but for the most part like for
all the senior devs I've talked to we
just kind of joke around about you know
Kljestan people are when they're going
around looking for programmers and
things like that asking for for ninjas
and secrets of the samurai and
everything so anyway I just thought I
would share my thoughts that it's
completely ridiculous and stupid and for
the most part with jobs like that you're
probably looking at a place that's very
startup II and probably a place that I
would say you may not want to work for
depending on you know what I would
think that if that is the Job
Description it's probably a complete
hellhole another could be kegs in the in
the floor you know I mean like so you
open up some sort of secret panel and or
hell maybe the keg is right next to your
desk I don't know but if that's the kind
of thing you're looking for maybe that's
kind of ninja and then just skills that
you know where the ninja skills will
land you most likely but uh I you know
not even to knock that but there was
this other recruiter that reached out to
me and if somewhat on a similar note
they they had a job description where it
was like in the Job Description they're
like you know that you you mandatorily
a door it says something along the lines
of that it was mandatory that that you
go to like a one javascript convention
like bi-weekly or something like that or
it was like you know some coding
convention it's like dude you like
people are interested in things because
they want to be interested but like you
start like putting you know requirements
on people that attend coding conferences
and stuff like that like that's it that
is just excessive and like that's
another leg thing that just immediately
jumps out at me like oh I'm not going to
be a good fit there that's not going to
work for me not saying that there's
anything wrong with coding conventions
but like dude if you live in Richmond or
DC or something like that you're going
to have a decent amount of like coding
in hell not even rich man but like DC or
New York City or San Francisco you're
going to have a lot of different coding
conventions and things that you can go
to not leaving conventions there could
they call it developer meetups because
we don't want to be dorks and be
considered ninjas so we have to call it
you know not a convention from you know
really what it is we call them you know
meetups but anyway sometimes it's easier
to go to meetups depending on you
obviously your geographic location or
even
you know how much responsibility you
have in your day-to-day affairs but just
another thing that just recently like a
recruiter reached out and like sent me
this big job description for this
company in Tyson's Corner which I would
never want to go to Tyson's anyway but
you know that was just something I read
no it's just like nothing like like I
said it doesn't even matter that like I
like I would go to a meet-up I have no
problems going to meetups man if it's
convenient if it's like something that
you know that I have time to do but like
to make it some sort of mandatory job
requirement like you're out of your
 mind that's crazy
the fact of the matter is like we should
all be wanting to be better developers
we should be coding at work and and and
building up our skills and if we have
time to do stuff on the side or at home
we're going to continue to do that you
could start your own YouTube channel you
can do whatever you want but like if it
was like hey Chris uh we're gonna hire
you this job is mandatory got two three
three videos a week it'd be you know
that it it's no fun at that point man it
really isn't and yeah anyways that's
about it guys I'm just going to go ahead
and drop off here but thanks for
watching guys and uh you guys I keep
saying guys there's some girls that
watch me too but everybody take care
