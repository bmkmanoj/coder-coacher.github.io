to talk about WYSIWYG editors and and
also get your advice just to figure out
if you if there's something out there
that I'm not familiar with when it comes
to WYSIWYG first I need to explain what
that is it stands for what you see is
what you get so when you're writing
blogs for anything that's gonna be
displayed inside of a browser you're
writing an HTML so HTML like you're
using paragraph tags or anchor text
things like that but like if you're just
trying to write and not have to put all
of your text inside of actual P tags and
and anchor tags and things like that
then you're gonna want to use a WYSIWYG
because it stands for what you see is
what you get you write and then it's
actually creating the HTML that's gonna
be put inside of a browser for you so
you're not having to deal with putting
things inside of tags and when it comes
to WYSIWYG there's basically three
options there is like what I consider
one of the the most I guess commercial
options of the three which is the CK
editor and this has been around for at
least 10 years or more it's used by
major companies the downside of using a
product like this is that the API I
don't think is all that easy to work
with in fact most WYSIWYG API is our
nightmare to work with
but in this particular case a lot of
major companies are paying the premium
to use CK editor you're actually freely
allowed to use CK editor in your website
I believe but also check a license on
this I'm not an attorney obviously but
the the license I believe you are
allowed to use it but if you go to
distribute your source code or if you're
even trying to sell like a website that
you own or something like that and
that's part of your source code you're
gonna need to have a commercial license
so that I could end up biting you in the
ass like lay down later on down the road
so for that reason like I don't use CK
editor myself the next one which has
been around just as long as tiny mice or
tiny tiny MCE I believe people call it
tiny - that'sthat's what I've always
called it even though it's not really
spelled that way but we love our
acronyms and i.t now this is a pretty
phenomenal project but once again the
API itself is actually very difficult to
work with and it also has somewhat of a
restrictive
instead that is saying that you can you
can go to distribute it but you can't
actually change the source code and and
that you know also has to obviously
remain in place for whoever you
distribute the source to so for that
reason like tiny mice it really is the
King on the block I think when it comes
to actual widespread usage and the
reason why is because WordPress actually
uses tiny mice in their in their project
you know it and if it's not called tiny
mice I'm setting a goddamn trend right
now I'm setting everybody should just
call it that because Chris hogs call
today I have no idea how you pronounce
it I've actually never talked to other
people about the product itself so I
wouldn't even like I just call it tiny
mice anyway call it whatever the hell
you want but if we call it tiny mice and
wasn't being called that before I'll
take credit for it it's kind of like my
SQL or sequel it doesn't really matter
but if you say SK well then you just
sound like a jackass I'm just playing a
lot of people say it that way and I'm
just a YouTube content creator so don't
get offended by anything I say please
anyway guys so WordPress is obviously
one of the most popular blogs on the PHP
platform PHP using the PHP language and
and they use tiny mice in their project
so so clearly tiny mice is able to be
distributed and once again if you look
inside WordPress the source code you're
probably going to see tiny mices license
in there as well so is that that is a
good now the benefit of a product like
this is that it does have plugins
available for links for imaging as far
as I know it also supports video and
then that leaves basically there's an
awesome option if you're looking for a
WYSIWYG that just works and has it
pretty free to use license and I
definitely recommend tiny mice and then
the new kid on the block is quill and
I've talked about quill quite a bit i'm
actually using quill on a on a website
that i own and this is like I think the
closest thing that I've seen to like a
Microsoft Word type of experience that
works inside of a browser the downside
with with quill is that it is very new
and it is somewhat buggy like the editor
itself is actually I find it to be
somewhat troubling and frustrating
use especially having to like deal with
like formatting like sometimes if I'm
doing a header like I have to like I
can't just press ENTER and wants to do
another header or it's like stuck in the
middle of the page so I have to like
click off of the button to make it to
make it go back to its normal position
but that's all to be expected this
project is actually created by a guy
named Jason Chen who works for
Salesforce it's actually a project been
going on for about since 1 2014 and
really started to take off in the last
like year and a half so I expect that
we're gonna see a lot more improvements
with quill and eventually this is going
to be like the successor to both of the
other previous ones and there's
certainly a market for it
the downside with quill though is it has
no table support so if you need
something and unfortunately this is a
requirement for a lot of people that
documents exist in like Word docs or
Excel Docs they can be in tables and
things like that
well Microsoft Word is proprietary it's
owned by Microsoft so if you wanted to
take a table that's inside of Microsoft
and copy that and paste it in the quote
it's not gonna work in fact no tables
work and quote whatsoever and basically
it's a feature that's been requested
since 2014 on github I noticed so even
the creator at that time was like well
tables are going to be very very
difficult to implement but right now
there's no table support whatsoever
which is kind of a deal-breaker for a
lot of people but the licenses is very
flexible and if anybody ever wants to
get involved in and handle that then and
then that would be great
another thing that's interesting about
quill is it uses this the data itself is
stored in this JSON format called a
Delta and basically the quill is reading
the Delta to then render it on to the
page and everything but it reads this
JSON object and then it's creating HTML
elements based off of attributes on on
individual individual items from within
that JSON object so quill is a good
project for sure I definitely recommend
it but if you have any sort of table
support or any sort of copy and paste
where you kind of need things verbatim
copy and paste it from word into quill
then you definitely want to stick with
tiny mice
is tiny mice at least has some table
support you're gonna end up losing some
of your formatting and things like that
but for right now it's probably the most
robust solution so by to pick any of the
three it's gonna be tiny mice with quill
being second and ckeditor being third
unless you can afford the license with
ckeditor that maybe that is a better
that would be the best but for the
typical right the middle developers out
there that don't want to spend a bunch
of extra money I would check out tiny
mice or quote
alright guys thanks for watching have a
good day so this video was brought to
you by a dead mountain coding boot camp
they're a boot camp that is based out of
Utah but they're also in Texas in
Arizona now and they have very good
reviews so make sure you guys check them
out the link is in the description tab
below they offer courses in web
development iOS development UX or user
experience design Quality Assurance and
just a few other ones in fact they're
even getting into Salesforce as well now
so they're continuing to adapt their
courses based on what the market needs
are and major companies are hiring some
of their alumni so make sure you guys
give them a look they have great reviews
and thanks for watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
