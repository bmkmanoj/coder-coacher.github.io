is going to be about object this new
shorthand it's an object notation so
basically in JavaScript there's object
being create and this is my object this
is a standard object really value so
it's like a dictionary and a lot of
different language we could say X
actually equals cash why the dog so that
way if you went and you said console dot
log my object dot X and that's going to
return cat so you gave it you know the
key and it actually returns the value so
if we go over here you can see cat gets
outputted I'm gonna zoom in old on that
probably too much there's cat alright so
you know we have the data that's already
there to create this object there's this
newer shorthand way of being able to do
it in JavaScript using es6 and that is
where we could actually have a bunch of
different variables like you know what
let's let's create like a band object so
band has a name so we'll take our name
equals okay that's my phantom I always
use them as an example then we can save
our origin equals Queens New York and
then John relative cutesleep right now
to John row and we'll just a rock or
alternative or whatever but now what I
can do is I can actually create an
object that I can save our band equals
and then I give it the object name but I
could just pass in strictly the three
values I've already declared surname
George in genre alright and then I'll go
ahead and console.log is band alright so
I just created a javascript object much
easier without is to identify the keys
and then the values I just simply had to
say the values and it's going to use the
actual variable name as its key so let's
go ahead and take a look at this and if
there we know I have an object with a
genre of rock and the name of Bayside
and the origin of Queens New York that's
actually there's actually much more
helpful than it may appear because you
know figure scraping the web and you're
trying to
this and that you know on each
individual band and you don't maybe
maybe don't have all the information to
create the object well this particular
catering is gravel a variable creature
object also that's a very end of
execution here so is it pretty cool I
think feature of vs6 and really this is
called object on ok or object notation R
objects out of creation object shorthand
creation and that's a better you guys to
make sure you'll vote and comment
subscribe thank you bye hey guys so a
lot of you asked me how do I get my foot
in the door to become a programmer and I
just want to take a moment to mention
Death Mountain coding boot camp is a
12-week intensive course that focuses on
the technologies of the here-and-now for
web development some of the things that
are actually teaching in the Suevi
course it's geared to get you into the
industry by focusing on things like
jQuery
nodejs react angular how to use github
so a lot of the things that you're going
to need to do as a developer as soon as
you start they're going to be teaching
you in this and this coding boot camp
and the entire goal is to be able to get
you into the industry within 12 weeks so
if you guys are interested in learning
more information about Deb mountain
coding boot camp just check out the link
in the description tab of this video
thank you for watching and have a good
day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
