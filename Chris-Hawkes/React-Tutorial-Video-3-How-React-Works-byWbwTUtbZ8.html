react code I want to go take just a
moment to get into a demonstration of
how react actually works so react it can
be thought of as a module system so
react handles complicated modules and if
we look at basically how to sum that up
react is all about building like
self-contained modules so this entire
square is one particular module and then
inside of this module we might have a
bunch of other modules like so here's
one module and then here's another
module and here's another one and these
things all do self-contained things so
if we went ahead and we said this is
module 3 and this is module 2 and here's
one but here's the master module
all right so that's sloppy writing but
that's the master now this react is
really good at maintaining states of
what a state state is the ability to
monitor changes based on like a user
logging in or changing some particular
thing and then all these other updates
happen because of that one change so
that's called state management that's
what react does really good at and
that's why everybody likes react so you
could have a server so that here's a
server sitting up here and then the
react components say this component is
master component is communicating with
the server so it's calling out to the
server every three seconds say and the
server is you know getting some data
processing and then it's passing the
data back to the component and because
react is smart it knows okay something
changed to this item right here let me
rerender the entire thing and it will
rerender all of the stuff so it knows
that a change was made another good
thing too is that you can reuse
components inside of the components so
like say this is a component that is
showing all the comments well your
comments could be one component so this
components basically being used over and
over and over again for each comment and
say this is a form to post new comments
right here and this is something else
they just like monitoring data but
ultimately they can all be managed
separately but react is keeping it all
inside the entire state of all this
stuff is inside the the react global
state container so this is all handled
for you this complicated question mark
of a mess is all being handled by react
for you and all you have to do is just
write your code in a specific way and
all this just works and is fluid
and is great so that is in a in a
nutshell you know how this this process
works but one of the things you want to
keep in mind is that this master
component is extremely important like
you want to have this top-down hierarchy
where here's the top and this might be
the second this is the third and this is
the fourth but this top this this outer
component is is the most key part so
it's very very key
all right guys so all that said I just
wanted to explain react at a high level
of how react works and how react should
be approached and looked at and in the
next video we're gonna go ahead and
actually get into writing some react
code and seeing it work alright guys
