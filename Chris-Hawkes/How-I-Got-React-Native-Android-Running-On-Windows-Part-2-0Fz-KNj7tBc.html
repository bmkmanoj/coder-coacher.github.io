part of this video this is a two-part
video series on trying to get react
native working on Android for Windows
specifically but this this process can
be followed probably no matter what
operating system you're on so if you
followed the project and you made the
awesome project in your command line by
using the react native CLI tools that
allow you to try to build the projects
and when you build a project if you were
to pull it up and some sort of IDE which
in in this case this is Android studio
which is free and you open the existing
project that was created for you using
the command-line tools so here it's all
here and I didn't I didn't change any of
this stuff so this is all just standard
react native code and the question is
how do you actually get this code so
that it works inside of an emulator for
that to happen in the previous video we
looked at installing the plug-in for
guinea motion which allows you to
actually launch the emulator directly
from the IDE which is that's all it
really does so you don't have to do that
you can actually just launch the IDE or
not ID but any motion from your your
Start menu if you want to do that so you
can launch that that way or you could
use it through the little button now
that you've installed the plug-in but
either way once it's open you're gonna
go ahead and you're gonna get a screen
similar to this and what you want to do
is just make sure you have a Google
device selected whatever sort of device
you want to test on any motions gonna
download all the stuff that you need in
order for it to run and then you just
click start so it takes a little while
but once it starts it actually brings up
an emulator so you have the emulator now
in order for this emulator to actually
run your Android react native
application you have to first things
first you have to say react native run
Android and rerun react native run
Android it needs to actually you need to
do this with your emulator running so
the emulator has to be running because
this is gonna actually go out and it's
going to detect that you do have a
running emulator and it's going to
install the project on the emulator this
was something that I didn't really
understand when I was first doing this
but I'm
one of the things you're going to notice
also is that I get a weird error message
stating that something like more than
one emulator detected so you can see all
these different emulators here so I'm
not sure why I have that many emulators
running I wish I didn't but either way
you can see build successful and that's
the important thing because it goes out
and it installs this awesome project on
the emulator in question now the next
thing you need to do because if we pull
up our emulator you now see that we have
awesome project installed on the
emulator so if I go ahead and try to run
it this should throw an error so this
throws this weird error message that
says that uh you know couldn't couldn't
let you try to reload jeaious and it
says could not connect to the
development server so what this means is
that you actually you have to actually
go to the directory where your
application is installed and you need to
say npm start because npm is it needs to
be running in order for this sdk to work
so that was another thing that i didn't
quite understand so this whole thing has
been a really big challenge but now that
you know this should hopefully help
other people out there as far as
actually being able to get the android
reader react application running and be
able to see the feedback which would be
nice so this thing is now listening so
you can see it's a should be ready now I
think so if we reload J us it's gonna
take a little bit longer and you can see
that is using NPM which is you know
something that's with no now we finally
have welcome to react native we're
finally running the actual project here
so here here's the text welcome to react
native so after all this time and all
this efforts that is how you get react
native working on Windows with getting
motion with emulators with Android SDK
with Android studio with react native in
Windows and any other environment out
there so guys thanks for watching and
please subscribe have a good day goodbye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
