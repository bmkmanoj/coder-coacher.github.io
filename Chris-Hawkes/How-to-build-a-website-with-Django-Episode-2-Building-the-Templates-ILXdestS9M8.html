a different recording software because
I've had massive problems with Adobe
captivate it's definitely not a good
screen capture software program
it seems to crash all the time I mean I
have plenty of resources that that thing
should me but it just randomly crashes I
lose all my stuff and then I get all
pissed off anyway be getting back to
where we were here let's go ahead and
build some stuff inside of our
navigation or template some have some
classes here I'm gonna have you 5 sepals
we're gonna header everything's gonna
sit inside the header the header is
gonna be 100% wedge so to do that I want
to have a game class equals rap inside
of the header now below the well inside
the rap I'm gonna have a navigation div
class and then inside here i'll have a
UL with some li elements and an anchor
tag inside of it right now you can just
do a pounce because we don't know where
it's gonna go it's been linked 1 to be 5
links at the top of this website so I am
going to just repeat this 5 times
all right so now that that is done
before this content I'm gonna go ahead
and add another I that should be good
inside the wrap here I want to have a
logo snap div class logo and then we're
also gonna add something called a clear
glass equals clear and now we need to go
ahead and create this class in our main
dot CSS so clear all it does is just
clear bone it's just a simple style and
we're gonna be using that a lot so it's
going to add that we want the width of
our application to the nine forty pixels
header is gonna be one hundred percent
with a really header is going to be
let's give it a height of 150 pixels
that's gotten bring in our logo the logo
that I'm bringing in is actually sitting
right here so if I look at the
properties of it you know the detail as
you can see that it's 168 and width 91
and height and we're also gonna float
this left so let's go ahead and look at
the application again we still have that
back black background the logo needs to
actually find the image let's go ahead
and set the background of it URL inside
here when I did dot dot images and then
lo BGC a GC semicolon on that and it's
changed this background color well we
can keep it black and actually change
the background color of this be pound of
FF to white so going back to this take a
look here all right so now we have this
now it's good and um into our navigation
and we want this to be with 100% and
then we want Li
we're gonna have this we'd gotten a view
L dot now you will ally and don't do a
little bit of math here I don't feel
like thinking about it in my head so I
know I have nine forty pixels and wit
I'm gonna divide that by 5 so 188 so
each one of these should be 188 pixels I
want the text alignment to be Center
they're gonna be floated and left and
then actually that mean I am the richest
display:inline-block let's see what that
does hopefully that puts everything in a
line that's good there's a lack of space
let's make sure that the padding is set
zero
let's just make sure now has a padding
of zero as well
we may have to have margin:0
that's fine for right now
now I review this full-size you see that
everything's sitting off - what the hell
not sure why that's not fitting
now that fits I don't know we'll worry
about that in a little bit so we need a
little bit more space between our logo
and the content below it so it's at a B
our statement below the logo it's a
quick PR and the we want to remove the
margin on the body as well so let's go
to the body and remove make sure padding
and margin is zero wrap should be
margin:0 auto and this will Center it in
the middle of the screen so depending on
how so it doesn't matter how wide the
device is its viewing it it'll center it
right in the middle also remove the
padding at the top which is what we want
still not much of a space between the
logo and the nav not sure what's up with
that time after the clear okay that's a
little bit better spacing now the
content inside here let's go ahead and
um I want to give the background color
of the header or something so I can tell
where it's sitting right now so if I go
to the header I may give it a background
color of blue it's gonna look awful but
this is just so that we can see where
things are sitting currently
and this needs to be this needs to be
gotten rid of
I said header is not being applied the
background color that's because we're
missing a dog okay
all right let's take a look at this
again all right so there's our header
that's fine what will live without for
right now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
