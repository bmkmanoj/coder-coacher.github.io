so I'm going to be doing an entire
series on Django and react and trying to
get that into my Django website and and
what I wanted to do is kind of give a
brief update on what my stack looks like
so I will be so it makes sense basically
what I'm trying to build here moving
forward I have a module that I've
created which I call gossip and the
model is it's kind of rough around the
edges right now in fact I kind of just
borrowed from another module that I had
and I will probably end up having to
update this at some point in fact
there's already a bug in here should not
say let's just say gossip so what we
have here is there's actually a lot more
going on with this thing you need to
know but this is all standard Django
build the model identify you know what
these model fields should be and
everything so this is the M and the MVC
and then what I have here is I have this
defined as Jason that way in my view
when I'm making these requests I can say
like because I'm not relying upon a
restful framework this is kind of just
like a rough around the edges
baseline solution for creating my own
restful framework I'm trying to 'take a
Django model turn into Jason and that's
what's being returned so when we look at
like gossip detail or gossip list or
even add with the post everything let's
just look at a detail and list and you
can see I have these require HTTP
methods which are at the top here say
Django views decorator dot HTTP require
HTTP methods I'm using Django 1.7 I
believe these are in previous versions
of Django as well but you can see I'm
restricting the call to a get which is
similar to what an API would do when
you're just trying to get JSON data back
and you can see that I'm saying and get
object or 4/4 and you can see I'm using
the extension that I defined in the
model
gossip dot as Jason so it grabs you no
inquiries the database but that one
particular object the as Jason method is
called which if I go back over to my
models file you can see I've created the
method inside of my models class that
says as Jason and it takes all these
items and it's just turning it all to
Jason style format and you can see an
author is a foreign key relationship so
it's doing the same thing to get the
Jason basically all this is is just a
dictionary which gets returned but you
can see I have so I'm building a
dictionary here but then I'm also since
I have a foreign key relationship for
the author module you can see right here
it makes reference to the the built-in
user table so from that user table I'm
grabbing the ID and the name and we'll
see an example of this in just a second
because I have an exact same module that
I've built which is probably going to be
deleted but I have it under lounge and
it's it follows the same pattern except
the name is lounge here but it does the
same exact thing so let's take a look at
that in HTML so you can see what I'm
talking about or in the browser I mean
oh and one other thing I did want to
show you on this is that and my URLs for
the lounge that I'll give you an example
this is the exact same way with their
gossip module that I'm going to be
working on with this react tutorial you
I just created manually the you know the
API URL so API lounge ID API add API
update so I I manually went through and
out of that so when we requested here
you should see
well it's just API and then the number
Oh goddamnit I also needed lounge so I
did lounge API - so there's no query
that matches that I have to find a
matching query I don't even know all
right I meant to look at all right so
here's one number 30 which is a test
here so I know that 30 exists so here is
how that model object works it just it
builds the Python dictionary and it gets
turned to Jason and the view because you
can easily turn Python dictionary to
Jason which is what's being done the
view and the model object is being
turned into a Python dictionary in that
model as Jason method that I had just
described to you guys so you can see
here that that is how I'm building my
API now for better out-of-the-box
solutions the de-facto number one option
is Django rest framework this can be a
bit of a hurdle though especially for
new people to try to get their api up
and running some people don't need
anything as robust as Django web
framework but our Django rest framework
um but I'm assuming at some point I'll
probably use it I may just continue to
go with a custom rolled solution but
they have a lot of things like security
and throttling and stuff like that but
definitely it's a big big thing tackle
and honestly I just didn't feel like
messing with it for what I was trying to
do at the moment so that is why I custom
rolled my own API and these videos
moving forward are going to be
interacting with the API and in this way
we're if I went ahead and I grabbed
longe and I think I said if I went API
you can see it pulls all of them back
which is very similar to what you would
see even if you use rest framework so
whatever you do you need to be able to
have an ability for these tutorial
series to be able to request the object
and have it returned as Jason and
whether you use Django rest framework
Django tasty pie or custom don't roll
your own solution like I showed you guys
it's completely up to you anyway so this
is kind of a detour of the video series
here but we need to make sure you guys
are up to date on that all right let me
know if you have any questions and feel
free to leave any comments please
