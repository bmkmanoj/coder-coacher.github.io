about tales from an older programmer the
the comment that I have here is from one
of my viewers and he's actually a he was
in tech for a long time he's been out of
tech for at least 10 years or so and he
lives somewhere in Texas right now I'm
not exactly sure where but Texas a big
state so I'm not really revealing too
much information there's like 24 million
people and a huge-ass state so good luck
finding the one person but anyway just
in case he didn't want to be mentioned
but there the comment it was is
interesting he says I remember high
school in the late eighties the newest
book and the library was stayed in
nineteen forty something it's not just
computer stuff that is outdated in
education but just to name a few of the
computer courses that I took in college
das Lotus Notes macros cobalt mainframe
assembler JCL WordStar and the likes and
that was 90s era stuff most of which
might means my phone hasn't rung for a
tech job in over a decade even though
I've had my current phone number for
over a decade so that sucks man that's
that that's the tale of an older
programmer and that honestly is why I
hope that this YouTube channel blows up
because you never know when the tech
industry might fall out from under your
feet so that's happened in the past you
know these technologies become outdated
I'm sure if the writer of this comment
wanted to he could probably learn web
development if he had interest in that
I know another older programmer that
wants nothing to do with it I mean he's
seen modern JavaScript and like we've
complicated the the complexities now it
seems like of any stack is now that the
UI more than it is you know the API and
the backend complexities lie everywhere
obvious I don't want to downgrade
downgrade back in programmers but the UI
has become so complex that's where most
of the jobs are it seems like in web
development where a lot of the struggles
are and in this case he could probably
do that but you know clearly he hasn't
hasn't wanted to and all that that work
that he did learning all of those
technologies the unfortunate thing is
that they are they are outdated now so
as an older developer once you have
family you have kids you have a wife
things like that like real the real
world starts to you you need to live
your life like so you're gonna buy a
house you're gonna have kids and a lot
of the times people are like you know
they don't want to spend all that time
learning these these technologies just
to die with that in their brains as they
you know disintegrate into the earth at
the end of the day and and then you know
you you have to balance out I guess that
whole spending time with family and
learning new technologies the thing that
sucks about being a programmer is you
always have to continue learning those
new technologies as we go along though
because you will end up becoming
outdated unfortunately if you don't and
it is a it's a major commitment T to
time in your life and that can lead to
major problems so what major problems am
I talking about how like health problems
a lot of programmers they're not
physically healthy because they're
sitting down at a desk all day they're
staring at computer screens so they're
damaging their eyes you have carpal
tunnel typical office worker level stuff
not like we're making deals with the
devil and like you know mining for coal
or any shit like that but the fact I
mean you could be I would i would bet
some coal miners are probably healthier
than like programmers because i've seen
some really unhealthy programmers that
looked like they died like five years
ago and that's because like I said we
sit in their chairs and we food and we
just don't get enough exercise some of
us some of us own but um you know like I
said as you get family and stuff like
that it becomes a little bit more
difficult because next you know a lot of
like single programmers that young guys
out of college or young women out of
college that you you go home you go to
work you you work real hard you go back
here apartment your condo or whatever
and you have time for exercise you know
stuff start adding kids into that
equation or a spouse or something like
that and like your life starts to become
a little bit more difficult than you
start adding a mortgage and cars and
soccer practice and you know it's like
it's yeah you'll see but then you know
you still have to devote time to
learning new technology so what I've
found and what I've been trying to do
for the eight years that I've been doing
this the first I would say four years I
worked way too hard I was definitely a
worker
and I do have some regrets in some ways
because of the amount of time that I
spent working really hard but it also
paid off so I know that I know that it
was worthwhile like I know that it but
it was still sacrifices made those first
few years was because I was learning I
was still working full time and things
like that once I became a developer you
can learn a lot while you're on the
clock so you should also be efficient
with how you learn while you're while
you're working for a company and really
try to learn you know those concepts
while you're getting paid for the
company because a lot of the concepts
whether it's one language to the next
like you're gonna take that with you
because a lot of languages and
everything they have the same
functionality I mean are the same the
same overall like you know theme
basically you have you know loops for
loops and iterate iterations and
programming and and how you iterate
something whether it's in JavaScript C
sharp or Python or something it's all
very similar so even even abstracting
outcome complexities and things like
that and in architectural development
that you'll do or that you'll see being
done at the workplace you can still
apply that to other languages and things
like that
and I guess my point is that while
you're getting paid to be a coder it's
there's a huge benefit there because you
are learning while you're developing the
problem with that though is that
sometimes you get so micro focused into
one piece of technology that you're good
at and then you end up stagnating so you
want to make sure that even if you have
a comfortable gig with a company that
you're not going to be stagnating with
it with an allocated dead technology or
something like that you always want to
make sure you're challenging yourself
and if you could challenge yourself
while working for the company and learn
new technology and it gives you that
opportunity you absolutely want to
capitalize on that now some companies
just expect you to learn everything in
your off time and that's where things
become a little bit more difficult in
this industry but I think we're starting
to balance that out I think technology
is is now in every single facet of
business and I and we're starting to see
just more more awareness to ageism to
sexism to things like that and and
hopefully that it will become a better
industry to work in it's not going to be
the old nerds with glasses that
literally spend their their night and
days coding non-stop you're still going
to have the
types and those types should probably
make more money because they're devoting
their entire lives to it so my point
behind that is that you want to continue
to learn new technologies but be very
selective about how you you learn them
which technologies you want to learn I
want to learn everything under the Sun
but I know that I can't devote all my
time to this YouTube channel I would do
tutorials on everything just because I
have a general interest in learning all
the different technologies I hear about
everything from my laravel to view
things like typescript I want to get
involved in all that stuff I just don't
have enough time unfortunately because I
I can't do this full-time so and in that
sacrifice what I'm doing is that you
know I'm still interested in those
subjects I just don't have enough time
to like delve into the subject and
become an expert on it
nobody does so that's why you want to be
very very selective and for me if I can
use that technology to better myself in
my career or make me more attractive to
other develop to other employers and
things like that you always want to be
as attractive as possible to in the
employer market so if if I'm going to
learn something it's definitely gonna be
in that direction I'm not gonna learn
just something just for the sake of
learning it at this point just because
time is a huge concern of mine and then
from there like I'm gonna be also very
selective but like if it doesn't meet
that criteria then if I can use it for
automation for something that I do for
my business or my personal life to make
my personal life easier things like that
then that would be another interest of
mine to learn but those are like the two
main things that I have to look at I'm
not 19 years old I don't live in a
dormitory I like I don't I'm not even in
high school I have so much other stuff
that I have to do in places I have to
pee that I have to be very selective but
I certainly don't want to be the
programmer that hasn't had a phone call
in 10 years because I don't have the
technology that they're looking for and
I would just caution all of you to make
sure that that doesn't happen but also
be very wise with your time if you're
younger I know a lot of my audience is
like like teenager age like 15 percent
of my audience is in the teens somewhere
in the mid to late teens and for you
guys and girls just make sure that you
know that your entire life isn't gonna
be
way that it is like right now so if you
have time most most certainly this is at
a time that you want to learn the most
that you can but once you do get into
the industry you'll see that that
eventually you will be the older
programmer and hopefully you're not
writing a comment like this guy that
shared this one today all right guys
thanks for watching have a good day take
care bye so this video was brought to
you by a dead mountain coding boot camp
they're a boot camp that is based out of
Utah but they're also in Texas in
Arizona now and they have very good
reviews so make sure you guys check them
out the link is in the description tab
below they offer courses in web
development iOS development UX or user
experience design Quality Assurance and
just a few other ones in fact they're
even getting into Salesforce as well now
so they're continuing to adapt their
courses based on what the market needs
are and major companies are hiring some
of their alumni so make sure you guys
give them a look they have great reviews
and thanks for watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
