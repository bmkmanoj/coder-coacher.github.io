new es6 tutorial series I'm putting
together and I'm going to try to make
this as simple as possible although I
can tell you that some of the latest
JavaScript stuff is just confusing and
it's confusing for several reasons
JavaScript used to just be just code
that we'd like inserted into our HTML
pages and it just rendered and we use
here jQuery with some plugins and and
those had a little bit of headaches
every now and then but nowadays like
it's a lot more complicated than that so
being a front-end engineer is now
arguably harder than being what used to
be like a c-sharp back in developer or
even you know Python Django or Ruby
rails developer JavaScript is now that
complicated where there's so many
different libraries and so many
different ways of writing the code but
the whole point is that javascript is
the only language that runs in the
browser browsers render JavaScript
differently and the latest version of
JavaScript is es6 or Xmas for 2015 I
know that's really weird and confusing
but that's the way it is and we have to
end up using a tool like Babel to then
take our modern JavaScript and turn it
into older Java scripts that still works
in older browsers and the reason why is
because if your stuff didn't work in
older browsers I think your customers
would get upset so we can right and some
of the latest you have six standards but
it means that we need to have Babel so
in order to have Babel it means that we
need to have no js' installed our
machine because no js' comes with a
package manager that we're going to use
to install Babel besides our fault so
make sure you have no js' installed and
you can do that here so that will give
you access to NPM so we can install
Babel
we also need some way of writing our
code and I recommend Visual Studio code
so if you just search that in Google
it's a free product and you can use any
editor you want so technically you can
write a notepad although I wouldn't
suggest it so that all said I have a
folder that I called es6 tutorial I want
to go ahead and navigate to that folder
so that's what I'm doing here I'm going
to go into es6 I'm going to open up a
command line
CMD so now I have it opened up into that
tutorial folder and you can see there's
nothing in it so the first thing we need
to do is leading is NPM to run this
command called I nee and I say I knit
for some reason I always pronounce it
wrong and most people stay in it and it
but I for whatever I like I think I say
I knit because of the iPhone and all
that stuff and just kind of programmed
in my head but we're just gonna call it
cs6 and well we'll just skip all this
stuff just keep pressing enter all this
stuff doesn't matter and then finally
we're going to see that it has this
package dot JSON file and we don't have
to worry about too much of what that is
going right now because I don't want to
confuse anything more than it has to be
let's just keep continuing forward and
we're going to install two tools that we
need and those two tools are called
and says right here NPM install saved a
which is Sabol TOI which stands for
command-line interface and Babel preset
environment and that allows us to write
this modern JavaScript so we're going to
copy that entire statement and we're
going to paste it inside of our command
prompt and run this and what NPM does is
it really just goes across the internet
it grabs these projects and we're
installing to hear battle seola and
bevel preset environment and it brings
them onto your computer and it's going
to it's going to install them in a
folder that gets created for you called
node module so in modern JavaScript the
file is now consists of all kinds of
different JavaScript files and they're
spread out all over the place and we can
import them and use them as needed and
then we can also use entire projects
like react or angular and things like
that and those will all be installed
inside the node modules folder right
here
so because we installed two dependencies
we now have a node module folder and the
node module folder contains all the all
the information babel needs so you can
see babbled a pretty big friggin project
and needed all this stuff sort of two
projects that we just that we just
installed another thing to is because we
said save does it adds them to our
packages a JSON file to tell us exactly
which two versions of of these you know
basically which version of babel CLI and
which version
that will preset environment and the
reason why that's important is because
you could take your project and without
having to worry about all the node laws
isn't something that you could just have
your package and and bring it into
another folder on another computer
across the world and just run npm
install and it will go through all the
dependencies and install them for you
under the node modules folder so that's
really what package.json is all about
now one of the things that we're going
to need to do and babel actually tells
you that it means it is that you need to
create a babel RC file and that's
confusing but we're just going to copy
this part and we're going to create this
file called dot babel RP and it's a
special file type that babel uses so
when we use babbles command-line
interface it's going to it's just going
to work and that's all you need to know
so let's create another new file this is
going to be actually our main files
we're going to call this index Roger you
know what we're going to even call it
first yeah so that way we know this is
our first file then we're going to
create a JavaScript array which hasn't
changed with the newer versions of
JavaScript but this is an array in size
it's where braces and we end it with a
semicolon
and we get we have a variable name of X
so now what do we want to do if we want
to actually say you know what I'm going
to take this file I want I want to
bundle it into a another file so we're
going to pull up our command line and
here where I'm going to say NPM run and
then we're going to say babble and we're
going to give it a start file which is
indexed on Jetta I know we called it
first idea and then we're going to say -
oh for out file and we're going to say
fondle dot jaya and press enter and this
is going to run and throw us an error
now this says that it couldn't figure
out what Battlement so what we're going
to do is add that to our package JSON
file and under script here we're going
to put an enter and we're just going to
a travel and then bat we'll make sure
there's a comma after that so we just we
just set babble
in battle and let's try this again
all right so it's probably good to have
error messages because you learn a lot
from error messages there's no such
thing as actually programming anything
without running into errors and and
identifying those errors and not
freaking out if you're usually rule
number one but you just build a lot
because you don't know what you don't
know and a good programmer knows that
they don't know a lot and in the same
sense that one of the biggest traits of
being a good programmer is also being
able to figure out what the problem is
being able to phrase questions and that
takes experience and really running into
errors or you know okay it is like it is
a type error this is some sort of
undefined there yeah there's all kinds
of different errors you can have in this
particular case this thing says hey it
tells you what the problem is says
fumbled obvious doesn't exist so it
doesn't know what you're trying to do
and the reason why is because we're
running this locally by saying npm run
savile but in order for us to pass the
argument to the babel script which is
right here because this just at a run
babel in order for npm to actually
understand the argument we have to say -
- after our babel command for MDM run
battle and in space - - anything after
that is going to be arguments that is
passed to babble so the first argument
is the file that we created first is and
then we're saying out our - oh is our
out file we want babel to turn first i
jsut bundle GAF so now by doing that we
don't run into any errors we look here
we know the bundled ijs file created so
let's take a look at bundle js figure
out what's going on there so if we look
at bundle you can see that there isn't
much change between first and bundle but
there is this use strict and use strict
is something that were used to in older
versions of JavaScript because
JavaScript has some weirdness to it
where if if if you've tried to access an
undeclared variable javascript would
just create one for you and assign it to
the global namespace so we really don't
need to get into too much of this but if
you wanted to read more about this
there's a lot of good documentation you
go to WV schools or you can go to
Mozilla documentation which is a strict
mode MSDN I'm sorry MDM that I'm a CMB
but this talks all about strict mode but
it will prevent things like unassigned
variables from being declared so like if
I have y equals you know that movement
in the compiled version the let's do
that here we're saying y equals this is
a trick I'm not sure what this is going
to do but we're going to try and you can
see why hasn't been declared there's no
flaw it like it's just hey why doesn't
exist so we're going to say you do
something with it so a normal JavaScript
it doesn't complain about that sort of
thing let's press the up arrow so we can
run the exact same command that we did
and this thing went ahead and created
and you can see it didn't even complain
however if we were to reference this
this javascript file inside of our
browser and the browser actually
executes this then there's going to be a
complaint file because why is undeclared
so let's go ahead and and get that going
so that we can actually see this inside
of a browser we're going to create an
index.html file and inside the
index.html we're going to create some
basic HTML here we're now HTML inside
here whenever our head head body body so
that's all the standard HTML stuff you
need if you go and highlight all this
and press ctrl not forward slash out of
control Namah f ctrl alt test out of f
man I don't freaking know so it's
actually shift alt F that's so weird
shift of F and you can see that actually
formats are a little better probably
want this to be indented like that but
anyway inside of our head we're going to
actually load our script files from if a
script
store
got forward class and we're going to say
bundle so we're going to use the actual
bundle file that's being created for us
and we actually may close this off
officially like that all right so now if
we go ahead and we open up our folder
and we double-click on our index file
that we created this should open it up
in a browser and we look at it in the
browser inspect the element you can see
that we now in an error uncaught
reference error Y is not defined
it's like M you tried to reference an
undeclared variable typically you don't
want to do that but and your normal
JavaScript it doesn't complain unless
you use that you're strict and that's
actually a new feature of es 5 I believe
John Resig the jQuery creator actually
wanted us to go in but here if I remove
the use trick there's no complaints now
check this out if we go to the window
dot global object so I've left a window
dot Y this is a script check that
out so even though Java Script was like
hey you didn't declare this variable
before it went ahead and it's assigned
of Y to the to the global namespace
which is the window object without any
sort of complaints whatsoever so that
means that we're polluting the global
namespace probably because we had some
sort of an error so anyway that's what
babbles doing is actually saying hey you
know use this older more correct version
of JavaScript so that way you know
there's some problems people will be
notified of it however during the
compilation process of creating the
bundle file it's not going to complain
about that there it's not that's not a
child that say hey you need to write
proper Java trip it's just saying eh you
can write new JavaScript and we'll turn
it to whole JavaScript but you can still
write some sloppy though so you
want to be careful about that so for
this first video of this series this is
where I'm going to end up I'm going to
leave this first video off because this
was all about just getting everything
set up so now that we have a basic set
up and we're going to be able to see our
output we're going to start actually
getting into the more of
the es6 syntax and the following videos
guys so make sure you subscribe make
sure you upload this video it's
motivation for me to keep making the
videos sometimes I do tutorials I get
feedbacks I'm going to continue this
tutorial but it's like damn I started
getting traffic on this thing like five
months later because people started to
find value in it you know by that time
it was like five months you know later I
barely know or remember where my files
were and like what I was doing and it's
just hard so like if I can get some
decent support out of the gate it's much
more beneficial I think in main creates
more motivation for me to to continue
the series and everything so anyway guys
thanks for watching you guys have a good
day bye hey guys so a lot of you asked
me how do I get my foot in the door to
become a programmer and I just want to
take a moment to mention dev Mountain
coding bootcamp is a 12-week intensive
course that focuses on the technologies
of the here-and-now for web development
some of the things that are actually
teaching in the 12-week course it's
geared to get you into the industry by
focusing on things like jQuery nodejs
react angular how to use github so a lot
of the things that you're going to need
to do as a developer as soon as you
start they're going to be teaching you
in this and this coding bootcamp and the
entire goal is to be able to get you
into the industry within 12 weeks so if
you guys are interested in learning more
information about Deb mountain coding
boot camp just check out the link in the
description cab of this video thank you
