have watched my videos in the past you
guys know I'm a huge Python fan I mean
Python was my first language and
sometimes I feel like I talked it up a
little bit too much I get some hate mail
about some of the things that pythons
not good at and I mean people accused me
of basically glossing over the fact that
pythons not the solution for all
problems out there because of a few
videos that I've had that you know where
I taught Python as being one of the best
languages I still think Python is one of
the best languages but it is important
for newbies out there to understand that
Python isn't like the you know the tool
that solves all the world's problems and
that there are certain things about
Python that they're very that are very
lacking compared to other other you know
languages which I'll try to talk about
here in just a moment so let's go ahead
and get get into just a few things about
what sucks
and number one multi-threading in Python
is a basically non-existent not possible
and most of that is due to the fact that
python has a Gil which is short for
global interpreter lock and the main
reason for that is what it does it
prevents multiple threads from being
executed on by Python at the same time
so what that means is that if python
can't execute on multiple threads at the
same time it means that it's not a you
can't do parallelism or at least
multi-threaded parallelism with with
python it's impossible and it goes back
to when guido was designing the language
he he used a gill to basically make
python thread safe because at that point
with some of the c like to see memory
management you know the core of pythons
memory management is not thread safe at
all so you could have race conditions on
multiple threads if pathan is executing
on both of them so basically without the
guilt I thought it could be trying to
update two pieces of memory at the same
time
and and that's where you get into those
race conditions where it just becomes a
very problematic thing and it'll break
your program it'll it'll crush
performance eat up all the memory which
obviously causes a program to break and
it's never a good thing that we're good
when the entire program freezes up so
other languages like Go Java c-sharp all
that although all those languages
actually do multi-threaded programming
much better than what Python is is
capable of doing and unfortunately
that's one of the biggest concerns even
in the Python community today with some
of the rise of like a sink and a weight
with JavaScript with c-sharp having a
lot of success there with gos
concurrency which is a different pattern
than the asynch and await but they have
the the core implementation of those
features are something that Python just
really can't do without rewriting a lot
of what Python is and and unfortunately
the Python is a very easy language to
just write out some variables it's not
it's you don't have to declare your
types in advance I mean you just
it's that dynamically interpreted
language a language so trying to address
some of those concurrency problems and
multi-threaded problems is going to
require that the Python not be the
Python that we know today so most likely
there have to do something but so I
guess I don't know what that answer is
and I don't think most of the Python
community knows what that answer is
going to be at the moment all right next
thing packaging in Python sucks ass and
that's the the best way to put it I
don't know how many times I've tried to
download some sort of module like I
remember I was using Python Satchmo at
one point and like that son of a bitch
had like 18 requirements of packages
that it required and those packages
needed specific packages to be able to
work and I've run into that problem on
so many different projects with Python
where like you're just missing some sort
of package and it's all just because of
the fact that the packaging in general
and Python is very very
lacking alright next one it's not as
fast as many languages out there due to
its dynamic duck typing
so duck typing goes back to the phrase
of if it walks like a duck and it quacks
like a duck it is a duck so in Python
you can declare methods and you don't
even have to you know give the user any
sort of advanced warning on what type of
method or values that methods gonna
return whether it's a string or a list
or a dictionary or whatever it is all
that is just some dynamic behavior of
Python that you don't want to declare
those things in advance so you're not
saying hey this you know this integer
has to be a string or something like
that it's just you can pass in whatever
the hell you want and Python will just
you know treat it according to what it
thinks it's gonna be and that's that's
into just what duck typing is but just
the dynamic nature of Python makes it a
little bit slower than other languages
and in fact a lot slower than compiled
languages out there like C++ or or even
c-sharp now here's one of my big
concerns with with Python is that it
doesn't really have any good IDE is the
best one out there is probably pycharm
which is made by the jetbrains guys and
it's it's pretty good but it's not
anywhere near as good as some of the
editors out there and a lot of Python
hackers I'm not I mean they probably
don't even use IDs but I feel like for a
corporate environment IDs are very
important and right now pycharm is the
best thing that we have and I don't
think it's that great but that's you
know it's just a personal opinion now
one of the issues with Python compared
to other languages like C sharp or Java
or C++ or even C is that there are not
as many jobs in fact even Ruby just
because of the rails framework and the
adoption rate of Rails probably has more
jobs out there than Python so if you
look at the overall amount of jobs that
are available python is is growing
extremely fast in the last few years
it's pretty much I think grown by like
six or seven hundred percent according
to indeed.com
over the last five years but even still
if you look at the grand scheme of
things you know how
many jobs are there in Python compared
to C sharp or c plus plus or Java it's
not even close so python is is probably
beating Perl but even then it's on pace
with you know probably a little bit
greater than Perl when it comes to jobs
now so once again python is making
extremely good headway there but they're
not quite there as far as not even close
to being there as far as c-sharp or Java
now one of the things here a lot of
people don't care about this especially
Python people but I hate the fact that
Python doesn't have a switch statement
I'm still we're doing this l if l live
thing which I think is just terrible
looking I missed the switch statement
when I'm working with Python I use a
switch statement and c-sharp I use in
JavaScript I believe it's in PHP and
most other languages out there but it is
not in Python one of the biggest
concerns over the last five years or so
is that the Python is facing a huge
difficulty trying to get people to
switch from the Python to to Python 3
the other day I was working with the
work zhuge library I mean ok if that's
how you say it but that is the the
Whiskey program that is used in flask is
built on top of that and eve is built on
top of the flask so ultimately I was
trying to trying to port work over to
Python 3.4 and 3.5 which is what I was
aimed at but unfortunately that library
barely works with Python 3.1 and I was
getting just massive errors
unfortunately I didn't have enough time
and I'm sure just like many other Python
developers out there you just don't have
enough time to pour it all this stuff
from Python 2 to Python 3 and some of
that stuff you know was you know
breaking changes that it just it really
sucks when you when you do like an
upgrade and it's not backwards
compatible it always takes some time to
get these packages and things updated so
even to this day there is still a major
problem trying to push everybody over to
Python 3 because mainly it's just not
supported there for things like flask
and and Django and and and that stuff's
really important for somebody who has
you know there
but err relying on working Python code
that they can't have things breaking so
it's the reason why I'm even on my
production websites I'm still using
Python 2.7 with Django so there you have
it I'm not bashing Python I'm not saying
that Python sucks or anything like that
there's just a few things that kind of
answers the critics out there of why
Python may not be the best language
depending on what you're trying to do if
you're trying to write a game engine you
have no reason and no business doing a
Python if you're writing native web apps
you're probably not going to write in
Python you could try to use Kivi
although that damn thing wasn't working
at all as of a year ago but I mean so
the power you know if you but if you're
gonna do a web site no reason why you
can't use django django is plenty fast
enough for most sites out there if you
can run multi-billion dollar companies
like Pinterest and Instagram and and
discuss and many other websites out
there that I'm sure that it would fit
your needs
just fine and and it is very easy to
work with so speed and multi-threading
is not necessarily as important as some
people make it out to be so just because
there's a few shortcomings doesn't mean
the language sucks it just means that if
you're trying to do multi-threaded
programming don't use Python I mean
that's as simple as that all right guys
