this video I'm gonna be responding to
one of my viewers who says hey Chris I'm
a programming noob I like that Nov 28
years old and I've decided that I'd like
to teach myself Lua because I have a
strong interest in hack hacking and BOTS
and scripting programming's for a
favorite game of mine League of Legends
I'm wondering what your opinion is of
Lua and if you would recommend it as a
first language
I've watched a handful of videos and
played around with code combat comm and
I'm starting to become familiar with the
concepts of strings variables functions
and logical if and or' then statements
you really inspire me to keep my
learning process going and I would love
to hear back from you your fan Robert
alright thanks Robert I appreciate it
it's awesome that that you say that
you're my fan because I've never really
had fans so that's awesome I won't let
that get to my head though but I
definitely appreciate you reaching out a
lot of times I don't know what to talk
about and then I can just read the
comments and I can find something to
talk about now you asked what my
experiences with Lua I've been
programming now for six years I started
programming when I was your age so 28 I
actually got into Perl programming which
was a lot more popular than than it is
now but it's still a top-ten language at
least top 15 the the Lua language has
been around for like 30-some years and
to be honest with you I've never once
touched it so I would not be the best at
giving advice on on what Lua is great
for my simple research with Lua would be
you know what you would be able to look
up yourself as far as what it's used for
and whether or not it's good for BOTS
and things like that
my programming expert expertise or when
I jumped into programming initially I
was interested also in scripting I
needed things to be able to rip through
web pages pull out data store them to
files read those files and do something
with that data so that's pretty much
what I was doing I was I was collecting
data on different rock bands for my
music website so I started with Perl
which has always been a very good text
extraction language and there's been a
lot of BOTS written in Perl
but Perl was a very difficult language
for me
because there was so many different ways
of accomplishing the same thing I've
always been a big fan of Python and when
it wasn't until I switched from Perl to
Python that I actually hit the ground
running for me Python made things so
much easier to deal with if I have an
editor and a Python language I can write
scripts with the with the best of them
so even when I was first getting started
with Python it allowed me to be able to
just accomplish so much I felt like then
then writing in Perl so if what you're
trying to do is the same thing you're
building scrapers and things like that I
mean I think Python is the best language
to learn but that doesn't mean that Lua
is not a feasible alternative because
like I said I've never used Lewis I
can't say anything really good or bad
about it I can refer to some of the
common you know the common websites to
kind of give us an idea on what this
websites popularity is tlb index is
probably the most widely regarded list
of what the top languages in the
industry are so you can see like Perl
number nine where I was talking about
pythons number five Java number one C
C++ C sharp which is also what I do as a
day job and then yeah I should go down
the list you can see Lois hanging around
down here at 31 which isn't bad it
sounds like it's bad but it's really not
there's hundreds of languages out there
and Lua has been established in the
industry for a long time I've heard of
Lua since the days of getting started in
programming but ultimately Lua has never
replaced Python or C sharp or Java or
any of those top ten languages as saying
hey you should learn Lua to do script
scripts and BOTS and stuff like that to
be honest Python has some excellent
hacking type systems like for building
scrapers like the Google search engine
scraper there's a Python program called
Python scrappy it's not a program but
it's more of a library of module of
Python code but scrappy is built for
actually parsing webpages and getting
data so it's it's a full scripting thing
now you're going to find this very
difficult Oh starting off with with with
program
based on what you said you just started
getting into I would not jump into
something like this right now if you're
gonna stick with Lua that's fine but if
you're gonna do Python try not to jump
into one of these you know built up
libraries because this typically takes a
decent amount of knowledge with Python
before you can actually utilize it and
it might turn you off to the whole thing
but ultimately if you become good at
something like Python and you're
building scripts and then you can make
use of something like scrappy and
probably be able to accomplish a lot of
what you're looking to do now another
thing too is if you're getting into the
industry a lot of people even if you're
playing with Lua just to write scripts
and BOTS and stuff like that you're
probably wanting to be able to
eventually take your knowledge and be
able to maybe get a job in the industry
you know making money as a Lua developer
one of the issues that I would caution
with Lua is that like if I go to
indeed.com that number one jobs website
and I type in Lua I have 460 jobs that
get returned and the entire country and
one thing that's notorious about
indeed.com is that a lot of these
websites and I've seen it personally
these jobs that are being posted
sometimes they're being posted by IT
recruiters and the IT recruiters are
posting the same over and over
again or some you know recruiter is
reposting some other recruiters position
but ultimately I'm seeing four and five
postings from different recruiters for
the same job I find that infuriating
actually but that's one of the things
that I would caution but yeah 460 jobs
on indeed com is not very good so then I
looked at um you know the Google Trends
and I see that you know it's not really
any it's you know it's kind of gone up
but you see it's kind of flat you know
what I mean it's not it's not like some
peeking you know language so I don't
know I guess I would caution if you're
trying to get into this industry for
jobs and everything like that so I mean
why choose Lua over Python if you're
just getting started at least with
Python you're talking about there's a
you know there's a huge industry look
43,000 almost 44,000 open positions for
Python right now if you're looking at
c-sharp 38,000 jobs
even pearl pearls something that's been
dining in popularity for a long time
22,000 jobs you look at a monster like
Java 85,000 jobs so a lot of people I
didn't mean to click on that ad a lot of
people you know they want to make sure
that they're learning something that's
not gonna become obsolete and I'm not
saying LOA's gonna become obsolete but
if you're just getting started why not
get started in something that's a little
bit more ingrained and fine-tuned with
what the industry is using right now so
that's basically my advice and I
appreciate once again the fact you say
that you watch my videos and that you're
inspired and and I wish you the best
with with learning and I can't recommend
Python enough for learning in fact I'll
point to a video right now and in Python
or at least in the description that you
should check out because I have an
entire video on why you should learn
Python programming and it goes into so
many different things about why Python
is a very popular language right now and
why it's the number one most hot
language in IT schools in fact here is
the video right here why you should
learn Python programming so if you just
search that on my channel this goes in
you know it's pretty pretty up vote I
voted myself but eighty nine thousand
views and a lot of people like it's a
pretty good video and the 24 down voters
those are just haters you always have
people are very very religious about
their languages but anyway that's all I
got so I appreciate you watching thank
you and have a good day bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
