I hit the 40,000 subscriber mark and I'm
not going to be like making a video a
little thanks goes you know I I mean I
do appreciate all the subscribers out
there but this video is hoping to talk
about more than just hey look at me the
four years that I've been doing this
this YouTube channel it's it'll be four
years in march and i think i've learned
a decent amount along the way i'm still
surprised that i have this many people
subscribe to the channel I understand a
lot of people out there have a lot more
and things like that but that doesn't
really matter to me this was never a
full-time a full-time thing for me in
fact it seems like the only reason why I
even worked is because it's one of the
few things that I've actually tried on
the IT world or in you know as an
entrepreneur where I actually did
something that I was truly passionate
about and a lot of people told me when I
was trying different things along the
over the years really that you know you
have to be passionate about about what
what is you're trying to do I mean and
whether you're doing a start-up or you
know just working on a product or a new
language or or any sort of blog or
anything like that you definitely have
to be passionate and in the past I
haven't been passionate about certain
ventures that I've tried and they just
haven't worked in this particular case
it's kind of amazing how this all came
together and I guess I you know I think
obviously everybody has subscribed and
has watched my channel and also I I
thank you know YouTube having it for
having this platform and actually you
know making it of making a possibility
where you know an individual can from
the home of you know from wherever they
live in the world as long as they have
an internet connection and a computer
and a webcam or even screen capturing
technology you'll be able to record
videos and post it to a platform that
can be consumed by you know millions and
if not billions of people throughout the
world none of that actually happens
without without Google and the
infrastructure and everything that
they've put in place so I think it's
absolutely amazing not just for creators
but also for the consumers as well
because I consume quite a bit of other
YouTube content I've actually learned
quite a bit from YouTube and you know I
think it's one of the true game changers
and the world of technology that and
when we look back and we look at like
the World Wide Web you know HTML and tim
berners-lee you know I think honestly do
tube is going to be mentioned in the
same breath and so in some sense and
maybe I'm fooling myself saying that
because I have a youtube channel that
surpassed 40,000 subscribers today I
don't really think so i think even if I
didn't have this channel or anything
like that I could understand that
YouTube has created an entire new you
know world of possibilities and the fact
that we now have all these you know
companies that are streaming quarterly
meetings and things like that on youtube
I think it's great you know a lot of
yeah and maybe you know the video
streaming as a whole is also grown as
well it's not like video streaming
completely relies on YouTube it's just
that YouTube made it possible for the
masses in order to build or stream their
content of course if your Microsoft and
you're paying for your own servers and
you can use html5 video and you have
that possibility but you know for the
you for the average Joe you don't have
that possibility so YouTube made it
possible now over the years that you
know what I've seen a lot of in the four
years since i've been doing this as i
started out with tutorials and tutorials
weren't very good some of them were ok
but i think people kind of like the you
know the down-to-earth you know non
nerdy approach so i consider myself
somewhat of a nerd but at the same time
i'm a kid who I grew up in Maryland you
know basically a lot of different you
know cultures that I come from I mean I
came from like more of a blue-collar
industry before I actually landed my
first white-collar job and then
transition into being a programmer but
you know before that and I've been you
know a truck driver you have been in
construction you know I've learned to
have a foul mouth from a very young age
so you know just a lot of these things
that you know I grew up listening to
like gangsta rap and high school and I
had a lot of different phases i had my
nirvana phase and i even had a country
phase 4 11
point in my life but the point is is
that like I don't have you know some of
this like what I feel like is like
silver spoon nerdy type you know I
wasn't tinkering with with some of these
programming languages while in high
school I was out partying and you know
making a fool of myself basically but I
was able to get over all that I think
and um and you know the fact is is you
know once you have a family and you you
you have to settle down you know so I
mean I settled down quite some time ago
but it's really just I I think that that
is the one unique approach that I have
maybe that some of the other YouTube
tutorial videos didn't really have at a
time and even now I think that might
shine through a little bit but I would
say my level of professionalism has a
professionalism yeah it's gotten a
little bit better over the years I think
so sometimes I do regret swearing on
some of my videos I know that there's
been a couple people that have been
offended by that but at the same time I
was like you know what if movie stars
you know Hollywood people you know they
they go out they cost they say some of
the most filthy things in their movies
and everything and it's okay if you're
having a few beers with somebody they'll
say some you know filthy that you know
they don't let some f-bombs fly and
things like that and and the thing is is
like you know that's being real but its
not being you know professional from a
business professional sense and you know
I basically I think that one of the
things that I've learned along the way
is that I should be more professional
with my approach but at the same time if
I'm being too professional and to dry
and too politically correct then it's
going to not you know you're not going
to end up growing your channel basically
I mean because there's so much of that
dryness out there that fakeness that you
know you can consume that anywhere on
most of these YouTube tutorial series
that you have and and I also i feel like
i tell it like it is i mean and
sometimes people have pointed out the
fact that i'll jump you know and take a
position one day and then have a
different position another day to be
honest it's not that I'm trying to drive
use or anything like that but on
like that's the way my mind works like
if you would have asked me a month and a
half ago I thought you know react and
redox is terrible but you and really I
one of the things that I've definitely
learned of late is that I need to be
careful the type of influence that I
have on other people I'm not trying to
be dry or fake or anything like that but
I do need to be careful with the fact
that when i say javascript is a mess I
don't want anybody to think that
javascript is not necessary like yes
it's a mess but we need to do something
about it it's kind of what I'm saying
like if there's going to be another
direction it's going to be you know it's
going to be either be organic from
within the development community we
decide to come up with a new direction
or you know it could even be like
corporation which I don't really feel
like asthma organic but a corporation
can end up you know driving a new
standard that we end up going down
instead but but one of the things I want
to make clear is that you know
JavaScript can be a real pain in the ass
sometimes but it's not all that bad and
we can make it better and it's never as
bad as I actually make it out to be like
there are certain days where I just feel
like ranting on a subject and be like
it's absolutely terrible they ok so like
today or yesterday I'm dealing with an
AJAX call and redox and redox requires
that i have to do install an additional
package called redox thunk which makes
the action creators instead of returning
objects return functions so that way the
functions can be executed when a
synchronous calls are made out like two
AP eyes and things like that where this
you don't get a result back right that
second and redox without the readouts
thunk project you get this error and
you're like why do I get this error is 0
because i'm making a synchronous ajax
call from a redox action and it's
expecting an object to get return right
away but the ajax quote doesn't return
an object right away it's actually going
across the wire so instead it's actually
passing back a function that gets
executed and you can read more about
that on redox thunk but it's the kind of
thing we're like for a moment I felt
like making a video where I'm like can
you believe this you know to me like
another but then I thought you know what
this kid that makes redox like I call me
kid he's probably younger than I am
probably not that much younger maybe ten
years or so but you know he's very smart
the dude is
like we're extremely smart very good
programmer and and it's easy to bash
something like that but the fact of the
matter is that this guy took upon
himself to create an additional project
to say hey I don't feel like it needs to
be involved in the redox project but if
you run into this situation here it is
and and you can you know what I mean if
he didn't actually do that then somebody
else is either going to do it or you got
to do it yourself and the fact of the
matter is he did it on his own time and
he did it himself and he probably did it
better than I can do so I could have
easily ranted about that but um I've
learned from you know some of the past
rents that I've had in the last few
weeks that it does influence some of you
guys out there and even if it just
causes you the double think for a second
about what it is that you're going
that's not something that I want to be
responsible for and you know just to set
the record straight dotnet core asp
django whatever it is it doesn't matter
if you're doing web development you have
to use javascript if you have to use
javascript you might as well be involved
in some of the latest tools like Babel
and web pack in es6 and all this other
stuff so don't you know don't let me you
know stop you from doing that because
honestly it doesn't matter if I'm in
c-sharp or if I'm in Python i'm writing
a ton of JavaScript and that's going to
be that way for the foreseeable future
because I'm a web developer so that's
been a hard lesson I think of late is
just simply the amount of people that
are consuming this channel now where I
get 300 and I think almost 70,000 views
this month and if I say something you
know there's a good chance that some of
those 370,000 that reviewing this
content could end up taking you're
getting the wrong idea based off of a
video that I do so that's something that
that I need to to be careful with and at
the same time you know not be some
fake-ass politically correct guy that
nobody wants to hear you know because
there's so much of that out there on the
web that I can't stand it I do want to
talk real about some of these projects
and some of their shortcomings and even
if it's a rant video I just need to
balance out the pros with the cons you
know like if I'm going to be all you
know five points negative i should try
to find at least five points positive
just to balance the
sout and then people can weigh it out a
little bit better than us simple all-
rant so another thing I've learned is
that the tutorials don't really pay off
I've tried to do a lot of different
tutorials I've created my hipster code
website I thought that you know i
thought i would be adding a lot more
tutorials to this and the thing is i
could be like the new boston or somebody
else where I'm doing tutorials on
everything under the Sun but the problem
with that is that i don't know like you
can't be an expert in all this stuff
i've already said it before if anybody
thinks that they're somehow just some
you know an expert in all of this stuff
then they're completely full of shit and
sometimes i feel bad about that and but
then again there's also this this fine
line where it's like you may not be an
expert okay i did this quill j/s
tutorial quill jess is not a very
complicated API you can get up and
running relatively quickly I feel like
the tutorial not very good it's okay but
I'm not a quill j/s expert but I know
enough about JavaScript plugins and
tinkering when settings and things like
that that I felt like it would be a good
opportunity to teach somebody how to do
it so i went ahead and i did that and i
created my little quiz off it and it
doesn't mean something that great or
anything but the thing is is that quill
jess isn't very complicated so for me to
be able to consume it with the amount of
JavaScript knowledge that I have it's no
big deal and I might be able to explain
it a little bit better than what the
documentation shows because I'll tell
you the documentation there was some
head scratchers there were like some of
the examples they had didn't work with
the latest versions of quill like I
couldn't get image links to work I had
to adjust you know my CSS on my site in
order four lengths and things like that
to work within you know the blog stuff
so that's that stuff that i'm using here
so I feel like okay I may not be an
expert in quill I didn't write it I
don't contribute it to it but I know
enough about quill in order to get it
installed and running on my site which
you can see it here all this formatting
the code highlighting and all this stuff
this is all using that quill j/s editor
so I feel like if I am good enough to be
able to do that then I'm probably good
enough to be able to teach it you know
in relative layman's terms but does that
mean that I'm qualified to start
you know teaching Scala and in Java even
though i don't use either one of those
two ever at all like there are people
out there that are doing tutorials on
that stuff that it's absolutely clear
that what they're going is they're going
out and looking at other tutorials and
things and then just kind of hashing
over the same shit and number one it's
borderline criminal or illegal it's just
I don't know that there's just so much
of that out there that I feel like it's
diluting the entire tutorial market and
for that reason like I don't really see
myself you know making any sort of
mainstream tutorials for whatever reason
my python tutorial here seems so I've
gotten some pretty good attention out of
the gate but besides that i would say
that there hasn't been a whole lot of
success on any other tutorials and the
reason why is that there's just so many
there's so many to choose from out there
that it gets diluted so people that are
jumping into this market now where i
started four years ago or even going to
have even more of an uphill battle to
try to denver differentiate themselves
from others and and then there's
obviously that you know the paid for
sites out there like you to me and
plural site and and for what for what
it's worth i may still try to be a thorn
in their side by making tutorials
completely free on YouTube and how are
they free they're free because I spend
time doing it I'm learning and I'm also
making money on the ads and the money I
make on the ads aren't it's not
significant but it does add up to more
videos you have the more views you have
the more money you make so yeah there is
that I I didn't it's funny because
hipster code was just something that I
ended up making form back in april i
think it was and I made it because I
wanted to teach myself how to use react
and flux and then it's just kind of it's
just something I've been working on and
haven't even worked on it until this
week and I went had made some
improvements to it this week and change
the model of it and everything and it's
something I'll probably work on the next
couple weeks I'll be doing something
else and one of the things I was going
to work on with xamarin and I talked to
a few people and xamarin is just such a
nightmare it's not xamarin fault really
but any time I've tried to do android
development i find it just a miserable
experience with the emulators even with
gani motion as an emulator service i
think it's just a terrible experience
and it once it's not anybody's fault I'm
not trying to rant on anything it's just
simply I find it to be a miserable
experience trying to do android
development and and with react native
and in xamarin i'm sure they make that a
little bit less painful but it is still
a very painful process and it's
something i just don't find to be very
fun at all so to answer anybody's
question out there for samer and i
haven't really got into it beyond just
getting some basic applications working
and even having trouble doing that so
I'll be perfectly honest as well if I
could retire tomorrow I would I think
most people no matter how happy they are
with their jobs and things like that you
know they would like to retire early for
somebody like me who has you know
children I didn't make a lot of money
basically my entire life so I need I
need to do things in order to make sure
that my finances are in order you know
for my wife my children myself
retirement you know all that stuff I
mean I'm 35 years old now and and this
channel kind of makes me think a lot
about you know what are the
possibilities because it's like if I
have 40,000 people that have subscribed
obviously have a corporate sponsor
that's interested enough in the
demographics of my videos in order to
you have me as my my sponsor which is
Deb mountain coding boot camp so check
those guys out in the description tab
below there are coding boot camp has
very good reviews online so you can read
all about amon korra and people seem to
be pretty satisfied with them but the
the interesting thing for me is like
when I look at that I'm saying you know
I never planned any of this out this was
truly just an interest that somehow took
off and
I haven't really looked back and it
wasn't really until this year that I
thought maybe something could come of it
so what have I done through 2016 well
I've continued to kind of just do what
what I've done which is making tutorials
but in addition I started putting my
face in front of the camera so people
could associate you know the real chris
Hawks to these videos and doing videos
with my dog and driving in my car and
being in my backyard those are things
that I never had thought to do before
and I think it helped to some extent
because people realize that I'm more
than just a voice on on a computer
screen I don't like to show my face all
that often though like I don't I don't
crave that type of attention in fact i'm
relatively shy in fact i'm very shine
for in public and you know so it's i
find it interesting but i don't mind
getting in front of the camera every
once in a while just kind of showing
everybody that that i am a real person
but that's something that i tried to do
this year and and i think it helped the
channel a lot it helped it grow a lot
and in addition to that was you know
doing hipster code like I did hipster
code because I was like you know what
I'm going to try to utilize some of this
traffic and things like that maybe I can
be and build like a pluralsight type
thing and and I did that like I said
April I worked on it for a couple months
and that I didn't touch it until about a
week ago and you know to date that I
have about 600 people registered to the
site a couple hundred people have taken
the quizzes and nobody pays for the
products but it does make some money on
the ads and an affiliate sales through
like Amazon and stuff like that so you
know that I guess that is a decent
success and its own or on its own and I
plan on continuing the blog because I do
like to write every once in a while so I
just plan on Albright this I need some
sort of paging i'm going to do with some
paging in here because right now I only
have a handful of blogs but eventually
i'll have more and another thing too is
like I found that you know what
everybody else that's a programmer seems
to have their own blog where they're
just kind of posting and like this
particular case where I have run webpack
from the command line like this thing I
thought was kind of helpful like where
you can't have multiple watches you know
running from the same web pack config so
i ended up
singing arguments and that wasn't quite
as obvious as I didn't see any
documentation in fact i was looking at
actual github conversations where this
didn't seem to be possible and then like
I figured out a way you know based on
some more research in order to pass
arguments I webpack config so I could
have webpack configs running
simultaneously which I thought was
interesting because I don't want one
giant web pack bundle for different
pieces of functionality so doing it this
way I thought was pretty pretty awesome
but you guys I ended up i'm going to
start blogging about it just because
this might end up getting search by
google and it might help somebody one
day or it might even help me when i go
back and learn it I could have made a
video but there's just not enough
interest overall in something like that
you know it only only time that's going
to help you as if you try to do what it
is that I was trying to do and you
weren't able to do it then eventually
you might stumble across across this
blog oh yeah okay that's helpful so
that's something that I'll continue to
use this platform for as well moving
into the future what else okay so pack
publishing reached out to me to do books
and video opportunities for different
different platforms pluralsight
expressed an interest but I didn't
really talk to them or negotiate any
sort of thing without with them but I
think they were interested in what type
of courses I would be willing to
contribute because you know they have to
have all of that stuff approved and
there's already a lot of experts on
pluralsight that I'm sure it would be
good exposure i know it helped john
Samas and everything but it's also a lot
more work i mean you have to be a bit
more professional in their tutorial
series and what I do in some of mine and
obviously I guess you know they get the
rights to the videos and stuff like that
but I otherwise i can continue to be
like a set of pain if I start getting
hundreds of tutorials eventually and
people like my teaching style then you
never know I mean that could be an end
up driving traffic away from pluralsight
where it's like why pay thirty dollars a
month when I can learn what Chris is
talking about and even though it might
not be the best as some of these other
videos it's still free and it helps and
that's honestly where I try to I plan on
being a little bit of a thorn especially
with some of these more these niche
industries and technologies tool sets
and libraries so yeah going back if I
could retire I would and in trying to
find something that I think everybody in
this industry you know they would like
to know they would like to have some
sort of success where they could say you
know what I made a few mil or whatever
let me put that away and then you can be
fine you know you could pay the house
off and retire early and I don't know
that that's ever going to happen to me
but what I need is all 40,000
subscribers to donate twenty dollars and
then that way I could have eight hundred
thousand dollars and then I could pay
off my house and and then retire and do
this full time and make make ends meet
doing that so I just need all 40,000 of
you guys to donate 20 bucks that's a
twenty dollars USD and I'm riding out
into the sunset in fact you know I
bright out in the sunset and do this
full time that's that's what I do and I
probably do podcasts and other stuff too
but for right now you know that's not
going to happen I'm certainly grateful
for all 40,000 subscribers that have
you'd this or the three hundred seventy
thousand people that watch the videos
I'm going to continue to make videos and
I'm hoping you guys will continue to
watch them and hopefully you know I can
get to 80,000 by this time next year I
suppose alright guys thanks for
everything have a good night and take
care bye hey guys so I've talked about
this a lot Deb mountain coding boot camp
they are my sponsor they're one of the
reasons why I'm able to do these videos
and they offer a 12 week intensive
course that teaches you the technologies
of the here and now they're going to
focus on a lot of things that are
actually being used and websites things
like jQuery and they're going to be
using stacks like nodejs the 12-week
intents of course is to try to give
people in the job market so that is
their entire focus we've all we've
talked a lot about on this channel
whether or not a college degree is worth
it I'm not the one to be able to answer
that question for you I absolutely think
that college degrees are great
especially in computer science I never
want to convince somebody to say that
they shouldn't do that you know
obviously schools like Stanford and MIT
I'm you know I I'm an envy of all those
graduates however there is you know the
bulk of developers that don't
necessarily need to be the MIT graduates
to actually have success in the
programming world I think I speak
relatively well for for that type of
person and with coding boot camps we're
seeing them you know try to offer more
Skills more modern-day skills because a
lot of times when you're going to a
computer science course and a major
university you're learning technology
that's already outdated by the time
you're learning it with dead mountain
and coding boot camps like what dev
Mountain offers they're focusing on
really what is hot right now so and they
also focus on a relatively you know a
small set of skills in order to make
sure that that they are teaching you
what you need to know in order to be
productive in a in a workplace
environment so make sure you guys do me
a favor do yourself a favor check out
the link and the in the description tab
below for more on Deb mountain coding
boot camp thanks guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
