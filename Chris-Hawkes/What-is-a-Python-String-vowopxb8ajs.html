gonna go ahead and continue this
tutorial we just did a simple hello
world explanation and one of the basic
programming principles that you need to
know you want to be an expert programmer
but you have to know what a string is so
somebody says hey you're a programmer
what's a string and you don't know then
you're gonna look like an idiot so all
the string is though is it's simply what
we just printed to the screen this print
hello world that is a string and the
string is significant is signified by
having a double quote and an ending
double quote anything inside of that is
a string so you can also use single
quotes hello world is also a string
whether you use double or single quotes
it's up to you I use kind of both I mean
and the reason why I use a double
sometimes is just because if I want to
say Chris is tutorial I can do that
without there being a problem now if
this was a single quote and we had a
single quote here you see what the
problem is and my text editor here it
says hey you killed the string after
this s because it thinks the string
starts from here and ends here and all
this stuff here pythons not gonna know
what to he'll do with that because it'll
because it'll think that you killed it
right here and if you watch what happens
when we run the program look the right
thing we run this program and it says
hey this thing we don't know what the
hell this is because the string ended
here and it says it's invalid syntax so
so with it ending there now you can
avoid that issue by using a backslash in
front of the single apostrophe and what
that does is it says hey don't treat
this as a start and an end to a string
just simply ignore it and treat it for
what it is which is a single quote or
single apostrophe so it well when you if
we save this we'll save it so you can
see what I'm talking about
and we pull this up we run it it treats
it for what it is so it'll say Chris's
tutorials so that's what you call
skate character you're escaping this
character and treating it for literally
what it is and that's a single quote so
we're gonna that's what a string is and
we're gonna go ahead and cut the string
tutorial off here and we're gonna jump
into the next type and Python which is
an integer okay all right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
