to show you how to create a new project
from existing code base using Python and
Visual Studio 2015 if we want to do that
instead of saying new from existing code
we're actually not going to do that
we're gonna create a new project and
when you're using Python you have to
make sure the Python tools is installed
I believe that comes out of the box now
2015 but if not you're most likely gonna
need to download the latest update
because I ran into some bugs with the
one that did come wrapped with 2015 but
if you go down to other languages under
templates other languages you can see
Python down here and then there's an
option down here that you can say from
exist existing Python code and that's
actually we're gonna do it I'm gonna
browse over the project I'm trying to
open up is actually run Django locally
which is I put it under my scripts for a
Python so that because scripts is on the
command line so I just want to grab that
folder
isn't it so that's the project I want to
be able to debug and run inside Visual
Studio I just click select folder and
then I give it a name and I'll call it
Django that's fine and just click OK and
here you can just leave this where it's
at this isn't this is just where the
folder is going to be that's fine go
ahead and click next here is um where
you want to actually select the right
development environment that you want to
use for the project and then I'm just go
ahead and use the set up PI file that's
fine you can always change that later if
you want and we don't need to detect
virtual environment so I'll just click
finish
and it'll take just a moment and then
all the files will be inside the
solution Explorer in 2015
alright guys that's it so now if you
wanted to you could just pick any one of
these files in here and just right click
and then just say set as startup file if
that's where you want the actual start
file to be implemented and that's it
that's all there is to it alright guys
thanks for watching have a good day bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
