view J s tutorial and view J s is a new
data binding library from from the
JavaScript side of things where it works
with any sort of existing web server
that you have so if you you you use view
J s alongside of something like nodejs
or Python Django or Ruby on Rails either
way you need a server-side language that
is responsible for taking data from the
server and passing it to the client
which is the browser and then view J s
will then take that data and it binds it
into the HTML templates making things
you know much easier to deal with when
it comes to data binding so if you J s
is actually a much more lightweight
JavaScript framework when compared to
something like angular or backbone or
react so in order to get started and I
want to create a folder here in fact I
already did I'm called a view tutorial
that I put in my projects directory but
I want everything to live inside of here
we also need a code editor one of the
things that I recommend is visual studio
code I find vs code is actually a pretty
good editor it's completely free and
it's cross-platform so if you guys have
ever watched my Python tutorials you
guys have seen view J us and I'm sure
you would agree that's not V J's I'm
sorry visual studio code you know I'm
sure you would agree that's pretty good
you have all these extensions that you
can use for and it's completely free I
find it much easier to use an atom so
let's go ahead and inside here we need
to use our text editor of choice which
I'm using vs code and I'm just gonna say
open folder and then I need to find the
folder that I put everything in so I
call it a view J s tutorial or view
tutorial that's what I called it and
then we'll select the folder so on the
left hand side once this folder is
loaded we're gonna have these icons I'll
make them bigger so here are these icons
here this is your documents icon it
shows you everything in your folder and
right now we have nothing in our folder
this is if you want to search for
something this is your debugger this is
any sort of extensions that you have and
how you could update them and then if
you want to use a git repository you can
use that but that's gonna be beyond the
scope of this tutorial
first thing we need to do though is we
need to actually create a new file which
we're just going to call our index.html
so index dot HTML is typically the home
page and let's go ahead and create our
actual HTML in here so there's a title
so this is all of our HTML markup if you
guys have had any experience with HTML
this all makes sense to you and we'll
just call this a few toriel and we're
almost done here alright so that's all
then all we need right here just to
basically get this tutorial started
alright so now we have this index.html
and now in order to use Vijay s it's
actually quite simple if you wanted to
just go the basic round that's actually
downloading the the actual minified file
so if you go to the View j/s
installation website address here and we
can just say production version which is
going to it would give us like
stripped-down version we actually want
the development because we want the full
warnings and debug mode especially if
something goes wrong so you might have
to say that you want to keep it we need
to actually take where that thing
downloaded and put that in our our new
projects directory so let's go back over
to our editor here and we're gonna
create a folder that will put our
JavaScript in and we'll just call this J
s so inside of here we'll put our view J
s
if we look inside of our downloads
folder you should see this VJ s file so
I'm just going to cut it and then paste
it into our Jas folder that we just
created so I'll paste that right in
there and now we need to reference it
and I'm wondering if I can do this I'd
like to be able to drag it and that did
not work all that did was open it
alright so now we need to actually
include the script file at the top of
our page right here so we're gonna say
source equals and it needs to find the
J's folder and we'll save you J s and
then close off the script tag so that's
all we have to do we have to just
include VJ s if you want actually look
at all the code here you can see it's
not it's not minified so there's a lot
of stuff going on in here if you ever
were bored you can take a look at it but
it'll probably blow your mind if you're
just getting started with UJ s so first
things first let's open this up in our
browser here because I want to make sure
that we actually pointed to the file so
if you double click on it you should it
should open up with your default browser
or you might have to stay open with and
then select Chrome or whatever sort of
the browser you're using and when the
page is loaded let's go ahead and
right-click and say inspect and this
will actually pull up our console if we
click on the console here we should be
able to see inside of our sources panel
the the actual index and if we if we had
a 401 error or a 500 error like if this
page was not linked to correctly then it
would throw an error message here but
you can see that there's no error
message being thrown in our console so
everything's good so the view j/s
library is loaded so now we can move on
to the next step so now inside of the
editor we need to create a div tag where
everything is going to sit so we're
going to say div ID equals app and app
so the ID of a HTML element is always
unique so there's only going to be one
app I mean you could make two but then
you're gonna have problems because it's
only gonna assign it to the second or
the last one that you need to find but
ID should always be unique all right so
now that we have this idea assign at the
bottom just before the closing body tag
we're gonna create a script
here so inside the script this will
execute and well by putting it down here
we know that the Jas library or view Jas
library has already been loaded by the
time we get here we're gonna actually
paste in this this code right here which
is called this is actually initiating
the view Jas library here and then it's
at what it's doing is it's finding the
app ID which is saying element this is
the element to find and here's the data
to pass to it and it says message hello
of UJS so nothing's going to happen here
because we actually need to have the
message tag inside of our element ID
which is right here so in order to do
that it's very similar to like the
Django templating engine where we just
put it inside two curly braces the name
of the variable that holds the data we
want to display so now let's go ahead
and go back to our our file if we
refresh you can see hello of ujf so view
Jas took that data and it binded it to
the ID so nothing spectacular this is
nothing that you cannot create on your
own but this is just a quick quick start
into view J us and getting it running in
your project alright guys thanks for
watching in the next video we'll get
into more view Jas bye hey guys so a lot
of you asked me how do I get my foot in
the door to become a programmer and I
just want to take a moment to mention
dev Mountain coding boot camp is a
12-week intensive course that focuses on
the technologies of the here-and-now for
web development some of the things that
they're actually teaching in the Suevi
course it's geared to get you into the
industry by focusing on things like
jQuery nodejs react angular how to use
github so a lot of the things that
you're gonna need to do as a developer
as soon as you start they're going to be
teaching you in this and this coding
bootcamp and the entire goal is to be
able to get you into the industry within
12 weeks so if you guys are interested
in learning more information about Deb
mountain coding bootcamp just check out
the link in the description tab of this
video thank you for watching and have a
good day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
