action file and in this video what we're
going to do is create the reducer so the
way Redux works is that Redux has
components and so you have a react
component and we're going to use a
special ability with the react Redux
project so that the two ecosystems
communicate but when a when something
happens in react it notifies the Redux
action that hey something occurred and
it sends the type of what action it got
executed so then Redux reads the action
that got executed and then calls the
reducer that matches the action type and
then in addition and we'll see in later
videos you can add payload data so you
can actually add like data that you want
to send with that action but for right
now the only requirement with Redux
action objects or that they have this
type attribute and we have assembly that
there's an add functionality so let's go
ahead and without further ado let's add
the reducer ojs file so we're going to
say reducers jas now this one the first
thing you should do is define a constant
a constant is actually a new keyword
within the JavaScript language that is
now part of the es2015 or es6 standard
and it's going to be the initial state
because the initial state will never
change so we want that to be constantly
uses less resources and we're going to
say counter equals 0 so there's gonna be
a relatively basic application all it's
going to simply do is just count up
every time you click a button so we're
saying the initial state when the redox
application is loaded should be 0 now we
need to create a function that we're
going to call counter app and then here
it takes in the state and then in action
and the action is once again the action
that got fired right now we only have
one action and that's called add now
here we need to add a if statement
because if
the state that gets passed in is
undefined meaning that this is the first
request that's been made then we need to
actually return the initial state up
here so that this is making it a little
bit more efficient because that way it's
not trying to instantiate new states
every time so we're going to say if type
of state which gets you know this past n
will say equals with 3 equals undefined
return initial state which is the
constant that we just defined up here so
this just makes things efficient inside
of redox now we're going to do a switch
statement and the switch is going to
look at the action type and once again
this is the only required part for
action objects within redox is that they
have a type object and we're going to
just look through it in a simple switch
statement and we'll say case add and if
add matches we're going to say returned
object assign this is another new
feature of JavaScript where we can take
an existing object and map it to an
empty object so we create this empty
object we take the existing state but
then the third argument here is what
specifically changed so our state is
very simple there's only one counter
attribute within our state states will
get much more complicated as you build
larger applications but for right now we
have one thing that can be done if they
add we're going to say counter its new
value equals counter and just to make it
easier to reason about for anybody
that's new to programming I'm saying
take its existing value which is 0
initially and add it add 1 to it once
again there's better ways of doing that
but this is just to be very very
specific about what's going on and now I
can put a semicolon so this is all just
one statement and now I should also have
a default because every switch statement
should have a default and the default is
going to be just return this state
so basically if we try to fire some sort
of action that the reducer doesn't know
about just returned and don't do
anything and wrote in in real life he'd
probably wanted like you like throw an
error or something or these some sort of
logging to try to find out what happened
now we need to export counteract oh so
we're going to say export default
counter app that way we can load it from
within our application alright guys so
once again just to recap actions are
just functions that create objects and
the objects the action objects have to
have a type parameter this type
parameter has a string name add so when
that's fired it's going to call the
reducer if the state is initially no or
undefined then it's going to go ahead
and create the state from our initial
state constant that we created then it's
going to run the switch statement over
the type of attribute we only have one
action that can be taken which is add
which is then goodnight it's going to
mutate the state in this central store
we're really the central area it's going
to say I'm going to take an empty object
I'm going to map it to the state so
anything that's in states can be mapped
to this empty object and then I'm going
to change this one specific part of that
state and say you know what the new
counter is going to be the old value
plus one and then if the action type
doesn't match then it just returns and
does nothing and then I'm exporting the
actual reducer function alright guys so
that's how we do that so now we have our
actions and reducers out of the way so
in the next video we're going to create
our store and the store is actually
these the central global state alright
guys thanks for watching and bye hey
guys so a lot of you asked me how do I
get my foot in the door to become a
programmer and I just wanna take a
moment to mention dev Mountain coding
boot camp is a 12 week intensive course
that focuses on the technologies of the
here and now for
development some of the things that
they're actually teaching in the suevi
course it's geared to get you into the
industry by focusing on things like
jQuery nodejs react angular how to use
github so a lot of the things that
you're going to need to do as a
developer as soon as you start they're
going to be teaching you in this and
this coding boot camp and the entire
goal is to be able to get you into the
industry within 12 weeks so if you guys
are interested in learning more
information about Deb mountain coding
boot camp just check out the link in the
description tab of this video thank you
for watching and have a good day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
