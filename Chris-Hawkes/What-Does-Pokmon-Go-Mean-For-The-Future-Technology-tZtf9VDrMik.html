the rage right now apparently
everybody's talking about it and I was
just kind of thinking on my way home
today that this isn't the first time
that we've seen this now if you guys
have paid attention to the news in the
United States this Pokemon go game was
from what I understand pokemon is its
own separate entity and I guess it's
partly owned or majority-owned by
Nintendo and then the pokemon company
paid another IT company that actually
produced this app but it's exploding a
popularity everybody's got the app
installed on their machine whether it's
the iOS or Android I say not everybody
because apparently it's so busy that
some people can't even get it installed
which is which is interesting so I think
well actually I can attest to that
because my son has an LG phone and he's
very jealous of the fact that my
daughter has it on her iPhone but he
can't get it on his Android LG phone and
they keep just saying that there's
server problems so a lot of jokes going
around and everything saying that that
you know the servers across the world
just can't handle all this so just
Pokemon go traffic right now it's the
hottest app out by far so we've seen
this stuff in the past so one of the
things that kind of came to mind with me
is like when I was a younger kid I
remember like the beanie babies craze at
McDonald's and when certain beanie
babies were worth you know ten thousand
dollars or more and it was a ridiculous
amount of money and the thing was is
that people couldn't get them and then
the tickle me elmo i remember that when
i was a young child is low like a demand
sometimes i think creates this this well
basically people are just crazy i think
so the scarcity is also what ends up
fueling this far too so with pokemon
they may not even be trying to bring
scarcity into play I mean they just
might literally be so bogged down that
they can't get this app on on phones
like my son's LG I don't really know but
I think I think it's really interesting
you know what this app has been able to
do so if you guys haven't seen it the
app is for your phone it uses the gps in
your phone
and you're able and basically it
promotes you to get outside and to start
exploring your surroundings looking for
hidden Pokemon so when you find the
Pokemon you you try to trap them in your
little Pokemon ball and then you get
money and then you can level up or not
money but you get like points you get to
level up and stuff like that so so
everybody's doing it there's fake news
stories going on saying that people are
stopping their car in the middle of the
roadway to try to capture Pokemon and I
honestly I wouldn't be surprised that
that really did happen but from what I
understand that there there's already
fake reports and everything going out
out right now but I think the real
question from a technology perspective
is what does this app mean for the
future doesn't mean anything if you guys
know from a programming perspective like
mobile phones just through the web
browser through html5 have had the
ability to use geolocation for quite
some time now for literally years phone
GPS systems are getting a little bit
better over time but I remember hooking
in the gps for an app that i was
building it wasn't even a pit was a
website and that was young that was a
couple years ago but i was using
javascript and html5 capabilities in
order to track where somebody was I mean
with the browser you have to obviously
except you know that the website can
track your location a lot of people are
very uneasy about that but with this
Pokemon go though the businesses are
starting to get in there like how can we
capitalize on this and they start
looking at okay well you know people are
going to look for Pokemon they might as
well go and come inside of our business
and and look for Pokemon there because
then it might offer more business and I
was actually at a restaurant on Saturday
and both my wife and my daughter were
playing the game so my wife was playing
as she do she's doing it with the way
they're gone to I think she also likes
it too I don't think she's a huge
pokemon fan but I can essentially attest
to the fact that adults and children are
both playing this game but we were in a
restaurant and this restaurant has a
gift shop and I don't know that we
really bought anything because of this
Apple we're already customers anyway but
you know some businesses are like wow
how can we capitalize on this how can we
use this to bring people inside
business and maybe not just this pokemon
thing but how can we you know how can we
do this with other business products in
order to drive business to us and I'm
not sure that this pokemon thing solves
that but sorry I'm holding a selfie
stick which I normally don't do so I
know it's probably moving around a
little bit but the um yeah I mean so so
companies normally don't really do this
in Pokemon might be the first one to
actually make this such a popular thing
right the people are grabbing their
phones they're going out in the middle
of night I've seen facebook messages
where groups are getting together to go
into the you know old town wherever to
start looking for pokemon in the middle
of the night and you know Greta this is
a game and people are just having fun
the question is how can this then get
transferred into something else how can
Facebook start using this or how can we
start using this to be more active
people or how is it going to drive
business one of the things when
something like this happens though is
there's always copycat programs that
come out so I'm gonna flappy bird or
angry birds or any of those things you
see all these copycat apps that come out
and you know grandparents end up
downloading it not knowing what they're
downloading and whatever and so you can
have all this copycat stuff so that's
definitely going to happen you might
just have it trickle out you know it
might just fade out like like we've seen
with so many other things or you know it
could be the start to being you know
more personable like I mean hey you
don't explore this area and you might
win a hundred dollar coupon or something
like that to some restaurant you know so
it could be the new form of like Groupon
or something we're instead of like your
groupon is all about trying to get
people together in the power of people
to try to push businesses to offer big
discounts through you know increase
increase customer traffic and you know
they're there might be ways that I've
been able to do it with this is low so
i'm not sure that pokemons necessarily
going to help anybody's business but i
think it's funny though cos businesses
do immediately jump on it and think how
can we try to you know capitalize off of
this and in some cases i think that
there's just not anything to capitalize
on you know right now nintendo
mr. the roof even though they didn't
even produce the app or actually write
the code for the app and you know
there's going to be a lot of copycats
bring it up and stuff like that so the
question is like who is really going to
make a ton of money off of this thing I
mean Nintendo is obviously making a lot
of money right now but I'm not sure I'm
really not sure they're so what the
business is one thing that comes to mind
though is a businesses are always
complaining like like movie companies
and definitely movie companies but
software companies everything else and
they'll complain when obviously their
their their software and things are
sitting on the pirate bay and people are
downloading it illegally which is you
know also known as stealing and and it's
funny in some sense just the fact that
you know they'll say that they're losing
all this revenue to all this pirated
material that's being downloaded you
know across country to across the world
really more by young children and things
like that and I just wonder like how
much oh you know the information that
they post like how much money they're
losing and stuff like that does that
take into account that like if whoever
the child is or they like a hit or the
young person is or the other hacker from
across the country or the world you know
if they're not in the market to buy that
product anyway and they don't have the
means to buy it and they never were
really going to buy it like did the
company really lose money you know
Brandon somebody stole something but did
they lose money and that just kind of it
comes to mind with with you for some
reason what would this Pokemon thing I'm
not even sure those two are
interconnected but you know companies
are always looking for the next
competitive edge and and and in the
advantage and this might be a new thing
this might be something good where we
grab our phones and and go out there and
maybe not catch pokemon but try to you
know communicate with each other more or
something I don't know I'm not really
that social believe it or not so it's
funny because i have this channel and i
talked to thousands of you guys but I'm
not the most social guy in the world i'm
really not like relatively shy and i
don't like to get in front of crowds and
audiences and things like that so once
again that's kind of funny that i'm
doing this channel
all that stuff but you know a lot of
people are interested in this this new
social age and trying to find new ways
of getting out there and everything so
anyway guys let me know what you think
man this is all I got today visit and
I'll talk to you later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
