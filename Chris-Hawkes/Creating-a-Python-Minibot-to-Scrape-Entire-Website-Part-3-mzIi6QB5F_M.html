another topic I want to make sure that
you guys have a clear understanding of
what we did here you're probably
wondering okay well why would I want to
print out the title to an actual word
page or something I mean obviously you
really wouldn't and you wouldn't put it
under one movies dot txt file if I were
gonna do something here like I would
create an entire directory for movies
and then I would probably go ahead and
add the string and then I'll say link
text so what I'm doing here is I would
create like a directory under our
training thing called movies and then
put the link name and then you have to
add on to the end of it I'd have to add
one more plus and then extra dot txt so
I would have it like a txt file for
every single movies that we captured so
let's just do that real quick under our
training we'll create a folder for each
out file we would just write in the
title so let's just do that real quick
you know what I'm not even gonna output
in the title because it what that ends
up doing is you guys already know that
we can read each file that way but here
let me I'll get rid of this whole read
response here just for right now and
this is quickly a way of what does out
file write nothing I'll call that right
well there's right nothing but at least
it'll create a web a a text file for
every movie that we captured and let's
go ahead and run that real quick
well here's a situation that we have it
is unable to write the file because it
has spaces in it and that's obviously a
problem
I'd have to go through and remove every
single stinking space
I'm trying to think about the best way
to go about this suit that title I'm
just thinking here so in this particular
case the failure occurred as a result of
a special character that can't be
written to it as a text file name with
this question mark here I mean we could
go through each item looking for special
characters and removing them and for
right now that's it that's a topic for
another tutorial this is what you call
an exception and well it's actually a
problem I guess you can you can kind of
go around something like this which it
probably isn't the preferred method
because you really need to try to cuz
you're gonna be losing a movie there
like there's an option so you don't
break the entire program or you could
say just well we could say try and we
could put everything in a try statement
which says hey try to do this and if
something goes wrong like in our case
their question mark movie name we could
say print this movie could not be
written to for some reason or like an
arrow and then we'll say plus
it's what we're doing we're gonna just
print out on the console the failure and
what movie failed and you can bet that
in each one of those movies printed out
there's gonna be something with some
sort of weird character but this is not
gonna break it's basically saying they
try to do it and if not just print the
statement on so and keep on moving so
when we do this we'll start running it
see what's going on with our movies file
here you can see it's growing
so what it's going it's going through
every single file it's going to print
out the error messages for the files
that don't work after all this is done
so you can see our movies file is
growing each time
and I do not want to wait for this to
finish but each movie you can see it's
printing out the title like we wanted it
to so if you wanted to go through
instead of going out for the title you
could go after using method that I
described in one of the earlier videos
you could go after and you know get the
director for every movie my computer is
being eaten up in resources right now
because of all the programs that I'm
running you can see the list is now
getting bigger looked like you just got
interrupted there for a moment but
here's the exception this is what killed
our program last time but instead of
killing the program it simply as we
instructed it printed out the error
message and then gave us the name of the
movie that did not work so by doing
these try and accept statements it's a
good way of just continuing to carry the
torch on the program even though
everything hasn't worked as expected and
in programming it seems like nothing
ever works as expected so these try and
accept statements can be very valuable
especially depending on see here's
another one why worry was a question
mark so I'm gonna kill this program I
don't need all this data so I'm gonna
kill it
control see hold it down there we go all
right but you can see here we have a
huge list of movies here that we have
and we printed out the title but like I
said if you were just captions and data
you could print out the directed by and
year of the movie the running time
whatever you want I mean this is just
one particular example of a movie I'm
gonna go ahead and erase the director
here because I don't need it it's being
you got a love windows you know
I'm assuming in the computer's memory
somewhere it's still using the movie
spot the movies directory so I can't
erase it right now but anyway we're
gonna go ahead and finish up this
tutorial session on building this mini
bot there's a few things that I need to
get into including how we're gonna build
a entire django website from scratch I'm
going to show you guys how to do that
and I'm gonna explain more about that in
the next video I'm also going to touch
base on Ajax here pretty soon
we're gonna use something called
selenium webdriver to parse heavily you
websites you use a lot of Ajax and stuff
so I'm gonna get into that but that's a
little bit separate than what we've done
here I still also need to touch base on
how we're gonna fill out forms using
pythons mechanize and I think once we
touch on those three subjects there's
really not much there's really not much
you can't scrape with those three
combined methods and then it's just a
matter of you know building a website
that is worth wild and come back to I
mean because you can't just simply
scrape data and and redisplay it I can
tell you that's not gonna work so it's
still gonna take some creativity some
some hard work and effort as far as like
you know if you're going to be using a
website where you're collecting data you
still need to do more than just
redisplay the data you gotta add your
own you gotta add a unique twist to it
and things like that and that's always
you know the hardest thing to do
otherwise you know everybody would be
doing it
alright so I'll go ahead and cut this
video off now I'll talk to you guys
later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
