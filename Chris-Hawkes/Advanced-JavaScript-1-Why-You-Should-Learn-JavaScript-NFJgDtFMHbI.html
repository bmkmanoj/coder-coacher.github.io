tutorial series I'm gonna be putting
together it's gonna be advanced
JavaScript so it's not really something
for beginners and JavaScript however
it's going to be good for any sort of
beginner to just kind of you could
probably brush up on the language using
something like w3c schools which is a
website so it's let me give you this
thing so here we got this junk
so w3 schools comm is a good place to go
for some just basic JavaScript
fundamentals of how the language works
but what we want to talk about in this
tutorial series is more about some of
the more modular approaches to writing
JavaScript so you know how do libraries
like jQuery work we're not gonna be
doing like jQuery specifically but like
how did they make jQuery like how is it
considered to be a functional language a
lot of people will tell you that
javascript is not functional and it's
kind of argumentative whether or not
it's a functional language but it
certainly has functional features and
what kind of discuss that in this
tutorial series so hopefully you guys
can bear with me I am NOT in academic
I'm just a programmer like you guys are
and I just try to give back to the
community and see if I can if you know
try to expand upon your knowledge and
expand upon mine at the same time if I
make mistakes or anything like that I
apologize in advance once again I'm not
some academic who has a master's degree
or a PhD on some sort of JavaScript
thesis I didn't write the language and
I'm bound to make mistakes so that's
just the way it is unfortunately now one
of the things I did want to get into is
if you've never gotten into Java Square
before I'm hoping that you've actually
heard of it but if not JavaScript goes
way back it was created by this guy
named Brandon Ike and so it goes back to
according to Wikipedia here like
Netscape so the Netscape Navigator so
essentially JavaScript was created for
the browser ended up being the adopted
browser language just based on you know
a usage and a lot of different you know
details that just kind of fell in line
which we won't talk about here but
essentially over the years a long time
ago javascript became the fundamental
fundamental language of the browser and
therefore of the the web so
back in the old days but when browsers
couldn't really you know do a lot of
video streaming and stuff like that it
was just a lot of anchors and text and
paragraph tags and a lot of HTML and
stuff CSS had you know certain features
but it wasn't nearly as complex it is it
is now but over the years we've seen
JavaScript become literally one of the
most important languages out there
because everything has a web presence
every business has a website or at least
most of them do websites are becoming
more sophisticated as our internet
speeds are increasing browsers are
adopting trends we've seen Google Chrome
start leading the pack Microsoft had a
very bad reputation for their internet
explorer browser which dates back to
like I used six and seven and eight and
nine and they were all terrible browsers
but then starting in like IE 10 they
started updating themselves which is
what chrome and mozilla were doing and
chrome and mozilla always worked when
you were developing some sort of new
feature but IE was always just a little
bit different and unfortunately was a
lot of that back and forth going on so
it was very difficult to write
javascript because you could write
JavaScript any would work in Chrome and
Firefox but it wouldn't work in IE and
it certainly wouldn't work in earlier
versions of ie so all these hacks
started being introduced throughout the
years and you know and that continues
even to this day unfortunately so we do
see some differences in the way that
browsers are treating and executing
JavaScript so certain things will work
in certain browsers and they weren't
won't work in others and then that gives
rise to what we've seen with a lot of
different JavaScript libraries things
like jQuery which has been around for
quite a while now and it's you know it
is the de facto standard for how to
write javascript in a lot of ways
because the jQuery guys are all the best
JavaScript developers in the world
really working on a similar library of
essentially functions and you call these
functions and these functions are
guaranteed to work essentially the same
on most browsers so it prevents you the
individual developer from having to
learn all these different ways have been
able to accomplish the same goal you
could rely on a third-party library like
jQuery and get the job done
at a reasonable speed so jQuery
continues to be a very popular op
to this day but as we've moved into the
last few years you've seen a lot of
JavaScript flame wars and really the
raging harder now than they've ever been
javascript has so many different
directions that you get pulled in you
have templating languages like like
underscore and then you have like data
binding libraries like backbone that you
hear or knockout then you have like
actual libraries that are handling like
they're just a view for like an MVC web
app where you have Model View controller
the view is now being handled in a lot
of cases companies really like the way
the Facebook react library works and
that's all just JavaScript in their own
way of being able to you know maintain a
dynamic fluid UI which stands for user
interface and so we've seen a lot of
like react lately and then you have
full-scale web frameworks that are being
written in JavaScript those frameworks
include things like angular ember meteor
and then you have JavaScript databases
these no sequel databases like MongoDB
you have JavaScript for server-side now
with no js' now nodejs isn't is a
JavaScript API built on top of c and c++
library so basically c and c++ allow
node to be very very fast but node
itself you you write node in javascript
but essentially you know it's all you
know machine level code and stuff data
that is written down to like C and C++
so you just use JavaScript in order to
to work with it but so we've seen a lot
of these transitions and then this is
also given rise because once you start
dealing with a lot of JavaScript files
you're quickly going to run into
problems where you have namespace
collisions because of something called
global variables and and tainting of the
name space or they call it you know
polluting the global namespace so we're
going to talk about some of that stuff
but that's another reason for a modular
approach to using JavaScript where you
have a bunch of different modules and
the modules allow you to use closures to
your advantage to it to prevent
the pollution of global namespace and
what that ends up causing is that you
end up having a bunch of JavaScript
files that sometimes rely upon one
another and they have to be loaded in
the right order and for it for
everything to work smoothly so now
that's also given rise to things like
requirejs which is like the old-school
way of using javascript modules and
making sure that they're required in the
right order so you're not trying to
reference you know certain JavaScript
code that hasn't loaded yet you've seen
tools like gulp and browserify which are
kind of doing the same thing browserify
is actually taking the approach that
node has where you can easily require
modules not just third-party modules
like jQuery or react or something like
that but also your own third-party
modules that you're going to create
which we're going to show you in this
tutorial series as I say which we which
means I it's just me doing this tutorial
but I'm going to show you how to use
some and create some of these modules
that you can then use something like
browserify to load and work alongside
with jquery react or whatever sort of
other you know javascript library that
you're working with so now long story
short there that became a big issue when
you start getting into complex
JavaScript development is that you end
up having to maintain all these
javascript files so now we have these
new libraries browserify calls and stuff
like that where you end up we're having
a like a test file where essentially
you're doing all your development in
that you run your browserify and
browserify takes all the requirements
and all that stuff and it matches it
into one big javascript file where
everything is loaded in the right order
and you don't have any sort of clashes
or referencing of on you know unloaded
variables and objects and things like
that so anyway that's kind of where we
are in the state of things right now
javascript boards are going to continue
to flame on the list of top ten
languages for a video I wrote last year
which has had way more traffic than I
ever thought it was going to get and it
has like 350,000 views to date which I
never thought it would get that much Z
and always end up languages are like the
Bible right people are like religion
actually like people they view their
language as a Bible in a lot of cases
they can
very very religious about it I'm very
like I'm kind of the same way I'm always
a Python is a great language but I'll be
the first admit it's not the best for
everything but a lot of newbie
programmers they'll tell you Oh
functional you gotta you've you know
purely functional languages of the
future well they've been talking about
that for twenty years you know so
this isn't the first time something like
this has come up and I'm not saying like
a functional language a purely
functional language or even just a
functional language like Scala or
something like that is not the future
I'm just simply saying people are very
passionate about what in languages they
think are the most important however I
think a good majority of developers out
there that would say if you're looking
for a job and you want to be competitive
in today's marketplace you need to be a
JavaScript expert or at least very very
good with JavaScript because javascript
is what is here and right now everybody
has a website Java scripts the only
thing that runs consistently in all the
browsers and we're seeing more and more
reliance upon the JavaScript language
and that is really not going to change
anytime soon so you can put all those
language Wars aside whether or not you
want to lose you know learn Python or C
sharp or whatever it is you should
always learn JavaScript with whatever
you want to do even if you want to use
something like closure or elixir or
Scala or something like that you still
want to learn JavaScript alongside with
that so hopefully I can help you guys
out with this tutorial series and if
it's crap then just let me know I do my
best and I'm not perfect but anyway guys
thanks for watching and have a good
night bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
