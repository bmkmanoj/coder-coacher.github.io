a second video of the series and in this
video what I'm going to do is add a
bunch of HTML and basically add a home
page to the website so whenever you're
doing something like this we need to
have navigation since we're using
bootstrap if you actually type in go
home bootstrap navigation like the first
result you can see here there's just a
nav bar example so all we need to do is
just right click go to inspect using
chrome and if we make sure we have the
entire navigation header there selected
I could say copy copy outer HTML and
then above right in my body here is
where I'm gonna have the nav so that
this shouldn't miss should work here and
a couple of things down at the bottom
this this UL class I want to get rid of
the entire thing I don't want that so
let's go ahead and run the application
all right so you can see that the
navigation is like this full width thing
a lot of people don't don't like that
and in fact I'm not going to do that
either so the reason why it is full
width is if I right-click and I look at
the nav style here
it's really this container fluid-like if
I got rid of fluid I think this would
just Center in the middle yeah that's
what I want all right all we have to do
is go over and take off this fluid part
the fluid makes it go to 100% width
using bootstrap and while we're in here
let's go ahead and update some of the
stuff in here like here's the home
directory so the home directory is your
root directory so you just have to do a
forward slash there we're going to go
ahead and just make a tutorials link and
then here I'm gonna just put vlogs vlogs
and
I'm gonna get rid of this entire sub
menu I actually don't have enough
content to even populate it right now
so a lot of this stuff is on the fly I
haven't really given it too much thought
I should go ahead and take fluid off of
there all right so now you can see it's
actually centered and what I want to do
is give this background like a nice
probably black so I can change the
background over here and start messing
with how I want it to look so I want it
kind of dark so we'll go with that color
that'll work now we need to add custom
CSS so let me I'm gonna just paste that
color so I don't forget it and then I'm
gonna copy this link statement here and
just below it I'm gonna go ahead and
paste what we're gonna call our main CSS
and since we've created that file we
need to go ahead and add it to our
project so I'll go to CSS add new item
I'm just down here I can say main dot
CSS so now I can go ahead and I need to
figure out I need to figure out what
class and I said basically this navbar
default this entire class I just want to
go ahead and paste it in here and since
you're dealing with classes if you want
to start with class and CSS you're gonna
use a dot or a period and if it's gonna
be actual ID don't style an ID but if
you did it'd be a pound so anyway we're
gonna say background color and really we
could just save in background problem
it's not black round but background
black rounds racist background color
I'm gonna grab this this thing that I
pasted here this color that we saved
from the browser and let's just make
sure that it's working and it's not
working I'll probably cuz I didn't save
it
yeah layouts not saved that's why
all right but my color is not working
the idea because I should be just doing
this navbar default probably so
basically I'm overriding the bootstrap
style background that should work
all right there we go so now our our
colors are all jacked up they should
probably be white so here's this entire
style if I just in fact you know what
f that just copy the entire thing
control C and then we can put it in our
custom styles down here and we're gonna
change this to white which is FFF
it's now that's white this this brand
color needs to be changed so we're gonna
go ahead and override that and I want
that white as well and now we're while
were in here let's go ahead and um this
thing so we're gonna make it not quite
white but we're going to do CCC which is
basically on a:hover
I really don't like how that's all
spaced together like that that's what
chrome is doing they should have some
proper spacing between that what that
means is that's actually a direct
descendant so let's just so this should
basically tent the color just slightly
actually tints it quite a bit but that's
cool that's fine I can live with that
for right now let's not worry about it
and we should probably you know I can
live with that for right now all right
next thing we want to do I want to do a
slider like this on the front page so I
can start running through some stuff
here so this just gives you the code
that you need to copy so we're gonna
copy this entire thing
and send some we don't want every page
to have this we're just going to put
this in the home page
now since we're also you know alright so
we also need to add the bootstrap Jas
file for this to work so we're gonna say
script type equals text JavaScript which
is actually not mandatory anymore but
I'm still kind of old-school with that
then we say source and we're going to
use the static tag that we've been using
so static jf we're going to do the
bootstrap min-ji so bootstrap Minjae s
alright and then I'm also why is this
complaining because it needs to be close
I'm sorry the script tags need to be
closed like that alright so in order for
bootstrap to work it also needs jQuery
but as you can see we don't actually
have jQuery downloaded so let's go to
download jquery here and we'll look at
the compress production version so if we
in fact we'll just go ahead and just go
to your file explorer and wherever it
downloaded manually copy and paste it so
here's the jQuery one point whatever and
we're going to cut this and we're going
to put it into our project that we're
working on
all right sum up it paste our joint
right there and just because I don't
care about the actual version of jQuery
it sits in the comments and everything
of the file itself so I don't need to
know what specific version it is so I'm
just going to college a query to Batman
that's fine so now we can change this to
jQuery time in now if we go back to the
instructions for the carousel let's make
sure so this just might work actually
so
alright let's just see what happens
now it's obviously going to point to a
bunch of images that are not in our
project it looks like we have a typo
okay both of these are missing an
apostrophe
all right so it actually just works so
it looks like you're probably I guess it
needed hell I don't know all I know is
that if you follow those instructions it
works but you can obviously see that
there's no images here so if there was
an image it would be showing up like
right and right in the top so let's go
ahead and just um for the moment
add a couple of images so I can actually
go to creative commons here search
Google Images and search for flower
cities are all free images to use so
we'll just copy this image URL or image
address Oh God dang it
that's Google's frigging cached version
so go to view image and then you can
copy image address and it'll work so
basically we're just going to copy the
same image and all of these just for now
so now you can see it's a little bit
better it's not quite aligning very well
though so like if I do image source
let's see margin:0 auto that'll at least
Center it in fact I probably want to
probably want to set a max width on that
as well
yeah for right now this is gonna that'll
be good enough for me all this stuff
should be tinkered with but since I'm
doing a video I don't want to mess with
it too much but basically I didn't want
the image number one I wanted it Center
number two I don't want it overlapping
the little arrow icon things
all right
all right so we're we're moving along
here let's go back to our layout page
and oh really not to layout I'm gonna do
the index so basically the index I I
need like a call-to-action or something
so basically before my carousel I should
have like a big glass container and then
in here it's gonna be an h1 so you
should your page should only ever have
one h1 but we'll just say start learning
good day and then I want to text or all
out-of-class texts enter this little
center the text using styles that are
already included in bootstrap so
basically you're not gonna have a flower
image here this is going to be like
tutorial videos from my channel that I
plan on having also let's go ahead and
on the actual layout page we need to add
the name of our project is right now it
says my project or something like that
it's just here a C's project name so we
wanted to say new post and then the link
should just before it slash because it's
gonna go back to the home directory
so basically if you clicked on that you
if you click on the home page or at home
and it'll take you to that back to the
the index to the root directory and the
main page of the application right now
our application only has one page
all right guys um so I'm gonna I'm gonna
cut this video here and this is
basically just getting a front page
working navigation also the good thing
about bootstrap is I didn't show you but
it automatically is working on we really
need to do something about the styling
it's it needs to be worked on properly
but you can see that actually as
responsive working for you so on mobile
views and everything that'll work just
fine
alright guys thanks for watching please
subscribe have a good day let me know
