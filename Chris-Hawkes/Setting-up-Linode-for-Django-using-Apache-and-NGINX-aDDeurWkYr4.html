we're going to be doing is I'm learning
how to set up and OneNote but we know it
is the server that i've been using now
it's a virtual private home so it's
really awesome when it comes to getting
all your up and running it's really
quick and everything so it's a little
bit more complicated to set up but just
going from purchasing a domain and then
getting it set up on the note I'm going
to kind of just go through a
step-by-step process this particular
tutorial does not entail like how you
actually set up your server it really is
only going to take place on okay I
bought a domain how do I go ahead and
enable my Apache virtual host and if
you're using any sort of additional
virtual host server like in my case I'm
using engine X so I have two servers
running on each domain that I purchased
so that's what I'm going to go ahead and
do is just show you what you would do to
forward your DNS servers and things like
that so here isla node and i just bought
from godaddy a a domain named
crowdfunding scope calm and it's for a
website that originally I had started
for these tutorials but then I decided
to change it over to a crowdfunding
website but then I realized that too
don't really mix and I want newb niche
which is what my tutorials are based off
of to just essentially be about
tutorials getting things off the ground
stuff like that and crowdfunding needs
to kind of go somewhere else so that's
why after some research and everything I
found crowdfunding scoop I'm going to go
with that it's kind of sits like a news
site so it's really one only things that
were available at the time so anyway I'm
going to go ahead and get this all
switched over so now that I have this
information first things first let's go
ahead and go to our lindo look up here
and go ahead and click on out of the
node and then dns manager
vodka alright sorry when we add this
it'll actually tell you so the first
things first we're going to add our
domain name I was looking for the dns
server but it's going to show it after
we add the domain name so when you do it
you don't add www suggests crowdfunding
scoop com or whatever your domain name
is then you're going to want to give an
email address and this is an email
address you probably don't want to be
related to the actual domain that you're
using because if this domain goes down
pretty reason and somebody needs to get
in contact with you you want to have an
email that's not relying upon the domain
that it's in regards to so in this case
I'm just going to go with new niche @
gmail.com which is not going to you know
it's obviously always going to work and
they just make sure that it's going to
buy DeVault have that yes add master
details and I me just want to make sure
that is selected and go ahead and press
ok and then you'll take into this fray
near and these are these NS records I
was talking about these dns records so
this you have to go to the place where
you bought your domain in my case it's
godaddy and you need to Ford those
nameservers over to the node so the node
knows how to handle that domain because
then once it goes to a noted then goes
to it finds your application and routes
your domain name to whatever virtual
host is handling that domain name so
I'll get into that more in just a second
but I just take note of this go ahead
and copy the first one NS one more node
and we're going to go over to godaddy
here and if you're logged in you'll be
able to manage your domain and it should
be able to take you into something
similar to this how these are domains
that I own let's go ahead and go into
this one
alright now that we have that we're
going to go down into this name server
and just click manage and then what we
need to do is go ahead and add a name
server
godaddy actually just recently changes
that but if you didn't see what I just
did missionary here it's defaulting the
standard this is something new with
godaddy as of like the last couple weeks
so just click custom and then add name
server and then just copy them what you
had and there's actually five that we
want to add here so just copy and paste
the same thing but just change the
number one through five so we're going
to do this five times
all right there just click Add so that
part is done we're going to save it and
you're not gonna see it right away with
godaddy it'll take about five minutes
and then you'll see the name servers are
updated so now that we've done that
we're good there and get that taken care
of I'd send out of we've done not let's
go back over to the node and that is all
set up here so now we need to go out and
assemble our patchy virtual hosts so
you're going to need to have if you're
using Windows you're going to have
something like this which is putty putty
is going to allow you to log in to your
website and if you set up your server
you obviously have to have done this
before but putty allows you to log into
your linux box and once we're here this
is where you need to go to make sure
you're at your root directory here which
is uh you'll see the CTC and metc
directory you're going to have a patchy
too so CD space apache2 and these sites
available now these are the sites that i
already have enacted on my lenovo i'm
going to go ahead and add crowd-funding
sort of scope as well so a good way to
do this if you already have a working
application just so you can see what is
working I'm going to go ahead and just
say sudo nano new niche com password
there alright so what I'm going to do
here actually going to copy this entire
thing so I've copied this and on this is
an actual working directory what patchy
is doing as it's listening on port 8000
because typically your server listens to
port 80 but in my case I have static
content being delivered through engine X
and in genetics is looking for static
stuff like JavaScript files and images
and if it's
that it sends every other requests over
to port 8000 which would is then handled
by Apache so that's what we have going
on here I'm going to go ahead and exit
out of this now we need to go ahead and
create a new file named the domain that
we just purchased so it's going to be
sudo nano and the pseudo is necessary if
you're not logged in as root and it's
always a good idea not to allow root
access so I'm just a user that has extra
privileges in to access as extra
privileges IP is a pseudo name so Nano
is going to bring up the editor and then
we're going to name our file so it's
going to be crowd funding Scoob com so
here it's going to be blank now if you
right-click your mouse button it will
paste and everything that we had before
and then what we need to do is go in
here and we're going to change some of
these things so it's still going to
listen on port 8000 but my server name
is going to be switched over to
crowdfunding scoop my alias is from
funding school and I'll keep my same
email address now I'm going to name my
wet web application just crowd I guess I
haven't made that yet but everything is
going to be located within crowd so this
is where you would actually put like in
my case i'm using a django website so
essentially i'm just a hey Django needs
to know where this with CG script is
located and it's going to be located in
this directory once I am finished here
so these settings you would just forward
to wherever your application is going to
be located based upon your document
structure so yeah anyway so
just going to finish these up
now that is it and you're going to press
us to change the savings or did the
settings and when you press 0 if you do
a durar on the file you'll be able to
see that it's there now in my case since
I'm using engine xip the same thing with
engine X and I'm really what I should do
is uh should copy and paste that last
thing I had i'm gonna copy and paste the
same thing I just had before so i would
not to do that all over again CD space
or pseudo so you'll see that this is
here i'm going to copy this and then
we'll go back in my case i'm going to go
into engine X and I'm going to the same
thing sites available and then just the
exact same thing sydow nano www Kron
funding school calm and we right click
this in here and I do need to change the
actually you know what I'm not going to
do this I just realized something engine
X has a different structure and i'll
explain that in just a little bit sort
of work the Apache is not going to work
like that so in addition to being in
sites available there's a sites enabled
and you really have to add it here too
now you can do it the long wait like
this sudo nano and then the same thing
that crowd funding scoop com so you can
just type the exact same thing in like
this and just save it so that way it's
there there's also a shortcut to where
you can actually I'm just make a
like a link to the file that already
exists so in this case I'm not going to
worry about back to where he did it but
there is on just a shorthand that would
save you a couple of seconds there so
I'm going to go into my engine X now and
sites available and I'm going to do I'm
going to tell me the same thing from my
working directory which is noob niche oh
 alright so we're going to just copy
this entire joint a lot of times have to
select from the top and then we're going
to go ahead and just
and I could go in here and I could
change this
so this is the setup then for
crowdfunding scope for engine X and copy
this will press ctrl x to leave this and
impress yes for saving it now it's good
the same thing the site's enabled and
then just make the same thing now one
other thing I did do which I think I
messed up on as far as my naming of the
file
you see I name that wrong so look I just
say remove RM so sudo RM www a
crowd-funding stoop and then we got rid
of it so that's some real quick I didn't
mean to put the www on there like that
jovan back in here and I just need to
copy this and put that into the other
one and two sites enabled the name at
the right thing
alright and now that we've done that we
need to go ahead and restart the server
we're actually we're going to rebuild
the servers and then restart them and
assuming your application is set up in
my case it's not but you'll see it work
probably in a couple hours after the DNS
servers switch over from godaddy to the
node into your new application but let's
go ahead and restart the server now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
