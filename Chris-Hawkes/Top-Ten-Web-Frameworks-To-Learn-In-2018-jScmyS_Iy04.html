my top ten web frameworks that I think
one should learn for 2018 so if you're
trying to get a head start this is kind
of taken into consideration with the job
market looks like right now and also
going into the future so what I'm
looking at all that stuff I'm like I'm
trying to like future-proof this as much
as possible to say you know isn't gonna
be around for a couple of years or so so
anyway it's just one person's opinion
you know take it with a grain of salt
obviously but let's go ahead and get
started so number one or really number
10 I'm going to be counting down from
ten to one so number ten is is going to
be just typical asp.net so like dotnet
four point six or four point zero point
seven whatever the latest version is but
whatever that version is it's going to
be the version before dotnet Corsa
dotnet core has at least three two or
three versions that they've come out
with already and I'm not talking about
dotnet core with asp.net it's jus it's
typically four point five or four point
you know three point four point seven so
if you have those skills there's a lot
of opportunity out there and there will
be for some time because there's so much
there's so much of the dotnet because
the ecosystem that you know it takes a
long time to to upgrade to the latest
standards so there's gonna be plenty of
opportunity for that number nine on my
list is gonna be laravel now laravel I'm
not a big fan of PHP I like I don't
really recommend it as a first language
or you know I really only really
recommend PHP if you're getting paid to
write PHP it's what I've said time and
time again but if we're going to mention
PHP and a web framework that's really
popular right now it's gonna be laravel
so definitely check that out if you're a
PHP person alright next one is Falcon
and I'm really excited about Falcon I
plan on spending some time with Falcon
in 2018 it really looks like a cool
framework it's super fast it's very
small it's it's it's a money it's it's
good for micro services so there's been
a lot of talk about micro services these
days which is really just a bunch of
individual api's instead of one monolith
API that is handling all the requests
micro-services is all just drill down
into just you know specific pieces of
functionality having separate API so
it's easier to maintain
or at least that's the goal behind it so
with microservices so if you're gonna
build something you know very bare-bones
especially with like a view J s on the
front or a react or something like that
then you know micro-service is something
that specialized specializes in api is
it's probably a good idea so that's why
I'm excited about Falcon I definitely
plan on checking that out so that's for
the Python programming language next one
is going to be rebel and this is based
off of the goaline programming language
and golang is also another languages
it's highly suited for microservices web
api is things like that so if you're
going that route and you truly need the
performance over something like Python
then go is a good alternative it's a
very concurrent language so revel is the
leading framework for the go lang
programming language so if you're going
to be going that route then rebel is
probably a good direction to take number
six on this list is meteor and the
problem with meteor in my opinion it's
it's a it's a node.js web framework but
it's really only been built around
MongoDB to date and there's a lot of
security concerns with MongoDB that make
meteor not a great option for a lot of
people I remember when the project first
started getting venture capital funding
like it had commercial ambitions from
the start it just seems like it missed
kind of a few steps along the way and
and there's plenty of blog posts about
the mistakes that were made and things
like that but I think meteor is still a
pretty good option for nodejs anybody
that wants to go with that you know that
nodejs
server stack all right
number five is flask I really feel like
there's a lot of opportunity with flask
if you compare flask to Falcon then you
know those two could probably be duking
it out here pretty soon but you know
Falcons more of an API whereas like
flask is still it provides you templates
and things like that so with with flask
I think there's an opportunity for you
know you to even build a stack with
flask and both Falcon alright number
four on this list is going to be Ruby on
Rails and the reason why rail and the
rails is still highly popular just like
Microsoft and dotnet and things like
that there's going to be a lot of rails
opportunity out there for for some time
to come
and it's still a viable
for a lot of websites said that are
being created even to this day like
website said if you need a full stack
framework for the authentication things
like that then I mean Ruby's it's it's
still a good option but I've never been
a person I've never been a huge Ruby
guys but from you know the jobs and
things like that it's still definitely a
viable option and something that I think
you're pretty safe learning here for the
next couple of years number three on my
list is Django this is probably you
could probably switch this out with Ruby
maybe depending on different people's
point of view but Django is not not
nearly as popular as it used to be but
it's still a very very awesome option
for websites with like I said
authentication authorization things like
that that Django just provides so much
out of the box you don't have to write
it makes it so much easier for me to
develop a website that for instance like
my hipster cook website I chose Django
over nodejs
even though I was writing a lot of
JavaScript at that time like I just felt
like Django was much more mature than
anything that nodejs was providing so I
don't think I went wrong on that at all
because I was able to build a website
that I needed in like three months and I
mean this thing was taking credit card
payments and had a lot of different
customizations to it and things like
that so I was able to focus on that
functionality as opposed to writing the
entire framework and Django just
provides it out of the box that's why
I'm sure I'm sure I'm showing a little
bit of favoritism but it's just because
Django is awesome so all right number
two is going to be dotnet core so future
proofing yourself I mean dotnet is going
to be around for a long time 20 billion
dollar a year profiting you know company
Microsoft speaking this project is their
future and it's cross-platform so it's
the first time Microsoft's gone that
direction really in their entire history
so they're embracing the open source and
cross-platform market and for that
reason they're gonna be a major player I
think in the future really leading into
the next five years or so probably
Microsoft really had to go in this
direction because they were losing
market share and pretty much everything
that they were doing including web
frameworks like you saw Ruby on Rails
Django and they started taking a lot of
market share from asp.net and older
frameworks with Java like Springs stuff
like that that was it was much cheaper
it was faster startups liked it was a
cooler language it was new but so
Microsoft's kind of they've taken a lot
of steps to get to this point to where
they're at right now and I think that
it's going to end up being positive for
them and probably for any you know
c-sharp developers that are trying to
get into the mobile development and web
development or just you know typical
console development all right anyway
number one is going to be expressed and
probably not a surprise the reason why I
say Express is because there's so much
there's so many web frameworks out there
that are running on nodejs or that just
a can run on no js' and when you're
looking at something that just gets the
job done like Express gets you up and
running so fast with with nodejs that
I've seen a lot of very very major
websites like from huge corporations
that are running Express yes it's
perfect for the modern client-side
framework by the way these are all
server-side stacks so I'm sure that's
probably apparent to you guys after I've
listed all ten now this is server-side
stacks I'm not counting the client-side
you know what you would even call like a
framework now a client-side which is
like v UJS or angular react things like
that now there is like this new I would
say basically the community is is it is
labeling these things web frameworks but
they still need a server-side technology
so it still needs like a node you know
running Express or something like that
so if you're running Express it works
perfectly with angular react or EM
review whatever direction you want to go
and that's why I have it number one on
this this list because I've just seen a
lot of companies they're like hey I just
need a minimalist server spun up that's
really just renting a single page and I
need an API and for that no jess is is
very very good and if you're gonna go no
GS you're gonna go Express probably so
all right guys that's my top 10 list man
let me know what you think have a good
day bye hey guys what's up so this video
was brought to you by the tech Academy
