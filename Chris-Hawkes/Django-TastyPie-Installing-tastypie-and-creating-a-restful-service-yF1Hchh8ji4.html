series we're going to be looking at
django in tasty pie the web is turning
into very quickly a world of AP is
everything's got have an API and the
reason why that is is because every
device out there whether it's a mac
windows cell phone android iOS whatever
it is you have browsers that are able to
understand HTTP so HTTP is something
that they can all finally understand
it's better than XML and so it's a
little bit less overhead and community
applications can communicate back and
forth with each other if they have an
API to expose themselves so the
client-side whole the whole situation
with the client-side development is that
JavaScript and client-side code used to
refer to the browser and individual
browsers nowadays it's just specifically
ap Isis is like the new client side
thing so Django tasty pie is really
Django let's go to solution for setting
up a RESTful API servers for your
website the other option would be Django
rest framework those are clearly the top
2 i'm going to go with tasty pie
hopefully i'll do a tutorial series
sometime in the future on django rest
framework because i've never used it no
really used tasty pie either so this
website that i have pulled up in front
of me is new post calm kind of a new
technology blog type of thing doesn't
get a whole lot of traffic as i just
started it and I don't mind messing it
up in the process of trying to get tasty
pine and stuff set up so really it's got
a very simple model it's only one
application there's like it's called a
news app so like my news app is going to
be what I expose under Django tasty pie
so what we're just going to be trying to
do is try to be able to get data from
our API front we're going to try to get
JSON data from the database into the API
so hopefully we'll be able to get all
this stuff taken care of and everything
so first things first when you go ahead
and install tasty tasty pie so pull up
your command prompt whatever that is if
it's windows I'm in Linux right here so
i need to do sudo since its linux
windows you want to do
but go ahead and use pip install pip
install Django tasty pie alright it's
just are you satisfied I started having
installed now when you go ahead and pull
up our application and I so pull up your
editor wherever your application is
currently set up and we need to go into
our settings file all right in our
settings file let's go ahead and add
tasty pie and it's just called tasty
part alright so we're going to save that
alright so just to take a quick look at
what we got going on here it's actually
two modules I forgot about this way this
new is a module with this models file
and this should all be familiar with you
if you've done jang of development
hopefully you have if not then you
probably want to stop this video right
now because it's not going to make a bit
of sense anyway so this is a model file
so we have our model set up so the API
apparently can live anywhere for tasty
pies so we can actually create like an
API folder I'm not even that ensure it's
necessary to even have an API folder but
I could probably just have it sitting in
fact I'll just have that mofo sitting
right am I my project folder here so
let's go ahead and create a new file so
I'm using visual studio isn't going to
make a lot of sense for a lot of people
out there doing like Python development
sure most of them don't use visual
studios just I happen to be a c-sharp
developer so I end up using that for
work and stuff like that so I just kind
of do Python in it so i can not have to
mess with multiple IDEs especially when
they get really complicated i like
visual studio so anyway let's go ahead
and call this API it's going to be that
pie file
so I have that just sitting right in
here and we need to go ahead an import
from tasty pie got resources import
model resource and then we're going to
go ahead and import from our news module
here so we'll sit from news import in
fact it needs to be from news top models
import the name of the bottle which is
news okay so we'll save that now we're
going to create a class and we'll call
it news resource and this is going to
inherit from model resource which we
just imported at the top and we have a
class meta then we'll say query set
equals news objects dot all resource
name equals news and this thing actually
will give a name apparently if we don't
provide one but we're just going to do
that anyway alright so now in order for
this resource to work we just simply
need to add it to our URLs file
so we're going to go down here and
similar to what we got going on right
now just when i say api and include
um
so I've actually never done this before
but apparently all i have to do is
include entry resource about urls which
i don't think that's right oh wait now
that's clearly not right so it's
actually going to be there's resource
sorry so what we want to do up here is
we want to import from our model files
will say from my project ap I implore
news resource and then I'm down here
just above my site Maps i'm going to go
ahead and add news resource equals news
resource open closed parenthesis all
right that's what we want in fact you
know i have to fix a path issue i should
just have to say from api import news
resource i believe so my go ahead and
upload this to myself which we
technically don't we don't want to leave
this in production or anything like that
we need to add some authentication to
this but just for the time being
hopefully nobody with me so now
that that is hooked up and i uploaded it
to the server what i can do now is I can
go forward slash API news which is the
name of my module and then I can just
say ? format equal Jason and now I get a
bunch of JSON data back for every every
news item that I have in here so it's
pretty cool just like that we have a
restful working API now like I said I'm
just second ago I can be with
very easily by exposing this to the
public so the next thing I need to do is
make sure I go ahead and add some
authentication to this our guy so I'm
going to go ahead and touch on that in
the next video this video was about
installing tasty pies setting it up and
using it with an existing model within
Django alright guys make sure you
subscribe I appreciate all the
subscribers out there if you have any
questions feel free to leave a comment
and I'll try to get back to you as soon
as possible
all right everybody take care bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
