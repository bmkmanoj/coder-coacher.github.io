karim here he says jquery after basic
javascript is it enough or should i
complete JavaScript for web development
you can take whatever course you want to
look javascript i think that it's
definitely are in the top what maybe
five languages to learn right now maybe
number one is probably number one of
your web developer number probably top
five if you're doing other things and
yeah i don't know if you're a web
developer you absolutely have to use
javascript now if you're going to be
going to a lot of corporations they
probably are still using jquery if
you're servicing apps that have been
created oh you know over your boat save
may be anything from like two years ago
and beyond like there's a good chance at
still using jquery and as you guys know
i mean some of this software and
technology meant it stays around for a
long time so the whether or not you
should learn it now like last year early
last year i gave an opinion that said
the jquery was still an important thing
to learn and i said it from that
perspective of okay you're going to go
to a job and you're not going to know
what the hell that is and it doesn't
take that long to learn kind of jquery
ropes to at least understand i you know
enough to be able to find the
documentation if you get tripped up
somewhere but now it's let's fast
forward to today i can tell you that you
know the overall javascript community
has pretty much won with convincing you
know everybody if you're if you're you
know young and around for very long you
know that like es6 is a new standard
this is just the worst looking website
by the way I like Mozilla gr6
website but everybody will tell you that
you know es6 is the next thing in it
really is what's interesting about it
though is that in many cases you cannot
run in the browser what it is you're
writing from within es6 that's why you
need to have babel which will compile it
to older versions of javascript that
still run in the browser so that is the
one like caveat of learning the whole
es6 thing but should you do that versus
jquery and at this point i am changing
my opinion for any
new developers out there don't even mess
with jQuery the JavaScript community is
hostile towards it apparently it's
better nowadays to have seven megabyte
downloads you know running you know full
stack client-side frameworks as opposed
to jQuery which a lot of people consider
to be a monolithic framework but if you
look at it compressed that I'm just
curious so you can see only 32 KB
minified and gzipped and so a lot of
people don't have let you know the gzip
there a lot of servers can't render as
energy's I'm not sure about Jesus to be
honest with you I think from what I
understand not everybody is able to
support that I have to look into that
but on gzipped so if you were going to
look at regular zip top code you're
probably still looking at about you know
more than like 700k be on minified you
know with comments and whitespace and
and everything but like I said nowadays
in the end that is very very very
frowned upon because a lot of what
jQuery did a lot of what people used it
for was simply just like Dom selectors
so like how do i target you know this
div and change it or something I mean so
nowadays with regular raw JavaScript you
should just definitely use the modern
JavaScript way of being able to do that
in fact you could have done that back in
the old day too a lot of people look to
jQuery to do everything that regular
JavaScript could do even regular
JavaScript that was cross platform
across browser compliant so what I find
funny though is that with jQuery like
it's not as big as most of the histories
will tell you it is and then a second
like instead we're going to wrap up
angular and all kinds of other different
technologies into one like I said 9
megabyte javascript file maybe minified
you're looking at you know 4 get 4
megabyte and that's a humongous amount
of download that has to occur on
somebody's cell phone now on you know
data plans like spotty data connections
and things like that so it's like nobody
even considers that anymore which I
guess it's going to one day come back
around and bite us I'm you know Google
still considers that I can tell you that
owning this hipster code site like
Google's such a pain in the
when it comes to like you got to do this
you got to do that in order for it to be
rendered and for people to be able to
find your content you want to read your
your news articles and everything you
got to use use their new mobile
formatting and all this but
then the mobile formatting doesn't work
with my images and it's such a
game you got to play with with Google
ones it's unfortunate but that's the
thing like so a lot of these JavaScript
developers that are building eight mega
you know megabyte bundled up JavaScript
files that the client has to download go
to production with something like that
and see how much credit Google is going
to give you when your content is slow as
 even on the fastest server because
it's so large so that's that's something
I would consider but what you should you
learn jQuery right now my advice is no
it's it's it's a hot people look at it
hostile there's a lot of things that
jQuery used to do for us so we don't
need it to do and you know go with es6
use use babel to compile es6 and use
webpack to take all of your different
modules and bring them together and that
might be overkill if you're just getting
started just write the JavaScript that
just works in the browser so even if
it's es5 you know the earlier version of
the javascript standard you know started
to start there but definitely definitely
take make sure you're learning about
these new features like you know Reyat
includes is a very good way of being
able to figure out whether or not an
array has something a value in it where
we used to use index of there's the
things like you know maps and filtering
is so much easier now in es6 and it used
to be so jQuery used to make some of
those things easier for us as well and
we don't we don't really need that
anymore but yeah so that's about amen
just I would consider like you know to
the overall community and as a whole
it's like what is the plan when you have
an 8 megabyte download that you know you
expect everybody to to download and then
have it run in the browser and things
like that like to me there are concerns
there with usability there are concerns
with almost 100% JavaScript doing all
kinds of stuff that even the browser
used to handle for us you know using
things like the
program was reacting there's a lot of
things that does it does very well but
then there's a lot of side effects said
that just crop up and and it's hard to
explain but once we like like I said
once you have eight megabyte of
JavaScript code or even four or even two
I'll just smash the other man and there
are side effects that crop up more on
this JavaScript side of the system than
I've ever seen you know on using older
technologies even crappy technologies
like Wow web forms from from asp.net
which I absolutely hated by the way
there was a terrible set of Technology a
lot of people liked it but anyway all
right guys that's what I got today so
definitely don't don't learn jQuery over
over es6 or just now plain JavaScript
sorry start with that if your job
requires you used jQuery I think
honestly a couple weeks out of playing
around with it you should be serviceable
enough to be able to figure out what's
going on with it alright guys thanks for
watching and make sure you subscribe bye
hey guys so a lot of you asked me how do
I get my foot in the door to become a
programmer and I just want to take a
moment to mention dev Mountain coding
boot camp is a 12-week intensive course
that focuses on the technologies of the
here and now for web development some of
the things that they're actually
teaching in this what we course is
geared to get you into the industry by
focusing on things like jQuery nodejs
react angular how to use github so a lot
of the things that you're going to need
to do as a developer as soon as you
start they're going to be teaching you
in this and this coding bootcamp and the
entire goal is to be able to get you
into the industry within 12 weeks so if
you guys are interested in learning more
information about dev mountain coding
bootcamp just check out the link in the
description tab of this video thank you
for watching and have a good day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
