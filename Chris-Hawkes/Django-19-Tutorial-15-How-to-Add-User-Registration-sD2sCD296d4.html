we're actually going to be I'm extending
this tutorial series and I'm kind of
going in different directions now and
and the Django website that we have been
building before is not going to be
something that I'm building in this or
continuing to build in the tutorial
series but what we're looking at in this
video is how to extend or how to
implement django registration so that a
user can sign up and log in to your site
and things like that so this is just a
simple application that I have so it's
just a typical Django 1.9 application on
Windows I'm using Postgres as a database
and all of this stuff hopefully you guys
if you're following along in the
tutorial you should have a basic
understanding of you know this app
because there's nothing special going on
here so all right that said let's see
first things first we need to go to our
command line and I need to go ahead and
pull that up
all right so the name of my project is
called mice it's a long story
all right so if you're using a virtual
environment then you have to follow this
step where you go into your virtual
environment you need to activate it
which is under scripts if you're in
Windows I just say activate so now I'm
in my virtual environment if you don't
have a virtual environment don't worry
about any of this stuff but then we need
to do pip install django registration
now with general registration I was just
going to let you know that there's
apparently there's a two-step process
which is typically what you see with
websites where you have to validate your
email address that prevents a lot of
spam and stuff like that but then some
people choose to have a site where it's
very easy to register where you can you
know end up doing stuff with the site
without having to do email verification
that obviously gives away to people that
can you know spam you have multiple
accounts and things like that
one such site is reddit com you can see
like with Reddit you don't have to
actually verify your email so you can
create new accounts very easily but they
other mechanisms I guess to try to fight
the spam that they did alright so one of
the first things we need to do is add
account activation to our settings file
so this is a toggleable feature where
you allow the account if it's pending
email verification you know for somebody
to actually go into their email and
click on the link to verify the account
that's the amount of days that you can
provide so you can make it larger than
that but seven's the default usually
next you have to make sure that you have
django can't rip off and your installed
apps now django should have that already
in there by default but that is needed
for this project alright next we need to
go to the urls file of our project and
we're gonna add one line here and we're
adding it counts and then it's going to
use the Django registration project that
we just installed alright the next step
I'm not sure if this is a valid or not I
have not tried to use this project but
it looks good to me
this guy created a Django registration
templates project so we're going to
trying to make use of that so let's go
ahead and just download the zip for the
project and what we're going to do is
we're going to extract this registration
because all this is this project is just
simply Django HTML files that are needed
for the registration process that way we
don't have to make them ourselves so
we'll use some sort of zip extractor
take this downloaded file and we're
going to extract the entire registration
folder to our Django project templates
folder which I somewhere around here
all right I'll goes a long way so see
projects there it is mice then I have my
templates folder here all right so I'm
gonna just say okay it's gonna extract
it right to my projects template folder
now we should have everything we need
there all right let's go ahead and try
to restart our application actually with
mine I'm using PyCharm which should
reset it every time I'm gonna go ahead
and visit this link
all right so let's go ahead and try to
go forward slash accounts like login all
right looks like it's not finding our
template so that's not cool all right so
if you look at what we have here you can
see that the actual template and the
registration folder is actually being
hit but where it's missing is it saying
it's looking for this base study HTML
which doesn't exist and we don't want
so everybody's site is different right
so you most likely have a layouts folder
so let's look at my template directory I
have a layout folder which is like my
main layout so I'd like to lay out one I
guess this is my main layout I don't
know but yeah we'll just use layout one
so what I need to do is I need to go in
this is gonna be kind of tedious but I
have to go in instead of saying all this
crap I have to say /aa layout slash
layout 1 dot HTML I'll just copy this
whole line I may or may not need that
forward slash I'm kind of thinking I
don't right now let's just go ahead and
try login so that way since that was the
page we were testing so if I go ahead
and save that I don't think I need that
first forward slash I don't remember all
right so it still doesn't exist is it
looking ok so it's looking for the right
thing I just fine so let's get rid of
that forward slash which I don't think I
need
all right there we go all right so this
looks obviously terrible if you're using
bootstrap what you would want to do is
go into go into here bootstrap you
should put everything inside like a div
container oh wait I'm sorry div class
equal container
all right so he'll alright so I don't
feel like doing all this right now but
um you can see if I put in the container
now no changes in fact while I'm in here
just in case you guys are using
bootstrap as well all your input buttons
and stuff like that should be a class
equal form control for nice styling
sorry the Sun setting where I'm living
right now and I need to turn on the
light because I can't see a damn thing
I was looking at my keyboard I couldn't
really see anything actually since this
input down here is a button we want to
be like BTN and BTM primary alright see
we got here alright so it looks a little
better we obviously need to make these
inputs use the same class form controls
so that'll make it look prettier
now I don't want to get too much into
styling the form if you guys need help
and styling the registration form let me
know but I feel like this this tutorials
didn't off on a tangent when we're
talking about styling instead of
actually figuring figuring out how to
implement this so for now let's just go
ahead and do the extend statement at the
top and we're going to go ahead and
replace all these with the right master
page for it to look at
so you guys get the main idea here I'm
gonna just go with these for right now
and we're gonna go instead of login
we'll go to register and we're not gonna
worry about the styling but my username
others say test one I'll use my gmail
address
all right now the reason for this error
is most likely because the project
doesn't have send mail or any sort of
mail client set up for it so it's go
ahead and look at our settings file
again because that's where this is gonna
need to be resolved yeah you can see
there's nothing in here that has
anything to do with the email so let's
go ahead and add that to our settings
we're gonna say from up at our import
statement at the top say from Django
Cora mail import send mail alright
actually guys um don't worry about using
send mail and the settings just go ahead
and delete that what you want to do
instead just go ahead and copy this down
and this is specifically if you're using
Gmail so say you have a gmail address
you just want to use that as your your
website address to send and receive
emails from and that would be fine a lot
of people use mail servers or pay or do
something like that and I typically just
try to use my gmail address but it's not
you know all that professional so anyway
the point is though is that no matter
what email address or mail server you're
trying to use the settings are going to
be slightly different but for Django the
good news is you just have to use these
settings here but you're it's going to
be different depending on what you're
using so if you want to use Gmail like
this I'm 100% sure it works with Gmail I
just tested it email port 587 make sure
you do all these settings here make sure
you're using your email back-end I put
you know make sure you have your right
pass we're down here so this will be
your password and just a test and we'll
say default from email like job mice so
this looks this all looks good I'm gonna
go ahead and put in my real password and
then go ahead and close my settings file
and then we'll test it out all right so
now that I've done that let's go ahead
and start these from this site we'll go
to register my username will just be
Chris Hawks email make sure you give the
right email address has to be a valid
email in order for you to receive it
all right so this is fine this is uh
it's because we didn't change the base
for the register complete template
that's why we're getting this template
not found if we went over to
registration complete and we change this
over to the right to the right thing we
wouldn't have that template not found
but you can see that if I go ahead and
pull up my gmail account
all right so this is the email that I
just received in my gmail account and
you can see that we can customize all
these settings but the local host angle
address sent me this link is valid for
seven days you can customize all those
messages based on the template so if I
went ahead and clicked on this it should
take me to the account activated you
know and there it goes and you can see
down here your account is now activated
so obviously we didn't worry about
styling and look and feel and all that
stuff but now you have a actual actual
you know registration a verified user
which is really cool so you can go to
accounts login and I can do my name
Chris Hawks which is the name of the
user that I just created
now I login now you can customize where
it redirects to this redirected to an
accounts profile page which obviously
doesn't exist but yeah anyway so I'm
logged into the site so normally you
know you would yeah so basically I'm
logged in at this point so that all
works and you can customize you know the
Django registration behavior so that
users have different groups and then you
check for whether or not you know they
belong to a certain group to see certain
pieces of your your application and you
do all that through you know the
combination of Django code on your views
and also through the template but anyway
guys this video just shows you how to
get a working registration if you have
any questions or if you have anything
any suggestions or ideas that I should
expand upon to give further example
because we can definitely go a lot
further into like customizing you know
unique profile pages and stuff like that
but now there's a lot there's a lot of
documentation out there for that this
complete example here though is a full
working example even though it looked a
little ugly at times we weren't worrying
about styling or anything like that it
was all just functionality so it all
works really good and that's it guys
