tutorial series for the go programming
language it's also known as the golang
or just simply go and it's a language
developed by Google and it seems to
begin a little bit more popular in the
last couple of years so I'm still not
very widely used outside of Google and a
few niche locations but it definitely
has some potential on most programming
languages like Python or JavaScript or C
C++ they're all built off of the actual
C programming language a lot of people
think go is just another type of
language built on top of C similar to
like Python or C sharp or C++ but that's
actually not the case so go is its own a
separate machine level programming
language and it is a compiled language
which means that it is fast it's faster
than an interpreted language like Python
or Java running on the Java Virtual
Machine the and definitely faster than
in Python which like I said is an
interpreted language meaning it has to
actually figure out the types that it's
dealing with line by line and when I say
types I mean like an integer from a
string it doesn't know any of that stuff
in advance so that actually slows down a
language but something like go I was
mainly built for really a high speed
execution also a term known as
concurrency where multiple requests can
be made at the same time so it's
definitely good for that type of thing
so there's a lot of talk about languages
like or frameworks really like nodejs
which is JavaScript and JavaScript is
fast it's a C like language and it is
concurrent as well and a lot of people
are like well no js' is good for chat
type of applications you know we're
there's a lot of back-and-forth inside
some sort of a virtual chatroom well go
would actually do a task like that
better because it is a compiled language
and it is very close to machine level
now another thing about go is that it is
very different from your typical
object-oriented language like Java or C
sharp and it's certainly different than
IKOS statically interpreted I'm sorry a
dynamically interpreted language like
Python so if you're looking to kind of
spread your knowledge or use go as your
first programming language there's
definitely nothing wrong with that it it
may be a little bit difficult to grasp
if it is your first language but
definitely no problem in and learn and
go and adding it to your your list of
languages that you know and I think that
it's definitely going to become more and
more important as we move into the
future I mean Google is actively
replacing a lot of their C++ and even
Python code with some go code so I think
we're going to see more jobs and demand
for the go language moving into the
future it's been a lot of hype in the
first few years but over the last couple
of years on libraries and things have
have caught up with the language and and
made it a little bit easier for new
developers to come along and pick it up
now one of the best things that I want
to mention about go compared to
something like Python and C++ I mean
everybody knows C++ is a very fast
language in fact it's probably faster
than go I would say it's like 90% sure
of saying that but go is actually a very
quick language that can compete with C++
and it's certainly a lot faster than a
lot of these other popular languages out
there so if you're looking simply for
speed go is one of the fastest languages
you're going to be able to use alright
guys so in order let's go ahead and move
on with the tutorial in order to get
this thing installed you want to go to
the golang.org website and then just
click underneath the little gopher guy
and we're gonna go ahead and download
the go distribution I'm gonna look for
the MSI for Windows
all right so let's go ahead and go
through the installation I'm using
Windows and it will by default put it in
the C colon go directory it's also going
to add a environment variable to your
Windows system so that way when you're
on your command line you should be able
to type go and it'll be able to find it
and if that doesn't do that
automatically then you need to actually
add go to your environment variable but
once again with the installation if
you're using the MSI it should go
through that whole process for you
all right so then let's go ahead and
click finished you can check your
environment variables if you want by
just going to your control panel
and over here if you click on system
system again there's probably a shorter
way to get here but click on advanced
system settings environment variable and
then under your path when you click Edit
let's see there so we'll check it this
system variable path and you can see
that it added C : and go bin so if for
some reason your go programs don't work
this is where you need to check a lot of
people I can get tripped up by that and
by that all right so now with go what we
need to do is we need to grab an editor
that we can program with I'm a c-sharp
programmer during the day and I like to
do even Python programming in Visual
Studio but I can't use Visual Studio for
for go I've actually tried it there's a
Visual Studio in its extension there's
only one and it doesn't work so at least
on 2013 it doesn't work and I have no
idea why and I don't really feel like
figuring it out but Adam is a good
editor and it's an open source community
created editor and it actually supports
a lot of newer languages it supports go
it supports even stuff like JSX which is
very new so let's go ahead and download
the windows installer so I mean you have
that and you can use any sort of editor
that you want but you need some sort of
editor to develop your go language code
with
all right so after Adam installs you
should be able to see the screen I've
actually not had a whole lot of
experience using this editor so this is
kind of my first stab at it
now if everything goes well I should be
able just click on install a package I'm
going to open up the Installer and then
I can search for the package and what
I'm looking for is something called go+
and there it is right there so that's go
ahead and install this thing hopefully
it works I've never used it
alright guys after it installs um you
should get some messages down here at
the bottom so let's go ahead and create
our first project when I say open a
project I'm sorry actually gonna go over
to file and then say add a project
folder I'm gonna put under my C projects
directory and I'll just have a folder
called go Oh shite I have this ' I need
to rename this alright so we'll put our
files in that go directory
now when we say it will create our first
program file all right so let's go ahead
and run the hello world program so first
thing we do is mean it's a package main
on our second line we're going to say
import and then in double quotes fmt
we'll say function main then we're using
the import fmt dot print F a little
world
I'm never going to save this file and
we'll save it in our projects go
directory which I thought it would be
there automatically but anyway we'll
call this hello world dot go all right
so now that it knows that it's a go file
you can see that we have some syntax
highlighting within our atom editor and
in order to go ahead and run this thing
I'm gonna do it from the command line so
I'm gonna go ahead and open up a command
prompt I'll just open it as admin and
then we're gonna CD into where our go
program is it's an go and then there's
our hello world go and if everything
goes well we should be able to say go
run and in the name of the program
alright so this thing has to go through
it actually has to compile and then run
the program and you see that that's what
it actually did it went through and it
compiled it as basically an X exec
executable file which can run anywhere
and it ran the program and then you see
the output so that slight hesitation is
because the entire program is being
built and created for you as opposed to
just running and dynamically
interpreting it so essentially that
process would only take place the first
time you build a program and then you
can have that and not have to do that
every single time you run it so it may
look like if you're used to like Python
or something that goes not that fast but
it actually truly is a lot faster than
and then it looks alright guys and just
a quick look at what we have in this
program that made this thing work so the
FMT library here is for input/output and
you can see that the output is actually
us printing the screen but we could also
accept input using the FMT
and it's similar to like similar to C
code but completely different and it
gets a little bit of getting used to but
that's like I said for input/output
alright guys and then the packaged main
is actually going to execute this
function main and it's executed by
itself without actually having to call
it so if I had another function down
here described will say function test
and there's a frigging test
you would think if it ran just
sequentially that the test would be the
next thing executed automatically and
that's actually not what takes place so
if I save this thing and I run this you
can see that the second function is not
executed now now one thing you'll notice
like when we want to call this this
second this next function here so if we
run test number one you're gonna know
that there is no semicolons in Google Go
which is completely weird compared to
most other languages because it does
make use of like curly braces but unlike
Python Python doesn't have semicolons
either but it also doesn't use those
those curly braces in the same way that
you know that group these like functions
and for statements and stuff like that
so it's gonna take a lot of getting used
to for like a typical program or if you
get used to the fact that we do not use
semicolons and go and you'll also notice
here is a problem so I try to run this
test function and if we go ahead and run
this you're going to get an explanation
non declaration statement outside
function body meaning that nothing is
there to execute that because it has to
be called from main
and you can see that the main is the
start and everything has to be done
inside main nothing exists outside of
Maine Maine can obviously call other
functions and crap like that but it has
to be called from Maine you can't just
call it down in the file like you would
with a normal pie Chthon type of file
all right guys so we're gonna go ahead
in in this video here hopefully you guys
are getting at least going with go and
in the following videos we'll get more
into the syntax all right thanks for
watching please subscribe bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
