is going to be a little bit different I
haven't really tried anything like this
before and let me just kind of jump
right into it so I've always had this
fascination with cowboys and like Native
Americans and and really like fighting
against all odds and it kind of goes
back to I think you know me living in
texas and visiting the alamo and other
things and and i kind of grew up like
for some reason kind of like i had like
an attraction to that sort of thing i
wanted to hear the stories like there's
something about you know being you know
trapped and hopelessly outnumbered and
trying to fight your way out of it and
things like that and it goes back to
like 300 from sparta and all that stuff
but you know the united states history
and really Texas history got the Alamo
and then there's also the Battle of
Little Bighorn which is one of the
things I from whatever reason I got kind
of fascinated with it I read a few books
on the subject listened to a few audio
books and I just couldn't really get
enough of it it was just it was very
interesting in the fact that somebody
like this guy George Armstrong Custer
was a complete asshole was a Civil War
general for the American during American
Civil War with literally 3% of the
American population perished and the
fighting you're talking about a
significant amount of fighting going on
late 1800s or mid eighteen hundreds
approximately and they were killing each
other in astronomical numbers George
Custer though like he he was there
during the First Battle of Bull Run and
then he was also there when when Lee
surrendered four years later at
Appomattox and was considered at you
know as one of the saviors at Gettysburg
and things like that charge headlong and
then almost every major conflict in the
Civil War survived it all really without
getting shot stabbed or whatever like
one of the things that almost got him
was I was I dysentery during he got sick
during the Civil War had to be sent back
home but then that actually killed a lot
of people in fact more people than even
the fighting in you know they died from
from disease and things like that but
you know he ended up he survived all
this stuff right hands about West to try
to reign reign in the Native Americans
and specifically the Cheyenne Lakota
Sioux and the Arapaho Indians and he's
trying to like he's basically task would
be in a complete
so going into villages murdering natives
and things like that trying to get them
on the reservation well when gold was
discovered in the Black Hills of South
Dakota and into the wine and Montana
territory
the United States government wanted to
renegotiate the deals that they had made
with the Lakota Sioux to be able to take
some of their land for gold mining and
prospectors and things like that and
before the deals were even negotiated
people were already starting to move
into the area to survey the land to
start trying to mine for gold and things
like that and Custer's job was mainly to
protect you know those people and also
to just you know basically just attack
you know any sort of Native Americans
that he came across that were not on
there their reservations so the sue
under Sitting Bull's she's sitting Bull
who was basically the the leader of the
Sioux and when I say Seward the Sioux
was the name for it was like Sioux
Nation which really you could see it was
this Hunkpapa it was their Northern
Cheyenne and the Arapaho and Lakota
right and they're all kind of combined
and working together against the United
States military because they were trying
to protect their way of life and they
were like in reservation Indians were
being put on reservations left and right
for literally a hundred years leading up
to that point there this was one of the
last remaining you know areas of land
and it was in a modern day you know
Montana or South Dakota account of the
United States so if you look at where it
is it's like pretty much it's still very
very rural
so all the way out here you know like
this tongue River here you can see
Northern Cheyenne are still there the
Indian Reservation they got put on and
everything here's the crow reservation
which was actually helping the United
States Army at the time but anyway
there's not a whole lot out there right
not not a whole lot and you end up but
you look at this was 1876 so in 1876
Custer goes and attacks a village that
was way too large to attack they were
literally outnumbered anywhere from
somewhere in the estimates are about ten
to one or twenty to one and it was just
completely it was it was unbelievable
and he just he marched headlong right in
there just like he had done for decades
before leading up to that and probably
thought he was in
vincible and everything it even took his
dispatch minh of about 700 soldiers and
broke them up into four different groups
and he had control of one group and and
then he attacked a village basically I
had roughly 265 people under his command
and every one of them was was wiped out
not one single person was able to live
to tell the tale
and not only were they killed they were
brutally killed like when when the sioux
indians when they when they killed you
if you were still alive year they were
going to scalp you while you were alive
they were going to you know shove things
down your throat cut your genitals off
like they did all kinds of extremely you
know gory things to people they always
mutilated the bodies afterwards because
they believed back when you came back in
the afterlife that you would come back
and you know in that physical form and
you know I don't know basically was the
best way to teach your lesson for for
messing with them but you know who were
the bad guys I'm not going to get into
who the bad guys and good guys weren't
all this stuff but I can tell you the
Indians were pretty much minding their
own business they had their own you know
the group of people and then the Calvary
attacked them but let me drive home the
point here and try to speed this along
some more take five minutes n that was
1876 and I'm fascinated with the stories
I'm not here to give you guys a huge
history lesson or anything like that but
you fast forward a hundred years from
well let's first talk about what
happened in 1876 when when Custer got
wiped out you know that was basically
the the beginning of the end for any
sort of Indians that were on the free
Plains and things like that they were
pretty much all forced on the
reservations after that
Custer was a national hero because of
the civil war stuff and it was a compute
complete shock to a pretty young nation
at the time when he got completely you
know annihilated you know killed along
with all his brothers and and all of his
command and everything else and people
were shocked so that was the same year
that Alexander Graham Bell first filed a
patent on the telephone it was also the
first year that to tell the typewriter
was invented so so daring so that's 1876
now if we fast forward a hundred years
and we look at like where technology is
now and what has been so from 1876 from
when this happened to but roughly 1976
you're looking at
the invention of all kinds of different
stuff you have like cars air
conditioning electricity being you know
main thing that people have in their
homes
obviously flight space travel integrated
circuits transistors Einstein's theory
of relativity I'm there's there's so
much stuff that happened right in that
hundred year span that it's absolutely
it's absolutely unbelievable and the
reason why I mentioned it's a well
because like back then Custer was
fighting on horses they enough tanks
they never roads aim and have horrible
railroads were starting to work their
way out west and everything but there
just wasn't a whole lot so like within a
hundred years we've seen a humongous
amount of effort and technological
advancements and I would say even if you
compare that hundred years to the
previous hundred years before that but
you know humans have been just
astronomically like headed towards to
say this this crazy technologically
advanced world it's kind of
mind-boggling if you really think about
it that's kind of what I'm trying to
convey in this video if you look in 1976
and in fact for like another 20 years
from there you're looking at what the
personal PC being like a mainstay like
an average thing in somebody's home in
the existence of the creation of Voyager
one that just recently left the solar
system and is now in interstellar space
was launched in 1970s you have the
landing on the moon and and you know
companies like Apple Microsoft Amazon
the internet was invented like the MRI
was created and used as a as a medical
advancement you have Nintendo Atari
PlayStation Li all these companies
coming out in that time frame where we
have and what we used to have arcades
and things like that we have these you
know these these handheld devices man
that are sitting in our house in the
television in fact I mean it's just it's
absolutely amazing like that's just 20
years after like 1976 and it's like and
then I was like well you know where we
been since like what 1996 like you know
what is like what advancement that we
had and I started thinking about I'm
like well you know now we like the iPod
was a pretty big thing you have
smartphones
quantum computing the creation of
Google's SpaceX Google is probably a
little bit before 1986 pistil Google
became a you know really popular saying
in the late 90s and early 2000s you know
Google changes the world I mean it gave
us all this stuff like all this relevant
information it's not like they created
the World Wide Web but they made it so
that we could actually sift through this
data much easier you look at things like
you know Tesla and SpaceX electronic
cars PayPal online e-commerce with like
eBay and Amazon and all that stuff we're
now we were able to confirm water on
Mars the Curiosity rover if you look at
the Curiosity rover this is just amazing
a we get these pictures in from this
this you know this rogue foreign
landscape on Mars man we've seen Martian
sunsets and things like that so we have
we have things what about you know Titan
we've confirmed hydrocarbons on Titan
the moon around Saturn which actually
has a very sick methane atmosphere and
everything I guess its nitrogen but yeah
they've liquid methane on their on their
surface and they have oceans and waves
and things like that and or you look at
the moons of Jupiter like Europa which
has actual ice and sea sea ice and
everything that is explode they are like
really giving off vapor plumes from the
ocean bottoms below there's just like it
all this stuff is being discovered just
really in like the last 20 years or so
Evan we also have a big data like
machine learning so you go Google
leading the way on that just you know
through the sheer volumes of data that
Google collects on our on our searching
behavior and things like that they are
able to to drill down on exactly what
we're looking for through basic trial
and error through just large amounts of
big data where it's much more reliable
to do it that way then you know using
something like IBM Watson that can
apparently predict the future but we
we all know is just complete garbage and
I say that because you know that
elevator commercial with IBM Watson is
like calling the elevator repairman
before it breaks and stuff like that
clearly you know Watson's not that good
and if it was and it would be competing
with Google but it's not because it's
not you know so but but now we have a
virtual reality and augmented reality
that's now starting to enter under our
lives now this is just 20 years after
you know the the previous 20 years I was
talking about so it's like we've made
some significant progress and like
sometimes people tell me like that our
that our advancements that we're making
now are not nearly as good as well what
we were making in the previous hundred
years and I actually think that that is
false like right now the biggest thing
that I wanted to talk about is that
they're doing gene editing and we're not
too far off from parents actually making
their children you know picking out
traits that are going to make them smart
or fast or skinny or prettier and that's
just going to be like a normal thing and
you're going to have the rich you know
richest members of society that are now
creating you know these what I would
call you know superhumans and it's not
like they're mutants like x-men they can
do superpowers but you're talking about
people that were bred to be smarter than
other people naturally are and the
reason why I don't have a problem with
it is because the United States is
already behind in technology when it
comes to gene editing like CRISPR gene
editing and things like that when you
compare it to other countries like like
China that have a different mentality on
you know the god and messing with nature
and things like that where China is
always like it seems like their entire
culture is like hey we don't care about
all that stuff we don't care about your
old scriptures and all that stuff we're
going to make ourselves a better like
happy or healthy or fast or whatever and
you look you compare that to a country
like the United States which is still
very very religious and compared to a
lot of European countries and things
like that where a lot of people believe
literally that the earth is 6,000 years
old or that you
that a lot of things they read about is
you know it's fact and things like that
I'm not even going to comment on whether
or not they should they shouldn't or
anything like that but there is
definitely a mindset that is different
just a cultural difference between
places like the United States and a
country like China so two superpowers
are going to have to go out in here as
far as trying to remain competitive and
I mean you can throw in other countries
as well but like if people have a
problem with gene editing and trying to
cure diseases by basically playing you
know quote unquote God or whatever then
they may be at risk of being left behind
because what if what if one country is
like you know what we're going to do
that and all of a sudden their people
have a higher IQ they're coming out with
better technologies they're coming up
with better solutions then then the
country that doesn't follow City we're
going to end up being left in the dust
is what I'm trying to say so it's not
even just the United States thing it
happened I picture you basically I have
two countries I mention the United
States and I can kind of speak to that
because I'm American citizen and then
you have a country like China which is
another superpower that is you know a
huge economy and things like that but
there is a definite different mindset
between what Americans find acceptable
you know typical Americans find
acceptable for you know that that type
of gene editing and research and
everything compared to a country like
China and that could end up being a
problem so where are we going to be 20
years from now like I honestly think
that this is going to be a big issue
it's going to be like you know a race to
like who is going to be who's going to
do artificial intelligence the best
who's going to do machine learning big
data the best and and who's going to be
editing their genes in order to make
themselves a better smarter faster human
because that could end up defining the
next 20 years it really could it could
end up defining the next hundred years
this could be the moment where it's like
hey what you know American citizens you
didn't want to play God and blah blah
blah and now we're going to miss out on
on you know an entire basically race of
people that that might always be one
step ahead of us now so is I guess the
fear of being left behind good enough to
kind of just
or go all the concerns that that people
may have about you know playing gods
quote-unquote and and that you know
there are some very valid points like
you start gene-editing people what if
you could reverse engineer that what if
there is like diseases that come along
and could wipe you out and we all have
this gene that was edited that is now
susceptible to some new disease that got
created or something like that there's
always you know risk and everything and
everything that we do but so it's not
like it's just a religious argument
against doing something like that but
there is I think at least a cause for
concern to be like hey we may not be
keeping up as well as we should in this
new field of research in that you know
it's something that we probably need to
take into consideration another thing
too that really concerns me if we're
talking about like you know future cells
and things like that it's just simply
the the over overcrowding of the earth
and the depletion of earth's resources
we have nearly 8 billion people on the
planet or 8 billion at this point and
you know at what point we're going to be
like hey everybody should just keep
procreating as fast and as much as they
want to before we start to worry about
hey there may not be enough jobs there
may not be enough opportunity there may
not be enough resources on earth we may
not I mean so there's there's some
serious serious concerns I think at this
point leading into where we're going
like even if you look at programmers
like nowadays everybody is like there's
there's commercials there's there's
videos there's people talking about hey
everybody should be a coder because if
everybody is a coder then like all of a
sudden the demand for coders is going to
go down it's going to keep prices down
and there's always going to be a need
for a coders but not everybody can be
coders not everybody can be a doctor not
everybody can be a lawyer then there has
to be a certain balance there but yeah
we'll see whether the next the next 20
years goes but I would say you know
obviously we're going to see a lot with
virtual reality augmented reality big
data machine learning artificial
intelligence also with a CRISPR gene
editing things like that hopefully we'll
see more of a space travel and things
like that as well but I haven't been not
holding my breath on that I mean as far
as I know there are no planned missions
to Mars or anything we're not
get any humans off of this planet
anytime soon and and that's to me that
that is one of the biggest causes for
concern because it's like I kind of view
life and everything on earth you know to
be possibly temporary like we don't know
how long we're going to be here we know
that dinosaurs existed on this planet on
multiple occasions that there were mass
extinctions on multiple occasions we
know that that there was a what a
Pangaea that the entire continents of
this planet
were all one and connected at one point
I mean that explains why they were there
were extinct plants that exists in South
America that also in matched extinct
plants that existed in Africa because at
one point those two continents were
actually one continent so clearly you
know major things happen on the earth
and things break apart things die off
you know we have volcanoes that could
wipe out the planet there's all kinds of
different things but so we need to be
getting off this bitch is what I'm
trying to say is like we need to be
trying to to colonize other planets and
things like that so we're not wiped out
at a moment's notice because of some
crate you know some some volcano or some
shift of the Earth's plates and things
like that you know you just you just
never know but anyway I've kind of I've
completely talked a lot ninety minutes
straight so I actually enjoy doing this
are they getting this out so let me know
if you guys appreciate this I'm sure
this isn't going to be what everybody's
cup of tea is but you know got to keep
things fresh and different
I suppose all right guys thanks for
