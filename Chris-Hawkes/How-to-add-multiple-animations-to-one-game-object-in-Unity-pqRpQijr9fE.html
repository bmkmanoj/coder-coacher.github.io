I want to show you guys how to use
multiple animations your character
object or whatever object is in question
that you have an animation attached to
you can only have one at a time but it
has multiple animations that you can
call inside here so there's two separate
animations that I have here I have him
moving his mouth and arms and I have him
talking so you can see if you need to
add an animation it actually you do that
through your animation tab so like
here's my first animation here's my
second one if you want to make a third
one you can do that here every animation
you you make though it will be
associated to your your actual game
object when you click on him you'll be
able to see your animations over here so
if I made a third animation it would be
element two because it starts counting
at zero so the thing is though in the
code-behind when you actually animate
the object or you start the animation
you can see if I look for the mouse down
button and then I'll say audio play and
then animation play and by default it's
going to play the first animation in
there so it's gonna be this moving mouth
and arms and I'll show you that so when
I run this he moves his mouth he's
supposed to move his mouth and arms it's
actually incorrect name but anyway that
should just be called moving arms
because that's all he does so now if I
wanted to distinguish to move to
actually call this square which is potty
mouth bill talking I would actually just
pass that in as a string argument to
animation dot play so let's say potty
mouth bill talking if I save that I run
it unity now
you can see that it actually does the
second animation alright guys and that's
how you do it
peace
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
