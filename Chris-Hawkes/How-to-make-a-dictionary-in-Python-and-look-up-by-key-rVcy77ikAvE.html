talking about dictionaries dictionaries
are common thing in Python they're also
known as associative arrays and
languages like Perl and JavaScript but
essentially it's a dictionary meaning
that there's a key and there's a value
so your key is your lookup and your look
up provides your value and in Python
we're going to use the curly braces for
that so we'll say my dick
it just sounds messed up but anyway
we're gonna then give it a key which is
my key one I'm gonna keep discount under
not gonna use capitals cuz it is case
sensitive and then use a colon to
separate the key from the value and this
will be my value actually let me get a
little bit more specific key one value
and then to add multiple dictionary
items you just separated by a comma so
now we're on to a new key which is my
key to and then key to value
and obviously it would help if I have an
equal sign here since I am creating a
new dictionary all right so now if we
want to find an element in the
dictionary by a key lookup so we could
say X equals and we'll say my indict and
then we use square brackets to look up
the key so we'll say my key 1 and then
we can print X and let's see what the
result is here and you can see that it
got key 1 value
so X is using a dictionary lookup by key
to get to value and now we can also add
values to an already established
dictionary so I mean when we're creating
the dictionary you can create all the
values in here like this initially but
if you're like oh I need that to now add
another value to that dictionary you can
do it very easily all you have to do is
just say my dick and then give it the
key name so we'll say my key 3 and then
just close off the square bracket and
then in the equal sign we give it two
value so we'll say key 3 and value and
now we can say the same thing X equals
my dick pull up let's just sounds so
messed up anyway my key 3 and then we
can say print X
and you can see that this value is now
inside of the dictionary because we
added it here alright guys so that's how
you create a dictionary and that's how
you add a value to an already
established dictionary it's also how you
look up values by key within a
dictionary alright thanks for watching
