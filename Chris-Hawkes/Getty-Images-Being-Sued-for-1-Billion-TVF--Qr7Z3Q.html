the United States
who is a renowned photographer she's
actually taken photographs for decades
all through the 20th century and all 50
states in the United States including
some pretty iconic images and back I'm
not sure the exact date in fact I'm
reading off an article doesn't actually
say the exact date but she had something
about almost 19,000 images and like I
said some of these were very iconic
images that we've seen in different
magazines and everything and she donated
it to the Library of Congress now if you
donate images to the Library of Congress
that stuff goes under a public domain so
the Library of Congress had stated when
she donated the 19,000 photos that this
was one of the most what was basically
the nicest act that they had ever seen
because apparently these photos were
worth quite a bit of money being taken
you know through so many you know trying
periods of you know the United States
history so she ends up giving these
photos to the Library of Congress
they're released under public domain at
least that's what the Library of
Congress States so public domain means
that anybody can use the images I'm not
a copyright expert but what I do know is
that eventually artwork and put
photographs and things like that
eventually their copyright laws expire
after some sort of a period of time and
they go into the public domain and
anybody's free to use them and a lot of
like government for photographs and
things like that are all public domain
that are free for you to use but what
the photo company getting images did and
getting images guys is like they own I
stock photography I believe they own a
lot of other different things I know
that they have you know they're just a
humongous corporation in their own right
but one of the reasons why getting
images get such a bad rap is when I was
first getting in the web type
development back in like oh 9 and 10 and
11 back in those days Getty Images was
working with a lot of copyright trolls
or patent trolls and um what these guys
do is they go around and they look for
any way they might have a patent on
something or they look for
I mean it might work operate on
something and then they just bully
people into paying thousands of dollars
for improperly using photos now if we
fast-forward to today we know that
there's rampant photo copyright
violation that goes on every single day
you see Hollywood movies with quotes
posted overtop of that murder you know
it's not exactly fair use your cover is
a very difficult thing but we'll talk
about fair use in a second but you
obviously see it every day on Facebook
people are posting and sharing stuff
that they don't actually own the
copyright to Pinterest is another site
where people are going in and they're
pinning photos that they don't own and
they're pointing links back to their own
site so in many cases they're actually
making money off of somebody else's
copyright and they do it on such a large
scale that nobody can even possibly you
know stop it really and if you look at
it sites like even like like the Pirate
Bay or kick-ass horns and stuff like
that you look at all the different
countries like the UK in the United
States with all the billions of dollars
that gets poured into trying to stop
these companies they still can't do it
but what copyright trolls were doing is
they had like like this one prenda law
firm I think it's called prenda law you
can look them up but these people were
bullying young and not really young but
just fledgling startups or single
bloggers operations you know finding a
photo violation and like demanding 2002
between 2 and 10 thousand dollars for
the photo or they would be sued and then
they were actually suing people on
taking the court and we've seen the same
thing with the Recording Industry
Association of America which owns a lot
of the the rights distribution for a lot
of musical artists and you know the MPAA
which is a music picture of the American
Association of America is only that but
a lot of times they were also doing the
same thing that we're filing lawsuits
against people that were committing
copyright as an example so Getty Images
was working with some of these copyright
rules to do the same thing took this
lady's photos from the public domain
which should we're free to use and then
they license them so basically they
started selling these free to use videos
on their website and then sending out
copyright notices demanding
payment for illegal use of their photos
even though they got the photos for free
from the public domain from the Library
of Congress Congress I was donated by
this lady and by the way let me get her
name her name is Carol Highsmith so she
donates this stuff now this lady she
ends up getting a notice from Getty
Images she's 70 years old now and she
ends up she actually got a notice from
getting images themselves demanding
payment for the illegal use of a photo
that she owned and gave rights to the
Library of Congress which went into the
public domain and now she's actually I
guess because it really rubbed her the
wrong way the fact that I never won she
found out that Getty Images was taking
her photos and selling them and making
quite a bit of money off of the
thousands of photos that she released to
the public domain and then and then to
find I guess as icing on the cake that
they could try to come to her and demand
payment for for the photo so it just
makes Getty Images looks look terrible
but for somebody like me I remember
Getty Images beating up on people back
you know several years ago so I don't
feel sorry for them at all in fact I
secretly I'm kind of glad that this is
happening to them because it just seems
like it should because what this lady
ended up doing she filed a lawsuit on
July 25th so just three days ago for
over or actually for one billion dollars
so she's now trying to go after Getty
Images and a lot of people are saying
that she might be able to collecting a
good portion of this money I think the
actual of statutory limits or something
like that on the amount that she's able
to collect is like somewhere over five
hundred million but still some people
are saying that there could be a new
precedent set in this case Getty Images
has billions of dollars and or at least
some multi-billion dollar company I know
that but I guess this is a case guys of
what goes around comes around
when you when you basically if you if
you act like that even if you act like a
jerk you know what I mean eventually
it's gonna catch up to you and for the
most part with what Getty Images was
doing a while ago I when I say
I mean several years ago you know they
had something like this coming to them
and does it doesn't really surprise you
that somebody would go out and hire the
services of copyright trolls and then do
you know a stunt like this so I think it
just kind of speaks volumes about you
know you know being being ethical number
one and you know companies can't operate
unethically because eventually it will
catch up to you and in it so the real
question is gonna be though is whether
or not the Getty Images has a defense
like there's nothing stopping them from
taking public domain photos and
reselling them in fact you could do the
same thing so the photos that they were
reselling technically you could do the
same thing according to what Gettys
defense is gonna be so if Gideon's up
you know being proven you know not
guilty in this case and then it's just
fine that anybody can do it including
you so I find that I find that really
interesting but what her argument is is
that look I gave the photos to the
Library of Congress as public domain it
was never meant I didn't give this this
you know this fair use for this this
permission to my copyright to anybody
else but to the Library of Congress so I
think their question is really gonna
boil down to is it going to be a dispute
between the Library of Congress or is it
really a truly a dispute between this
lady and Getty Images for taking her
images but either way it's a pretty
crappy move like I said just simply
taking something that is free to use for
anybody and then charging thousands of
dollars and then on top of that to
actually send a notice to the copyright
owner just shows you how cool is you
know you know companies can be sometimes
alright guys thanks for watching have a
good day bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
