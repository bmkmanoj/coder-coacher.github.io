so now that we have our project set up
let's go back to our directory here and
we're inside about my project file and
what we want to do is go ahead and start
our server and to do that we just go
python manage py and then we'll say it's
actually run server
all right so once it runs you're gonna
see something similar to this before
this last line here once you visit the
web page you'll actually be able to see
that a connection was made so it was a
get request so that's what it's showing
you there because I went ahead and
pulled that up on a browser to show you
guys so anyway um you should have a just
a message that it is running and when
you go visit that in a web page you'll
be able to see that our first
application worked so we actually have
Django up and running which is pretty
awesome all right so now now that we
have done that let's go ahead and get
into the next step all right in order
for us to be able to actually configure
a database to our s settings file within
our project I'm gonna use my sequel it's
one of the more common database
databases out there so I recommend you
use my sleep well if you use a different
database it's gonna be a slightly
different configuration and the settings
file but once you have your database
install them it should be relatively
similar to what we're gonna do here what
I did is I actually downloaded a I
downloaded a my sequel MSI which
actually installed the my sequel server
for me since I'm using Windows and
that's really where I left off here I'm
gonna go ahead and provide the link to
what I installed on my machine here for
my my sequel and that way you guys can
download that and go ahead and install
my sequel on your local computer and
then in this next video we'll be able to
connect to it once you have that
installed and part of the my sequel
installation just follow the MSI and
I'll show you here I'm going to show you
so I have
all right so it's actually this my
sequel community installer thing but
you're just gonna double-click on that
once you download it and go ahead and
just install the community server
version and that should be really all
you need if you have Python 2.7 like I
do there'll be an option to have like a
Python script installer thing that you
can add on to it if you want you don't
have to have that if you don't want to
and once you install it it does allow
you or it does ask you to make a root
user so I just I have my root user your
root is called root so that is your root
user and then you just have to give it a
password so give it whatever password
you want but remember to write that down
or to just not forget it so set up your
root user it's all part of the
installation that will be that will be
that you'll be guided through in the
installation process so anyway in the
next video we're gonna go ahead and
configure that my sequel installation
that you're gonna set up now to our
Django project thank you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
