sequel set up out of the way which was
one of the more difficult things we have
to do we want to go to enable our admin
for our Django application here so let's
go down to our settings file and inside
here we want to uncomment this Django
admin alright so we added that to our
installed apps then we want to go ahead
and move over to our URLs file and we
have to uncomment a couple of lines
there as well if we go to our URLs
and here it tells you that you want to
go ahead and uncomment these two lines
to have your URLs working for your
Django admin and let's go to uncomment
this we don't really care about the
advent documentation but this should
work so now let's go ahead and go back
to our command line and where we're in
sync TV before we want to go ahead and
say Python manage py and will say the
sink in DV
and now you can see that it's actually
creating some more tables it's creating
a table because we installed the Django
admin or we added it to our installed
app so it went through and it created
the database tables and things that it
needs for Django admin so let's go to
our website here and we'll see if the
admin is working without having to
restart our server and you can actually
see that it is working so I'm going to
do something here we're going to do what
is our username our username is admin I
was like testing 123 and there you are
so we are now logged into our backend of
our new website that we just created so
all this stuff is synced with my sequel
inside here your users this is where you
can set permissions for certain users on
your website to be able to perform
certain actions and in this case we have
one user and he's a super user ease of
staff so admin is that person now now
that we have that working in the next
video i want to show you how we're going
to create our first application our
first module and we're going to go ahead
and use something similar to what they
have in it the Django tutorials kind of
walk through that and build that pole
app alright so I'm going to keep this
one short and sweet just simply how you
activate your admin thank you for
watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
