we looked at how we can loop over lists
and things like that but what if we
wanted to just loop over a certain
amount of the elements inside of a list
and and before we saw that well if we
have some sort of matching condition we
can break out of a list and all that
stuff but what if we had ten items in a
list and we only want to do it rate
through the first five the best way to
do that is to use something called the
range operator in Python you actually
see this quite a bit as well so we're
going to say my list and this is just
going to be a bunch of numbers equals
one two three four five six seven eight
nine and ten all right so we have ten
items in this list for all numbers and
we're going to say for X and once again
this could be your temporary variable it
can be any name you want it can be
called your mom it could be anything
and we could say range and then we're
going to say 1 through 5 now the
interesting thing I want to point out
though is that one it actually starts at
the first element so it'll print the
first element but when you say 5 it
actually stops at the 5 and it doesn't
show the 5 so it's only going to go to 4
so this is something that I just want to
show you guys because it is kind of
confusing I think so if we were to say
print X we're actually going to get 1
through 4 so if we wanted to get the
fifth one we actually need to say you
don't stop at 6 because it's not going
to print 6 it's going to print the one
before 6 which is weird because when you
say 1 it doesn't start at 2 it actually
starts at the first element but this is
a relatively short video but I did want
to explain the range function in Python
because you do see this quite a bit one
other thing I wanted to mention is that
in older versions of Python before
Python 3 the the range was actually
called X range so if you ever see X
range it's actually the same thing as
range but Python 3 changes its name over
- just just simply range not X range I'm
not sure the the reasoning behind that
but that will throw you through a loop
as well if you're looking at any sort of
older Python code and github alright
guys so that is the range operator in
Python and thank you for watching and
please subscribe please share this with
your family or not take care guys bye
hey guys so a lot of you asked me how do
I get my foot in the door to be
programmer and I just want to take a
moment to mention dev Mountain coding
bootcamp is a 12-week intensive course
that focuses on the technologies of the
here-and-now for web development some of
the things that they're actually
teaching in this 12-week course it's
geared to get you into the industry by
focusing on things like jQuery nodejs
react angular how to use github so a lot
of the things that you're going to need
to do as a developer as soon as you
start they're going to be teaching you
in this and this coding bootcamp and the
entire goal is to be able to get you
into the industry within 12 weeks so if
you guys are interested in learning more
information about dev Mountain coding
bootcamp just check out the link in the
description cab of this video thank you
for watching and have a good day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
