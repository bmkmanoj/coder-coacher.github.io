second video of the beginning or getting
started with react and in the last video
we wouldn't installed all the
dependencies that we needed for react to
be installed but now we need to go ahead
and setup webpack so that it works so
what we need to do is create a new file
that we're gonna call the web pack
config dot J's file so this is just a
JavaScript file and I need you to just
take in this and and and copy this so if
you pause this video and just copy this
word-for-word this needs to be here
because what we're doing is we're
telling web pack how to use babel to
compile j and j sx code interna to
regular JavaScript using reacts library
so it needs to have all of this stuff
here otherwise it's not going to work so
after you pause then I'm assuming
everything's fine you'll notice here
that it's referencing a Jas folder so
let's go ahead and create our new folder
now that all of our JavaScript is going
to be put into inside this J's folder
there's going to be an app dot JS file
and if you'll notice and the web pack
config we look at this you can see this
JSF GS so this is going to essentially
be our starting point so here let's go
ahead and add a variable X equals we'll
just do an array so cat dog donkey all
right so here's those are the three
things and now let's go look at the okay
so now we have the app J has defined and
what those gonna do it's gonna take
everything in objects and it's going to
bundle it all into one bundle JS file
that we're putting right here it's gonna
put it inside the root directory all
right so that's good now in order for
this to actually be able to work since
we did not install anything globally you
can see it's all just local dependencies
in order for this to run we need to
actually edit the package.json file to
run our babel and web pack commands from
this scripts subcategory here so let's
go to add that now so we're just going
to simply say
Abell and then we're gonna give it the
babel keyword and then we're gonna have
another one for webpack and then we're
gonna say webpack all right so now we
have all that stuff set up so if we go
to our command line we can now say npm
and we're gonna say run and then we give
it the actual script name that we wanted
to run so we want to run web pack since
web pack is going to compile our our app
jeaious file and it's gonna create a
bundle file if everything goes well so
now you can see with web pack is
actually running through NPM so now you
can have this isolated dependency
environment which is really helpful to
use because you may have if you'll
notice on this particular project since
we're not referencing any sort of global
package like look at this react DOM is
15.2 but what happens if you had one
directory that all projects shared for
react Dom and react Tom updates on one
particular project and then completely
screws up five or six other projects
that's when you run into a dependency
nightmare so I don't like to deal with
dependency nightmares I like things to
be isolated if I come from the Python
virtual environment type of a setup
where I like to have things nice and
concise and not conflicting with one
another so by doing things this way I
really feel like it doesn't it doesn't
conflict with anything now one thing
you're going to notice here is that and
this did work and it admitted that
bundle jeaious file but one thing that's
going to be interesting here is that it
didn't exit out of the program the
reason why is because if you would have
copied the webpack config like I told
you to you can see it says watch equals
true and what we want this to do because
we want to just run this watch command
one time and that way any changes we
make to apt ijs it's going to recompile
and you can see a bundle just got put
here but if we went ahead and we made a
change and we say you know what I'm
gonna make it
cat Johnson and let's watch what happens
if I hit save anyway you can see just
take a moment and look at this there's
only one change here so when I click
Save the watch directory notice it
picked up the save and now there's
another emitted version so now we have
webpack working to our advantage
alright guys so now we have a golden
setup a setup that will make you rich
and get you to fulfill any sort of
dreams that you ever want to fulfill in
programming in the next video that we're
gonna get into actually writing some
react code and watching it all work
through bundling and babel and all that
other good stuff so thanks guys for
watching make sure you subscribe to this
channel for more stuff like this and I
appreciate it and take care</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
