snapchat yeah excited yeah I'm excited
so we're also recording this right now
I'm so hot so this is my snapchat thing
now what is this thing do though what is
it called again
yeah Oh your snap code I snap code so
that's like a bar code okay that's cool
all right
also I'm on Instagram now Isabelle help
me instead of the official hipster coat
Instagram site and based I was making a
ton of noise behind Instagram apparently
you cannot share links Oh Vance I'm a
little bummed by that so I'm trying to
figure out like why is Instagram works
so much money if you can't like promote
your products and stuff on it I don't
understand how do you do that
if you can't link to the product how do
you how do you like promote it you're
just like supposed to be and here's a
picture Matt find me on the internet put
Thank You with Trillium website put in
your bio link in your bio okay I hope
the links on my bio go check out my bio
but I have like thousands of links or at
least hundreds of links for a hipster
coat so what if I had more than one all
right so then I'm also um like snapchat
apparently that you can't go as a
website I'm on can I get back in I feel
like an old man was not shot I really do
this is crazy
all right so here's that's it is it
mitten into play yeah all right so maybe
they can tell me how I'm supposed to use
that chat to to actually like promote my
stone such an awful picture I'm not sure
what we're done that decides making a
ton of notice how do I fold my filters
again
why are you so constrained mm
ridiculously awesome
that's fine all right so there's our
picture I'm a little bummed that with
snapchat we uh I also don't know how
we're supposed to use this to promote
but what is my snapchat handle I am that
knee hipster code on snapchat so if you
guys are on snapchat please find me
there I'll be posting stuff probably
like throughout the day I might even
just take random pictures of a downtown
Richmond or doing whatever I'm doing
during the day also I guess same with
Instagram or you're going to anyone that
but I'm not sure what I'm doing with
Instagram but both of the links guys are
in the description tab below so if you
guys would check that out as well I have
appreciated it so one of the things that
I don't understand with a website like
snapchat is I think that it's great that
like snapchat is trying to address this
whole augmented reality market where you
know it does like really cool stuff with
your phone like you know it can index
facial recognition all kinds of really
nice stuff and like the other day I was
watching a video on Facebook's Facebook
they have a new app that they were
actually working on a lot of people's
face like a complete ripoff of like
snapchat and that they're trying to go
out to the snapchat market but like
here's a TechCrunch article where
they're talking about this augmented
reality camera effects developer
platform so if I saw Zuckerberg actually
doing a demonstration but basically it's
just like snapchat in the sense that you
can take pictures and then like there
was some really cool stuff that he was
doing like he was taking a room and
filling it up with like skittles and
water and things and it was very aware
of you know there's a very some very
sophisticated AI with you know the the
photo recognition somebody does I think
that's that's pretty cool although it is
kind of like like I said a knock against
snapchat now the thing that is very
interesting with snapchat is like from a
business perspective I find it to be
less useful than something like Twitter
at least with Twitter like you have the
ability to you know go out there and
like you know promote your stuff hey
check out this video in like hey here's
a link to my website or here's this
product you're like you know you can
tweet to like one of the best ways if
you run into like a company that is
their services down or something like
that if you end up tweeting out to the
company I've actually gotten pretty
quick response back when I what I've
done that sort of thing and like Twitter
provides that value so there's real
business value there's really user value
however it's never made a diamond profit
so after all these years all this
popularity it's never made any money
meanwhile snapchat is just recently a
publicly traded company on the on the
stock exchange and I wonder how it's
doing lately oh it's oh here we go
so it's really only been out for one
year so so went public went public on
March 3rd so with that this year but
anyway you can see it opened up with a
high of $27.90 of shares on a 26 billion
market cap at that value there that you
know that would have been almost double
and that's going double but anyway quite
a bit more than what his market cap is
right now but you can see snapchat is
valued at twenty six billion dollars
right now so snapchat its entire thing
is like you only use it on your cell
phones and then there's no way to like
post links and things like that it's all
very personal it's not really about
businesses and then promotion and things
like that and it's probably arguably one
of the reasons why it's as popular as it
is because it's cool it's not some it's
not some business thing it doesn't
delude the product with financial needs
that every business has but the problem
though is that if you have a snapchat
product and you compare it to something
like Twitter that does provide a
business needed it is useful to users
and is you know pretty popular even now
and it doesn't make any money so how
it's not trying to make any money I
don't understand that so that's the
craziness of this world that we live in
right now with technology where like you
have a company here that snaps have lost
514 million dollars in 2016 and it warns
that it may never be profitable so how
do you lose you know 500 million dollars
in one year tell everybody you're not
going to be profitable and then still
have your stock trade at you know
four billion dollars like people have
lost their mind like they really have
and that's actually one of the reasons
why people have a lot of like analysts
and things like that it's felt that
we've been in like a tech bubble for
quite some time
Millennials these days will buy anything
they really will and it's part of the
reason why I like and just the crazy
world that we kind of live in is the
reason why I like I when I was trying to
find a domain name for my website I
wasn't exactly happy with hipster code
somewhat derogatory to the hipsters out
there I'm sure some people would
consider me a hipster I don't know about
that but it's just like and I use the
term loosely man like if you're like a
yuppie wearing you know spandex bike
shorts you know going in in some public
park and doing push-ups like I call you
a hipster I mean you're probably more of
just a freak but no I'm just kidding but
the hipsters man like they're everywhere
especially the tech market that's kind
of why I built this entire hipster cold
web site called it what it was it's a
programming would say it has programming
news by programmers I have programmers
are right for me I write for it
occasionally I want to do it more but I
do the tutorials on it right it's all
about coding it's programming and that's
why I call it hipster code but people
have lost their mind like they really
have so if it's like hipster code is at
least profitable for me it doesn't make
a whole lot of money like when I'm
writing news articles most of the money
bag that gets earned on this website if
not well yeah like probably 80% of all
the money is you know based on people
clicking ads and things like that which
they rarely do these days so that's it
that's a tough industry to be in but at
least in a sense that like what does
website cost me besides they're the
writers that there is a loss I'm taking
in some sense yeah like overall okay
this website is losing money because I
do have writers but if I didn't then it
would be profitable at least because I
built the whole thing myself I don't
have network administrators and database
administrators and everything working
for me I don't have more marketing
department or anything like that so you
can bootstrap I think your own success
story not saying that you know this one
is like a real success story or anything
but for me I'm you know I'm proud of
that I'm proud of the fact that you know
I get several thousand people a week at
this point I go to this site I get four
hundred fifty thousand people that have
found me on the inner
and everything so you note in that sense
that I do think it's a success story
Anna and I'm gonna continue to push it
so make sure you guys are going to
history go check it out my site but once
again I don't know going back to the
topic of like snapchat and from a
business as like I don't understand some
of these projects and I think that it's
kind of a dangerous like precedent that
we're setting because eventually as a
rogue that's going to get pulled out for
mostly there's going to be a market
correction you know there already been
downturns in Silicon Valley and things
like that but if we keep having
companies that will never earn a profit
and be valued at twenty five billion
dollars I just don't understand how that
works man like that it just defies all
principles of a business you know going
back to the earliest days of humanity so
alright guys this video is sponsored by
two sponsors this month and they help
pay the bills once again in fact they
really they are the main reasons why I
can afford to pay writers anyway but dem
Mountain coding boot camp is my
sponsored I've had for quite some time
now they have twelve and sixteen week
courses or in person to developer boot
camp they're owned by a multi-million
dollar company they have an intention to
try to get people in the door with
technologies that are used like right
here and now a lot of web technology
like react angular nodejs they're going
to teach how to use git as a version
control system they're to be working
with other developers and definitely
check those guys out I appreciate it the
web's web not a website but the video is
also sponsored by Etta wanax
learning solutions and if you go to
Edwin X TV that is their website where
you can get all kinds of information on
all kinds of different coding projects
here you have like Chango Ruby on Rails
then they do a lot of things with view
cloud architecture and things like that
so all kinds of information you guys can
check out it I don't want to stop TV
which is ed o onyx and learning services
they also have a YouTube channel so if
you guys want to check that out that is
idiotic Learning Solutions YouTube
channel
