second video of the green sock tutorial
series and in the first video what we
did is we moved the image from left to
right for the hipster code comm website
and we gave it a duration that are
basically a speed of how fast that that
animation should move from the left to
the right we also told it how far to go
to the right in this video what I want
to show you is that you can add in more
arguments to the third into the third
argument to the group Z tween light dot
two method that we use to move this
image over the remember the first
argument was the actual element that we
want to move the second object was the
speed at which we want to move it and
then the third object was a JavaScript
object that has key value pairs that end
up you know that indicate to this green
sock library of you know what to do and
in our case of this example we simply
just said X and then we gave it a value
of a hundred so we said move it a
hundred pixels to the right and you can
see that that is done right here so
there's more that you can pass in here
though there's also a y coordinate so I
could say a hundred so as we're moving
it to the right also move it down a
hundred pixels as well so let's see what
this result is and now you can see it's
moving to the right and down at the same
exact angle so pretty much it's at a
perfectly diagonal axis another argument
that is really cool that we can pass in
as an actual rotation so we can tell it
to rotate a hundred and eighty degrees
so now the 180 degrees that literally
flips upside down
we can also tell it to essentially go
invisible by lowering its alpha so we
can say alpha and we pass in point two
and you can see it slowly fades out from
its normal alpha range all the way down
to two point two so I can even tell it
to go fully zero and it completely fades
out almost like the jQuery hide so I'm
going to remove the Alpha tag but I want
to show you that you can also make the
image bigger so if we set height 500 and
we could say width 1000 and now is it
not only flipping the damn things
getting huge so that is so awesome all
right guys so in this video we saw that
the third argument that gets passed into
the tween light dot 2 function is a
JavaScript object that has all kinds of
key value possibilities of being able to
rotate the image to change its alpha
essentially make it invisible to
changing its height to its width to its
rotation so we saw that we can do all
kinds of cool stuff with our animations
with our simple images in JavaScript
just using this library so it saves us
so much time rather than having to try
to do something like that with just raw
JavaScript or with with the jQuery
library so hopefully guys like this
video you like the series please rate up
please comment if you have any questions
and please subscribe to the channel also
for more tutorials you can visit hipster
code calm and there's all kinds of
tutorials similar to this for all kinds
of different emerging technologies and
the IT world thanks for watching and
have a good day bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
