we're gonna be looking at template
literals which is another new thing
within es6 and it really gives us the
ability to more easily make multi-line
string so if I wanted to say you know
I'm going to create a long string
argument is just gonna be something
maybe it's an HTML page so what I can do
instead of having to do this old way
where I'm like typing like this and then
I had more characters like that and
things like that and to be able to
create a nick or string and obviously I
would go to assign it you could have a
long string that way but that's like the
hard way you have to concatenate if you
wanted to do a multi-line string you
could actually do the new back tic
feature which is this I could say this
is a long string this is more long
string interesting so you can see that
you have a big huge string it just it
makes a little bit cleaner so that way
you can have your your standard
formatting and it works just like a
regular string that we currently have
alright so if I go and take a look at
this and you can see it just outputs the
string I just like we normally would now
one of the cool parts about this is that
we can actually include actual variables
from within the string which is
something that I would say it's simply
it's relatively new for sure
so you include a variable within this
new backtick feature and our template
literals we can just define like okay
let's say a band and we're gonna say
it's Bayside so that's our band name and
if I wanted to put it in here or
anywhere really I could just simply
simply say dollar sign and then inside
curly braces we actually reference band
and you gave an you know do something
like band name equals like that now if
we run this you can see it actually
included it right into our strength so
they call it you know template because
you could actually build you know
effectively you don't even need template
engines anymore because JavaScript is
almost including the template engine
type syntax that we need
just built into this new new template
literal es6 standard now this there's
also greater flexibility to be able to
build certain things like you can even
have a function will save our long
string function I will just say the
passes in an argument
in fact we won't even do it this way
we're going to do it as the era of
syntax
and that way we're sticking more to the
es6 standard so here's the arrow
function and what we want to be able to
do is we want to be able to call this
and be able to pass in so we're going to
console.log long string function and
then we're gonna pass in the name band
and you can do that and we could also
say you know they've been around for
let's just say what 10 years maybe
something like that so we'll have we'll
have the first argument band name and
then a round since those are two
variables and now I'm using the back
kick character I can just say return
this backtick string and we say
and name is a rock and has been around
since and here we're gonna do something
a little bit we'll just say a round
since and then we'll just say you know
what we're gonna add 5 to it so we're
doing an actual mathematical calculation
from within here so let's just say you
know they've been around 15 years so I'm
just gonna put 10 this is obviously not
really the way you would want to create
a function because it makes it very
confusing but my whole point is that you
can do more than just referencing
variable names you can actually do
computations and evaluate JavaScript
expressions from with inside these you
know these curly braces
so based on is a rock band that has been
around since 15 obviously you would say
some way which I think they have been
around for 15 years but this is actually
a very cool thing like I said it's much
easier these days if you wanted to
create like a new mustache type of
templating engine you could literally
use JavaScript's beta built-in es6
standards and probably create a few
functions that make some of this stuff a
little bit easier to do but this is
definitely a very cool feature of es6
alright guys thanks for watching make
sure you subscribe vote up and stay
tuned for more videos bye hey guys so a
lot of you asked me how do I get my foot
in the door to become a programmer and I
just want to take a moment to mention
dev Mountain coding boot camp is a
12-week intensive course that focuses on
the technologies of the here-and-now for
web development some of the things that
they're actually teaching in this what
we course it's geared to get you into
the industry by focusing on things like
jQuery nodejs
react angular how to use github so a lot
of the things that you're gonna need to
do as a developer as soon as you start
they're going to be teaching you in this
and this coding bootcamp and the entire
goal is to be able to get you into the
industry within 12 weeks so if you guys
are interested in learning more
information about dev Mountain coding
bootcamp just check out the link in the
description tab of this video thank you
for watching and have a good day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
