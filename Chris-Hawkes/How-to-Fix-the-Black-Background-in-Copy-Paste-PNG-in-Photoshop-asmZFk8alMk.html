annoying feature or a problem really
between Photoshop and Chrome which is
really seems to have occurred just
recently as far as I'm aware but let me
show you the situation here so if you
have like a transparent image so any
sort of PNG image is gonna have a
transparent background so I went ahead
and copy this image and then I try to
put it in Photoshop so I can just
control V and paste there you get this
black background and that really sucks
there's really only two ways that I know
of that that can resolve this relatively
quickly one is that you could actually
right-click save as and then open it up
in Photoshop which could allow it to
view it as a transparent and not have
that ugly background what I find a
little bit easier like if I just go to
the the web address so I've been linked
in a new window that'll be fine
Windows has the snipping tool so you
could actually take like the snip if I
just wanted to copy it I could just
simply copy that or even if I just
actually view the image itself it's the
same thing
and I could just copy it and then paste
it into Photoshop that way and it
doesn't have that ugly background so I
know it's annoying unfortunately as far
as I know there's no other way around it
it's a bug probably with Photoshop and I
know that it's effective for Photoshop
cs6 and I believe also the Creative
Cloud version so it might save you some
time if you're on Windows and you have
the snipping tool to just snip it
instead of having the save files and all
that crap alright guys thanks for
watching have a good day bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
