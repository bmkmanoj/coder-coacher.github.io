going to be talking about webpack react
and babel it's so complicated I
understand to keep up with the latest
JavaScript standards they change all the
time they change sometimes it feels like
hourly however as of the time of this
video so currently June 2016 the most
up-to-date standard in order to write
complex modern-day JavaScript is to use
Babel which is going to compile your
JavaScript using the latest standards to
work with older browsers so without
Babel you could use the latest standards
but it wouldn't work in most browsers so
you need be able to compile that code
down to what code that works for you or
you could go through the hard work of
doing all the work that Babel does for
you but that would be that would not
make any sense
the second thing is that web pack is now
the normal modern day bundler so like
you set up a configuration file with web
pack and it actually handles all of the
compilation of taking all the different
imports and files that your package
needs making sure the dependencies are
met with the old days of JavaScript on
what you would typically do like in this
particular page here is that I would you
would have to add script tags right so
you add script tags to the bottom of
your file and one script tag has to be
on top of another so it loads first
before it gets reference otherwise you
have those reference errors so that way
sucks of doing things right it's much
better if you can just say you know I
need this file make sure it's available
what web pack does that hard work for
you in addition to that you also have
react right so react uses something
called JSX JSX is similar to javascript
but it's actually a subset it's very
similar to something like CoffeeScript
or typescript you write in a certain
type of format but then that code has to
be compiled on the regular JavaScript in
order to be able to work with react in
this tutorial I'm going to show you how
to set up all three of those to work
fluently with each other and it's really
not as bad actually no it's a pain in
the ass to figure out on your own but if
you just watch this tutorial maybe
subscribe to this channel it'll save you
a lot of time so first things first
let's go into this static folder this
static folder is where I'm actually
holding my static files for the
application this is where I want to have
all my baby basically my
Babel code and everything else that is
going to exist here one of the things
you need to do is you need to have no
js' installed on your machine because no
js' allows you to use npm so if you've
never heard of npm it's a package
manager it's been around for a long time
but node it supplies it with with it's
installed so that way when you write NPM
it's going to know what you're talking
about so I could say NPM I knit I knit
is a command that's going to build a
JSON file JSON is JavaScript object
notation and it's basically like XML but
it's JavaScript subversion of being able
to define data in a predictable way and
it really just is a JavaScript object
using key value pairs so in this case um
the I knit when I ran I knit command
it's going to ask me a few things asked
me for the name of my project so I'll
just call it hipster I'll give it a
version hipster I'll say hipster code
library it is for hipster code for my
website entry boy doesn't really matter
just plate it I'll put my name on here
but for all this other stuff just you
know just hit enter to just accept it
okay so now that it's done that if we
look inside of our file I have this
package JSON file that was created for
me along with the information that was
put in there all right the next thing we
need to do in order to get Babel
installed along with all the latest
Babel crap you need to go ahead and go
to the command line and we're going to
run npm install babel loader Babel core
Babel preset es2015
yes 2015 guys is JavaScript 6.0 so
javascript 6.0 was the name that they
had originally gone with but now they're
calling it at my script 2015 or
javascript 2015 but either way it's the
latest standard javascript that doesn't
work in your browser except for maybe
Chrome and then there's this Babel
preset react and then save dev so I want
it to do save dev is actually going to
save all of these projects within my
config so when when this installs you're
going to see that by using saved dev as
opposed to just save or as opposed to
installing things globally it
it is willing to put it in one specific
specific section of the config file the
reason why you don't want to install
things globally especially things like
web pack or Babel is that you may update
those projects and they may break other
dependencies like you might have plugins
that rely on a specific version of Babel
or a specific version of web pack or
whatever maybe you don't want it you
don't want to mix all that junk up with
your other projects so try to avoid
installing things globally if you can
now now that we've installed that let's
do another install saved a version of
web pack
alright once this is done here webpack
is going to be relatively big projects
it's going to take just a few moments
but once this is done I want to show you
something if you type babel and you're
like unrecognized internal Kentucky just
installed it right well the problem is
is that we installed it locally and we
didn't install it globally so your
computer has no idea what the hell Babel
is unless you actually added a path
reference to the specific location where
Babel is installed it's not going to
know what it is but you don't have to
deal with the paths and all that
horseshit so I'm going to show you how
to do this in the NPM config to avoid
that debt hassle in your NPM config you
have these scripts and if you type
inside these scripts you can put a
actual argument so your key and then
Babel and I just simply say Babel I'm
going to do the same thing with webpack
so all I'm simply doing is telling NPM
when when I say Babel or I say web pack
that's what I mean so when I say NPM NPM
run Babel since we've added that to our
config file NPM since we ran it that way
now knows that we try to execute a babel
command now we got some errors and stuff
because we didn't supply the proper
information but that's fine so if you
wanted to run Babel or web pack or any
other dependency that NPM installs for
you can just add the scripts to the
scripts section there so that way it can
execute but you have to execute it by
saying NPM run all right now that you've
done that we need to go ahead and create
a web pack config j/s file to use with
web pack so we're going to a web pack
config dot j/s all right so inside here
this is where things are going to get a
little complicated and I want to go
ahead and I want to copy all this crap
in so that way I don't mess anything up
and then you guys can just you guys can
just copy this so if you pause the video
copy all this stuff into your computer
and I'll explain each section here
so this path is using
it's built-in ability to recognize the
path because the output file we're going
to have a bundle J s and then we're
going to have an entry which is going to
be our app Jaya so basically all of our
development is going to be done inside a
PJs but then once we're done when we
compile things using webpack and it can
converges everything that app.js needs
including jquery or any other modules or
anything that you're using it's going to
create one big-ass bundle J's file and
that way in your script your HTML page
you can have just one reference and
that's it bundle jeaious you don't have
to worry about right you know
referencing stuff in a certain order and
all that crap this will just handle it
for you this test means if it matches
either Jas or JSX then to compile it
using Babel z-- loader
this says exclude node modules because
Babel will try to compile everything
inside the root directory that you
provide but it's going to skip anything
in node modules because you do not want
that being compiled down I would
actually make things quite a bit slower
and then this presets is saying use the
latest standards at 2015 the ACMA script
6.0 so if you start writing stuff at
ACMA script 6.0 style it will compile it
down to older versions of you know just
plain JavaScript that will work in older
browsers and then this says react so for
writing some react code like JSX that
this is going to know hey I'm dealing
with JSX and let me compile this down to
regular JavaScript all right so now that
all that has been done let's go ahead
and create our App KS file which we're
going to put right into the root
directory because that's where it's
going to look for apps right here so
let's create the new file we'll come on
fj s inside app J s let's go to the
react let me say react all right and
just and before I even do that I'm going
to go to react to download a copy of
their example but I want to show you the
reference file that this is being
included so I already have this out this
locally running website which is going
to ret to reference that bundle J s file
and I can show you if I if we view
source down at the bottom you can see
that this thing is referencing bundle J
s right there is no bundle J s yet
because we haven't run our for
is command to actually take everything
from address and move it to bundle J s
but eventually we're going to do that
and bundle J s will be found so let's go
ahead and create inside the bundle J s
if I went over to reax tutorial page i'm
just going to copy this one section
where it builds a basic a basic
component here using react and i want to
show you something where where we're
saying react on that render instead of
content i actually want to say quiz
because if we looked inside my HTML page
you can see that i havent div ID name
quiz and not content so that's actually
where i want to attach this component in
react so now fjs is using this JSX code
which isn't valid JavaScript it needs to
be compiled down the j s so we put it
right inside of our app j s file and i
want to show you in order to be able to
well I'm going to show you an example of
how we use modern-day JavaScript like
the import statement so import in the
newest JavaScript standards allow you to
import objects that you need you can see
that we're using react right so we need
to actually import react and this is
JavaScript 6.0 syntax that isn't
supported in the browsers yet but I
could say import react import react when
I say from and then this is going to be
in double quotes or single quotes and
I'll say react now since we have react
installed there should be no problem
there but one thing that we do need to
do is that the newest versions of
ReactOS at the time of this video they
separated out the Dom so anything that
has to do with Dom rendering or anything
they have a new project which they call
react Dom so we need to actually install
that with NPM config our npm install
we're going to say npm react dom save
dev so just like we've installed
everything else we need to use this
react Dom it needs to be there so we're
installing it now alright so now that
that's installed we need to do the same
thing we need to say import react Dom
from
we'll say react Tom and you know I like
single quotes here
it just seems cleaner for some reason so
there we go it's now now everything
should work just fine so if I go to the
command line I need to say NPM run web
pack now web pack is automatically going
to look for the web pack config JSON
file that we just created so it's going
to look for it it's going to see it and
it's going to use all of these settings
that we have inside the web config
including hey what am I looking for app
dot J's okay and then what am i
outputting okay bundle yes and you can
see that it actually ran at our command
line looks like we did run into an error
okay it looks I mean you to install
react maybe I didn't install react but
you can see it looked for react it
couldn't find it all right and then uh
but I did create a bundle J's file over
here so let's go ahead and let me let me
make sure we install react here and I
thought it was installed already maybe I
didn't I don't know
all right so so that's that let me try
to run the compile I keep pulling up to
run let me try to run this one more time
run web pack
all right so that worked without error
now we have this big bundle j/s file so
now we have bundle J s and now if I go
over to my project over here and I
refresh you can see hello world I'm a
comment box so we now have in one bundle
J s file it's going to be one big-ass
file we have everything we need for this
project to operate and we used Ekman
script 6.0 standards so the latest
standards in JavaScript that aren't
supported we use JSX which isn't even
valid JavaScript which got compiled down
the regular JavaScript and all that
stuff got put into one file so we know
what to deal with multiple javascript
files we have one and that's this bundle
J's file so you know me this is better
to view it this way so if I go down here
and I go to bundle J s open a new tab
you can see the bundles yes because
we're using a web pack and everything
else it created this humongous file but
this humongous file there's a ton of
work for us and we could actually minify
that as well
I think Babel or even um web pack allows
you to minify I'm not on % sure we may
have to use go up for that but either
way you can metafile at down so it's a
lot it's a lot smaller but um it's going
to handle a lot of headaches now one of
the headaches that you're going to deal
with is you're like okay well you know
what let me update my my comment box
here and I want to change the tax rate
so I'm going to say our text has changed
okay we go back to our webpage and we
look at this and we see okay we got the
same site why oh because we have to
compile again so every time you make a
change you have to compile that sucks
right because then you have to it's one
extra step for every little thing you
have to do so so that blows we don't
want to do that but you can see once I
compile it the new changes take effect
all right our text has changed let me
also try to onto a screen draw thing
check this out boom what is this it
doesn't work very well at all this is
like oh you know here's a line there you
go boom how do I clear this I
actually never use that I should
probably practice that but anyway
so that's pretty cool I've actually
never used my screen draw capabilities
on on this before but anyway you can see
the text has changed right so how do I
make this set up so that we can just go
ahead and compile this thing on the fly
every time we change it that would be
better right because then you don't have
to go in and make that extra step well
all we have to do is go back into the
web.config Jason where we have this here
we're going to say what is the command
we're going to say just simply watch
equals true make sure you have a comma
there and now by adding this watch
equals true and if we run webpack you
can see that it's actually going to not
hang but it's going to continue to run
so basically it's going to endlessly
listen for any sort of changes so you
see how it doesn't exit out so it say
hey you know we made the change but now
I can go in and I can make changes on
the fly to my JSX code this mother F has
changed and now if I save the file
because it's being watched I refreshed
and you can see this mother F has
changed so here's my little screen
drawer thing one more time boom
o song
yeah this thing sucks anyway that's
awesome that it's changed so please
subscribe to this tutorial hopefully I
saved you guys a lot of time this is how
you get started with react Babel webpack
this is the latest stuff that you need
to be dealing with don't worry about
grunt and requirejs and no don't worry
about NSO start writing your apps this
way start using the apps and import
statements you know like so just you
just need to use the imports like we did
at the top here this is all the latest
JavaScript stuff this is where Java
scripts headed so please subscribe to
this channel if you guys want more
content like this thank you for watching
have a good day and bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
