so let's go ahead and change some of
this nav stuff I want to add just a few
things that I'm gonna do about us and at
this point I don't really know exactly
what other things I need to add to their
websites I mean like this is like just
time basic stuff but let's go ahead and
say contact
privacy policy so we're changing those
things no it's go ahead and go to our
URLs and add those URLs so that we can
actually click on them and go there here
so this is going to be about
I don't change this policy and then this
is terms okay all right now it's one of
the views and we'll create indexes for
our methods for those pages so now let's
do that let's go ahead and add contact
us first
and what will contact us
all right such a good start let's go
ahead and create some pages for some of
these other things so we can just save
as and I'm gonna save as save as Privacy
Policy save terms
all right so now that we've done that
let's go ahead and just since we're in
terms I'm gonna take this out and we'll
just say an h1 and here we'll just say
terms now what this is is it's a
variable inside of a template and
there's the first time we've done this
so what I'm doing is I'm actually gonna
try to I'm gonna try to allow the people
that manage this website to be able to
update their terms their privacy policy
all that crap because I don't want any
of that I don't I have nothing to do
with that as a developer doing them a
favor so I don't want to have anything
to do with that so instead of even
waiting for them to get me what they
need I'm simply going to have a spot in
the database to say it's basically gonna
be I'm not really sure what it's called
but let's go ahead and do that now well
we're gonna go we're gonna go into our
command prompt let's kill our server and
we're gonna use our Python manage py and
we're gonna say start app and the app I
don't remember what I should call this
I'll just call this management alright
so now we have a new module in our
application called management and let's
refresh this and you can now see that we
have this module management with its own
views and all this stuff what I'm gonna
do is open up the models file here and
we're gonna create a model that they can
use for things like their frequently
asked questions or like terms and
conditions all that grunt so let's go
ahead and define what our model is going
to be inside of our database alright so
inside this model file let's go ahead
and create our class or to say class and
we'll just call this management and it's
gonna inherit from model stock model
inside the class this is where we're
gonna define the things that that we
store so I want to go ahead and just
basically have a title which there's an
interesting name to give it but I think
it is fitting somewhat so I have we're
gonna define as a models done character
field and we'll give it a max length so
we don't want any naming collisions here
and I'll show you what I'm thinking here
in a moment so inside here and we're
simply gonna have what we call just I'll
just call it body block and we'll call
this is gonna be a text field so we'll
say models got text field max my equals
there's gonna be rather big so I'm just
gonna say 5,000 just to be safe and
we'll say no equals true blank blank
equals
this way they don't have to fill this
out if they don't want to I think for
right now that's really all I want with
it so yeah that should be that should be
all I need right now now that we've done
that let's go ahead and go back to our
command prompt and say Python actually
what we need to do we need to add this
module that we just created to our
settings file so go to settings and
inside your installed apps we're gonna
say my project management make sure you
have that comma on there and let's try
to run this Python manage that py sync
DB and see if it finds our module all
right so I didn't find the module so we
may just need to say management because
it appears I spelled it perfectly
unexpected keyboard argument black
black it needs to say blank
alright so go over here all right now
it's creating the tables for the new
module that we just created let's do one
other thing and just say sequel
management okay and let's go ahead and
run our server again actually before we
do that we need to add a file to this so
we're gonna add a new item it's gonna be
called admin dot py I know the reason
for the admin file is that you need to
have that in your module in order for
your database administration system to
register that that it exists basically
so you can see the objects that you
store in there and you can edit them
within your your admin so without the
admin file you can't do that for a
module that you have so we're gonna say
from my project models and really I may
not you know what I don't even I don't
think I need to I'm just gonna say from
models imports and then the name of our
class which we called management and
then we're gonna say from Django doc
trip import and now we need to create a
class inside here we're gonna say class
and we'll just call this management
madman and it's going to accept an admin
model admin what it's inheriting from
and over just to say list display equals
title and then we're gonna say search
fields
equals and this is a list and we're just
going to search by title and then the
final thing we need to say admin dot
site dot register
all right so now that we have that let's
go ahead and just make sure we sync TB
one more time make sure there's no
errors now if we go ahead and run our
server again go to our page seven here
then go to your admin got the login and
now you can see management has been
added to our admin and by giving it a
search field we can actually search for
all management objects so let's go ahead
and just do in a brief example we're
gonna call this title and we're gonna
call this terms an inside here we're
just gonna go ahead and just do some I
don't know why I just did anyway so um
go ahead and save that so that saves
terms to your database what page were we
working on again I don't remember yeah
we're working on terms alright so what
we're gonna do here is we're gonna say
terms equals management not objects get
and it's gonna be title equals terms now
let's go ahead because it doesn't know
what a management is so we need to add
that so we can say from my project I
really we don't even work that we can
say from management
models import management and now that we
can reference that and for our terms
here we need to send a dictionary back
to the template and what you need to do
is give it a name so we're gonna say
terms and then colon and then term
actually I have that backwards it's
terms and this can be whatever name you
want it's gonna be the name that you
reference in your template and if you
remember we already referenced terms in
our template and then you assign it the
object that we just created here close
off your dictionary make sure there's a
comma there and let's go ahead and run
this and see if we can go to our terms
page and find out what's what happens
here okay so it says management object
okay so the reason why is if we go back
to our template that's good though it
means that have found our management
object so go back to our template and
we're gonna say terms and dot what do we
call this body block or something and
now you can see it's it's saying blah
blah blah so it actually queried our
database when we requested terms and it
found the terms and conditions text so
that way when these people have their
website they're gonna go into their
back-end and they'll be managing stuff
and then go to their management and
they'll say all the terms our terms and
condition have updated let's go ahead
and and just update this in terms is how
the backend identifies so when we want
to add more stuff we're gonna add
privacy and
this is the privacy statement and then
we'll add some more contacts so we'll
just say contact this is our contact
information
what are some of the other ones about us
so about how to say this is about us
text
and
that should be about it for right now
now one cool thing I do want to show you
before we end the video is that we can
actually have this because you notice it
put it all on one line we can actually
have this accept HTML by doing this so
we can actually put HTML in here since
it's a trusted source it's gonna be like
two management people themselves doing
this let's make sure it's proper HTML
with a proper closing tag I don't know
why I keep hitting save alright so we
can actually have HTML and we're gonna
go ahead and save it and when we go to
our template we can render the HTML by
simply giving it a pipe sign which is
shipped in this like straight line thing
and then just say safe and watch what
happens when we go to the terms page now
you can see it's actually being rendered
as paragraph tags so it's it's being
rendered CP tag as the HTML that we gave
it so it's very convenient way of I
think you know making this thing
manageable so we have a good start to
our application this is basically the
administration method I'm gonna follow
so that you know they can update their
terms and conditions their privacy
policy and all that crap
you know as they see fit and it would be
you know reflective accordingly alright
and that's it if you click on any one of
these actually they're not even
clickable at this moment well terms goes
to the right page the other ones don't
really go anywhere that's fine
so any way that your link now works too
so thank you for watching please
subscribe we're gonna continue to build
this thing bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
