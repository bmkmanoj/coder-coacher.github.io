video I just want to kind of give a few
tips to anybody that might be getting
into react and redux and possibly even
single page applications with react
router and other tools the really the
few things I'm going to mention here
it's not like you know perfectly planned
out so it's not like all-encompassing or
anything but I think honestly that I can
give a pretty good you know opinion or
at least give you know some decent
pointers on what people are going to be
experiencing when they get into this
environment and just to provide a few
tips so number one whatever you're going
to get into reacting like if you're just
starting now you really need to know es6
and that's probably the first thing that
you should do there's so many different
free resources out there you could use
any sort of es6 tutorial on youtube some
are better than others mine I'm not
really saying is better than others or
anything but I do have a tutorial series
out there for es6 you don't have to
spend a ton of time to like master it
front and back but you definitely need
to understand you know some of the newer
features like the spread operator arrow
functions and things like that otherwise
you're probably going to have a much
more difficult time trying to jump into
this stuff so that just you know spend a
couple hours trying to fill yourself in
on the es6 thing so after that though
the amount of boilerplate that is
involved with any sort of new project is
absolutely like astronomical these days
this particular startup project here is
from quarry houses react slingshot which
he has a plural site course on there's a
lot of stuff in here that I don't like
that I'm not a fan of but it's it's
absolutely brilliant like all this this
stuff being put together and getting it
to work now with Corey houses tutorial
on Pluralsight like in a way it's almost
like cheating because most of the the
tutorial is him copying and pasting code
that he's already written because had
you had to have write all that stuff
from scratch you're going to end up
running into so many different issues in
the tutorial would be very convoluted
and confusing even more so than the
copying and pasting of the massive
amounts of code
you know that one developer obviously
spent a lot of time trying to you know
situate and get all correct and
everything and then do a tutorial series
on it so you're gonna probably see that
a lot more with you know the amount of
what we've really just all the
boilerplate nonsense that a lot of these
projects have but that said even though
there's so much boilerplate and you look
at quarry houses a boiler plane here
running a react redox react router and
on other other stuff especially we start
adding unit testing whether it's mocha
that uses tools like enzyme or in this
case he's using gest which is one of the
reasons what I don't really like some of
the stuff in here but most of this crap
you're gonna end up porting in anyway
now some of this stuff is very kind of I
would say borderline like anal are very
particular and probably doesn't need to
be in a starter app but eventually you
know you could probably try to figure
out what those pieces aren't and of
removing them but once again the amount
of time that something like this would
save you I mean because you could spend
literally three days trying to get your
entire project up and running maybe even
three weeks depending on how much
experience you have with all of this
stuff so that is definitely the best
advice I could give as far as this stuff
is concerned is that like you can't
really it's almost like a web framework
you kind of have to go off of you have
to go off of what somebody's already
created otherwise you're gonna spend a
lot of time reinventing the wheel here
so there's a couple of great starter
sites like here's a coreopsis starter
site and like I said this is um this is
one of the best I've seen he has a tour
tutorial course on Pluralsight where he
kind of walks through the entire thing
but once again some extra stuff in there
some Jeff stuff just isn't great for
being a like a testing everybody's using
mocha seems like mocha with enzyme and
j/s Dom can do what chess does and
that's yeah really the only real
downside of this and probably just some
extra features that he really didn't
need but things that helped him in his
tutorial as he was going along now
there's other react Redux starter sites
so here's one from Dave Zuko so once
again you can see
see how large these projects are I mean
they're almost like entire frameworks
within themselves but once again you're
gonna write half of this stuff anyway if
if you try to go on your own and even
for absolute newbies a lot of times you
want to do things from scratch so you
can truly understand what it is that's
going on but I think honestly you could
end up pulling your hair out with the
frustrations I'm just jumping into this
environment so I really think even
newbies from newbies inexperienced
people alike should actually be using
these boilerplate setups now from there
there are like code pen examples because
one of the things that's really
confusing with this entire ecosystem is
the JSX syntax which isn't really it's
not it's not a HTML it's not JavaScript
it's kind of like it's not XML it's kind
of like a mix of the two
but that is what react uses to build its
UI so having something like you know a
code pen set up where you can easily
start manipulating so there's there's
basically there's projects out there own
code pen and other things like plunker
or jsfiddle that will jsfiddle don't use
that but they have all this like stuff
set up so you can really start you know
testing out your your J like your HTML
so in this particular case no this is
Janus X I'm sorry but if I'm gonna do an
inline style I'm gonna do something like
this I'm gonna say color and then we'll
say it's blue and then testing so as I'm
writing in here I can you know so I can
see my examples working and this is
actually react JSX code and rundown
really react specific but JSX code and
you doesn't understand what I'm talking
about
so you can see your working example so
if you have basic you know okay can I do
this like why do I have to use two curly
braces well then you know a style and
well it's because anything inside the
first outer curly brace is what it's
going to be we can you know construed as
raw JavaScript and then anything inside
of here is then you know the actual
object which is the key values of all
the the styles and one of the weird
things is is like anything with a hyphen
within you know like for instance font
size is typically in CSS
typically this but if I were going to do
that in JSX I have to do camel casing so
font size and we're going to now give it
18 okay whatever
okay but that is how you do this camel
casing thing so one of those things they
could be like why the eff doesn't this
work well it's much easier to do it in
something like this and having to
compile your entire app run your app go
into the browser clear your cache and
then be able to see the you know the
outputted information and things like
that okay so that said definitely save
yourself a lot of time having some sort
of you know alternate dev environment
for very simple testing like you know
for testing your components and things
like that
I'm not your full scale components but
if you have a complicated component
you're really gonna need Babylon es6 or
V Babel and web pack and all that to
compile it for you so that brings up the
next thing which is um you have to
understand what it is that that web pack
is doing web pack is a module bomb
dealer but it's also doing other things
like minification which is taking out
all the white space of your JavaScript
code it's doing things with things like
ugly flying which can also change your
variable names to be much much much
smaller variable names and things like
that you need to understand the concept
of source maps and I've told you this
before I have a video on source maps so
if you just look at my name and the
video in source maps you can get another
introduction to what they are and now
you can use them with them wetback and
the react ecosystem so this is you know
definitely a must understand what is
going on there now another thing is is
the tool Babel which is what everybody
is using these days to write es6 which
is the latest version of javascript and
be able to then have it work on other
browsers so you can see clearly the
examples using this new map feature
whereas on the right hand side is being
just being transferred over so all these
different new features that browsers
don't support you can start writing the
code now and Babel is going to turn them
into an older working version so it
allows you to kind of get up to date on
unreactive them now and not and not the
future because we've seen in
like in Perl write a Perl profile was
out for 1516 years before Perl 6 was
finally released Perl 6 for all intents
and purposes has been a complete bust
nobody's jumping on it it was just too
long between that gap a lot of people
are still using Perl 5 but an even
better and more you know probably more
common example would be pythons 2 versus
Python 3 it took a decade for Python 2
to try to transfer over to Python 3 and
even now the most popular web framework
which is Django is still not fully
compatible we're not fully it's
compatible but there's they're still
holding on the Python 2.7 because there
are still Django projects out there that
are using projects that are only working
in Python 2 because they've never been
ported over to Python 3 so the point
being is that it could take a long time
for es6 to be truly working in all the
browsers and it's you know the current
form but with a tool like Babel it
allows everybody to get on the same page
now now that said by the time you know
browsers are supporting us 6 we're
probably gonna be running es 7 against 8
and then this never-ending cycle is is
going to continue what the fact of the
matter is though is and I've gone I jump
back and forth on this quite a bit
you know the Babel it's better in my
opinion to write Babel because Babel is
real es6 whereas typescript is not quite
a JavaScript language it's you know it's
its own flavor of JavaScript it's
written by more primarily written well
headed by anders salzburg who also
created turbo pascal and and and c-sharp
which is you know - excellent languages
but typescript itself i think is good
but I prefer es6 would babble because
it's the you know it's the real thing
so I don't you know we'll see the jury's
still out I think it's gonna take years
for typescript even come close to
competing with es6 at the moment for at
least you know current usage but but
typescript definitely seems to be
getting more popular now the next thing
I'm going to bring up is that here is
Cori houses react slingshot app that's
actually running on my local machine
right now and you can see the demo and
all the stuff so this is actually doing
Cline
side routing so it's not a you know
traditional server-side routing or
anything like that it's all doing client
routing if you wanted the demo app you
start doing things like this and you can
see that it's dynamically changing these
values down at the bottom with a
timestamp and one of the things you need
to keep in mind the first tool is you
have to have reactive tools installed on
your machine in order to be able to
figure out what's going on because these
are all component based systems within
react and a lot of times you're like you
know what the F program and what what
what component am i modifying right now
so you would end up going over to you
would right-click and then you're gonna
like you know highlight over a specific
portion and I'm like okay I see my TD
and you highlight over here if you click
react you can actually see these are the
values that are actually being stored
that are actually being stored for that
particular component so if I move all
the way up to this component you can
actually see it's props now the props
are basically the state of the
application that's passed down to the
component and you can see date modified
display results false blah blah but
these are all you know the the the
properties that are passed to these
components so if you want to understand
what's going on there that's a good
start now if you're using redox you
absolutely have to have the redox dev
tools because this gives you the tool to
be able to say okay if I change this
what what actions are being fired off
trade mild miles-per-gallon trade in
miles per gallon it would be my I have
no idea what that stands for but anyway
you can see I'm changing the values and
it's dynamically doing things right so
we're shirt and changing these values
and tells you what actions are being
fired if I want to look at the overall
state I'm gonna come inside here and I'm
going to be able to see in the overall
state of the application see this is so
I can change that and you can see it's
being changed in the overall state so
actions are being fired and all that
other stuff and with reactor redox you
have a centralized store so that's a
much better way than having a bunch of
components all managing individual state
because every once in a while those
states needed to converse and that's
where things get really
because you started modifying state and
weird starts happening well with
redox it's all about you know a purely
functional state system that says hey if
I'm gonna modify the state I know I want
to leave everything intact except for
the one piece that's being modified and
it also is all about which is a purely
functional approach and it's also about
having all these components share the
same state so that there's not a bunch
of different weird state management
going on that you know that is very very
difficult to debug so that is your
typical modern day react redox reactor
stack for single page apps and it is a
ton of boilerplate but to not use some
so you know starter project I think is a
bad idea this is the rage I would say
right now if you look at react react is
on the up angular2 is out I think
angular 2 has one major problem and that
that is that it uses typescript I've
talked to programmers that have said in
their development team that they've
tried to get on the whole typescript
thing thing and that you know it's good
for c-sharp developers moving the
JavaScript maybe but you know it's it's
not being embraced across the board and
the fact that types typescript is like
the default documentation language for
react not react with angular 2 that is a
I think that's a big problem for the AED
project in all and even if it's easier
to write because I've heard angular 2 is
much easier with typescript compared to
react react router and all that other
stuff I really feel like this whole
modular component based system shared
state purely functional state is going
to end up continuing to be embraced by
you know a lot of major operations
across the country so alright guys let
me know what you think make sure you
subscribe to my channel and thank you
for watching also check out my sponsor
alright guys see you later bye hey guys
so a lot of you asked me how do I get my
foot in the door to become a programmer
and I just wanna take a moment to
mention dev Mountain coding boot camp is
a 12-week intensive course that focuses
on the technologies of the here-and-now
for web development some of the things
that they're actually teaching in this
12-week course it's geared to get you
into the
the industry by focusing on things like
jQuery nodejs react angular how to use
github so a lot of the things that
you're going to need to do as a
developer as soon as you start they're
going to be teaching you in this and
this coding bootcamp and the entire goal
is to be able to get you into the
industry within 12 weeks so if you guys
are interested in learning more
information about Deb mountain coding
bootcamp just check out the link in the
description tab of this video thank you
for watching and have a good day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
