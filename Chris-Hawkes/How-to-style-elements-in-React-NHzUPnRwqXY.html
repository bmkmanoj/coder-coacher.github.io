for watching and in this video I want to
touch on how we handle styles and what
it is it's really inline Styles and it's
a little bit different in JSX and react
because this is all JavaScript and JSX
it is almost like a XML presentation of
of your components but it is still all
just JavaScript it compiles down to that
so you got to do some workarounds which
is a little bit different than what
you're used to but there's nothing wrong
with it I mean I've been programming now
for many years and at first honestly I
didn't like J Saxon it was enough to
almost make me go to a different project
but I mean react is I mean I couldn't be
happier with it so far I'm getting
started with it and the JSX thing is
really not that bad it's gonna be a lot
easier once more and more editors start
supporting it like right now I'm using
sublime text and doing a lot of other
stuff and pycharm and then I use Visual
Studio as well but both my charm and
visual studio can't handle JSX but
anyway it grows on you so just bear that
bear that in mind
hopefully you guys stick with it and
eventually you'll start to like it as
well so where we want to use the inline
Styles we want to declare that is a
variable which is the interesting part
of this so inside of my render function
here I want to style this h1 to be a
different color so what I'm going to do
is actually create a variable for the
style which is really you could think of
it as like a class name but what but
what I'll do is since it's an inline
style I'll just call this I'll name it
inline style just so you guys know I'm
talking about and it's an actual object
so when we say color we then give it the
color that it's supposed to be in fact
this will be color and we could say blue
so now to use this variable we would say
style equals and then inside the curly
braces we give it the name of our
variable that we just created and when I
pull up the web page you can see that
this is now being given the style that
we just assigned the color I actually
need to assign it I want to use this
color down here so I'm gonna copy that
now one thing to keep in mind is that
everything is camelcase so if you're
your CSS style that you're using is more
than one word so for instance font size
it's gonna be camel cased normally in
regular CSS you would say font size like
that but this is going to be a little
bit different so it's camelcase font
size and we'll just say 32 pixels and
then this I'm going to change the color
to what I just copied there so you can
see that I just went ahead and it has
both font size and color being assigned
to it and that the font size is showing
up is 32 pixels which I just happened to
guess and then it's almost the same size
as this oh yeah I like 30 so it's like 2
pixels bigger than this one anyway so
that is how you apply inline styles to
elements that are inside of your react
component it's really not a bad way of
styling because I mean these components
once you define them you just use them
over and over again so I mean really the
styling is self-contained it's it's very
similar to like like Google polymers
project we're using the shadow Dom where
Styles only pertain to a specific chunk
of the Dom so it's really a good way to
encapsulate styles for a particular
element now you could be saying well I
don't want to do that I just want to
define my classes in a external
stylesheet using CSS that's familiar and
there's no problem with doing that you
don't have to use inline styles I could
simply give this instead of a style tag
I could give it a class name which is
also camel case and this could be your
external class name like my last name in
this case it doesn't exist but that's
how you assign a class and that class
could have it could be styled inside of
an external stylesheet if that's more
familiar to you I happen to like the
inline style like I said just because it
encapsulates this to this particular
element and this particular style isn't
going to be normally you don't want to
do a bunch of inline Styles if you're
dealing with CSS because then that
becomes a maintenance nightmare in this
particular case I think it's it's
different just because of the
encapsulation alright guys well that is
how you style elements and react thanks
