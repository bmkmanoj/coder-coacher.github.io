this video we want to look at default
arguments in Python and why they're
important we're also going to look at a
gotcha which is really weird with
default arguments so you can get a full
understanding of how it works let's go
ahead and on our class object that we
already have defined we're going to
create a new method called default are
and then here we're going to have a
value and the second argument is just
going to be the actual default arc so
we'll say the fault arg equals hawks and
then down inside of this method we can
say prints value plus plus default arc
so when we run this let's go ahead and
call this method and then we're going to
pass in the actual value because this is
required right if we try to run this
without actually passing the required
parameter then we'll run into a problem
this isn't a required parameter because
we gave it a default value and that's
where that's what we're talking about in
this video so let's go ahead and pass in
this value run the program and you can
see down here and Prince Chris Hawks now
default arguments can also be overridden
so if i wanted to i could say something
else pass in the second argument which
is going to be applied to the default
arg and it's actually going to overwrite
the default argh so you can see over
here we get a new result so it's nice
because we're basically it's an optional
it's an optional parameter you don't
have to pass it in if they don't pass it
in we have some sort of fall back that
should be the default however if we run
if we run into something with immutable
data meaning if the data can be changed
like a Python list is considered mutable
data immutable it means that it can't
change mutable means it can change so
let's go ahead and pass in a list our
default our
it is going to be an empty list and if
we went ahead and said default our got a
pens value so same thing here let's go
ahead and and then we want to go ahead
and print the the list to see what's in
it because this is where you're going to
see a default argument gotcha and Python
so this is going to print the default
argh this will add this now let's go
ahead and run this real quick and you
can see a prince Chris right so that
seems like everything's good now watch
what happens if we call this again this
time we'll put again check this out we
get these like these duplicated list
because we're telling it to print each
time we call it so now we have this the
same list that's being appended to
and then you get it again and again and
again so on and on the immutable data
object a list that we have is a default
argh the reason why it's doing this is
because the list is only created the
first time the function is created so
when this is actually created by Python
this list is is created and it's created
just once so every time we go to app
into it it's a pending to the same list
every single time now that can be a
helpful feature depending on what it is
that you're working on but in most cases
that might trip you up and you're like
why is it doing that that's not what I
want now if you just wanted a new list
every time this is called you would
actually instead of just giving this an
empty list you would see none and you
actually see this a lot in Python code
more complicated code you'll see that
they do give a default value of none and
then they do an if check where they'll
say if default r equals none then it
says default r equals new list so you're
going to see that a lot and if we ran
this again you're not going to see these
concatenated list objects you know
you're going to have three different
lists which is what you may want so it
depends on what your purpose is but if
you feel like you know the first
circumstance is what you're looking for
and it's kind of what your programming
is built I can't even think of a
circumstance of why you would want that
at the moment but I'm sure that there
are but that is the way around it by
using the nun type as the default
argument and if we wanted to overwrite
the default value even though we're
giving it a nun type just like I showed
you before with the first and last name
you could do the same thing like you'd
say my list equals this and then you
pass in the actual list
and if we ran this you would get the
same result as you had before but this
time it's more predictable and you kind
of knew it would be that way if we look
here and we run this thing close this
you can see if we get to this default
argh and you can see that it is already
defined so we passed in an empty list
already so it's going to pass over this
code and it doesn't create a new one and
it just depends to the to the list here
so here's the second time around and you
can see that it's past the item with one
object in it already alright guys so
hopefully that makes sense to you guys
that is how default arguments in Python
work and how you can override them and
also a gotcha when it comes to how these
default arguments are instantiated when
the method is initially created alright
guys thanks for watching please
