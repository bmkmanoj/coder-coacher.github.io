video I just want to take a moment to
talk about a product that actually I'm
not getting paid to actually mention to
you guys but because I like to give back
to the community and also anybody that
wants to my channel you guys help me out
so if I can help you guys out in return
whether it's you know tutorials or just
information sharing or whatever it is I
plan on doing that on this channel as
much as I can and so this video what I'm
going to talk about is just briefly
mention in deep prime and just let you
know that I have I talked to a few
representatives from indeed who actually
invited me to use use Prime and
essentially you create your online
portfolio and you upload your resume
things like that and then indeed is
going to match you up directly with
retailers so especially you know when it
comes to technology and everything you
can see some of the companies that
they're working with here almost
exclusively technology companies so you
know it's focused on IT and the results
are definitely there my resume was on
there for less than 24 hours before I
had actually reached out to the
representative that I was talking to it
indeed to say hey you know I'm not
interested in changing my job you know
pull that pull that resume off but I
didn't want to let I did tell them
access I'm going to give you guys a
shout out because it was it was
phenomenal within 24 hours I had I think
was seven different different companies
that were asking me to interview with
them and every one of them knew you know
salary requirements everything else so
like you know they're fully aware of the
salary requirements the fact I didn't
have a degree like all that stuff and
literally within 24 hours I've been
d-prime I had seven seven offers even
probably like I was some companies
never heard of it's actually not the
case at all some of the bigger companies
include Capital one man tech which is a
billion-dollar really 1.6 billion
revenue a year but defense contractor
had a Fairfax job how's it being in
Denver actually but for the most part
they were all you know local local
opportunities except for the one job
which was man tech which was on Colorado
but anyway like I didn't reach out to
those companies I wasn't interested in
changing jobs or anything like that I
have no interest and changing jobs but
the other product it
pretty phenomenal so I have tried both
indeed Prime and I could recommend that
I also recommend higher comm so if
you're looking at like the two jobs that
actually match you up with approval
where the employers definitely recommend
both hired and nd Prime and once again
I'm not even getting paid to tell you
guys this I'm really not I feel like
both these companies should probably pay
me for mentioning mentioning their stuff
but either way there like I said is a
benefit you guys do yourself a favor if
you're looking for a job especially in
the United States that I think this this
could definitely help you so it seems
like those easy that you know from what
the opportunities that I've seen from
not just you know had hunters and things
like that that reach out to me sometimes
you know individual headhunters or for
headhunting agencies or even from like
you know good recruiters that work
directly for the company I get all kinds
of offers it seems like from your
LinkedIn just here just saying hey we
have this value might be a good fit for
blah blah blah you know that is like the
traditional way to go it seems like we
know with with indeed prime you know
they're they're hooking up directly with
with the recruiters for the companies
themselves so you can kind of skip out
on the middlemen a little bit so I
definitely recommend you guys to check
it out
I'm curious see if you guys have the
same or similar level of success but I
was surprised at the fact that the
instead in different companies reached
out to me interested just based on my
resume and experience and and and didn't
seem to care at all the fact that I
didn't have a college degree and I did
actually due diligence to look into some
of the job descriptions and everything
so even though they were reaching out to
me generally speaking some of these
positions still asked for the degree but
you clearly be the you know the status
quo to me from what I've seen in the
United States is that if you have
experience it Trump's a degree more
often than not these days so it's really
about experience and I think you have to
be clever and and come up with unique
ways of trying to find you know your
first opportunity whether it's you're
reaching directly out to you know a
product owner or manager at the company
or whatever to say what you can do you
know versus just you know simple
submitting resumes I think it takes
creativity these days like even this
blog it helps me
try to you know remain up-to-date with
the technology trends and things and
stay up to date with you guys and also
by doing tutorials and things even
though it doesn't really pay very well
it does help me learn and by teaching
others can also really solidify your
knowledge and different topics and
things but I think you know my point is
that you do have to be creative and
things that you do to try to try to
either establish yourself especially if
you don't have a degree
of course I don't know exactly what
those steps are like the exact steps to
follow just simply I think focusing on
emerging technologies where you can kind
of level the playing field versus senior
developers is definitely beneficial
anything that boot camps are touching
upon would be good technologies to learn
if you're if you're not going to
traditional college degree routes so
anyway guys that's my thoughts man make
sure you check out indeed prime thank
thank you for watching have a good day
