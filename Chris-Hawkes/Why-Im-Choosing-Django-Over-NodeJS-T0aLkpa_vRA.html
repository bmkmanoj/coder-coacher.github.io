about in this video is django vs node
and why i'm going with the decision that
i'm about to make
so to give a background django is built
around python the Python programming
language which i've already i've been a
huge advocate for python in the past few
years it was one of my first languages
that i've learned and I'm really happy
and proud of the success that Python has
had across all kinds of different
communities but with the web it's it's
certainly become like a top contender
for a web-based language or for a web
framework basically a server-side
language so I'm really comparing Django
to node so I spent a few months over the
last few months actually with nodejs and
I am a really big fan of node and I love
JavaScript I actually like programming
and node because I can write JavaScript
and I work I do a lot of JavaScript
stuff so I'm more of a senior UI type of
programmer dealing mostly with
JavaScript but I also do a lot of you
know a decent amount of c-sharp but I
definitely do more javascript in c-sharp
so when it came to running a stack at
home for the website that I'm about to
create I needed to decide whether or not
I was going to do node or Django now
I've had several Django sites in the
past and I decided to step away from
Django just for a bit to just play
around with note and see what I thought
of it and one of the main reasons why I
wanted to decide are really one of the
reasons why I thought node might be a
good idea for me and for my project is
because I wanted to be able to build the
framework from the ground up and
basically be able to handle every bit
about that that framework so when it
comes to like session management account
authentication templating engines all
that stuff I wanted to be able to write
all that code to get it going and note I
think gives a lot of freedom of being
able to do that so we're actually
comparing somewhat apples to oranges
Django is a Python web framework and it
uses Python on the server node is
technically a server-side essentially it
can be thought of as an API but it runs
on the server so it's actually written
in C and C++ but you use a JavaScript
API to be able to communicate with that
C and C++ language which ultimately
boils down to machine level language
which is ones and zeros so it is a
little bit of an apples to oranges
comparison when you say no js' in Django
a better comparison would be expressed
j/s which is a framework a minimalist
framework that is built on top of node
and what okay they did a redirect that
was weird so you have Express like I
said it's built on top of node and it
can be thought of as a Django you know
what Django is the Python Express is to
note in a way and that may not be the
best comparison but it's better than
comparing Django to notes specifically
so with express it gives you hardly
anything out of the box you basically
have some HTTP functionality for being
able to route requests to templates and
stuff like that and there's just there's
a ton of tools that you can add on and
everything and it just seemed really
cool so I was building this web
framework right and here's part of it
I've actually kind of changed it around
a lot but actually you can see I'm not
going to go through all the code here
some of its kind of sloppy but what I
did is I actually created my own
authentication kind of profile situation
where there's actually a swearword of my
comments and there hopefully you guys
didn't see that but my ID that sometimes
when I'm frustrated but you can see like
in this particular thing I was kind of
learning how to do like you know salting
and hashing my passwords which I thought
was cool and and you know I'm kind of
writing a bunch of stuff here so I even
have for my authentication like I have a
temporary database table using MongoDB
that I was creating a session data to so
basically when you register to the site
you go into this like temporary data
table that's waiting for authentication
so then I I spent up a unique Wade
using some of the latest standards there
and I send the email so that way I can
verify it's not a robot and they at
least have to verify their email address
and they come back in and I verify the
token that was in the email that that
came into the site the bottom line is
that I built my own authentication it
was really awesome I was really happy
about it now the reason why I'm deciding
whether or not Jango versus Note is
because I have a specific requirement
where I essentially want a just a basic
crud application so a crud stands for
create update read and delete so my god
say that write create so create read
update and delete yeah I guess that's it
all right so anyway a crud application
Jango is really what you know crud is
built for node is mainly you know with
it's a synchronous nature it's very good
for two-way chat communication it
doesn't ever have any sort of bug it's a
non-blocking kind of in out process so
it's able to handle high load although
it doesn't necessarily make it any
quicker than Jango it probably is a
little bit quicker I haven't done any
speed tests on it I've noticed locally
that note is actually quicker than Jango
but here's the problem with node and
Express is that what Jango gives you out
of the box with its admin with the fact
that it's just it's built to work with
you know your more traditional sequel
based languages like or sync you know
sequel databases like my sequel you can
easily hook it up to my sequel where you
can hook it up to post grad school or
sequel server it doesn't matter Jango
gives you all kinds of flexibility as
far as what job what database you want
to work with except for MongoDB if you
want to go into a no sequel with Jango
you're probably going to run into some
problems with the built in admin system
but most people don't want to do that
unless they're trying to be hip and cool
or that maybe they you know they do
think that MongoDB is the future but in
my particular situation like I said I
just want to build a crud application so
what I have here is I have this new
movies com website and I'm actually
tired of actually working on it I
haven't maintained this thing in like
three months I've owned it for several
years now at one point like I think
during its peak I had like a
50,000 visitors to this website and I
was like oh yeah but it was a ton of
work I had to write articles and stuff
like that and to be honest with you I
kind of did this as a learning tool for
my full-time employment because I was
learning about responsive web design
which in case if you guys don't know
what that is when you shrink a screen
down and this isn't even this doesn't
even look pretty it looks terrible but
when you start to shrink the screen down
you have this you know responsive view
and all stuff so this website looks
absolutely terrible and I'll be the
first to admit that it's looked better
in the past to be honest with you but
every time I would be like oh I'm going
to add this new feature and then I'll
start like getting into and then I
realized that there's just a ton of code
that makes this movies website run
because I've actually redesigned it like
probably ten times over three years and
there's just never there's never any end
in sight you know what I mean like you
think you're going to add some sort of
small you know update to it and then you
start looking at your your basecoat and
i'm like god damn i got a hundred
thousand lines of code here and i don't
even remember what half of it is doing
and i'm i mean look at some of this this
is just one of one of the views of many
that this new movies comm site is
running on and some of that code is just
absolutely terrible so the bottom line
is I'm actually going to be removing new
movies I don't plan on actually having
any sort of Hollywood based website
anymore I don't really need it and it's
never going to work to be honest with
you I had talked to you guys about a
previous video where I said you know
dream big and all that stuff well you
know if you're going to build a
Hollywood movie site where you're
actually talking about Hollywood movies
and things like that
that is a big dream but you better have
a strong passion to want to talk about
movies day in and day out and if you
don't like writing and you don't like
talking about movies eeen you're
probably never going to be able to
succeed even if you did with something
like you know IMDB or rotten tomatoes I
mean IMDB is owned by Amazon com
obviously a hundred billion dollar
company Rotten Tomatoes is owned they
were owned by Warner Brothers at one
point now I think they're owned by CBS
or some sort of large like me
you a conglomerate a lot of those media
companies actually own each other so in
my opinion I'm like well why do I have
this site I don't have time to maintain
it number one it's not a learning tool
for me anymore it doesn't really make
any money not enough to keep it running
and it's just kind of like so--you but
at the same point I'm like well I spent
three years on them on the website you
know as far as owning it you know so I
paid to renew the domain every year I
have thousands of backlinks to this
existing site so I have an age domain
and some backlinks why would I want to
just get rid of it so what I'm trying to
do is I'm going to go ahead and just
build a new website and I'm going to
actually have the website be catered
around the YouTube tutorial videos that
I do here on my youtube channel so I
just kind of want to like maybe showcase
a little bit more with the YouTube
channel and then also be able to provide
downloadable tools for when I do do
tutorials a lot of people have asked for
like source code for what I'm writing
and unfortunately I haven't given a lot
of I haven't actually planned that out
well enough to actually have the source
code available so that's what new movies
is going to be I'm going to try to
transition it into a site around my
tutorials and have all the source code
and everything available and hopefully
make it easier to kind of discover and
maybe interact with the community more
than just what the channel provides so
that's my whole thing and I'm like well
you know really what I'm envisioning is
sort of sort of a crud application so do
I want to use node or do I want to use
Django I've done the research I wrote a
framework that has a lot of
functionality within nodejs and I built
it from the scratch from scratch and I
really appreciate you know the learning
learning process along the way but when
it comes to actually getting something
done Django is absolutely right when it
says it makes it easier to build web
apps more quickly with less code and
there's just no question about it so I'm
choosing Django we're node may have seen
Django and speed in certain areas or may
be being less of a monolith you know
with its code base for my particular
goal if you just want to get a website
up and running and a pretty reliable
website you can't go wrong with Django I
mean
Django is still exploding in popularity
a lot of companies are using it and my
point is that in this particular case I
plan on using Django I'm still going to
be working on my node framework and I
hope to do something with that
eventually because I spent months on it
just kind of learning piece by piece but
Django's Django is the bee's knees so I
mean I really like Django and they're
like as much as people want to talk
about node and everything doing away
with Django I really don't think so I
think Django has some has some good
tools out there and for a minimalistic
website then no that's my choice so I
think Django still has no beat to date
all right guys thanks for watching let
me know what you think let me know if
you disagree I know no discord I'm not
bashing node whatsoever I'm just simply
saying for what I plan on doing with
your typical website maybe you Commerce
store whatever it may be I really feel
like Django has no beat hands down all
right guys thanks for watching please
subscribe and I have a good day bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
