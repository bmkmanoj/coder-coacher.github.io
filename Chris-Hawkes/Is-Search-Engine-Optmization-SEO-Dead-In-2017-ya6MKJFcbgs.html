talking about is SEO dead in 2017
and just one of the things I've been
working on recently I did the quill Jas
tutorial on well it's not hipster code
if you want but the quill jazz tutorial
I actually really like this project I
think it's awesome because I can
actually write blogs and without having
to do all this like hassle and stuff so
I kind of wrote this anyone really read
too much of it and honestly like my
writing is not the greatest and honest
and I don't even care to be honest I
really don't care
but the whole thing is that it's much
easier to write and not have to worry
about so much of the typical blogging
kind of nightmare I've said for a long
time that content is not something that
you want to invest in going into the
future and the reason why is because
anybody can do it so for me if you have
like a business model let's say Twitter
for instance Twitter's been on the verge
of bankruptcy for several years now
because they don't know how to make
money they they have this in a you know
hugely a popular product that doesn't
they don't know how to make money and
and they've had hundreds of millions of
dollars of venture capital funding
invested into them they raised money in
the stock market and and all of this and
they still can't make money so simply
you know being this this free model you
know is is it's tough for them because
they have competitors twitter has
competitors on Facebook on Instagram on
YouTube anybody that wants to be social
and say hey this is what I'm doing they
are potentially a competitor to Twitter
Plus let's be honest there's not much
that you can do on the Twitter platform
with 140 characters so other companies
spring up to try to fill the void and
you know they're like hey we can do
twice as many as that or we can have a
thousand you have the same guy who
invented Twitter also did medium which
is another site that I'm like well you
know I don't really know why I'd want to
use medium why do I want to use medium
to blog when I can create my own blog on
Django and own my own content not have
anybody tell me hey I can do it this way
or that way and then advertise which
months and once again no but nobody ever
makes money with advertising either
anymore because of all the adblock but I
can add advertising any way that I see
fit but if I'm using medium my content
is subject to them like going out of
business and
their database being hacked and all this
other stuff so obviously the same thing
can happen to my website but if you're
backing up your data appropriately then
hopefully you won't really have that
problem in my case you know I backup my
data through my web host I have a store
locally I have it on my web server
obviously all these different areas and
and those are things that any business
owner any website owner can do for
themselves they don't need medium or
WordPress or some other blogging
platform to do it for them so all that
being said is is SEO dead in 2017 you
know I I think SEO has been dead for
really many years now but the other day
I was talking to a a guy that owns a web
site that was well his entire web site
is he selling electrical pumps and he
found this this niche or niche market
where he can sell pumps in the United
States and not actually abroad - and he
does fairly well doing that so he has in
an e-commerce platform where he is just
focusing on one or two things he does it
well and he's able to get by but he
recently paid several thousand dollars
to have his website updated whoever did
it for him definitely ripped him off but
he was claiming that this guy helps him
with SEO and all this other stuff and
and the point is is like SEO doesn't
work anymore the SEO there used to be
devious tactics of joining up with
certain links you know doing guest
blogging keyword stuffing spam linking
you know through networks and things
like that and and those those things
just never really worked the long term
because if you're not providing value to
the user then then you're never it's
never gonna work I've actually done so
many different things that haven't
worked one time I had a a web it was a
web site that I wrote actually in Django
this was before I was actually a
professional developer but I thought I
was gonna be rich because I had a
product review website yet you know yet
another product review website and I was
reviewing products on things that it was
Beit it was dicey what I was doing
basically I was hardly providing more
content than what Amazon could provide
itself
but in the process I would have links to
Amazon and other things and and for some
reason I feel like I seem to have fallen
through some sort of crack where Google
was giving me tons of keyword credit on
all these different products that were
coming out so I was giving my two cents
and kind of building this site where it
consolidates a lot of this information
that was freely available it wasn't a
huge benefit I don't think to the user
but I was getting hundreds of people a
day and the thing is is that on this
YouTube channel I get roughly 13 14
thousand viewers a day something like
that maybe more it's something like
350,000 views a month I don't even know
how many users that is but basically I
get a lot of traffic on this YouTube
channel and the amount of money it makes
is actually laughable compared to what
this website was doing for and I'll skip
to the end of it where I say it only
lasted for three months however for
those three months I was getting three
to four hundred people a day and towards
like the holiday season when all of this
was taking off those three to four
hundred people it turns out can be much
much more valuable monetarily speaking
than tens of thousands of people heck
even maybe a hundreds of thousands of
people if they are in the market to buy
something and your website is getting
them directly to who they need to buy
the information from it is very very
lucrative I can say that so I thought
that oh I could make this simple website
do this you know this product review
thing I started you know spamming the
larger tools with a lot of keywords and
things doing all these things that you
know they say didn't work but it turned
out it did work and and if you are like
I said building something that is for
people that are in the market to buy
like TVs tablets computers then you're
making a heck of a lot of Commission
when you're getting them over in
addition because I was getting all this
extra credit the Google ads that you see
being displayed on hipster code right
here were actually
quite well I mean I was making you know
where I would make nothing I would make
you know 15 20 sometimes 30 dollars a
day just on ad clicks and that and and
mostly most of the money I was making
was on Amazon but there were days that I
was doing a hundred and fifty dollars in
advertising fees just in one single day
and that was on top of full-time income
and you know doing other things that I
was doing and I was like wow all I got
to do is just keep doing this and it's
gonna work well every day I would check
I'd get excited because I was making
hundreds of dollars and and then you
know every like weekly it was thousands
of dollars and and I thought I mean like
I was like wow I finally hit it big here
and and all of a sudden after about
three months of this I log into my
website and I searched the traffic and
everything and it's all gone literally
all gone and what ended up happening was
Google ended up adjusting their search
rankings and realized my website was a
piece of and I ended up getting
placed on some pages I was on page like
15 some I was on page like 500 basically
I was dropped off the face of the map by
Google and my entire business model was
based off of Google search traffic and
for that reason alone I understood at
that point and it was very hard to lose
that kind of money when you think that
it's going to continue to come in but I
think on tenth nobody's ever gonna come
to your site there's been many of
different there's been many of things
that I've tried since then like at one
point I was trying to do web site
templates one time I was trying to do
actual consulting I was trying to do
digital photography I did a lot of
different things and none of it really
worked because I couldn't do it better
than anybody else and I've actually said
that even with my movies web site the
main reason for building the movies web
site though was because I was trying to
learn responsive web development for my
full-time employment because I needed to
become good at that and one of the ways
that I become good at things is actually
by building products when I built the
quiz application for hipster code it was
actually because I needed to learn
react and also the flux architectural
pattern so this isn't here let me show
you I don't remember if I how okay so
like this quiz app then this quiz is
very bad I I went ahead night when I
originally made it I made it because I
wanted to build you know something in
react using the flux architectural
pattern and it was a pain in the ass
kind of learning it but as I started
doing that you know it was all been tied
together through web pack and babble and
all this other stuff and for the longest
time I call it table I don't know why I
called it Babel but I know that it's
called Babel but I was using all this
stuff and I decided that you know I was
gonna try to implement that into the
website because that's the way I learned
I build things and I learned from from
them and I think I learned quite a bit
and the the the product review website
was one of the hardest lessons that I've
ever had to learn because I ended up
going from making a lot of money to
losing everything and one of the things
that was a real major slap in the face
was that when Google shut off that
search traffic and they said hey no more
search up nobody ever looked up that
website to say hey I need to go to that
site because you know that site was
there like if I got shut off of youtube
I would hope that you know some of my
viewers would be like you know Chris
Hawkes what's he doing like I know he
got kicked off of YouTube maybe he's
doing something else like I would hope
you know some of that would be retained
I don't know how much of that would be
retained I don't know how much of these
people come to my channel just because
YouTube makes it convenient if I was on
Facebook or Twitter I don't know that
anybody would follow me there I really
don't some people have said do podcasts
and I don't know that anybody follows me
there so I did a few podcasts on iTunes
and it just it number one that doesn't
make any money number two it competes
with the money that I make on YouTube
because if anybody just went to my web
web podcast and I wouldn't make any
money on YouTube because I don't make
any money on you know it'd just be less
traffic so it's like it's difficult
because I don't necessarily do all of
this for money but you know being able
to make
a few hundred bucks a month helps with
some of the amount of effort that goes
in especially with something like
hipster code because I do have costs
associated with this website and there's
costs associated with YouTube as well
just because it's time and you know I've
said before programmers times is pretty
valuable I mean typically a programmer
in the United States is making at least
thirty thirty-five dollars an hour so if
you're gonna be doing stuff on your own
time
you know you would expect that your
bottom line would be at least fifty
dollars now or somewhere around that and
that might seem selfish or whatever but
it's just the fact that matter if it's
like why do football players get paid
millions of dollars and and even
football players that recognize that
they get paid too much they're not going
to just take less money because of it
like if somebody you know it doesn't it
doesn't work that way nothing in life
works that way so I think SEO has been
dead for a long time in 2017 though I
wrote this like quick blog that it's
going to be about quality content and it
really always has been it's why content
doesn't make a lot of money if you can
write quality content then then you're
gonna find some success if people can
find benefits from whatever whatever you
have to say and however you have to say
it and it's going to work and it's the
only thing that's worked for me and I've
tried a lot of different things so that
is my two cents another thing too is
that the devious tactics like you know
what was working for me for a short
period of time with the product review
website that wasn't very good that
wasn't providing much benefit to the
customer those types of things you're
gonna find those spammy bastards that
will slip through the cracks but it
won't last long term and if it doesn't
last long term then you're really not
doing yourself any favor even if you do
slip through the cracks and maybe make a
few thousand dollars in a short period
of time it's not gonna benefit you
because I can tell you that the amount
of effort I spent in building that
website and writing the articles and
doing all that stuff was not nearly
worth the money that I ended up making
off of it I can't in you'd the poor and
yes it would have been worth it but the
money didn't pour in more than three
months and
and it was all just a big fat waste of
time so keep that in mind one I was
talking to a buddy also about like he
was going to get into app development
because he had read about some guy that
was making a lot of money off of apps on
the App Store and they were simple apps
like things like you know set and
telling your your spouse or significant
other like you know sending her messages
automatically like that's that's
actually a very bad idea but like stupid
ideas like that this guy was making apps
apparently and and by by the time he had
15 20 30 apps out in the market he was
getting millions of views monthly and
that was adding up to thousands of extra
dollars in advertising that he was
making off of this this mobile stuff now
one of the first things that I look at
when somebody tells me how they're gonna
make how that you can find success based
off of what they did the first thing
that I think of now because I've seen
firsthand is that they're telling you
that because it no longer works for them
if it worked for them and they felt like
they actually had this niche that was
going to work long-term they wouldn't be
telling you about it and that's just a
simple fact
but once that dries up and they did find
success and maybe they can even show
that they have some success that's when
they start telling everybody else how
they can benefit and all this stuff and
and it doesn't really work unless 8 had
the intention that you know what maybe I
can make more money telling people how
to do something but the problem is is
that in my case and will and really in a
lot of the real world scenarios that
I've seen people are just bullshitting
most of them are just bullshitting they
haven't found the success that they're
even talking about and then some of the
ones that have found success no longer
have that success so now they're trying
to do something else and then there's
those people that literally make a
living off of helping other people I
don't make a living helping helping
other people but I've had the the way I
was able to find success on this channel
was simply by doing the tutorials and
stuff which ended up kind of morphing
into me getting in front of a camera and
talking to people which I started doing
in
sixteen but before 2016 I never even did
that I never talked to people like John
Samas and and did what they did and did
was as far as like talking about you
know things and answering questions for
people I actually like that a lot but I
like doing all of it I like doing the
tutorials I like talking about tech
because I have a general interest in it
and I also like helping other people and
I do like making money on on the the
channel where I can but I don't know man
the point is is that if you're gonna try
to do something make sure it's a benefit
to whatever your audience is because
nothing anything short of that is just
not gonna work long term anyway guys let
