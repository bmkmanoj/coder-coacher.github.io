tonight I was playing with a framework
for the first time and I've I've heard
about this for a long time but I've just
recently decided to give it a shot
tonight and what it is it's the Python
tornado framework and tornado has been
around for quite some time but what it
is it's it's a essentially a synchronous
Python framework that single-threaded so
basically the same thing that what
nodejs is to the JavaScript world even
though it's written in c and c++ tornado
is to the python world so it's good for
WebSockets they can handle thousands of
requests so it's non-blocking
and they'll and a lot of that entire
structure and everything is I'm still
trying to wrap my head around and grasp
it all but essentially it can do a lot
of cool things when it comes to actually
been able to pound the server with a ton
of requests without actually bringing it
to a standstill now the reason why I
decided to go ahead and play with it
tonight is number one I was born number
two I was looking for really how to use
Python with MongoDB with one of the more
modern frameworks but one of the issues
that I've had in the past is that I'm a
big fan of Django and when I use Django
there's like supposedly MongoDB support
but Django goes back all the way to like
2005 or 2008 or something like that but
it's completely built around a
traditional relational database and with
no sequel you have documents it's all
like this you know Jason's syntax and it
just doesn't really work with the
relational authentication models and
everything that Django has out of the
box and to be honest with you if you
don't have Django admin then I think
that you know Django brings a lot to the
table with its templates and everything
else but with the Django admin it makes
things so much easier when it comes to
administration because that's usually
the headache that keeps me going back to
Django whenever I try to move away from
it so you know recently I've looked at
Meteor I've looked at flasks nodejs and
a lot of that stuff I end up having to
write a lot of the administration
authentication pieces that I really
don't enjoy writing at all so anyway I
just thought maybe there's there's
something you know a little bit easier
something that you know I can maybe
introduce MongoDB in the Django and I
mean I've looked into that a little bit
but it seems like that's gonna be a big
headache so really tonight I decided to
give a tornado a shot and what I have so
far is I really like what I'm seeing so
tornado in case you guys don't know is
here's the website here it's a Python
web framework in a synchronous
networking library originally developed
by FriendFeed so it uses non-blocking
network IO which is the same thing as
node and then it says tornado can scale
to tens of thousands of open connections
making it ideal for long polling
WebSockets and other applications that
require a long live connection to each
user so that is kind of the rage of the
web right now so a lot of the two-way
chat communication you're seeing like
WebRTC WebSockets with html5 all that
stuff is relatively new and if you want
to actually be able to utilize that type
of thing
tornado is really a good option because
it's really slimmed down compared to
something like flask or tornado in fact
it doesn't even use a whisky file at all
in fact you can use whiskey with tornado
but it's actually not recommended so
there's all kinds of cool stuff that I'm
trying to learn with tornado here but
let me just show you what I was able to
do just and give it an example here so I
have very similar to how like a Django
project is structured I went ahead and
created a URLs file so I'm in the
process of a process of actually
creating my admin and what I'm gonna do
is try to actually introduce react to
all of this stuff where react just takes
the JSON data which is really good for
you know what this project is basically
delivering J
and data from MongoDB and I'm gonna have
react try to build the UI now I haven't
gotten there yet I just started playing
with this I literally only spent like an
hour just kind of learning the ropes of
this but I have this URLs file and then
you have so this is my attempt at making
an admin and I just kind of implant I'm
playing around for right now but
basically what I'm doing in my admin is
I'm just using some basic JSON files
that come with Python and I create this
this handler and the handler is actually
looking at all the collections and your
MongoDB data file then it's actually
just returning it all as one big and
Jason Reed so here's an example and like
right now there's only one particular
record and only one collection named
bands so what this is actually going to
do is it's going to return all the
collections that you have so similar to
Django's admin where it actually you can
view all of the different data models
inside the file I was thinking about
doing something similar to that but
obviously it's all being returned is
this just JSON data and then I'll use
react to build like an admin type of
thing for it at least that's my plan so
far so it that's what it does right here
goes through it reads all the
collections and it builds JSON files
based on the collection names now I have
a controller file and with Django a lot
of the criticism because it's an MVC but
technically it's a Model View template
but everything typically follows the
Model View controller so like with MVC
you have a controller file that actually
looks at the requests and hits up the
database and stuff like that so that's
actually what I'm doing here so I kind
of created a controllers file instead of
a fuse file to be more in line with the
MVC architecture but this is the same
thing as what you saw with the admin
essentially is that you have these
different endpoints and then the
endpoints are doing different things
here like in this particular case it's
actually querying MongoDB and it's
looking for the name that gets passed in
so to give an example of that
so what I could do is I could put in a
get ban by name and I passed in just say
similar to it very similar to Django or
flasks that you use a regular expression
so it's capturing this value that you
pass in and what I do is I in my urls
file that it's doing it here so it's a
regular expression capturing the
characters that are passed in calls get
banned by name which is in my controller
down here and I have get banned by name
and then you pass in the name down here
and then I'm just actually querying the
MongoDB collection and I'm finding the
the matching result and then returning
it back as JSON data so that's why you
can see that it finds the one record
that's in here and if I put something
else and it wouldn't find it it's no
alright and then the final thing I want
to show you guys is that similar to any
sort of like flask or Django you always
specify your templates directory well
it's the same thing with tornado you can
actually have a templates directory and
you can see here this is actually where
I'm doing this now normally you would
probably want to you like move this to
the main file I called it main but this
is essentially like the settings file of
Django and this is where I'm actually
making my connection to MongoDB and then
passing the DB instance around to any
files that need to query the DB and this
tells what port to listen on and
everything and and this is just telling
it to continue the endless loop to
continue listening and when it's not
blocking that means they can take as
many requests as possible or as you want
I mean eventually you're gonna have
things that bog it down like hitting up
the database and all the other stuff but
you know ultimately it's non-blocking
and that's the rage these days so anyway
so what we're having here is that we
have in this particular handler and like
I said this should probably be moved to
Maine but it's loading in the template
directory and then it actually loads the
template file and then it generates it
and similar to how we pass data down to
the
and Django you do something similar like
that with the way that the templates
work here and that's that you pass in
just the you know the key value pairs
like this in the generate statement you
could also pass a dictionary to I
believe but then alright so here's just
the title so if I go to my into my my
template it's very similar as far as
being block title you know and then you
have welcome to this mug name and then
the title so if I went and I viewed that
you can see that it's passing in the
value here and then the titles up here
as well so the reason why something like
this excites me personally is number one
I like how easy tornado is it's a very
simplistic thing I like the fact that it
has a lot of like you know what node
brings to the table except it's written
in Python and even though I like
JavaScript Python is a blast to write
code and compared to like c-sharp
c-sharp can be great too because of some
of the tools I mean don't get me wrong I
like all these languages but there is
something about Python that I love I've
always used Python it was the first
language I started with I'm considered a
senior c-sharp programmer and foreigner
at large enterprise company and do a lot
of c-sharp work but Python just you know
I love working with it so basically I'm
always going to have a love for Python I
always recommend it I think it's a great
first language I think it's a great
language to do a lot of stuff with but
this is a project that I think deserves
more attention we've seen a popularity
with flask and everybody's like well
Django's who you know there's too much
stuff going on with Django and
everything and then people are like well
with you know flask in there but flask
is built on the work zhuge engine and
all this stuff and tornado is its own
separate project which is I don't know I
think it has a lot going for with the
fact that it's actually super quick
nowadays all you really want your server
to do is pass around JSON data it
obviously has to handle some like
authentic a
and everything and that's something I'm
gonna play with this particular
framework I'm gonna try to add in some
authentication to it and everything but
you know ultimately you want JSON data
and and you wanted your server to be as
lightweight as possible so it's fast and
it can handle as many requests as you
want and then you can have you know
client browsers using something like
angular or react or backbone or knockout
or whatever it is you want to use to be
able to take that JSON data and go ahead
and build your UI from it so let me know
if anybody is interested in this project
this is something that basically I'm
just going to be working on just to play
around with hopefully I can stay
motivated on it and I probably posted to
github in case you guys are interested
but I want to play around with it some
more my goal is to have a application
that somebody can just easily install
have an admin already working where at
least they can see the data and
manipulate data that they already have
and then as far as you know also make it
more modular as well so that way you
know each app and your project has its
own controllers and its own URLs and all
its stuff similar to Django and then
from there I mean honestly like having a
slimmed-down fast a synchronous
non-blocking Python back-end sounds
really exciting to me I really feel like
it would be cool to be able to do that
and hopefully you know maybe there's
other projects out there that are also
doing this but I'm not really sure of
that at the moment but even if they are
I still want to do this just for my own
learning and I thought that you guys may
want to check out tornado so that's what
I'm sharing this anyway guys thanks for
watching and have a good day bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
