brought to you by deaf Mountain coding
boot camp make sure you guys check them
out if you're interested in going to a
coding boot camp they're doing all kinds
of courses nodejs you're gonna learn how
to use repositories like it and things
like that so everything you need to be
able to gain the necessary skills to be
able to get your first job and Industry
so check them out links in the
description tab below so since this is a
programming channel I'm going to talk
about what it's like to be a programmer
and in eight years of doing this this
job I can tell you that I'm still
actually happy being a developer it's
the best job I've ever had probably
because I'm paid pretty pretty pretty
well for it but you know even if the
money wasn't quite there I could
probably yeah I could probably make less
and still be happy doing what I do but
with IT information technology there's
just it's it's a great career to be in I
can honestly say eight years into this
gig like I would definitely do it all
over again so when I say that you guys
out there should probably be trying to
do it like if it is your cup of tea like
you like to try to solve these problems
and you feel good about figuring things
out because that's really a big part of
being a programmer and I really think
you know being a successful happy
programmer is is is having those moments
of like wow I cannot believe I just
wrote that shit I remember I did a video
about eight months ago and and at the
time it was it was you know not a very
good time but for me personally but I
remember saying that I just wasn't
excited about the projects and things
that I've been working on and that at
one point I was talking about how I used
to be able to look at the code and you
used to be a look at my progress and I
would be like I can see that progress
was being made and things like that and
I would look at code that I wrote and be
like wow I can't believe I wrote that
and that was something that happened
like pretty frequently when I was first
starting you know getting started
programming especially in like the first
couple years like that was like almost
like a daily basis type of thing or even
a weekly basis depending on how big the
project was but I would just look back
and be amazed at what I've done and I
think that's normal and as I started you
know advancing I think that that happens
a little bit less less frequently and
but the thing is is it does still happen
and like I think that that I'm still a
happy program because I actually do have
that like over the last like few months
I can name like several projects and
thing
that I've done where I'm like yeah I'm
happy with that that's awesome
another little side thing that I want to
mention I thought was funny this I got
this email from this guy he's probably I
don't know what his intentions are or
whatever but like the dudes like you
have all this talent to teach people how
to code and all this stuff like let's go
ahead and make courses on you to me
which you guys know my history that you
know they were stealing from me
but yeah make courses on udemy and he's
like and I could market it for you and
all you have to do is produce courses we
can make millions and I'm like why the
fuck would I work with you dude I mean I
can understand if you're like Steve Jobs
do bill it's like it's like if I'm not
marketing then what the hell have I been
doing on this channel for the last three
and half years like this is personal
marketing people are subscribed to Chris
heart like I don't know that you could
market something any better and I wasn't
even intentionally marketing it but I
just thought it was funny like there is
always somebody out there trying to get
over on somebody else like it's just in
that particular case I can understand
like like a Google partnership like
maybe like Sergey Brin and Larry Page
Larry Page really had the knowledge and
everything I'm sure Sergey was also
brilliant they were both going there
were PhDs and everything but you know
when you think about Google like Google
you to me like when i when i read the
book of like Googleplex things like that
I look at Larry Page as being like you
know Google doesn't happen without Larry
Page Facebook doesn't happen without
Mark Zuckerberg like it there's like I
think Google might happen without Sergey
Brin sorry I think that's the case but
that and I you know but again like
there's like certain I'm sure that that
Sergey brings a tremendous amount of
marketing talent and things like that in
this guy's case like this stage is
randomly reaching out to me across the
email and basically saying hey why don't
I do all the work doing exactly what I'm
doing now and then I'll just pay him
half of everything I'm working for
because I can't market my own stuff
that's funny but anyway as far as udemy
is concerned I'm actually curious
because I'm about to start pounding out
some tutorials I've been taking I took
about a year off of these tutorials I
just I was burned on it like I was
burned out a little bit now I miss it I
want to get back into it I'm gonna start
pumping out mad shit like I really am I
want to know from you guys like start
giving me some technologies
like that maybe I should start looking
into if you guys have suggestions but
I'm gonna start pumping out tutorials in
the difference between this time and
other times it's like number one the
tutorial is going to be finished before
I release it I'm not gonna have any of
this half-finished shit because I've
done that several times and there's
going to be like a general purpose of
each tutorial it's not gonna be learning
basic syntax things like that and it's
not like this is new but clearly like
certain people like to learn from me and
I feel like I have an opportunity to
really try to drive that home and I just
haven't and I've sat on the fence for
last year and part of that is because
like I am a developer I actually go to
work every day and what is that like
like it's it's stressful as hell
sometimes not all the time
I love my job but there are certain days
where like you come home you don't want
a code you don't want to do a YouTube
video like if I would do a YouTube video
but lately like I've been trying to edit
a little bit more and I just feel like
it's getting harder for me to release
stuff but I feel like some of that is
just maybe me being just too overly
critical because I hate saying certain
things that like are wrong or like like
if I go I know that I ramble and Mom and
just kind of ramble on sometimes and I
know some people dig it some people
don't
for the most part if I had time I would
probably try to like clean all that up
but I really don't so until I do do
something like this full time I really
just have to do the best that I can with
the time that I have and then hope for
the best and ultimately that's what's
worked so far and that's what I plan to
do moving forward but as far as the
tutorials I'm definitely coming out of
retirement I miss it I want to get back
out there and I'm just going to do the
best job I can I'm going to release them
they're either gonna be popular they're
not some probably will some probably
won't maybe they all won't maybe they
all will I have no idea but that's
that's what my plan is right now that's
what I've been wanting to do I got a new
office - I'm not sure if you guys see
this um I was going to do a video where
I actually showed you because I have
like the entire like anyway just new
office I'm like trying to switch things
up and it's just I'm basically ready
like I've been I've been getting
prepared to really start trying to amp
this thing up
and and I think I'm just about there
it's funny with YouTube like YouTube I
think sometimes makes people lose lose
their minds or maybe people are just
naturally losing their minds and then
like YouTube is just kind of like
showcasing it and highlighting it but
like I can think of some prominent
youtubers right now like a gray day
under a still not back man the dudes
been gone for like an entire year he's
like fighting this depression and just
cannot make videos like so in my case
like I'm just busy and that's what
actually prevents me from from doing
videos but like in his case like he
really couldn't do it then you look like
somebody like Eli the computer guy
always bitching about YouTube in the
algorithms on stuff and I understand
because he makes his bread and butter on
YouTube and like he probably thought
that he was on his way to being like
hugely successful only to find out that
YouTube just isn't really the platform
that's gonna reward people with a you
know a lot of money basically I mean you
could have a hundred thousand followers
like I do and you're not gonna make a
living on this shit good luck getting a
hundred thousand followers by the way
that shit took a long time for me other
people can do it really quick and and
Google's really weird about how certain
people can blow up and certain people
don't and things like that there's a lot
of like I think human tinkering and
bullshit going on with those algorithms
like no doubt but I'm not gonna I'm not
gonna bitch about YouTube anymore like
I've been affected by just like
everybody else I mean but it's really
not that big of a deal to me because I
don't rely on it a hundred percent but I
could imagine though if I did then I'd
be pretty pissed off but anyway I do
want to I want to get back out there
guys uh I'm going to be making these
tutorials I know I have a knack for it a
little bit and and I was getting better
at it and uh and that's what I'm gonna
do so make sure you guys subscribe for
more videos alright take care of bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
