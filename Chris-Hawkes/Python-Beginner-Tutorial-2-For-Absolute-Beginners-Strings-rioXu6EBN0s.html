second video and in the last video we
created this program I showed you guys
how to get Visual Studio code set up and
this this should be actually
multi-platform so it should work on Mac
and Linux so if it doesn't I'd be
surprised because that was like the
whole touting feature of Microsoft
coming out with this new product anyway
so a lot of you know tutorials they're
going to jump into like what is a string
and what is an integer and all this
other stuff and I'm not actually going
to get into all of that right now
because it really just doesn't I feel
like that the concept doesn't matter to
somebody that's beginning programming so
instead what I want to do is just I'm
going to focus on the string because the
string I think is one of the few that is
really important
Python can do math and stuff like that
but a lot of you guys may not be jumping
into immediate math with Python and then
they're still going to be this
disconnect where you're like okay I can
use Python like a calculator but now
what am I supposed to do one of the
hardest things for me when I was first
starting programming is to actually see
the bigger picture like why do I need a
string why is it even called a string I
can't tell you why it's called a string
but I can tell you a string is a type in
every programming language that you're
ever going to see probably so it's just
a series of characters and it doesn't
even matter it doesn't even like the
characters can be actual letters they
can be numbers but it's it's if you're
just starting out you're like why you
telling me this dude but anyway let me
show you an example in Python in order
to assign values you're going to use
things called variables and variables
can be any name that you want them to be
so my variable this variable has an
underscore in it that's what this
character is here it's an underscore
that's considered a legal variable in
fact it's actually a normal-looking
variable in Python a lot of places and a
lot of languages they'll have you do
stuff like this where you'll say my
variable
and that's also valid as well but a lot
of people they separate the first word
which is my and then the second word
which is variable with a capital letter
here and this is actually called camel
case but you don't have to deal with any
of this shite either so don't even worry
about it
we're just going to say my variable
equals and we're going to say this is a
string so we saw this in the last video
but the reason why strings are important
is because anytime you read a file it
could be an HTML file it could be data
like that you're grabbing from a
database it's going to be in string
format and you have to know that ok how
do I take two strings and add them
together and stuff like that there are
certain rules that you have to follow
when it comes to dealing with strings so
we could say my variable and we'll say
another one my second variable equals
this is some more stuff
now here's two simple strings and what
do I do if I want to actually combine
these two together so we're going to
actually do this now we're going to say
my combined variable equals my variable
and you can see that the editor actually
tells you little options that you have
so it says my oh you mean my variable
right or one of these other ones but
we'll click on my variable plus and this
is just the actual plus keyword just
like addition and we say my second
variable and if you want you could just
press the Enter button and it should
finish typing for you all right so now
if we want to say I want to print the
this value to the console which is down
here in our debug console we just use
the print keyword in Python so say my
combined variable press ctrl s to save
your file and one of the things you'll
notice up here when the file is unsaved
this little circle appears over there if
I hover over it the X shows up but don't
hit the X because it will close out your
your script without saving it but you
can see this little circle means you
have unsaved changes so if I hold down
control and s
now that circle goes away and it's saved
so if I run this program I'm going to
just go ahead and press play and you can
see that it combined these two strings
into one statement but you're going to
see this funniness where it's like
there's no separation between this first
variable and this second variable
there's no separation so you're like
well why is that well you could do this
if you wanted to when you're combining
strings you could say you know what I'm
going to have another string that's just
this empty these these empty values here
and if I did that and I run this another
thing too is I think if we press a F oh
wait I'm sorry there's we have a this is
a syntax error so this is good because
anytime you do something bad and Python
it's going to tell you what is where is
the problem at it says hey I ran into a
problem on line five so we can look at
line five and say okay there's some
problem here what is the problem the
problem is we said my variable plus and
then we have to set this string right
here which remember these are just
strings as well but this is a string
with no characters except for just a
space but then look we say my second
variable so the problem is is we need
the plus sign for every every adding you
know every time we add a new string to
another string we always have to have a
plus that's separating the previous
string to the string that you're adding
so it can go in a line you could have
literally hundreds of strings that
you're all joining together just like
this and realistically you probably
wouldn't but if you press f5 I think
it's f5 it should automatically run the
program again but I'm just trying to
remember if that's the case it might be
ctrl f5 or maybe I have no idea what I'm
talking about
we need to kill the program so we can
put press shift f5 to stop the program
or you can just click the little stop
button it doesn't matter but if I press
control f5 and
should run so that runs I'm thinking the
control is necessary I don't it doesn't
matter but anyway you can see we now
have a space here so this is that that
space that we added right here so the
proper term for this in the computer
programming geek world is string
concatenation so they call it concat
which is like short Co in CA T or
concatenation that's it's really short
for concatenation but it's concatenate
combining this stuff together and you're
going to hear people use that term and
you just have to get used to it it's
it's unusual for sure let's go ahead and
stop the program so one of the concepts
here that I want to get across with you
guys is that these are variables and
they're whatever name you want them to
be so we just we created this arbitrary
name but there are certain things that
you can't do number one you can't put
numbers in front of your variable it has
to be a character it could be an
underscore if you wanted to but you
can't have numbers you can see it
instantly turns red says hey man you
can't do that so don't do that
also when you're using Python just go
ahead and use this underscore convention
for the most part for any of your little
variables that you're going to have
that's what most Python programmers do
you don't have to but that's probably a
good idea to write code the way other
Python programmers do in case you start
working with other ones or trying to
help them with like their github
projects and stuff another thing too is
that there is these reserved words that
mean certain things in Python one of the
reserved words the only one that we've
looked at so far is the print keyword
and you can see if we highlight over
this this actually tells you a bunch of
stuff that doesn't make a whole lot of
sense to you but it's like prints the
values too extreme or 2's YS USD or
tv-out
all this stuff is very complex and
confusing but basically programming
languages that go out this sis that it
stands for standard out and it just
means print it to the damn console you
know whether it's in an ms-dos or you
know this debug console down here that's
all that's what
it's a system out so print will put
whatever sort of string that's in here
to system out now and we'll see in the
future it doesn't have to be a string
there are other types in Python that are
not string so you're not going to use
strings for everything but strings will
be a very very very very common thing
now there's other types of reserved
words in fact this is the quickest
documentation I can find which is on New
Mexico Tech but you know this goes all
the way back to Python 2 7 which is
literally a decade old probably at this
point and these are all like words that
you're going to see in the Python
language that you can't use this
variable name so you never want to
overwrite any sort of variable name with
one of these because that would be a
major problem so here's this print
keyword that you can see which we've
used so there's not a ton of words you
can't use but basically I never want to
be like print equals I just effed up
because I just assign print a new value
which I don't need that in there yeah I
could have that in there that's fine
I'll do that alright so now if I said
print let's see what happens actually
I'm interested I've never tried this
before
okay string object is not callable
because what we did and you can see STR
is short for string and that's what
we've been talking about it says tight
air because remember I called string a
type there's different types in Python
and string it's just one of several
types in Python but types in any
programming language is something that
you don't need to understand right now
but it's very it's very important to how
programming languages are actually
created you often hear about type
systems and its type safe and all this
other stuff you don't have to worry
about that right now if you're just
getting and getting started but that's
what it's telling you it's saying hey
there's a type error problem because
print no longer does anything special
like we saw we overrode print and we
print no longer has its meaning it's a
string and we're now trying to call a
string like it's a function and that's
something that we're going to look at as
well in future videos but this print is
really just a Python function it's part
of the Python standard library for every
Python installation it comes with a
print and print like like we saw before
it really tests and whatever is in there
inside these parentheses to the standard
output so now that we've changed what
print is we turned it to a string and
now it doesn't have any idea what we're
trying to do here and that's why line
number nine is where the program error
is out so understanding how to read what
these errors are they're called trace
back errors is it's actually a skill
that takes years to develop in order for
you to be like okay that's exactly what
the problem is there's going to be times
that when you're a new developer where
you might spend like an hour trying to
figure out why doesn't this work what
does this mean and then as you have some
experience you're like oh yes this
object is not callable so this means
that there's no function here this it
has no idea what you're trying to do
here we take print out though we press
ctrl f5 to run the program again and you
can see it works just fine because we
didn't overwrite print
all right now I also want to be
practical about you know why something
like this because once again one of the
hardest parts is how all of this stuff
comes together because individually you
can look at these concepts and be like
well this isn't complicated at all but
then you wonder how does something like
this turn into something like YouTube
how were they using simple commands like
this to build a website like YouTube how
is the the Python like how does
Instagram run on the Django web
framework which is really just Python
code to do everything that Instagram
does and the answer to that actually is
that Instagram and everything it does is
not all Python but most of its
server-side processing and stuff is so
as you'll learn there's different
languages and technologies that are used
for different reasons and you'll have to
forgive me if I have a weird voice by
the way I have a cold and it's really
bothering me
so now raw and uncut I don't want you to
have to worry about anything that I'm
doing right here but I want to show you
the benefit of a string so we're going
to leave my variable here we're going to
change its content in just a second but
I want to show you why a string could be
you know used as something that does a
little bit more than you may think
and we're going to say you know what
we're going to say my out file in fact
you know we're going to say my HTML file
equals open and this is another Python
keyword here open and then we tell it a
path and once again you don't know any
of this stuff I don't expect you to like
even be able to follow along on it but I
do need to know where I actually put
this on this tutorial here because I
need to know to reference and I forget
already where we put it
and the answer that question is we put
it in this Python for beginners so
Python for beginners ok so that's
actually what I'm gonna do here Python
for beginners and I'll just say my HTML
file about HTML and then I pass in this
additional keyword which means right and
then we're going to say my HTML file dot
write my variable okay and now instead
of this I'm actually going to put actual
HTML in here and we're going to say
title look at this title actually that
needs to be inside of a head too so this
is just HTML guys so anytime you go to a
web page you're going to see this type
of HTML in there although this is very
kind of raw and uncut I'm just putting
in some stuff in here so we can actually
see the example and I want to put a just
a title in here and we'll say hello
world all right so this is uh this is
all string guys and it's in HTML format
and we're telling it to write to a file
and putting it in this directory right
here and this w means write a new file
if it doesn't exist because if the file
existed we can actually put different
commands in there let's say I want you
to append the file or add to what's
already there and W actually will wipe
it out every single time it writes a new
file so that doesn't matter anyway I'm
gonna press ctrl f5 to actually run this
program and when it's done
I don't think we're nothing is going to
print to the console or anything so it's
not going to look like it did too much
and now it looks like it was still
thinking but it actually didn't take
that long off but now look what we have
here we have in our Python from
beginners folder we now have this my
HTML file so Python created this file
and then look at the file type because
it's a dot HTML file that Python wrote
you can see that it wants my chrome can
open it because my chrome is my default
browser so if I double click on this and
we'll say Chrome and let me show this so
you can see this is actually referencing
right there and we have hello world so
let's look at and you can even see in
the title up here at the top it says
look at this so if we look at the source
you can see it's just our HTML and the
browser knows how to render it so it
could get even more complex obviously
like if I said let's put an anchor
inside here and we'll say AHAR equals
calm all right so it's go ahead and run
this again control f5 and all I did was
add an anchor tag which is just another
HTML thing if I pull this up
I don't think it's safe in one second it
didn't run so I'm pressing ctrl f5 to
run it again alright so now when we look
at the result you can see that we have
this anchor click me and if I click it
it actually takes you to hipster comm
which is a website that I created this
is also a Python website that is all
Python code that's being used to run
this in fact you can take the quiz and
I'm going to make this free I was
actually charging for the quizzes but I
don't do that anymore
I actually I haven't made it free yet
but nobody's really using the website
very much so
that was only charged either it was like
5 or not $10 but yeah nobody bought it
anyway I just thought maybe you know
people would be interested but they
don't care and since they don't care
I'll just make it free everything else
is free right but you can see that it's
just there's actual quizzes and stuff
like that that are available but this
entire website was built with a Python
and Django so you know some of these
examples once again I know I'm jumping
in fast and you guys might be like whoa
what's going on but you know what this
is the kind of practical stuff that I
think people need to kind of swallow
because like a string alone one of the
problems like I said is like okay I
understand the concept of the string but
I don't really understand how a string
helps me create an HTML page I don't
understand how I can read an HTML page
into a string because in the same way
that I actually wrote an HTML page I
could actually use Python to go to any
web site across the web get their HTML
source page and then use Python to start
looking for values inside of here in
fact that's what Google search engine
did it was originally written in Python
and it went from one site to the next
and then it evaluated its content and it
did it in a way that was more efficient
than other browsers at the time and now
you know you look at you fast forward to
today and Google is making 21 billion
dollars a year in profit and they did it
all on the back of Python initially and
you know and that's another thing too so
a lot of you guys are like you know I'm
older I'm just getting in the program
and all that stuff
I'll tell you what you know there's
going to be there's going to be
fantastic programmers in this world and
I may not be one of them but what what
matters though is that do you have the
drive to continue to succeed and try
when you start failing you know you
maybe take a break for a moment and come
back you keep trying because you got to
keep trying and programming things are
going to be difficult for you but I
don't think there's any sort of age
limit or educational requirement or
anything else that tells you whether or
not you can solve a business problem if
you have a business mind and you know
how to you know maybe gain a decent
amount of knowledge in programming you
don't have to write the next face book
in order to make you know decent money
you don't have to be an expert
programmer creating some of these
fantastic frameworks that are being you
know developed by Facebook and Google
and all those guys you can be successful
in this industry with just hard work
determination and just having a decent
understanding of how to solve business
problems with programming code so once
again I know this example might have
gotten into a lot with the whole opening
file and all stuff we're going to look
at all that stuff more in the future but
just you know right now this was just to
simply tell you you know this is one
specific you know use case for what a
string can do it can write files and and
anyway guys let me know what you think I
appreciate you watching I'm going to go
ahead and cut this video off and I plan
on continuing this series I'm glad
people are excited for it I'm actually
excited for it myself
I really thank Microsoft and Visual
Studio code because I love this editor
and the person who created this Python
extension I love that guy too
you know he makes it so much easier for
me to be able to train some of this
stuff because my earlier Python videos
some of the biggest problems that I had
was just simply getting past the initial
setup phase like it sucks balls trying
to get you know somebody to okay you got
to install Python now you got to
understand what a system path is and how
to add Python and you need to then you
know download some freaking text editor
install these plugins and all that stuff
and it's
so much to swallow if with Visual Studio
code hopefully it's as simple as install
Python install Visual Studio code add
the Python extension and things just
work hopefully that's working for you
guys and let me know if you have any
questions and once again thanks for
watching please subscribe and have a
good day bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
