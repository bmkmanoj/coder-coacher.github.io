just want to touch on the Python
anaconda project and the reason why you
want to use it is I think there was some
confusion at one point it was funny
somebody had actually said a joke
because they're making fun of me about
using Python they say how so the next
big thing is Indiana Conda they were
just being an idiot but turns out there
is an anaconda project and it's been
around for quite some time and the
reason why we have anaconda is because
without it you run into situations like
this where I was looking at this Astra
pea project which deals with Astro
astrology things like that and Python
uses numpy for numerical computations
and things like that I was just going to
play around with it see if I could get
it working but I do the traditional pip
install for asked repeat which which
work just fine until you go to actually
import it and then you get a numpy
version error so that's mainly to do
with the fact that I'm on Windows and
Windows just doesn't mesh well with a
Python
you know Python basically if you're
going to be doing some hardcore Python
programming you're probably not going to
doing in Windows but Windows for the
most part is still capable but it is a
it's definitely a hindrance and you know
tonight just is a hindrance and not
being able to use this particular
library because you know I've run into
some situation that is fully related to
being on a Windows environment so in
order to solve that problem especially
for newbie developers that are trying to
get into some of the latest computation
big data projects like graphing and
things like that that Python has to
offer it's just easier to install
anaconda and go from there so first
things first you just have to go to the
down the anaconda website which is
created by this a continuum company and
it's completely free and it's BSD
license so when you go to download it
you can download the Installer and now
this thing is like 358 megabytes but it
also has everything that you need in
order to get up and running with a lot
of these popular projects so it's a
rather large program like 1.8 gig or
something like that but once you have
that up and running then you're going to
have this Anna
the Navigator that you can use to
install packages and libraries that you
want to mess with like here you can see
spider which is a Python development
environment
it's an IDE actually so there's
different things that the Navigator
allows you to do but in addition to that
it also allows you to use a console
based installer which is called Conda
and just like you do pip install butts
with whatever sort of library you're
trying to use by installing anaconda
here you'll be able to use Conda to say
Conda install so and so now I just
installed this anaconda version so you
would think that if I went ahead and I
opened up the command prompt and I'm
just going to go into my projects I'll
just make her okay so Boca is a Python
library that deals with charting and
things like that
why'd I do that all right now what I'm
going to do is a run Conda install Bo
when I even spelled that wrong R it's
okay I know I didn't start wrong it's
okay so now by using Conda because I
installed anaconda I have this this this
new installer which makes things much
easier and it actually deals a lot of
the headaches you normally deal with
with Windows and such you have that
being dealt with for you here so
definitely recommend it even though it
might install more than you need not
having enough is certainly a pain in the
ass
especially on Windows now from the the
Boca let me go ahead and run ties on
here
actually I'm going to paste this entire
thing
as I or so this
all right the easier way to do this is
just going to be able take my editor I'm
going to open up the folder that we just
created
and I'm using Visual Studio code which
is a free editor by the way so here I'll
create a start that py file just for
Python
all right and this is from the boca
documentation so i just pasted this in
and if everything works well this should
be able to create an HTML file from
wherever it's run so i could go here and
you can see it's right back to say
python start py r I should just go say
star dot py and the pythons on your
command line then it should know how to
run that
all right and then by running that it
actually automatically opens up the web
browser to this lines dot HTML you can
see that we have this this chart graph
here based on the data that we supplied
to it so you can see that we have just
two two lists here with some numbers and
and then the output file and up here is
where all the magics happening where we
were able to install Boca using anaconda
and then here is actually showing the
results and if we look inside of our
folder you can see that the lines that
HTML file is created for us so that's
how we actually get started with the
Boca project and Python and it's one of
the many benefits of using something
like anaconda because if you start
getting into like numpy or you want to
use astro pee or anything like that it's
just easier to go the anaconda route
all right guys um thanks for watching me
hey guys so a lot of you asked me how do
I get my foot in the door to become a
programmer and I just want to take a
moment to mention dev Mountain coding
boot camp is a 12-week intensive course
that focuses on the technologies of the
here and now for web development some of
the things that they're actually
teaching in this 12-week course it's
geared to get you into the industry by
focusing on things like jQuery nodejs
react angular how to use github so a lot
of the things that you're going to need
to do as a developer as soon as you
start they're going to be teaching you
in this and this coding boot camp and
the entire goal is to be able to get you
into the industry within 12 weeks so if
you guys are interested in learning more
information about Deb mountain coding
boot camp just check out the link in the
description tab of this video thank you
for watching and have a good day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
