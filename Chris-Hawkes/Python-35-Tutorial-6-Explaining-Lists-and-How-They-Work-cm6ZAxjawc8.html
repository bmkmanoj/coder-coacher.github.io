video we touched on all the the quick
quick and dirty on the value types at
Python house and we didn't go over all
of them but we went over a lot of the
main ones we left off three very
important ones that we're gonna get into
in the next three videos the first one
we're going to start with is lists and
lists are so important in Python they're
very flexible things we're going to
create a list by using square brackets
that's how you do it in Python so when
we go ahead and we print type what type
is this and remember we have to put that
in parenthesis and what type is this is
a just a variable which is a of type
list so we'll see that here in a moment
and you'll see that's a of type list in
Python so it's a list object list
objects are just containers they're
boxes they can hold stuff and in Python
they can hold whatever the hell you want
them to hold they can hold webpages they
can hold millions of webpages it can
hold an entire library and each and each
object is a book which could be some
humongous string or something like that
it could be a list that holds lists so
here's a second list right second list
is this so I could say okay you know
it's kind of confusing I say second list
over here so I could have second list
inside of the first list I'm also
breaking my naming convention as well so
I should get rid of the camel case
I'm teaching you guys bad Python ways
this is the way you do it in JavaScript
or or c-sharp if you were writing a
variable like that but anyway what type
of what type is this is a is a list that
actually contains another list in it
not install right so it's still just a
list so this list contains a list so a
list can contain a bunch of numbers 1 2
3 4 5
still less no it's go ahead and instead
of printing out the type we'll get rid
of the type argument and we're just
simply gonna say display the value of
this list so when we do that you're
gonna see that we have in the square
brackets it's basically just saying hey
I only have a value of 1 you know 1 list
so let's go ahead and say 1 2 3 4 5 now
you'll see this 1 2 3 4 5 and a valuable
list so it's actually really cool that
you can combine a bunch of integer
values and a list which also has a bunch
of integer value so in many cases we
could say this could be a list of movies
so like we'll go ahead with the same
thing Braveheart Forrest Gump a super
bad and then the second list is just
gonna be a bunch of integers or whatever
but this could you know be a bunch of
movies too so pineapple express Friday
you've got mail so I'm getting all kinds
of different genres in there alright so
you can see that it's just a bunch of
values now it's two lists so now what if
I just you know I could have I don't
even have to have a second list in there
but I want so I can have two different
lists so I can say what type of this and
then print this so print the second list
I'm sorry secondly the second list will
print it down here and we run this oh
god damn it
now you'll see that we have two lists so
anyway let's go ahead and get rid of
next I'll get rid of second list now
what if I wanted to know how many values
are inside of what type of list is what
you know what type of this is or what
type is this it's a horrible name
actually is not really a horrible name
just hard to say um so we have three
values in here but what if I had like a
million you know it'd be hard to count
one two three four five you know what I
mean so there is a special function
that's built into Python which I've been
saving for this moment that actually
tells us the amount of values that a
certain list has and that's called the
length function and the length function
takes the argument of whatever list that
you're passing in so let's go ahead and
do that real quick so you can see it's
three we knew it was three because it
was easy to count but would it like I
said what if we had seven hundred and
eighty seven thousand you know I mean
that's we could easily have that much
and length would easily in quickly
return however much that is so what if I
said one of the things I do want to
mention which doesn't really deviate
away from what we're doing but let's
just say we have you know this X
horrible string name like I was telling
you before but this is a string I could
actually use the length it doesn't have
to be a list length can actually return
the amount of characters that are inside
of a string so if I run this 16 gets
returned so that's just kind of a side
tangent but also kind of relevant to the
subject at hand so I wanted to make sure
I touched on that and once again as I
start typing the intellisense and Adam
is saying hey what type is this that is
that what you want press tab and that'll
automatically fill in so it's something
that we'll probably want to make sure I
really it er eight several times and
make sure you're taking advantage of
your editor now
list can be can be worked with or they
can be manipulated by using something
called an index and an index is just a
number basically if I said index 0 it's
gonna be the first value that's in the
list and the reason why is with
programming languages it's really weird
but zero is a number and they actually
start counting at zero so it takes a
long time to get used to but when you're
dealing with lists or strings or
whatever if you give it an index and let
me just give you an example we're gonna
say print the value of what is this
instead of you know just printing the
entire thing we're actually gonna give
it an index number so we're saying print
the first value because remember it
starts counting at 0 so this is 0 this
is 1 this is 2 so when we run this it's
gonna print braveheart because we said
hey just print that one we gave it an
index of just 1 and if I would have said
1 it's gonna be forrest gump because
force 1 is really two and - you know -
is really 3 because programming
languages start counting at 0 really
weird I know eventually you'll get the
hang of it same can be said for a string
I'm just going to keep this here we're
gonna call this test string equals this
is an example because these principles
don't just apply to list types they've
also apply to strings but I wanted to
save it until we talk about lists to
actually you know discuss these
confusing things so here's the first
character gets returned so let's just
give it I think there's I don't know
many characters around there but let's
give it you know 6 and what is that
gonna be that could even be a space
character we don't know yeah it's s so 0
1 2 3 4 5 6 ever seen 6 is the S there
so that is considered an index and you
always give it an index you
you do that by using the square bracket
and giving it an actual number now what
if I wanted to get the last character of
this is an example and I don't know how
many characters it has say it has 14
million I'm not going to go through and
count every single character to say hey
give me the 14th million index number
nobody's got time for that in Python
there's a shortcut where you can do
negative one and negative one is gonna
get the last value so you can see it's
an e because what it does is it actually
says hey let me start from the beginning
and go back 1 so that's actually how you
get the last value what if I said hey I
only want I only want values after the
fourth well then what I could do is I
could say 4 and then colon inside my
index number and you're gonna see it
returns everything but this because 0
and what's weird about and this is
really weird too this is gonna throw you
guys through a loop but when you do
those index values it actually counts at
once so when you're safe for it means 1
2 3 4 return everything else afterwards
that's why you saw when we ran it
there's a space so you would think that
you would do something like that and
that that would you know start counting
it at 0 and say 0 1 2 3 and then give
you the result but it actually doesn't
so that is totally confusing and I know
and it's not my fault don't blame me
it's just the way it is so that is you
know that like I said that's how it is
now what if I said I only wanted the
next 3 characters and you could actually
give it at a start and an end point and
the start and end point is not specified
by the colon so the same thing could be
said guys of
of strings which is what we were just
manipulating or lists so let's go ahead
and replace the list here and we'll see
what we got and you can see it returns
forest gum and if I want to say give me
everything after the first one it'll
return both poor scum and super bad and
if I said just give me the last element
of that list remember how to do it
negative one and that's it now one of
the things you'll notice which is weird
is that because we're only getting one
value what if I said give me give me the
type of whatever is returned by this
index this is gonna return a type string
because it's one value which is a string
totally weird now what if I say that's
actually not totally weird but this is
gonna be totally weird um what if I say
give me the values between one and two
it's a list that's something that he'll
I don't even know how to explain that
that's really weird because it's only
returning one value but it's still
considered a list because I gave it two
index numbers and I didn't give it a
specific index because the bottom line
is that this could be more than one
value it could be multiple values if it
returns more than one value it's a list
generally speaking but in this case for
some reason Python still treats this
even though only one value comes back
like if I didn't print type I'm only
gonna get one value back but because
it's not a specific index it returns it
as a list and not a single string which
is you know what that value is so those
are some you know that's a weird quirk
you probably won't run into but keep in
mind when you're saying give me you know
the start of some list and the end of
some list it's going to return it as
a new list if you say give me a specific
item in that list you know one which is
in this case is Forrest Gump it's gonna
return whatever sort of value type it is
which is Forrest Gump if I added a new
value in here and int you'll see that
it's going to return two and if I did
you know type that value at the one
index is now an integer so hopefully
that is not confusing that is
essentially how everything can be
manipulated is through these these index
values lists can store an unlimited
amount of information until your
computer runs out of memory and so I
mean you're gonna ask yourself well
lists I thought you said lists were
really cool and important well they're
very flexible in the fact that you can
store you know lists within lists you
can store different value types like
strings or integers or floats or bulls
or whatever and they're infinitely big
meaning that when I'm scraping the web
and you know I'm making money on you
know scraping data and analyzing data
and stuff like that I'm looking at
millions of webpages or in many cases
just hundreds or thousands of web pages
and I'll say okay let me go ahead and
grab all these links that I need to
visit well how am I gonna store those
links I mean am I gonna write them to a
goddamn database or something and read
them one by one I mean that would be
slow it's better to just say okay I just
I just figured out a thousand links that
I need to visit I'm gonna throw them all
into a Python list real quick and then
I'm gonna work on that list one index
value at a time and request each one of
those webpages and do some sort of work
so that's why lists are important it
could be there's a thousand documents
idea process and each one of those
documents is a value in that list and I
go through the list one value at a time
and open up the file do whatever work
needs to be done so it could be you know
gaming user clicks on
inventory I need to go through every
item in that inventory which could be
you know a list of a bunch of different
you know item types in a particular game
you know a compass and map potions
whatever so lists are important guys
they may not seem as cool with these
brief examples as I you know I explain
it to me but it is certainly important
something that you're going to use a ton
and discerning you guys get on board
with that the better so anyway guys
thanks for watching the video about the
inter doctor and introductions to lists
and we'll get into that more in the
future alright thanks for watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
