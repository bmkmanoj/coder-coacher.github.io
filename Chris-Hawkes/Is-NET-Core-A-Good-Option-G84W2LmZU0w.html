here from ash Kumar he says Chris I'd
like to hear your opinion on dotnet core
as this above linked hacker news
discussion reflects currently it seems
to be a better framework with regards to
speed quality insanity they says in
parentheses JavaScript community is a
mess while still lacking and tooling
support but that will come with time no
doubt so the dotnet framework I have
mess with that a little bit and my
opinion mainly is that I'd you know it
is it's good but especially if you're
catering towards a dotnet runtime but
when I was first getting involved in it
like over a year ago the kestrel web
server which is supposed to be the
cross-platform solution didn't really
work at least very well with a Linux
environment so I typically hosts my web
applications on a Linux server just
because it's so much cheaper like if I
compare rates with digitalocean Orla no
they are much much cheaper than
something like Microsoft Azure or Amazon
AWS or Rackspace or any of those other
major cloud providers so with net core
the reason why I would want to use that
is number one I do like to see sharp I
feel like it has a lot of capabilities
there but you're right about the tooling
being missing when I was using a
Postgres database on the.net core
application I couldn't use Postgres
because there was no database driver
created now I could obviously make one
but if I'm trying to get a project off
the ground I need a database driver in
order to be able to interact with my my
database I mean like system data which
is a major library of the.net
infrastructure and part of asp.net was
not included in net core so there were
ways of using Postgres but I would have
to use like entity framework 7 and I'm
not a huge fan of entity framework I'm
really not I think that you know it's an
object relational mapper
so it basically communicates with your
database for you but I just find it to
not be very good sometimes I want to be
able to write wrong sequel and I need a
database driver in order to build
do that and so dotnet core didn't
actually have that but this was like a
year ago already so I'm sure some
improvements are being made but you know
so far I haven't been like overly blown
away with with dotnet core I'm one of
the problems with this thing is that
like they've changed their name so many
times like this used to be called
asp.net 5 and then it was called MVC
next and then all of a sudden I went to
like asp.net core 1.0 and you know they
just keep changing the name like they
don't even know how they're trying to
brand this new Microsoft age you know
it's like I think that's been a major
detriment so far to them another thing
too is that I think it kind of like so
they're trying to come up with their own
unique spin on how you end up dealing
with packages and things like that so
they have a package Jason similar to to
how nodejs does it but I just wish
they'd follow like the exact same format
as nodejs I wouldn't try to like venture
to be different and and also nougat is a
terrible product I hate nougat nougat
doesn't work half the time it seems like
so it just sucks compared like package
managers are hard to actually drill down
though I mean maybe if we look at M p.m.
a lot of people fall 10 p.m. because of
all the different plugins and things
that are being linked to you know every
project has 15 M p.m. dependencies and
things like that or or more and yeah and
when you get you know I guess you know
they they run into similar type
situations where packages become
out-of-date you download some sort of
package and and like half the time it's
missing dependencies or that it's
linking to dependencies that have been
either deleted or modified and all of a
sudden there's just breaking problems so
I was watching a dotnet core tutorial
the other day and they had me um use
nougat to actually download like an
entire bootstrap type set up where they
were going to use I think they're they
were using a babel and all stuff so they
do you're supposed to download all these
files and and then you're supposed to
run the web pack and
when it's supposed to you know compile
down but then even the compilation
didn't work for this you know this
tutorial that was out of the box so when
you when you run into those kind of
problems like off the the you know right
out of the gate it's just like to me I
typically I might well you know I don't
feel like doing all this if you know
it's it's just basically it's cutting
edge
it's obviously trying to solidify its
documentation and things like that but
until they drill down like the branding
and then get some you know decent
documentation that's going to be up to
date then I I don't really have any need
to use that in that core at the moment
and plus the Linux um so here's like a
Linux example and things like that
well dotnet core like how am I going to
like I don't want to use sequel server
sequel server has a ridiculously
expensive licensing costs so a lot of
their you know their Microsoft stuff is
like you know they want you to use iis
and and they want you to use sequel
server and I don't want to do all that
like I just want ID and I don't want a
HelloWorld application that barely runs
you know I need I need some some solid
some solid infrastructure here I mean so
there should be more examples of how you
plug and play databases like post rest
or my sequel and not force us down some
IAS Express or is you know solution like
I want I just I I can see that already
this website has updated some some
decent you know new examples and
everything but I would venture guess
that it's still not ready for primetime
when it comes to Linux so I haven't seen
any sort of dotnet core Linux web sites
and running out there you know on a
Linux server using like Postgres or my
sequel so if I were gonna host an azure
or something like that then yes that you
know this will be a good opportunity I
think but it's gonna cost you more money
than what I pay using something like
Django or a node.js website on on
digitalocean Orla note and for that
reason I just I never really seemed to
venture down that path and I know
companies like to use Windows and IAS
and sequel server they like the
you know the added benefit of having a
major company like Microsoft when when
stuff hits the fan and that they can
call if there's you know some sort of
support problem and in companies will
always find that you know that that
shelter I guess and and for that reason
you know people that work for major
companies they're gonna be using this
type of technology for like the hacker
type community I don't see a lot of the
adoption on that core yet and I mean
we're looking at well over a year that
it's been out so we'll see what happens
but right now I'm not convinced that
it's any more relevant than you know
like Perl six basically like we talked
about it a lot and well I never talked
about Pro 6 but Perl 6 you know we
waited 15 years for Perl 6 to come out
now it's been out for like a year and
nobody's really adopting it yet so until
I actually see some companies and
websites you know posting some dotnet
core infrastructure then I don't really
have any sort of desire to jump on it
and be a guinea pig on this project ya
know not if I'm you know actually care
about the project and have to worry
about it actually working so once again
I always stay away from dotnet hosting
just cuz I hate the dotnet shared house
I really feel like there's some terrible
products out there when it comes to
dotnet and shared hosting in fact I
don't use shared hosting at all I need
to have at least a virtual private
server I don't want any sort of shared
nonsense and then with the azure cloud
like it's still very expensive and I
know there's a lot of hoops you have to
jump through and things like that so I
would I was on a on a Google App Engine
stack one time I was running a web 2 pi
or Django on a Google App Engine stack
and one time I dated I queried my
database in a very process intensive way
and I ended up running out of like all
my resources that I had for the month so
I had to enable billing in order to even
access my website because like I did
this huge sequel read that ended up like
just crushing my resources for the month
and essentially it was a database read
that cost me like $15 man on a mistake
and it's like you don't I don't deal
with that like I'm a node or
digital ocean so I don't know a man like
that for the that whole Google App
Engine experience left a bad taste in my
mouth and
and for that reason I've never hosted
any production websites in Azure or AWS
but if I were a major company I probably
would consider it but you know you know
those are my thoughts really that you
know as an individual developer that
doesn't have a whole lot of money to
spend on this stuff I'm not trying to to
pay a bit a huge premium to use dotnet
core on an azure stack so no that's
really my thoughts on dotnet core at the
moment I think their branding has been a
terrible travesty right out of the gate
so hopefully they can try to solidify
that and then get their documentation in
line to have more examples of how do I
run an actual web stack on an a bunch of
server pointing to Postgres without
using stuff like in any framework and
things like that so all that will come
like you said I think with more tooling
support but if but if Microsoft doesn't
actually provide these examples then
they have to rely on like the hacker you
know indie developer community to try to
create some of these examples make
youtube videos and things like that
and import for the most part I don't
plan on leading that effort so you know
Microsoft has never been big in the
hacker community for the last couple
decades it seems like and now they're
trying to change their ways and they're
doing a lot of good things like you know
with Visual Studio code is a really good
editor and things like that so they are
making some steps in the right direction
but I don't know that they have the
community of you know diehards that are
gonna spend all their free time trying
to show you know the rest of the world
why dotnet core is so much better than
Django or Note so we'll see what happens
but anyway guys thanks for watching have
a good day take care bye hey guys so a
lot of you ask me how do I get my foot
in the door to become a programmer and I
just wanna take a moment to mention dev
Mountain coding boot camp is a 12-week
intensive course that focuses on the
technologies of the here-and-now for web
development some of the things that
they're actually teaching in this
12-week course it's geared to get you
into the industry by focusing on things
like jQuery nodejs react angular how to
use github so a lot of the things that
you're going to need to do as a
developer as soon as you start they're
going to be teaching you in this and
this coding bootcamp and
entire goal is to be able to get you
into the industry within 12 weeks so if
you guys are interested in learning more
information about Deb mountain coding
boot camp just check out the link in the
description tab of this video thank you
for watching and have a good day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
