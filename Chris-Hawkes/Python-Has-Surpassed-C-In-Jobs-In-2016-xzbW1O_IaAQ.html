I want to show you guys and this is
something I just discovered and I'm not
even sure whether or not this is
accurate because like part of me thinks
that somehow this just isn't right but I
mean we've known for a long time the
python has been on the up-and-up when it
comes to jobs a lot more companies are
adopting it it's certainly gotten huge
in the web I mean YouTube is essentially
run by Python Google still uses Python
heavily a lot of major major websites
that have most of the traffic on the web
are using Python sites like Yelp and
read it in Instagram and many others
that they're all using Python now not
everybody uses Python obviously but
according to indeed com and this is data
from indeed com this is and they are the
number one job site and the world
apparently or at least in the United
States I know for a fact when it comes
to like job listings the amount of
traffic that people you know spend on
indeed.com but according to this python
has recently surpassed c-sharp which is
really interesting so you can see that
the green line is Python as it's
trending up and it just basically just
barely surpassed c-sharp here just
recently but you see that C sharp is
kind of on the decline and I think that
Microsoft has seen this coming for quite
some time because when it comes to like
new newbie developers everybody's
interested in Python for the most part
for this channel when I reach out and I
talk about Python I've had a lot of
interest from newbie developers it
caught my attention when I was first
getting started programming and that was
like six years ago so you know since
then we've seen now that in the debt
trend is continued and I think Microsoft
has seen it so they started you know
they open sourced their their entire
technology stack for the most part to
try to I think make themselves more
attractive in the knee open source
industry and you know they try to make
asp.net five cross platform and there's
still work left to be done there because
um you know unfortunately that that is
still not like really a production-ready
solution from what I can tell I've
messed with a kestrel web server before
for asp.net 5 and now it's just it's
really just not there yet I mean entity
framework seven works with it to some
extent but it's still
missing database drivers for post graphs
and my sequel to use just traditional a
do net so that's all dotnet speak and
everything but the fact of the matter is
that Microsoft i think is seen this
trend coming we're Python just continues
to gather more and more attention so I
find that I find that really interesting
and once again I'm not a hundred percent
sure you know how accurate these
indeed.com trackers are but what this
this data shows is that the amount of
jobs where they're looking for Python
actually exceeded the amount of jobs
where they're looking for C sharp now
one could probably say well you know how
much of this applies to the enterprise
development world like how many Fortune
500's are using Python when you look at
fortune 500 you're probably going to see
a considerable amount that are using C
sharp and Java so I don't think that
this necessarily means that enterprise
development is somehow being replaced by
Python I really doubt that's the case
but I think that I you know so when it
comes to enterprise development i think
the Java and C sharp are obviously still
probably you know very very strong but
when you have an entire ecosystem of
newbie developers that are coming up and
they like Python because it is truly
cross-platform it's free they don't have
to have like some you know you really
complex editor to be able to code in it
like visual studio or something like
that I mean I think that really that
it's a downside to you know newbie
developers when they're just getting
started they don't want to have to learn
how to use the visual studio environment
or net you know what I mean that so so I
think that this trend kind of summarizes
that I also think that the attention
that this channel has gotten with a lot
of you guys out there or Python fans
like I am and and I'm not saying that
python is better than C sharp I use both
of them I love them both but it does
make me a little proud to say that there
for a long time coming I've said hey
pythons pretty good that you know does
it solves a lot of problems it's not
necessarily the fastest line which is a
dynamically interpreted duck type
language and you know typically that's
not going to compare when it comes to
speed to a statically typed language
like C sharp or Java but the fact of the
matter is you can do a lot in Python and
some of those speed difference is that
you deal with can be made up from you
know on the back end when it comes to or
on the front end when it comes to
development
and obviously of sites like Yelp and
Instagram and read it and all these
other major sites can use Python
including YouTube like the third most
popular website in the world it is
almost entirely by a python so you know
it's capable of solving a lot of complex
problems and I think that we're seeing a
lot of the ecosystem the startup
ecosystems adopting it and one of the
benefits that python has over PHP in
Ruby when it comes to web development is
that it is in other arenas I've said
this before it's in bioinformatics and
all these other different types of
environments that you're going to see
Python being used and you won't see that
for Ruby in PHP alright guys thanks for
watching and have a good day let me know
what you think let me know how it
whether or not you think this data is as
accurate as it portrays thanks and
please subscribe bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
