a blog for the first time in a long time
actually I like doing it and I wish I
had more time to go to be honest with
you because I I think it's a somewhat
reflective or whatever anyway I just
like it I used to do it a lot don't do
it really anymore but I had this website
hipster code so I am going to write for
it every now and then hopefully more
often it's just like it like I said time
is a problem but in here I just made
simply was talking about Python versus C
so I'm just kind of being reflective
because I have a lot of like why you
should learn Python and so some videos
out there wife's and learn c-sharp and
things like that but witness this
article I basically was able to get my
thoughts down in writing and I could
have gone on for a lot longer and you
know that there may be some subsequent
articles but I basically jotted all this
down in about 15 minutes or so and
that's really all the time that I have
at the moment so I may end up you know
adding to it but I could just sum it up
by saying that when I the reason why the
Steven all came about is because of this
field the index which I've actually
linked to before Python it's c-sharp
just keep kind of changing paces and
everything like right now python is
ahead of c-sharp and a lot of dotnet
c-sharp people will probably be up in
arms about that especially because you
have visual basicnet which is right
below it which also seems to fluctuate
quite a bit I've never actually seen
Visual Basic used professionally and any
of the places that I've been everybody
seems to use c-sharp so I found that a
little interesting but I don't doubt it
or anything I mean because I don't see
Objective C either I mean if you're a
JavaScript dotnet developer then you're
typically not going to see too much
Python in a professional capacity either
so I guess we all should be like you
don't have our blinders on just because
we don't deal with a technology day in
and day out but here I go into like a
description what is Python to me pythons
way dynamically interpreted you have C
sharp which is a statically typed
language and it's compiled you know the
microsoft hololens by the way it was
sight a pretty cool project that I think
you know there's a lot of a lot going on
without men in reality not just with
Facebook's new products and
snapchat everything the Microsoft has
its hololens thing which is like going
back to the kind of this you know
eyewear thing like almost like so many
PlayStation VR oculus or even Google
glass which was a complete failure but
this has I think a little bit more
potential even than than Google glass
like if you are trying to you know give
demonstrations and things like that
problem with these headsets is they're
about $3,000 a piece or something I'm
sure the price will come down eventually
but they do look cool I mean we clearly
solve a Pokemon and everything that
augmented reality can be really really
popular obviously look at snapchat I
mean just taking photos and then having
rainbows come out of your mouth when you
open your mouth based on facial
recognition can make your website worth
twenty five billion dollars even though
you don't make any profit so there's
there's all this like you know there's
there's that technology that's in play
and everything and I think that's
interesting but going back to this like
you know what is better there really
isn't a better one like both are based
off of the C programming language both
are considered object oriented Python
can be like what perceives really
written so that it doesn't have to be
written in an object-oriented way well
c-sharp is fully object-oriented as far
as video games like there's no question
like if you're going to be a video game
developer like c-sharp is better than
then Python any day of the week the
Python doesn't have anything remotely
close to like being able to use c-sharp
with unity or even c-sharp from mono
game or even XNA the framework that came
before mono game but even other ones as
well like there was that what was that
paradox hanage and they changed our name
is something else I remember what it is
now but basically you're going to find a
lot more game engines and gaming and
things like that involving c-sharp like
with unity then you will with Python
unfortunately a lot of people like
psyched hi game and everything but PI
game is so old nobody is using plug-in
to create games man like like this joker
like this is really old then this is if
you just want to like play around with
gaming but I feel like if you're going
to put in all that effort like python is
the language that you want to choose for
that like just go ahead and start
getting into unity c-sharp maybe C++
even because like I said here I said in
either case neither competes with C++
which is control the market for complex
gaming engines and that's probably going
to stay the same for right now so clear
here like TLB has Python how to c-sharp
they keep changing back and forth and I
think it's interesting now with with
indeed.com you can see that based on
this chart here there is more job
listings for Python than c-sharp c-sharp
has just been trending downward since
like 2014 just your step is steadily
heading down and lately though they've
made some changes like that their dotnet
core dotnet core is now c-sharp I can
run on multiple platforms Visual Studio
code is one of the best products that
have come out recently for Microsoft
that actually runs on Mac Windows Linux
it's a great editor it's really pushing
Adam out of this way Avenue 7 a
stranglehold that I think on the very
slim down IDE market but the visual
studio code is completely taking that
over I see that in a professional
capacity as well beyond that you also
have actual Visual Studio which is
Microsoft's like gigantic editor which
like a lot of enterprise level like
shops are going to be using Visual
Studio and TFS and all that you know the
code testing tools and everything when
in unit mocks and most you things like
that but Visual Studio is like the the
powerhouse editor that is just a monster
for beginners to learn but it provides
like an immense amount of value to
companies that that do I to operations
Visual Studio that just recently came
out from back just a couple days ago so
Visual Studio the actual full blown
Visual Studio is available on Mac so
that's a very new thing like I said
Dominic core is now running on Mac
Windows and Linux so you have different
stacks everything I have a buddy who has
a dotnet course stack on asp.net running
on a digital ocean
droplet using MongoDB so it's definitely
moving over into like a you know across
platform language now the reason why
Python though is tradition
been partners because it's always been
cross-platform it was always installed
by default on Linux and on Mac machines
and things like that so you know
everybody that knows Python knows that
it's been around the block for quite a
while now for almost 30 years so Python
just gets the job done right so one of
the interesting things about indeed comm
and I say this to my article is like
there's 45,000 jobs right now the united
states for python while only 35,000 for
C sharp which is pretty reflective of
tob as well as the graphic chart here
for indeed calm but if you search for
things like net net has 57,000 openings
and granted some of the dotnet stuff is
for Visual Basic a lot of that and the
majority of it is going to be for
c-sharp and some people say you know
c-sharp forgotten that and they kind of
use them interchangeably
I do think C shops in a bit of a decline
but things like Dameron being purchased
in c-sharp allows like mobile apps and
things like that to be used Python
doesn't have an equivalent to xamarin
xamarin allows you to create
cross-platform at you know actual apps
like native apps for Android and iOS and
major companies are using this product
pythons alternative is key V and key V
was a buggy mess as of a couple years
ago I have invested lately but like
you're much better off with xamarin or
react native or even Kotlin at this
point if you're going to do mobile app
development in a particular language
Kotlin is something i actually when
talking about in a prius ever video as
well but all that broken down like what
do I recommend okay so it sounds like I
just I just talked up c-sharp quite a
bit there's a lot of enterprise jobs
pythons use at startup c-sharp still use
an enterprise stuff and you know like
there's obviously edge cases for both of
those but what do I recommend I
recommend starting off with Python I
started originally with Perl man Perl is
some of the most cryptic looking stuff
like you've ever seen Perl code samples
like so Carl one of the reasons why I
got away from Perlas because there were
so many different ways of accomplishing
the same thing where Python there was
like you know one write Python of way of
doing something
Perle kind of pride itself on how to be
you know it's complex and it just seems
like every time I went to try to find
some sort of solution to a problem there
was like you know it's some other way of
doing it like here's a like if you just
look at some of this code here man this
stuff is absolutely hideous out I know
people that have come from a sea
background I found pearl to be very very
easy compared to sea but it is a right
only language in my opinion this is a
very ugly kind of cryptic looking
language I'm sure a lot of pearl people
would disagree with that but I've seen
pearl I started with pearl I went to
Python Python to me just made a ton more
sense and granted to Python to a Perl
developer is going to look forward as
well as gonna look like Klingon but this
just you know the controlled whitespace
and everything else
the lack of curly braces the lack of
special characters for scalars and
arrays and things like that you know
Python just did away with all of it so
the fact that Python was created by a
mathematician whereas Perl was created
more like a linguist there's many
reasons why I took to Python and for
those reasons I recommend Python over
c-sharp because you're going to get
stuff done with Python much faster than
you will with c-sharp c-sharp is a
monster with an entire monster stack of
technology that like you have no idea
should I be using stable servers I'm
using Mongo should I be using MVC dotnet
or web forms or Chevy using different
web components should I think it's like
there's so much different stuff and like
with like but with Python it's like hey
you want to build a website whilst you
use Django or flask okay take one of
those okay now I got my stack on now I
need to figure out a deploy and so that
kind of get to beyond the scope of
Python but that's kind of where I
started man I started building websites
I started Python hipster code comm is
created in Python it's cheaper to use
it's also the most taught programming
language and all of technology schools
and things like that so here's some
books but is the book that actually got
me started learning Python so this was
one of the first books I also recommend
this Python for kids even though I've
never actually purchased this book I
have picked it up at Barnes and Nobles I
was looking at it I love the
illustrations that
it's great not just for kids but
anybody's just getting started
programming also I have my tutorial and
I can't link to it for no reason but
check out my Python for beginner
tutorial as well if you guys are
interested in that this Python for
beginners tutorial we look at this again
it has pretty good reviews and
everything heightens right back 200,000
views 1800 ops 40 down so clearly this
thing's pretty popular in fact I've had
IT schools use this professionally I had
a school University out of out of
England I should share an email I think
with you guys but anyway I gave
permission for them to be able to use my
tutorial and everything so it's actually
uh it's one of the more successful
tutorial series I've ever done but you
can also check out some of my other work
here on hipster code as well I'm going
to be adding more and more tutorials as
I get done eventually but right now as
far as pie number c-sharp I would
recommend Python starting out I think C
sharp is fantastic both are good
languages you really can't go wrong with
either one these are just opinionated
conversations but I think they're fun
conversations to have clearly I think
they also gather a decent amount of
attention because a lot of people want
to know like you know what is your
perspective in my perspective I should
have probably summed this up in there at
first it's like I've been programming in
Python for almost seven years I've been
programming professionally with c-sharp
for about five years and that all said
like I choose Python for my stack at
home because it's cheaper it's faster
for me to develop and the tools are just
in my opinion they're good enough and
fast enough for me to be able to save a
tremendous amount of money over C sharp
so that's why I do what I do and that's
why you guys got to check out my sponsor
which is dead mountain coding boot camp
because I'm going to be finishing up
this video deb mountain coding boot camp
is a twelve and sixteen week developer
boot camp which trains you in person out
of their physical locations in Dallas
Texas Provo Utah in Salt Lake City
they're owned by a very reputable
company they have very good reviews
online they aim to get your foot in the
door as a junior level developer way
an actual shop you know for web-based
technologies like shops using angular or
nodejs react and all the things that
there's just not enough skill sets out
there you know enough people in the
workforce that they're focusing on those
technologies so that you guys can go out
there and get a job and it looks much
better if you have a developer boot camp
you know on your resume than nothing at
all so definitely check them out also
