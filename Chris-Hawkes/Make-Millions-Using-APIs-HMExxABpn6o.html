this video I want to talk about the the
use of api's and this isn't something
new it's not like I'm trying to be like
hey look what I do if you know and I'm
some smart guy or something like that
because I'm totally not that's not what
this is about but one of the opinions
that I have and really it's I have an
opinion just something that's kind of
crossed my mind recently is that I've
often wondered like how do I actually
create a like if I were going to create
some sort of major project how am I
going to be able to do it one of the
things that always stops me from making
video games is that once you start
getting into the meat of the game you're
like damn this is a lot of work in me
you're looking at 3d graphics or at
least you know 3d or 2d you're looking
at physics engines and game engines and
like there's just so much there's so
many different things you have to deal
with that's not even counting composers
and a composer sound directors writers
you know there's all this stuff right
and and people that have been doing it
for a long time they do it better than
me and then I get kind of you know I'm
just like man what am i doing I mean I'm
having fun but at the same time there's
a lot of work and I know this isn't
really going to pay off and and I start
doubting myself basically and I end up
getting out of it
I'm now with web development as you guys
have known I'm not you know I'm somewhat
disenchanted with some of the tools that
are out there right now but I I don't
think it's all that bad because honestly
like let's let's look at things like
react what does it do it deals with JSON
data you eyes you know I've gotten
through some of the headaches of you
know initially like learning those
things and it's really not that big of a
deal not as much as I made it out to be
but let's be honest I also like ranting
on my videos and some people like
listening to the rents and it's easy to
rant it's easy to bitching and complain
about something instead of taking action
and doing something about it so every
once a while I do like to to vent but
the reason why I mention API is is that
in order to be successful I really feel
like it's it's an absolutely necessary
thing because if I were going to do a
jobs website for instance I think the
first thing that I should probably try
to do in order to stay relevant is to
hook up to AP is and that's something
that I learned what I developed new
movies and I really wish I never brought
it down because um
I the site had a lot to it and I took it
all down there was something like eight
you know a hundred thousand pages of
dynamic content between stars and movies
and it was all interlinked together
through relational database using my
sequel and I shouldn't have taken it
down but it just became a nun
unmaintainable mess but one of the
things I discovered during that project
as I was actually like trying to
seriously build a movies website is I
knew that in order to stay up to date on
on you know movie trailers on new movie
releases and things like that I needed
it I needed to be able to hook up to
api's to be able to do things better
than what I was currently doing it and
and I could write a bunch of scrapers
and try to maintain that that
information and keep it up to date and
things like that and then depending on
how you get the data you know through
scraping and things like that
your determines the legalities there and
I wouldn't be able to advise you on that
but you know obviously Google was a
search engine that made money off of
searching the web and parsing people's
content and then being able to display
that content and you know a unique way
in order to provide a service and the
same thing could be argued instead of
almost any venture I would I would be
willing to wager you know depending on
how you collect that data and display it
but there's all kinds of hurdles you
have to jump through one of the issues
with the movies website is I realized I
could not stay up to date on DVD
releases and things like that so I
immediately started looking out to who I
could interface with in order to get
that information who does it better than
anybody else well Amazon I figured was
one of the best companies to do that
because number one Amazon will pretty
much give the API access to almost
anybody that has you know a business
need for it and they they were much
easier to work with then somebody like
Rotten Tomatoes at one point I ended up
interfacing to Rotten Tomatoes but one
company that I didn't think would give
me the time of day because they don't
even have an affiliate program or
anything like that was a red box so I
was actually able to interface through
red boxes API and I was displaying
movies that were new releases that were
available on red box and my entire spin
on the site was that I was supposed to
have like a unique rating algorithm but
then I realized I just I couldn't do it
any better than what
Rotten Tomatoes was doing so you know
slowly but surely I started to realize
the immense amount of work and just
realizing that even writing biographies
and movie descriptions and things like
that none of it was going to pay off
because it just you couldn't possibly do
a better job than IMDB IMDB it was
bought by Amazon for several hundred
million dollars and you know this was a
long time ago decade ago probably and
you just can't compete with the
resources that Amazon has in order to be
able to you know to to provide that
information now another thing I wanted
to display was box office results
because a lot of people are interested
in how much money did the movie make so
I ended up going out the box office mojo
lo and behold box office mojo was also
owned by Amazon you wouldn't expect it
but the point is is that a lot of these
big ass companies like Amazon and Google
and Facebook and Microsoft on it they're
buying all these content websites and
they pretty much own all of them like
you look at CBS and who they own like I
would be willing to venture to say that
that Hollywood Reporter's probably owned
by CBS or something I don't know that
for a fact I'm just going off the top of
my head but I would I would be willing
to wager that some major company owns a
website like Hollywood Reporter so what
am I saying at all this what I'm saying
is that hooking up to an API is so much
better if they can do the information
better now this is something that
literally just took me you know 15
minutes of playing around with a Google
you've not YouTube but a Google Maps API
so I got the Google Maps API a little
API token and every time I make a call
I'm using my token and all the
documentation is available for how I can
actually make this call so this website
is just a locally running no Duane ojs
website which is using my base ijs
framework and all I do is I simply say
the location and one of the reasons why
I'm just making this point is like if I
say London there's obviously many
different London's there's gonna be a
lot of different London's in the United
States but Google knows that when you're
say London and all and most in all
likelihood you're trying to get London
United Kingdom
so they do this better if I said NYC the
most people you know equate that to New
York City if I said Bayside and I see a
lot of people don't know Bayside
New York City which is an area in Queens
which is part of New York City but it
points right to Bayside so it's like
you're not going to be able to build a
better map system than what Google has
done already so the point is is that if
you're going to build a map based
product the first thing you need to be
looking at is what API is can I tap into
in order to use that data so we can and
the video I posted earlier about Silicon
Valley and the whole dream of going to
Silicon Valley and being creating your
own startup what I'm saying is that
there are bootstrap ways that you can
you can build products that interface to
api's to companies that do things better
than you do while you're still you know
maybe in parallel trying to build you
know your own particular you know knit
maybe you will eventually try to do
something that they do better than you
better than them eventually but if you
can't do it right now you can't afford
not to use them as what I'm saying and
that goes to also with the whole web
framework argument for the longest time
I remember when I was doubting Django a
lot of people would be like well
eventually you can outgrow a framework
and everybody was talking about
conditioning scale can this scale and
99.9% of the time nobody ever runs into
the scaling problems and I remember I
read a quote from somebody one time
where they're like well in this day and
age this was years and years ago they
were like you can't afford not to use a
web framework and for the most part I
still think that's accurate to some
degree really I mean I actually yeah I
think I would say that it is accurate
because honestly like when I tried to
build a website they needed
authentication I was doing the quizzes
and the tutorials and I decided to go
with Django when I built hipster code
I built base IJ s is a minimalistic
framework on top of nodejs if I were
going to build him it depends on what I
was going to build if I really needed
you know secure authentication and
things like that I might go with um hell
I might make the web website myself
depending on it depends on what my
intentions are really if I needed to get
out fast I'd probably go with Django but
it really just depends on my mood but
the point the point is that I'm also a
developer and a lot of other people you
know may not maybe if they're they're
hiring a developer to work for them you
want to
just go with what what can work you know
quickly and fast you don't need to
experiment around with new technology
but one of the things I also want to
tell you was that I was doing a ticket
website one time I was going to build
you know like a because I want to do
like everybody's talking about the
ticket comparisons I saw those apps all
all over the place I'm like you know
whether these ticket comparison sites
kind of suck I'm gonna do a ticket
comparison site that looks at all the
ticket comparison sites to find the best
price which is probably still something
feasible but I ran into problems were
like a Ticketmaster they totally don't
want people scraping and automating
their website they have the CAPTCHAs all
over the place I ran into situations
like eventful where I was going to list
all of the the concerts for different
venues and things like that and eventful
was like hey you can use our API and
this was like one of the top people of
the company that actually got back to my
personal inquiry and they're like yeah
you could use the API but there's going
to be a charge associated with it and I
was like I don't want to deal with all
that so I ended up not using them
because I wasn't serious about the
product but I mean the fact that matter
is is if you're going to be doing a
search there's no better search api than
google if you're going to be doing a map
based systems there's no better map
system than then then using Google Maps
I mean but there's also products that
you can make with YouTube one of the
products that is making a killing of
late is this social buddy
so social buddy I think is our YouTube
Bunny damn I don't remember the name of
it so here's this YouTube buddy channel
or two buddy I can't even think of what
the hell it's called but anyway this
company is actually a company that I I
pay money to I actually pay for that for
this product not because I want to spend
money every month but it's kind of a
necessity because YouTube doesn't
provide enough good tools for their own
API and for their own web platform and
two buddy fills that void and there's
other websites and products that are
like tube buddy but tube buddy is used
by a lot of famous youtubers and I
decided to go with them and ultimately I
keep them around because they do one or
two things very very efficiently and it
saves me a lot of time and for me it's
worth the 15 years
bucks whatever I pay him every month
which is a lot I find that to be a lot
to be honest but because I think it
might even be $29 I don't know but the
point is is that they were able to take
you know API that's available and then
also locate what it lacked and then
build a new interface to other people in
order to accomplish you know things that
they couldn't do with the application so
you know that said like I said you just
wanna you want to look into the api's
wherever possible and then extend them
make them better and another example too
is if you look at a lot of the you know
upload a file or you know like we need
your resume or whatever a lot of those
people are using Google's Drive the
Google Drive because a lot of people
have Google Drive it's very very
convenient that I can have information
stored on a secure Google owned property
like Google Drive and then be able to
just say you know what oh I can't upload
this resume because it's on my desktop
PC and I'm on my cell phone driving down
the highway in my friend's car but if
you're using a modern API reason hey you
know what we accept the API of Google
Drive here click this button and upload
from your Google Drive account that's
the kind of stuff I'm talking about
obviously authentication we've talked
about that is as well the whole point is
that you can bootstrap I think you're
crazy large successful websites if
you're a good programmer and you can tie
all this stuff together I really think
you could be a thorn in the side even
for these million dollar venture capital
startups and at the very least get your
product off the ground so it's not some
incubator idea it's more of a bootstrap
working product before you then you know
get some venture capital funding for
maybe marketing and expanding as opposed
to selling your entire company and sold
for a couple million to get off the
ground which most likely isn't going to
be granted to you anyway unless you have
rich relatives Ivy League credentials or
you know Silicon Valley connection one
way or another anyway guys let me know
what you think and take care have a good
night and bye
hey guys so I've talked about this a lot
deb mountain coding boot camp they are
my sponsor they're one of the reasons
why i'm able to do these videos and they
offer a 12-week intensive course that
teaches you the technologies of the here
and now they're going to focus on a lot
of things that are actually being used
and websites things like jquery and
they're going to be using stacks like
nodejs the 12-week intensive course is
to try to get people in the job market
so that is their entire focus we've all
we've talked a lot about on this channel
whether or not a college degree is worth
it i'm not the one to be able to answer
that question for you i absolutely think
that college degrees are great
especially in computer science i never
want to convince somebody to say that
they shouldn't do that you know
obviously schools like Stanford and MIT
I'm you know I'm an envy of all those
graduates however there is you know the
bulk of developers that don't
necessarily need to be the MIT graduates
to actually have success in the
programming world I think I speak
relatively well for for that type of
person and with coding boot camps we're
seeing them you know try to offer more
skills more modern-day skills because a
lot of times when you're going to a
computer science course and a major
university you're learning technology
that's already outdated by the time
you're learning it with Deb mountain and
coding boot camps like what dev Mountain
offers they're focusing on really what
is hot right now so and they also focus
on a relatively you know small set of
skills in order to make sure that that
they are teaching you what you need to
know in order to be productive in a in a
workplace environment so make sure you
guys do me a favor do yourself a favor
check out the link and that in the
description tab below for more on Deb
Mountain coding boot camp thanks guys
