from Georgia Vijay said my head's going
to explode laughs aloud I learned HTML
and CSS recently but Python looks like
it's going to blow my head up before I
learn so I just want to take a quick
moment to just mention that dude I've
been there we've all been there for me
especially coming from an anon computer
science background a really a non
mathematical background in fact when I
was learning to become a developer I was
28 I said the story multiple times you
guys can definitely read up on it I
should probably put together a playlist
honestly of everything that kind of
talks about how my career got to where I
was but learning on my own without that
formal background was just I think it
made it even harder for me and at 28
when I was first getting started coding
I hadn't done any sort of math probably
since high school I believe so I had
taken a few courses in different
different different college courses for
my Business Administration degree but
never any math courses and I don't
really know that that really had any any
bearing on anything but just a lot of
the logic itself even the terminologies
that a lot of times come from
mathematics which you find their way in
the programming can be extremely
difficult to grasp and it just makes
everything much more difficult because
you're not only learning about really a
new way of looking at how objects
interact with each other and that and
what iterators are and things like that
you're looking at mastering and not just
you know the syntax but obviously this
new way of thinking and approaching
problems and then you're also you're
dealing with you know a lot of
mathematical terminology and everything
so there's I think there's just a lot
that you have to balance when you're
first getting started programming and
and it feels like an impossible task at
times but if you stick with it like it
would be easier so one of the things
that you want to stress in this videos a
lot of people say oh well Python is an
easy language or Python is a great first
language to learn and things like that
and that's all you know that is right
and saying that Python is definitely a
great first language but the first
language is always going to be the most
difficult language there's no question
about that whatever one you decide to
choose then
you're going to have a mountain of a
task as far as being able to learn how
to become a self-sufficient programmer
but it will happen with time I stick
with the words that I've said previously
where you just have to build things so
it's like hey I'm going to use this
technology let me build something with
it that's gonna be the best fastest way
for you to learn more moreso than even
watching you know some of these
tutorials and everything although I will
say that tutorials are great when you're
first getting started especially like
you know the step by step how to build
it to do app and react I mean if you're
getting started with react definitely
the first place you go in my opinion is
you go to the rad website and you do
their demonstration problem once you do
that you spend a few hours what it
builds your own problem and then that is
gonna be the quickest way to learn now
you can spend more time from there and
do a little bits of tutorials here and
there but most likely you're going to
end up forgetting a lot of those
concepts and it's just not going to
click the clicking the light bulb
moments that we all have as developers
and they will happen it's and they're
very noticeable when you first get
started programming because when you
first have that aha moment it's a great
feeling when you're like damn that stuff
clicks now it finally makes sense and
that I think plays into that whole your
training your brain to look at problems
in a different way and eventually you
just start having a programmer mind
where like you know the programming
terminologies data they don't slip you
up and you're a ha moment you still have
them you just don't notice them as much
and all this is you know obviously just
my own personal experience which is why
you guys are here on this channel but
you know everybody's experience I'm sure
is going to vary but I know and I've
talked to many programmers including
people that have reached out to me on
this channel that have said definitely
the of the aha moments where the
lightbulb is clicked man I've had it
literally where I've woken up from sleep
and had a solution to programming
problems I couldn't figure out the night
before or the day before even two weeks
before that definitely happens and and
it's a real thing
I started with Perl man Perl was a very
difficult language to learn so I think
if you find Python to be very difficult
which it is going to be much more
difficult than HTML and CSS you're in
for a world of hurt if you do
than the like C sharp in my opinion if
you're if you're geared towards being
like a C sharp net programmer you might
as well jump into that that mess right
now but that is like for a beginner
programmer that is like something I
would definitely not recommend like I
started with Perl moved to Python Python
just clicked for me but I bet you if I
was started with PHP and jump to Python
I could have had the same situation in
fact I guarantee I could have started
with Python and switched the Perl and
still probably had the same the same
experience because what I would I gather
to be easier with Python in many ways
were just a simple programming concepts
that I just couldn't grasp and Perl nor
would I have been able to grasp in PHP
or Java or anything like that so it's
like that first language is always going
to be the most difficult language to
just stick with it will get easier and
in Python I think is definitely a good
option for that I feel like there's too
many tools too many too many people
tugging in all different directions for
me to recommend JavaScript as a first
language Python still has a lot of a lot
of good academic support and everything
so I would I would still you know I
still think that you're on the right
task in 2017 and time of this video that
you're learning Python now if you wanna
be a Java developer I've gotten that
developer or even PHP or something like
that you probably don't need to go too
far in the Python before you branch off
and figure out where it is you want to
go and Python maybe that option for you
as well and then just one thing to harp
on as well a lot of people tell you
especially when we're talking about
table languages and everything people
like discussing their favorite line
which is it's like religion it's like
why we talk about politics and religion
and all sort of stuff like people people
have their passions and everything in
programming languages are just like that
as well
so for for sake of discussion it's
always something that can get a good
conversation going but when it comes to
like having it you know affect your
career or affect your education and
things like that of oh I need to choose
this or that or that you know this or
that you know just focus on one and
stick with it and then as you go on to
the next one you'll realize a lot of
stuff you learn from the first one is
going to apply to the second one and
that
the way would not even just every single
programming language that I've worked
with but I would say also every library
and tool that I'm interfacing to and
almost everything in the IT world I
think you will you will gain you know
experience as you go along to be able to
study things faster and figure things
out faster as well so alright guys
that's really all I got here I'll keep
it short and sweet have a good day man
bye hey guys so a lot of you asked me
how do I get my foot in the door to
become a programmer and I just want to
take a moment to mention dev Mountain
coding boot camp is a 12-week intensive
course that focuses on the technologies
of the here-and-now for web development
some of the things that they're actually
teaching in this 12-week course it's
geared to get you into the industry by
focusing on things like jQuery
nodejs react angular how to use github
so a lot of the things that you're going
to need to do as a developer as soon as
you start they're going to be teaching
you in this and this coding bootcamp and
the entire goal is to be able to get you
into the industry within 12 weeks so if
you guys are interested in learning more
information about Deb mountain coding
boot camp just check out the link in the
description cab of this video thank you
for watching and have a good day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
