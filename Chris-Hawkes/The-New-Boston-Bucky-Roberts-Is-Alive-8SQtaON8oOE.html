gonna make a video
Bucky Roberts connected with me on
LinkedIn I thought that was pretty cool
a lot of people are like well where's
the at like including myself I did a
video I'm like you just dropped off
facing a map he hasn't made a video on
his YouTube channel in over a year and
he has almost 2 million subscribers so
he's a hugely popular youtuber I means
definitely the number one probably in
like online e-learning type of thing he
was a huge inspiration for why I created
this channel myself so anyway I just
wanted to say that he is alive obviously
and well he's doing this director gig
some sort of social network that he's
building but that's really taken up all
his time and even on Twitter and
everything like he's just not he's not
response he hasn't had a tweet in over a
year since May of last year and then you
can see that he's like director of
engineering this Elliot ventures I'm
assuming that's the social network that
he was making because at one point he
tweeted that he was working on that
social networking framework and if you
wanted to help him you could but anyway
that's still there if you're interested
you can see he's also active on github
so a lot of people don't realize that
either if you're on github you can see
these keys doing commits and everything
and and that's really it so guys that's
all I have tonight make sure you guys
subscribe and vote up and have a good
day and take care bye hey guys what up
