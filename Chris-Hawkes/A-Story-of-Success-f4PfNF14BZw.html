just want to share this comment that i
got from from jan here and he says
thanks to yours and eli the computer
guys videos i took the courage and after
about eight months of quite intensive
self studying of javascript i started to
go for interviews and now i am working
in one of the top IT companies as a
junior programmer really really thanks
you two are the best mainly because your
videos aren't just some stupid click
here right this tutorials but they were
also very motivational i also like fun
from function because he he's not just
holding your hand but he is pushing you
to think hard and you are right about
fun fun function is you know pretty
pretty smart he does a very good job
with his presentation i'm also a fan of
eli the computer guy myself i try to
watch him when I can but honestly
there's so much content out there that
that I can't absorb it all so yeah I
also watch John samas and speaking of
which I just recently did a
collaboration video with John Salmons
and that's going to be appearing on this
channel not sure when but I know some of
you guys had had known about me of me
talking about John and the possibility
of us actually doing a video together
hopefully it's good we'll see what
happens on but I'm definitely tune in to
his channel if you're ever interested in
that so that said this is awesome to get
this type of comment because in my
situation it was the exact same like it
was basically perseverance it was
dedication i came home every single day
and in fact in my case so it wasn't
eight months it was more like roughly
two and a half three years something
like that before i was actually able to
get a full-time job so you know maybe
maybe the market is getting a little bit
easier for this type of thing to happen
and that's good good to know that some
people are actually finding success you
know that they're actually taking it
upon themselves to get out there and to
learn to self study and you know and you
have alternatives to college now I mean
there's boot camps and and there's
obviously you know community colleges
universities and I've never been an
advocate to say that you shouldn't go to
college or anything like that but you
know we do need to to make sure that
we're not wasting our money and I posted
that video about that ITT Tech
corporation that they're probably a very
shitty
institution and there's no question they
should be out of business but i think i
was just mainly trying to make the point
that you know maybe it's it's a little
bit concerning that it that a company
can basically be taken down but that's
not even important i don't even care to
be honest with you I don't in fact
that's funny I just actually just felt
like talking about it and now I could
care less I'm some like your typical you
know news consuming American who like
reads an article gets fired up for about
15 seconds and then forgets about it and
doesn't care anymore so you know
hopefully that doesn't offend anybody
but really I just I don't care um the
another thing too i want to mention is
the the actual tutorials i'm going to be
trying to make tutorials again i'm miss
making tutorials i actually like doing
it that's really cool that this you know
this particular person was influenced by
some of the tutorials that i did and not
just the motivational speeches and stuff
but with myself in this channel like
when i first started doing tutorials
that were terrible and then they got a
little bit better and even now they
probably don't compare to some of the
new pluralsight and other opera other
options that you have but you know what
i'm doing my own thing and and if people
are interested in trying to join me you
on the way i'm going to try to share
what knowledge i have i've never been a
territorial programmer where it's like I
want to try to hold on and retain this
knowledge and keep it secret from other
people so that I always have an
advantage over them you know that that's
a shitty way to try to get ahead in life
and I really think that you know through
you know through you know community and
things like that we can all work
together and actually accomplished a lot
more and I think you know even with
sites like stackoverflow you've seen
that in some cases it's a little bit
concerning with something like
stackoverflow because there's so much
knowledge that takes so much time and
dedication that ultimately costs money
that's real life skills that people had
to go to college for or that they spent
their time and as we know time you don't
get more of that in life so you need to
be cautious about how much time you
spend stop studying and things like that
and my story I was doing all kinds of
blue-collar work
and like but then I was able to get out
of the blue collar industry in fact one
of the ways I was actually able to get
out of the blue collar industry because
I absolutely hated it ever since I was a
child let me just say this first I've
always had this fascination to be able
to work in an office building like for
whatever reason like my father and
there's another thing I've never shared
with you guys but I am a third
generation program where my father was a
programmer and my grandfather was a
programmer in the Navy the US Navy and
um so so the programming I guess in some
ways runs through my blood although I
they never taught me or anything like
that like I would bounce some ideas off
of my father but you know they were
supportive and yo hey you should you
know be a programmer but you know I did
they never pushed me to go to college or
doing anything like that and they've
even like really tutor or mentor me when
it came to learning but new that is
something that I guess you know some
people say to you're born with this
stuff and that's absolutely not true you
can you can gain it and I've seen people
from all different walks of life from
all different cultures from all
different you know from different
genders you can learn to program it's
not as hard as it used to be which i
think is I know I'm grateful for we
sometimes try to make things harder on
ourselves and we need to and I think
case in point is the JavaScript
community you can see that we have
crafty people making things much much
more difficult for the sake of being
trendy and hip but we're not really you
know getting anywhere it seems but you
know as a as a young child I was always
want to work in an office building so my
father at one point had a office in
downtown Omaha Nebraska where he was on
the 15th floor and I would look out and
I build these little in a paper
skyscrapers and things like that but I
always had this dream that I would live
that I would work in an office one day
and um so you know the fast forward you
know high school was tough for me like I
was near basically I was close to
actually dropping out of high school I
barely graduated because I was skipping
all the time I was partying with my
friends there was one period where I
like literally stayed with my girlfriend
who was like a year younger than me i
was sleeping at her house play for weeks
so i was like i was a troubled youth
basically and when I moved out at 17 I
moved out
and I had to get a job so I started
doing things like my first job was a
lifeguard well actually was my first
overall job but that was my first job
out of high school was a lifeguard and I
transitioned over like a pizza delivery
guy and i worked at different
restaurants and things like that and but
ultimately that led the way into like a
blue-collar lifestyle where I became a
truck driver and then from there I ended
up transitioning over to hvac and
plumbing but I didn't do that for very
long before I decided to get into the
white-collar business and I did that
because I actually went out i purchased
like the everything job interview book
so when it came to actually interviewing
for companies I did my due diligence
even back then to be like you know what
you know I'm reading things that I
didn't really know about things like you
know how to shake somebody's hand
properly how to look them in the eye how
to be you know how to convey things
properly so I remember I did that
because to in order to get a
white-collar job I had to go through
five interviews in order to be able to
do that and it ultimately ended up
working out but you know as later on in
life and I started to realize that you
know at 28 that I didn't want to do that
my whole life like I am I wanted a
different career and and you know
through the same you know hard work and
everything and I think some of his is
the blue-collar jobs that I had before I
knew that it was going to be a lot of
effort and things like that so if I was
able to go home and I would study you
know each night and things like that
similar to how jam dated but I had to do
it a lot longer and i also had kids and
had a long commute and i lived out in
the country in the middle of nowhere in
virginia and I'm sorry this long commute
so I mean a lot of my time was spent
night and unfortunately like time
sacrifice that I could have spent with
my young children and things like that I
had to spend time also studying so I
think it yet to be cautious and how much
time you spend doing this stuff but at
the same time if you want results you
obviously after to work hard to attain
them and and with with me you know i was
able to finally get my foot in the door
you guys know through the rejection
stories and things like that that i've
had were you know I've been embarrassed
you know and applying for positions i
had no business applying to and things
like that and i continued to actually
have you know moments of truth that come
upon me where I realized that I'm not as
good as I as I thought I was and and in
some cases even though I'm cautious and
I say you know what I'm not as good as I
I am I need to be careful of that
because that's burn me in the past and
then even still it's like yeah well you
know i'm i'm even worse than i thought
it was a time so you know and it's just
it's one I don't know it's something
that you you eventually can get better
at you can get better at anything and
and one of the stories that I had
actually was I that I went and I talked
to a company I was interested in me but
they were trying to get me to do
whiteboard coding and stuff like that
and it didn't work out well for me at
all in fact I I choked up pretty hard in
the interview process and it but
ultimately I didn't even want to be
there anyway and once it started going
on like it was like dude why are you
even like I just kept thinking my head
just walk out of the interview just walk
out just walk out I don't need I don't
want it I don't even want these people
reached out to me I don't want to be
here and things like that but ultimately
I stuck through it and it was a bad
experience but enough of an experience
would be like you know what you know
that kind of stuff is is good because
you know people are going to ask you all
these questions they're going to put you
on the spot and you might get rejected
one or two times maybe maybe five to ten
times maybe even 20 times who knows but
eventually you're going to be able to
you know be able to retain your cool
under these interview processes and
things and you'll be able to get your
foot in the door for me that's
eventually what was able to happen and
um you know day and looking back I mean
things that things are great so I mean
being a programmer I think has a lot of
advantages it's not all great I wouldn't
want to be like a code monkey for a
company that just literally wants me to
pound out code without thinking and some
companies like you know they basically
like write as much code as quickly as
you can and ship that out and other
people want you to think about your
craft a little bit more and that's kind
of another topic for another video
really about you know which approach is
better you know basically quantity over
quality basically would be another video
topic that I'm going to talk about but
yeah man that's basically my story as
far as being able to get my foot into
another thing too that's an interesting
tip and i'll probably make a separate
video on this as well but my first home
that i bought I bought at the top of the
global recession that occurred and I
bought the house in
six and by 2009 the house was literally
lopsided by close to one hundred percent
of its value so so basically well not
really a hundred percent basically it
was um yeah there's more like 60 /
centers on my dad but it was oh it was a
shitload of money that i ended up losing
and stuff like that so part of the the
process of me being drawn to programming
and things was not just because i was
some dork who like to play with
computers i mean there was a there was a
actual monetary motivation in order to
be able to succeed and and i think a lot
of people need that so well some people
do i'm kind of a business-minded person
myself so I I don't like to just code
like necessarily just because I love to
do I wasn't doing this as a child you
know I staab viously i started at 28 so
i don't know i guess i should be clear
about that i think this is more proof
that if i can do it you can do it you
don't have to be some computer nerd that
started when he was eight years old now
i have my son who's very young and i've
already gotten him in the blender and
unity and doing some python stuff and i
think that's great you know the earlier
that you start but just because you
started at some young age doesn't mean
you can't pick it up later on in life
some people say this stuff is ingrained
i don't i don't believe in that but i do
want to be clear that that there was
definitely a monetary attraction to
programming that also grabbed me at the
time it wasn't just you know being you
know being influenced and you know and
opened basically opened I towards people
like Mark Zuckerberg who you know had a
movie being based upon him and stuff
like that and you know there was some of
that I think with just all these
different startups and I was basically
thinking you know what I have ideas
myself I've always been an ideas guy and
I can make these ideas i can bring them
to life and if i could just bring them
to life if it works for facebook surely
it could work for me and in really
facebook wasn't my motivation at the
time it was other there's other sites i
remember i was very influenced by
youtube being sold and I was just like
out man i all i gotta do is learn our
program and i can implement my ideas but
it all that solidified during that
concert because i say you know what this
band just gave me the time of my life I
felt too old I felt unhappy and I
decided I'm going to change my career
after this concert and you know it was
the the product that I was trying to
build with the music site that really
really got me involved in and you know
trying to push code as quickly as I
could and I was jumping from thing the
thing probably too much but you're never
going to learn faster than just trying
to build stuff so you can read about
theory and all that all day long
but there's a certain balance you have
to start hacking away at stuff and
getting things done and then eventually
you can start focusing more on software
design patterns and the pros and the
cons and and I'm not saying like I said
that quantity is better than quality I
actually don't think that but when
you're getting started you're not going
to learn more than just by coding you
know coding is going to help you more
than anything so think of an idea that
you want to do you want to build a
gaming unity do you want to build a
website do you want to build it in
Django or Ruby if you want to build an
Android app it doesn't matter what you
want to do but you want to you want to
have some sort of idea on what you're
trying to build and then you want to
start building the thing and then you're
going to learn a lot along the way and
then eventually you're going to be to
the point where you're just as good as
like honestly like a ton of your average
developers because there are the elite
category of programmers and those are
the ones you typically hear a lot about
and then there's like then there's just
the masses that follow between you know
elite in certain things and just kind of
okay some people their passion is not
learning this stuff day in and day out I
actually do like learning so even though
I wasn't like some coding nerd as a kid
I take a pretty good joy and learning
new things but also that being said I
think that after being an enterprise
development out for 44 years and
programming for seven years are close to
that I'm now to the point where I'm
starting to recognize that some of these
tools and things that I've been
promoting like react react for instance
I was all over the reactive and wag
and I think my videos de back years of
you know showing how to enter integrate
react into Django I remember like just
like four months ago I decided to build
a website that I wanted to build and I
did it in Django because Django was a
much more mature product than what I
felt like note and expressed could offer
I didn't wanna have to write a bunch of
middleware and authentication stuff I
wasn't impressed with passport jas I
needed stuff that was going to work and
I was tried and true I don't need so
there was a lot of reasons why I chose
Django but I chose Django I don't regret
it but what I do regret was that I built
the quiz app and flux and there was no
reason for me to build this in flux
and now that I'm doing redox I can't say
that I like either one of them and now
that when I go back and I look at my
flux code I don't even want to look at
it I don't even want to deal with it and
I'm damn near tempted to just rewrite it
and do my own JavaScript library you
know and using jQuery but essentially I
don't think the pattern I basically
tried to pigeonhole this pattern into
something where it doesn't it's not
quite necessary and that's something
I've said recently to like if you don't
know whether or not you need redox or
some like that and then don't use
it do yourself a favor especially if you
know you have these you know these
people that are going to say this
technology and that technology is great
ultimately that influences businesses so
then businesses get stuck you know on
some of these bandwagon technologies and
now you know they have teams of
developers that have to learn this stuff
and it cost companies in business
millions of dollars and it contributes
to this whole productivity paradox that
we see what we're constantly trying to
reinvent the wheel and everybody's
trying to show each other how
crafty they are instead of actually
trying to solve business problems and do
it as efficiently as possible not saying
that redux doesn't solve business
problems i'm sure it does for facebook
but there's no reason why hipster code
needs to use react or even flux
architectural pattern to display some
quiz it's not necessary and i think as i
start moving into this senior senior
mindset I'm just like you know what I
need to put business first I need I need
to choose the best tool for the job and
you hear that a lot from programmers
it's like you don't want to complicate
stuff you need to sometimes think
outside of just yourself you also have
developed
that have different skill sets around
you and is this tool really going to
provide you enough of a value add that
it makes sense to have to train and
onboard a bunch of developers in order
to get them on the same page with you
guys you know what did think about the
maintenance cycle I mean you just
there's just there's just so much hype
and in the JavaScript community
right now it's I'm just starting to
realize what a joke some of it is though
but ok so that said I got off on a
tangent I could talk more about this
guy's but basically i'm going to share
another seat I was sinking financially
also when I you know I have a family I
have a job I'm going home I have a
community I have dogs I have house I
have all this responsibility i'm still
trying to teach myself the program
amongst all of that stuff and on top of
everything i'm literally sinking
financially for four years every single
year was further into the hole with no
with no you know with nothing no no
relief in sight and i still found a way
and managed to be able to remain
motivated and almost use that that
unfortunate circumstance in my life in
order to continue to drive me forward
into you know basically tell myself that
I could accomplish this so if there's
one thing that people know about me it's
I'm usually my own worst critic so I try
to portray as much confidence as i can
on youtube and things like that but i'm
not an overly confident guy so you know
dude the fact that i was able to tell
myself that over and over again to
basically keep trying to stuff like that
i think is uh i don't know i think i
hope that helps other people because
honestly like it's not ingrained in me
and just because my grandfather was a
programmer my father was a programmer
doesn't mean that I was somehow destined
to be one or anything like that I've
seen so many different types of
programmers and you don't have to be
elite in order to be able to contribute
you know real real results to the
business community alright guys this
video is dragging on once again thanks
for all the support thank you Jan and
good luck with your new position
man that's awesome that I just wanted to
share with everybody else that that you
know success is working for people and
yeah and definitely keep an eye out for
that job John sama is a collaboration
video I did with them guys alright
thanks bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
