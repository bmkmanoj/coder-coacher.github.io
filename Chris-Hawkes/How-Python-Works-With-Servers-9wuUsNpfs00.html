headache and I'm doing a video anyway
because I love you guys so I got a
question somebody asked me whether like
how you could get Python to basically
handle a forum like a and basically work
as a server and I think he was on like
so I wanted to just give a brief
basically in layman's terms example of
you know how I understand the whole you
know HTTP communication between when I
set up a web server and have Python use
it and things like that so this is a
good picture I think that it's part of
the creative commons so i'm allowed to
use it but this you know this shows the
visitors website everything that's going
on so you have you have connection to
the internet right the world wide web
and you make this request out to the
internet but the first thing it does is
it hits the the domain registrar
registry where like it's going to figure
out what actual domain name you are
requesting and then once it knows the
domain name because the thing is you
have these like top-level domain names
like google.com and things like that but
that's just to make things easy because
everybody actually has an IP address
even google and all their web servers
they probably have tons of IP addresses
but they have IP address so in my case
for hipster cocom I have an IP address
that I have that points to a lenôtre
and New Jersey but if you were to make a
request to my page then you have
connection the Internet you hit the
registry so that's going to say oh my um
my domain name hipster cocom was bought
with GoDaddy
but GoDaddy says o our records reflect
that we forwarded all that traffic to
one node and then the notes DNS settings
actually tell it on my virtual host
actually which application is being
requested based off of the domain name
itself instead of just the IP address so
the reason why it's good to be able to
do that off of the domain name instead
of just the IP address is that otherwise
I would have to have a separate one node
account for every single IP address that
I wanted to or every single domain name
wanted to use but instead with lenôtre
I can have a server and I set up you
know multiple different applications
using what's called a virtual host with
like Apache or nginx and that's just
it's really technology that's written I
think in C and C++ and or mostly C
really I think it's just C actually but
they're just there applications like
node as an application on the chrome v8
engine
they are programs written in C and they
they're running on my a bun to Linux
server and they have the ability to look
at these virtual hosts to figure out ok
the domain name being repressed this
hipster code and not new movies or
something like that and then it actually
forwards it to the right application so
the thing is is that Python uses a
standard witches so the standard that
Python uses is web server gateway
interface and it's short for whiskey and
and and this wizzy thing it's just like
you can see that it's a specification
for simple Universal interface between
web servers and applications and
frameworks so that means that you have a
running Python application on your
server but your your actual like a
patchy server that's listening for
public traffic on your server needs to
know how to communicate with Python and
say oh you know that you know this this
needs to be executed inside of a virtual
environment all these different things
but the thing is is that there is a
standard and this pepp standard this is
a standard that Python has for all its
new updates so you'll see like they have
like you know there's its peps
it's like pep certified or something
like that but basically there's all
these different so this is all in a
nutshell to be honest with you I do
Python for fun I'm not some far I'm not
some like full-time Python guy in fact
I've never had a full-time Python gig
but I've been using Python now for seven
or eight years my understanding is that
this PAP is like what they do to
basically notate all the different
changes that they want for the Python
language and all the features and things
and and some of them get included some
of them get scrapped or whatever but the
point is is that the pep is to make sure
that you know if you're writing proper
Python and Python and you have
expectations for Python to be you know
doing certain things and there should be
like pep guidelines for that
and that actually stands for was I stand
for now let's just go back to the steam
Python I have no idea what pep stands
for to be honest with you but I looked
it up really quickly and it's it's a
Python enhancement proposals okay so
they're all just proposals and these
peps
get when they get introduced they're no
longer proposals and they're part of the
actual standard language anyway so with
the web server gateway interface that is
like a standard for not just Python but
also for Ruby and Perl and other things
to be able to use this new this whiskey
standard in order to run applications
using Apache and nginx and things like
that so the thing is it just doesn't
magically work out of the box you have
to have modules that are built for
Apache that are that are better at able
to understand Python programs and you
know in applications and things so like
one of them is mod mod whiskey and this
was made by Graham Dumbleton so he's a
really smart dude but this guy like he
knows obviously so much about Apache and
C programming and things and he he made
this and I was actually using this
patchy module for the longest time when
I was building web applications years
ago in Python but since that time I've
actually you've moved over to the the
new you whiskey project I guess it's not
new but new whiskey is now what I use
for most my Python applications so you
can see in this project itself I mean it
does quite a bit of crap that you
wouldn't want to have to write on your
own but it says the core implements
configuration process management sockets
creation monitoring logging shared
memory areas blah blah so there's a lot
of stuff there that you really don't
want to do on your own so you use Apache
that's already a great web server and
that actually is used by the majority of
websites by far and then you install a
module that works with Python so you can
choose between mod whiskey or you
whiskey and then there's another one
which is a mod Python which is used to
be popular or at least I don't know how
it's doing nowadays but so the point is
is that even though like pi
comes with a built-in web server it's
only really it's only used for like
local hosting you would never want to
actually set up a server surrounding
pythons built-in so ever you want you
want your Python application build in a
way so that it works with one of these
whiskey modules unless you want to
create your own Python whiskey module
and then you're gonna want to use like
Apache nginx is I would think anyway I
mean I guess you could write your own
server but most people don't I mean
you're already going the hard way of
trying to create an application in
Python for web stuff without using a web
framework which handles so much of the
other complications that we have so an
interesting note is that a lot of people
talk about Python class because they'll
say that Django is too complicated but
and I and I agreed Django can be a
pretty big pill to swallow when it comes
to learning and things like that so a
lot of people use flask is it's so much
smaller less to deal with but flask uses
a ton of their their functionality
actually comes from this work zoo
project which is you can see a Python
wizzy utility library so it actually
tells you in here if we were to look at
like the documentation that you can
build an actual Python application like
a server type application using the
Whiskey standard if you wanted to like
because it gives an example here it says
the basic whiskey introduction so it
says it's a utility library for whiskey
whiskey itself is a protocol or
convention so that's just a set of
instructions now you're out web
application can use to speak to the web
server and more importantly that web
applications work nicely together so
everything I said earlier so the basic
hello world and application and whiskey
without the help of work so it looks
like this so they're basically saying
that you can use a whiskey standard
within Python to create your own I guess
web server but you're gonna probably
have to write a lot of stuff from
scratch as far as how the web server
understands text files from HTML files
CSS files so you have to basically read
the mime types and all its stuff to
figure out what type of file is being
requested so the server can actually
find it assuming you're using templates
and you're going to open obviously an
HTML template and memory send it back is
a byte stream
I'm assuming all these things would be
and involved in that's why you don't
want to write it from scratch and even
the flask creator Arman Arman that I
don't know his last name I can't
remember um but he he was work so
because he didn't have to write all that
himself but even work so its itself when
you go to the ploy that has instructions
here and you can see mod whiskey so I
was telling you I used mod whiskey for
the longest time which was created by
Graham Dumbleton so you have to create a
whiskey file and that way you tell
Apache hey you're using this mod whiskey
module and here's my Python whiskey file
for my application so that's why you
always had to have a whiskey file when
you're deploying a django application or
a any sort of Python web application to
a web server somewhere so anyway I'm
sure I'm talking you guys is ear off
once again I'm not like some sort of
academic in the Python world but I've
set up and had to deploy a crap ton of
Python websites so this is just kind of
my high level understanding of of the
question and you know come to think of
it it would be cool to actually for me I
think to create like a work so quick
type project in Python I think that
would be fun maybe in Python 35 or
something if I ever had time or maybe
one of you guys wants to do that but
that's really it guys so make sure you
subscribe and also check out my sponsor
which is Deb mountain coding boot camp
they have a tuition schedule here today
if you end up paying to go for twelve or
sixteen weeks they can even offer free
housing but it's on a first-come
first-served basis so you guys got to
reach out to them and and ask them about
those details but they focus on
technologies like jquery angular nodejs
a lot of things that are being used in
the web world right now so their entire
process is just a 16-week like super
intensive course where you're actually
building stuff you have instructors
working with you and and then when you
get out hopefully you'll be able to get
in the door as like a junior developer
at some sort of a web web shop somewhere
so the the locations are in Dallas and
Provo Utah so once again the link is in
the description below and you guys can
get more information there alright
thanks for watching and bye hey guys so
a lot of you ask me how do I get my foot
in the door to become a program
I just want to take a moment to mention
dev Mountain coding bootcamp is a
12-week intensive course that focuses on
the technologies of the here-and-now for
web development some of the things that
they're actually teaching in the Suevi
course it's geared to get you into the
industry by focusing on things like
jQuery nodejs
react angular how to use github so a lot
of the things that you're going to need
to do as a developer as soon as you
start they're going to be teaching you
in this and this coding boot camp and
the entire goal is to be able to get you
into the industry within 12 weeks so if
you guys are interested in learning more
information about dev Mountain coding
boot camp just check out the link in the
description tab of this video thank you
for watching and have a good day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
