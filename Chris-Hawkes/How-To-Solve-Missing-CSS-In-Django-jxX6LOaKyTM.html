people they don't understand what your
angle what they have to do in order to
get their CSS and everything to work
with their projects so here what I have
is I have a django project it has no CSS
so it looks really ugly now one of the
things I need to show you is number one
when we look at the the template
directory here you need to actually the
first thing you need to have it to find
the top of your file is load static
files this is assuming that you're not
actually extending a base template
because if you're extending a base
template you always put the extend
statement first and then load static
files second however I don't have an
extend statement up here so I'm putting
load static files at the top so anyway
that needs to be put there inside the
curly braces with a percent sign and
then wherever you want and the static
files to show up you need to do this
so like this whole thing right here I
would replace all this the static stuff
that I have to replace crap I would end
up having to copy all this put this like
that and then and the reason why we do
that is because in the static it's gonna
look at the settings file to figure out
where is the static pointing to and
right now the static is not pointing to
anything so we need to actually add a
static file directory to our settings
files so what we're gonna do is I'm
gonna add site I need to add here's from
the documentation I'm going to add this
and we need to put the direct path to
where the the templates directory or I'm
sorry about the the static files
directly directory can be found so here
you can see my static files directory if
we look at the folder structure I have
projects heroin another heroin folder
and then that's where my static folder
is located so that's the directory that
needs to be pointed to sub-projects
heroin one heroin - static
so now we have the static files
directory set up and every time we do
that static statement inside of our
template it's actually reading this
value so if I went back over to the
templates you can see by me doing this
we should have better results so if I
went ahead and refresh this you can see
that we now have CSS and we're still
missing probably some stuff in here let
me see no everything should be fine now
and the reason why it's fine is because
all this stuff points to external links
and it just so happens that the folder
structure is is static that it's
pointing to like for the font awesome
and everything so everything is is being
pointed to correctly so that's good and
you can see all the JavaScript files
everything are all in the static
directory as well so to see that working
in action if they if the templates
directory didn't follow the exact same
see what what ended up happening is when
I downloaded this bootstrap template I
actually took the entire template
structure like the whole folder that I
downloaded that had all the JavaScript
CSS and everything and I extracted it
right to my static folder so everything
just falls in line perfectly with the
static folder structure so that you guys
may not understand what I'm talking
about it's late and basically if if it
didn't use a static folder and say they
called it something like resources or
something else and none of this stuff
would work I'd have to have that static
command that I showed you guys how to do
in the template I'd have to do that
everywhere but I don't have to do that
because the the patterns fall in line
and what I was trying to show you is if
I look at page source down here at the
bottom and I click on like the static
j/s you can see that it's pointing to
my static Jas folder just fine and once
again I don't have to reiterate that too
much but the point is if you can't find
your static files make sure you have
your static directory defined and your
settings full our settings file and then
inside of your template make sure your
loading static files all the way at the
top and then also make sure that you
have this static command just like this
because in the last example I'll show
you before this video is so you guys
know that this is doing something you
can see that when we look at the source
file those first two CSS files are
actually using that that command that
I've showed you so if I view the source
and we look at the first two statics up
here you can see that it implement
inputted the forward slash static
forward slash so that becomes beneficial
when you start moving your project from
one server to another that you don't
have these absolute paths spelled out
because absolute paths are an absolute
disaster and you'll learn that really
quickly in what development so you want
to avoid that as much as possible so
that is the reason for doing and just
follow that that structure of load
static files and put the static
everywhere you're referencing images and
JFS and CSS and even font files and
anything else like that alright guys
thanks for watching have a good night
