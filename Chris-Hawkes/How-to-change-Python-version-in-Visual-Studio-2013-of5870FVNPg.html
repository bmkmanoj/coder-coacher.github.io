video I just want to quickly show you
how to work with multiple versions of
Python if you're using Visual Studio as
your editor I actually have three
versions of Python installed on this
machine I have two seven three four and
the latest version three five and what
we need to do is anytime you add a new
version if I run this program here you
can see that I'm actually running it
with the Python to seven version which
is the default so I need to change that
over to three five and I'll show you how
to do that alright so what you're going
to want to do is go over to debug window
go down to options and settings and on
the left hand side in this window I'm
sorry if it's a text is small you're
going to go down to Python tools and
open that up under environment options
you'll see the default environment here
is four to seven so I'm going to go
ahead and change that over to my 64-bit
version 3.5 also say show settings for
the same thing click OK
and that's not cool so apparently Visual
Studio wants to restart you guys happen
to witness Microsoft at its finest here
so hopefully the settings will have
taken place when this thing restarts
we'll find out in just a moment so let's
go over tools again
I'm sorry debug options and settings
Python tools inner environment
alright so I did it did take effect
maybe I just automatically restarts I
didn't think it would do that alright so
let me open up my my project here
okay alright so I wouldn't have it after
it restarts you can see that I'm getting
an error message that says that Python 3
5 is unsupported it's a 64-bit version
Visual Studio is 32-bit I don't know
that that has that has anything to do
with this particular problem but it
looks like if we visit this link there
may be an update to Python tools that
needs to be updated but that's despite
you know what this video is about so
this video is not about debugging why
three five doesn't work in Visual Studio
but that is how you actually change your
supported python version and Visual
Studio and most likely if you have the
error that I do you need to go ahead and
download the latest update all right
guys thanks for watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
