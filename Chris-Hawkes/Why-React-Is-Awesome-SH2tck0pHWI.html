gonna be talking about why react is
awesome so if you're trying to sell your
your boss or whatever on why react is a
good idea for you this is just gonna be
somewhat of a consolidated effort to try
to to help you out with that so let's go
ahead and get started here
alright so react is the view and MVC
architecture which is Model View
controller goes back all the way I think
to the days of small talk in the 1970s
but started re-emerging back into what
the late 90s when we started having
frameworks web frameworks that came out
so with react it doesn't try to be the
full feature framework it doesn't handle
routing it doesn't handle making calls
to the database and things like that
it's not a server-side technology
although you can have it be rendered
server-side which is beyond the scope of
this conversation but this this project
is all about just essentially being the
view so it can be considered a template
engine react is about building reusable
components which is actually the future
of web development so we've been talking
about that for a little bit it's
maintained and developed by the guys
over at Facebook so some of the best
developers in the world are working for
Facebook right now
they can just simply afford to pay for
the top talent so some of the best
developers like in the entire world are
working on this project react did have a
problem with its license before but now
and it's MIT license so it's completely
free for both business and commercial
purposes and and it always was that way
but there was a little bit of a caveat
to that license that they had before
that basically said that you couldn't
sue Facebook over any sort of patent
dispute and still be able to use react
but they went ahead and they updated the
license to not have to have that
language because a lot of companies were
still skeptical of it and that only just
recently happened a few months ago so
react is actually going to get a lot
more probably adoption because of of
their license change which just recently
happened like I said now it's all
JavaScript so if react has a certain JSX
language that it uses and it's not
really its own language but it's a way
that you write code essentially where
it's really just calling JavaScript
functions that then transfers that JSX
code to regular JavaScript so even JSX
is technically just JavaScript but it is
a different way that you kind of write
your templates out from within react so
that it it can use JavaScript to then
build HTML and I'll get into that a
little bit more in just a second
alright so the unidirectional data flow
is just easier to reason about one of
the problems with like angular it uses
this this vibe bi-directional or two-way
data-binding
and it was just it was very difficult
for people to reason about their UI
state changes that would rerender and
everything so with react it's all about
this this parent-child architecture so
if a child is inside of a parent making
go ahead and fire an event that it gets
passed to its parent the parent
maintains the state for all of its
components in the child components
inside of that component and the state
change will then re render all children
come components and in react just does
that for you out of the box so it's
considered a decorative library so you
just you write things in a certain way
and then react handles all that
complexity for you and it's actually
very highly tuned and efficient and
everything and you just don't have to
think about a lot of those UI state
changes it just handles that for you and
if you've ever had to use jQuery to fire
like custom events to then like remove
Dom elements and insert Dom elements and
stuff like that it's a it's a it's a
friggin nightmare and like that's what
reactive solving and it does it better
than than other view engines and a lot
of full-featured frameworks like angular
and things like that so we're now seeing
some of those those projects copying off
of some of the things that react as well
and I still think that the entire
angular 2 debacle that happened where
they basically were talking about
completely rewriting angular and
everything in the 1.0 series was going
to become outdated and everything it was
kind of a knee-jerk reaction to reiax
entry into the market and how quickly it
was being adopted and then just how how
much easier it was for people to be able
to write complex UI's using this
architecture that facebook recommends
all right so components make react
highly reusable I already told you about
it is about reusing components I mean
it's it's the future of web development
so the components like I just talked to
you about the the parent-child
relationship like so every component can
State and then it also has property so
if it doesn't have to maintain or worry
about state changes and you just need to
pass some data to the component then you
would use properties but if if those if
those pieces of data need to cause the
component to act a certain way or to be
rendered if something changes and such
that's where you would then use States
so there's a difference between property
and state but the entire architecture of
the of the react component is just it
built with reusability in mind that you
can literally take components that
you've created and if you make them in a
generic enough way you should just be
able to drag them into any different
application that you're building and
then just you know interact with the API
for that component and I've seen it done
firsthand and major companies all right
react has a relatively small API so
getting up and running should only take
a matter of a few weeks to a few months
for most experienced developers so I
think even senior developers if you have
decent JavaScript skills like you're
going to be up and running with react
probably in just a couple of weeks if
you've never had any JavaScript or
anything it's probably gonna take months
maybe even a year if like you're
literally just starting but the react
learning curve is definitely much less
so than than some of these other
libraries out there that are being used
genius actually it is actually not a
piece of so a lot of people tell
you that like the JSX language I
actually hated it when I first saw it
like I just absolutely I thought it was
disgusting and then I like waited a few
months I came back into react because I
it was it was still gaining popularity
and I started playing with JSX again and
I was just like oh this thing is such a
piece of because it mixes the
concerns of HTML and JavaScript you're
writing JavaScript that is rendering
HTML typically and in the old days like
you want to separate those concerns and
we always talk about separation of
concerns from with NIT well JSX kind of
broke those rules and I think it rubbed
a lot of developers the wrong way but
eventually that stuff started catching
on to me and I understood why JSX was
making my life so much easier when I was
writing react code when I first got
started with react actually avoided JSX
I was writing a knowledge and just all
JavaScript and clearly that's just not
the best way to go about writing react
and you'll know quickly when I'm talking
once you get involved in that so react
to me is for mobile apps and virtual
reality the API and the architecture and
the way that you build your react
projects are it's basically just a a set
of rules that you're following to declar
truly lay out your components and
everything else just just works for you
if you do if you lay the components out
properly so with that same architecture
now you can now build mobile apps using
reacts native project and then you can
also get into virtual reality with
reactive VR and that essentially allows
you to have the opportunity to be a web
mobile and VR developer with just one
set of API so you have to learn and
things like that now there are some
differences like it's not like you're
gonna be able to run into our certain
reactive web development just run right
in there and start doing VR stuff like
there are going to be some differences
there but you're also going to find a
lot of similarities it's like oh yeah I
understand this documentation because
this this also applies to the web part
or this also applies to the react native
part and things like that so that is
pretty awesome toy they definitely
provides you more opportunity to build
different types of apps so react has a
huge community of support as well like
you're gonna find a ton of documentation
and support on blogs vlogs like Stack
Overflow now has over 70,000 questions
and then just just simply like you know
github and everything else so you're
just gonna have a lot of documentation
on there a lot and you're gonna have a
lot more now that they've changed their
license and more and more people are
going to be adopting it so you can see
it is gaining adoption here the Google
Trends like react came out around this
time you can just see it's just steadily
started climbing and and I've seen this
firsthand in the industry as well so I
really think that we're going to
continue to see react to start exploding
in 2018 2019 and then react developers
make a lot so according the Glassdoor
the average react developer is making
about a hundred and five thousand a year
I can actually vouch for the fact that I
had a job that was making way more than
that and that in an area that wasn't
even that expensive to live in so it
definitely there was there's opportunity
out there for react developers
so react is used by a lot of major
companies and products I know Facebook
and Instagram roam by the you know
Facebook obviously owns Instagram but
still it is a different product a
different code base and everything else
so these are just a few of them which is
a Khan Academy Dropbox Netflix Instagram
and Facebook but there are many many
other like major major companies that
are using react alright guys so that's
all I got in this video make sure you
vote up and subscribe to the channel I
appreciate all the support you guys take
care have a good day and have fun
learning react bye so this video was
brought to you by a dead mountain coding
boot camp they're a boot camp that is
based out of Utah but they're also in
Texas in Arizona now and they have very
good reviews so make sure you guys check
them out the link is in the description
tab below they offer courses in web
development iOS development UX or user
experience design Quality Assurance and
just a few other ones in fact they're
even getting into Salesforce as well now
so they're continuing to adapt their
courses based on what the market needs
are and major companies are hiring some
of their alumni so make sure you guys
give them a look they have great reviews
and thanks for watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
