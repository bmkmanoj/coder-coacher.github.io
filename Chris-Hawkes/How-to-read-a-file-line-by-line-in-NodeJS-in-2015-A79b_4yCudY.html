talking about in this video is with our
note project what is the best way to be
able to open up a large file and read it
line by line and in this example I have
this this large geography file which is
basically a ton of lines here it's like
three and a half Meg and I want to be
able to parse this thing line by line on
my no js' server and there's multiple
ways of doing it and most of them are
outdated so the reason why I decided to
make this video is just so that we have
one updated version of how we should be
going about this at least you know
probably for the next year or so until a
better module is made so let's go ahead
and get started here now you're gonna
need the fs module which is which is
part of nodejs and that allows you to
actually read files and open files it
stands for file systems so you just
wanna make sure you have a require in
there somewhere and what I would I have
going on here is I have a method that's
in this this entire section of code is
going to be executed when I search but
I'll show you guys in just a moment but
what we need to do is go ahead and and
use our FS to create a reach stream and
the reach stream is actually going to be
the file that it is that we want to open
so it's good and I'm creative variable
and I'm just gonna call an input and
we'll say it equals FS and FS is that
file system module that I was talking
about that we just required and then
we're gonna call create read stream and
then here is just where you're gonna
give a path to the actual file that
you're trying to open so mine is located
in
alright there it is
duplicate well yeah I already have that
defined anyway I'll get rid of that all
right so now we have our outreach stream
defined we're gonna go ahead and create
a variable called RL which stands for
read line and here we're gonna go ahead
and require another module which is the
best way to actually read line by line
from a memory stream and nodejs
and that's the read my module so we
require read line and then we're going
to say create interface
all right so I'll require redlined I'll
create an interface now we need to go
ahead and say input and we're going to
give it the input variable that we just
created up here which is just a
reference to a file stream and we also
need to do in an additional argument
which is um terminal false if you're
using the latest version of node as of
the time of this writing or this video
this terminal equals terminal false is
gonna be a big thing because it won't
work without it so just to kind of recap
this is the code that we just added
right here alright now we can go ahead
and execute some code for every line
that RL comes across on this big-ass
file that we're we're trying to read
so we'll say RL dot on and then we'll
just call it line will parse the same
line by line
all right so let me go ahead and I'm
gonna fire up my server so the app is
started here and it's um it's this
personal project here and the code
should be fired when I click find work
so you can see that it's actually
reading through that big-ass file
line-by-line and printing it out to the
console and I don't need that to finish
but anyway guys um that's going to sum
up how you actually read a file
line-by-line
and I'm assuming you wanted to do
something with you know each line if
you're looking for a certain thing or
something like that you would do it
obviously inside of this this area here
instead of just printing it to the
command console but for the entire
videos just this highlighted section is
what we what we had to write alright
guys thanks for watching and please
