bit of a cold sorry if I sound sick and
clogged up whatever but I have a good
question here and it's from Trenor Jones
he says would you recommend learning
Python or node for back-end development
and this is a tough question because
when it comes to back in development I
mean I would like to know what it is
that you're really building there but
when I was first getting started
developing and nodejs wasn't an option
so here's the nodejs website and nodejs
guys is a technology stack that is
written in both C and C++ that actually
uses JavaScript you see write the code
in JavaScript but technically javascript
is a scripting language but it it's
almost like it gets a little bit blurry
as in a programming language because the
programming language versus a scripting
language is if it's a scripting language
it means that it doesn't have to be
compiled before it can be run and in the
most case you know in in Java JavaScript
it runs right in the browser right you
don't to compile anything so it's
technically a scripting language but
with no js' it blurs the lines a little
bit because like I said no jazz is
really C and C++ and it does have to be
compiled down a machine code and you
write JavaScript in order to interface
to it so in that sense JavaScript could
then be considered somewhat of a
compiled in a you know actual
programming language and also it almost
sounds like a little bit degrading it to
me and in some ways to be to say that
you know javascript is just a scripting
language and c-sharp is this great
object or any language or some you
know that the fact of the matter is this
javascript is some of the most complex
you know that we have to deal with
now because of all the libraries and
tools and tool sets we have and
everything so you know that it has a
don't level of complexity on you know
just as much as other languages out
there so it I don't think it you know we
should look at it in any sort of
inferior way but anyway so when I was
first getting started development I no
js' wasn't an option and then when I
first started becoming an option it was
still very very questionable you know
where the project was going you know
there's a lot of hype around it and
everything so now you fast forward to
today and nodejs isn't really in the
option out there anymore it's it's you
know it's something that's kind of
tried-and-true it's it's approaching ten
years in the market at least something
close to that maybe not 10 years but
anyway it's been around for a long time
and we're seeing major stacks now using
it obviously they've been using it for
years now so you know it's the real deal
thing I mean doing a node J a stack with
MongoDB and things like that you can
have a big corporate app but you know
back and when I was first getting
started like if you compare that to like
Python and Django I would say that you
know Django was also somewhat of a
underdog compared to like Ruby on Rails
and even asp.net and some of the Java
frameworks but you know Django was I
don't know it was very reliable so I
really like Django in fact um I jumped
when I was first getting started I
actually started off with uh with Django
this is after messing around for quite a
while actually but I started off with
Django and one of my first apps was
actually written in Django but then I
started running into some issues with
you know doing when I started getting to
a decent level of complexity and for me
complexity was no database-driven design
and and getting people to comment and
sub late that's it I believe we're not
like you know things that I find to be
simple you know wasn't simple at all
when I was first starting and Django I
really I found I ran into some you know
some complexity I thought so I ended up
moving to web to PI which was a
framework that unfortunately really
hasn't made a ton of progress it looks
like over the years but Massimo you know
he like he was a college professor in
Chicago area or Illinois somewhere and
um you know he was very helpful you work
like all kinds of hours and things like
that trying to make sure the community
was up to date and a gun in Brno and
everything and I just found the
community a lot more tight-knit and they
were open much more open to some of the
newbies where you know I didn't really
see that in Django but anyway so I ended
up going back to Django the one saw my
first app actually did get to point on a
Google App Engine using web 2 pi and
that was new music when I was running
that thing and that was around for a
little while and then I realized that I
didn't want to host on the Google app
it was just too expensive so I ended up
moving back to Django alone the
webfaction so anyway the thing is though
is is if I compare Django to no js' and
I look at no js' you're going to use a
framework so you're going to use Express
JS probably when you get to pick your
own template engine if you use something
like Django for back-end then you know
it's going to have its own template
engine for you you can use you know
different jena template engines now in
django and i know this isn't really a
django versus no discussion but the
point is if i were looking at a back-end
framework i would probably be looking at
django if we're looking for a framework
for nodejs I would probably looking at
Express I suppose you could use sales
I believe it's sales jeaious right which
I haven't used and I'm a little bit
hesitant but I mean it looks like a lot
of people are talking about it's more
full-stack more comparable to something
like Django so with express man it would
take me like you know at least a month
worth of side work and things like that
in order to build the authentication
administration piece that Django has
right out of the box so it really just
depends on what you're trying to make
when I was doing a hipster code this was
a project I made back earlier this year
and I said and actually about time this
video comes out of it been 2006 but
anyway the this website like I needed to
be able to come to a payment prop
provider I need authentication logins a
lot of stuff and I just felt like you
know Python would have been the better
choice for the back end because I didn't
feel like writing all the stuff that I'd
have to write using something like
nodejs and Express but if I were going
to build something truly new and if I
were going to you know simply REST API s
and single page apps and maybe doing a
uh no sequel database like MongoDB the
nodejs is clearly the winner there and
it would make much more sense I mean
Django or even flask I mean there are
more built towards like the relational
databases from what I've seen if you
were going to go completely cutting-edge
back in you know restful api s and
something like Python I would look at
Falcon maybe for for ap is another one
is you know just recently I was playing
with a framework for music website
was working with which just recently
came out which is called sanic and I
have a video on sanic and how I actually
deployed it to a Lenovo bun to server
pretty easily and it's very very fast so
it's very node like so if you're looking
for nodejs speed you're not going to
find out what flask or Django but there
are Python libraries out there that that
can compete with the speed and that look
at that like I said sanic also Falcon
which is very good and then there's also
the e which is for restful api eyes but
I'm not sure how I ran into some issues
with Eve last time I messed with it but
the project definitely seems to be going
strong now the benefit with node though
and this is one of the major things was
that I was saying if I'm saying this in
my head actually and I could respond to
your comment but if if you're doing web
development even if you think that
you're just gonna be doing back-end like
if you're on your own you're going to be
knowing some front-end stuff too so
you're going to have to write some
regular vanilla JavaScript I'm sure you
can use jQuery you're going to use some
sort of you know view Jas or angular
react whatever you might end up deciding
to use and there's gonna be a learning
curve there a JavaScript learning curve
so assuming you ever get into that field
and you don't want to limit yourself to
just a back-end guy the reason why no
J's shines as an example and really the
probably the winner in this day and age
of saying what do I recommend is just
simply because I can write back in coda
and JavaScript and I can also write
front-end code if I write back in code
in Python or whatever them still got the
right front-end code in JavaScript so
there's no getting around having to
learn JavaScript if you're going to be
doing any sort of full stack development
and with nodejs I mean obviously it
emerges as a clear winner in that regard
so it's it's I guess it's sad to say
because I like Python I've always been a
huge Python fan but if that is your
aspiration to be a back-end developer
and maybe do some front-end you clearly
want to use nodejs and if you want to
get hit the ground running though
because if you're going to extend the
nodejs ecosystem then you're going to be
writing C and C++ so you're kind of
limited to whatever those guys are doing
and no
we're with Python the benefit of using
something like you know sanic and your
writing you know Python library for
backing code you would be able to
contribute to the sanic project much
easier more Falcon or whatever it is
you're working on because it's it's just
Python code and same thing with Django
so with you know expressed yes I mean
obviously if you contribute to that
because it's just JavaScript but as soon
as you start getting into the core
engine or whatever then you know that's
where you know you would need other
skills besides just JavaScript in the
node ecosystem so that's a really good
question and I think you know these
types of questions are great so keep
asking them to me guys because my
thoughts I think change somewhat with
not just experience but also just simply
as the tides of development change
already this channels going on almost
for years so you know things change over
that time and and you know my opinions
on some of these things change so the
you know these videos that I've done in
the past and sometimes years ago I need
to be updated to more mule relevant here
and now type of discussion alright guys
so that's it for this video make sure
you guys up vote comment subscribe and
thank you for all your support
and bye hey guys so a lot of you asked
me how do I get my foot in the door to
become a programmer and I just wanna
take a moment to mention dev Mountain
coding boot camp is a 12-week intensive
course that focuses on the technologies
of the here-and-now for web development
some of the things that they're actually
teaching in this 12-week course it's
geared to get you into the industry by
focusing on things like jQuery nodejs
react angular how to use github so a lot
of the things that you're going to need
to do as a developer as soon as you
start they're going to be teaching you
in this and this coding bootcamp and the
entire goal is to be able to get you
into the industry within 12 weeks so if
you guys are interested in learning more
