react Redux tutorial series and I'm
actually aiming to do this tutorial
series and on multiple different
frameworks because I know everybody is
very opinionated on the type of
frameworks they want to use whether it's
Express or Python Django or flask or
something else so I want to go ahead and
get started on how to actually set up
all this stuff for your project because
just for a forewarning react Redux I
think is not for the faint of heart I
mean it's it's a relatively complex
thing to get everything initially going
and once you have it going you could
probably make make your way through
everything pretty well but getting that
stuff initially set up I think is the
biggest headache so for right now we're
going to go ahead and I have this react
Redux tutorials video and I'm going to
create a new folder which we're going to
start with Express Redux in fact you
know what I'm going with the whole thing
react three dogs because Redux is not
necessarily for just react stuff but
they are hand-in-hand so I'm going to go
ahead and open up my command prompt to
the folder location where we just set up
everything and I want to go ahead and
first let's say NPM I knit and this is
actually going to go through the process
of creating a configuration file which
NPM is the package manager that we're
going to use to install RIA react and
redux and everything so I'm going to say
we need to actually make this all
lowercase so I'll go ahead and say react
redux in fact I don't even up like a now
oh yeah I can have underscores sorry I
didn't know if you could a simple react
Redux express j/s application and then
this can all be blank I'll put my name
Chris Hawkes and just say yes all right
so now we've done that we have this
package JSON file so if I set MPM
install - - save Express then this is
actually going to add express to our
package JSON file and also install
Express locally so the difference
between local and global is that if you
install global
then if you have different versions of
Express you can end up having conflicts
within your project so I try to keep
everything localized so I don't I don't
want to mix that stuff so now we have
this node modules folder where Express
just went ahead and installed and this
is actually where things get a little
bit more complicated but before we even
jump into the actual installing of react
and redux and stuff like that I want to
go ahead and just get the basic
expression AS application running so one
of the things that we're going to need
which we might as well install now is a
template engine that does not come with
Express by default we're going to
install pub which is actually the new
name for what used to be the Jade
template engine and interestingly they
wouldn't change the name I actually have
a tutorial series if you look at my name
and poke tutorials there's some some
tutorial videos there I'm learning how
to use the pub template engine it's
relatively simple I think I only have
like five or six videos there but it's
good it's good enough to give you a
heads up on on how the overall template
engine works but that's definitely
something that we need to have all right
so the next thing I'm going to suggest
is you're going to need some sort of
code editor to write your code in and I
recommend Visual Studio code because it
makes debugging so much easier it's
cross-platform and it's completely free
one of the best products Microsoft has
created in a very long time I think and
definitely recommend it will make
debugging so much easier so that's
actually what I'm going to be using in
this this series here and I have Visual
Studio open right now into the folder of
our project that we just created if we
take a look at the package you can see
has all its information that we
prefilled for our project including the
two dependencies that we install which
is expressed in pug' and then now that I
have both of those we want to go ahead
and create our main app JFS file which
is going to be the main entry point for
our nodejs application or Express
application so the first thing we need
to do is define Express we're going to
save our Express equals require and then
we're just going to import the request
framework and then we're gonna say
variable app equals Express
and we're executing the function to
create our express app and now we need
to say apt-get which we're defining our
first entry point which is just a
forward slash which is our home page and
we'll say function request and response
these are just normal HTTP objects and
then inside of this function here we're
going to say resource send hello Redux
and reacts alright so now that we have
that we need to then go ahead and tell
it to listen on port 30 so a function
console dot log listening to this joint
on port 3000
alright so that's our basic expressjs
application so now with our app.js
folder selected we should be able to go
to debug and click on this little green
button and then say no js' is our
environment it's going to create this
config full file for us and we should
just build it lunch or just close that
out make sure you go back to app chaos
and click Play and this should now
actually run the program but it's saying
that there is a problem so for whatever
reason if we look at the launch JSON
file which is in this vs code folder
that got created for us it's not finding
this workspace root it's actually
because it's not adding Express it's
actually adding the root which is weird
so we need to say on here Express react
Redux I've actually not run into this
problem before I'm wondering if it's
because in my folder is actually in my
actual seed directory I usually have
things in a subdirectory called projects
but either way that shouldn't happen
either way it doesn't matter just put
this in there and it will work so
Express react read off SAP J s and then
go back over and we click our little
debug icon and press the play button and
this should now logout it says listening
to this joint important and then if we
open up a browser and we go over to our
127.0.0.1 : 3000 because after the colon
is the actual port number you can see
hello react Redux so now we have our
basic application running but now we
need to actually implement our
templating engine but before we can even
do that we need to actually get our
static files so that we can have CSS and
JavaScript be rendered by Express and in
order to do that after we've defined our
app we need to say app dot u is Express
static and we'll just say public so all
of our stuff will go into the public
directory which is kind of the nodejs
status quo so let's go ahead and create
that folder now so in the same folder is
the express react redux let's create a
folder called public and the inside of
public we're going to create a folder
called j/s another one called CSS which
for some reason got put in the j sy
lecture it's all in the public folder
and then we'll have another one for IMG
and drag that into the public so now we
have the three alright and then inside
my CSS I'm going to add just a main dot
CSS file so we can test this and we'll
do h1 color red so this is just using
CSS so for any h1 styles that should be
rendered another thing we need to do in
order to get this all set up is let's go
over to our app JFS and after we did our
public let's go ahead and do another
statement that says app dot set view
engine and then give it the name pub
since we installed that and then we want
to go ahead and create our first pogue
let's see here we'll create our first
pub template but now expressed by it by
default is going to look for all your
templates to be in a folder called views
so let's go ahead and add our views
folder and then inside here we're going
to create our first index dot pub file
all right and then let's go back over to
our app KS and here we're going to say
instead of resource sites and we're
going to say resource render and once
again if I'm going fast I apologize I'm
trying to get this this tutorial going
and you guys could always pause I'm sure
to just you know to catch up or whatever
but resource dot render is going to
render the actual index pub file that we
have here so let's go ahead and create
the pub file so in our Polk file let's
go to so make sure you have Pope's
selected and we're going to go ahead and
write some of the code we say doctype
and then HTML and then everything's just
kind of indented we'll say head title
equals this is a redux app will say body
I'm not a huge fan by the way of
actually what we'll say welcome to redux
i'm not a huge fan of this this pug
template engine by the way i've never
been a fan of this type of stuff that
tries to make HTML so much easier I feel
like HTML is already relatively easy
enough but you know teach there owns a
lot of people like to spoke stuff so
another thing too is I want to let you
know that I do have a tutorial video on
actually getting started with poke so
like if you just search poke tutorial
Chris walks you can see that I have this
pug image and everything check out that
video alright so we need to restart our
server and if you get this message when
you restart to server that it can't look
up the index view you can see what's
going on here we have this root
directory and then it's looking for
views but our project doesn't exist
there it actually exists inside of
express react redux within that root
directory so another thing just make
sure that the views folder is inside the
express react redux folder so you can
see my views is in there and then we
need to add a line just above the poke
statement where we're going to say you
know what for all view requests
use the current root directory plus the
view so that way it will point to the
view directory and press ctrl s to save
and then we can restart by doing just
this restart button and if we look and
watch this in action you can see that it
displays now another thing we have a pug
template error once again I'm not a huge
fan of pug but if we go in and we fix
that Jade Jade or pug whatever you want
to call it doesn't need the the equal
sign or the parentheses which is weird
because I believe in an older version it
used to but it looks like it doesn't
need that anymore and you can see that
it's automatically fixed there so now we
have an actual template engine working
although our CSS is not actually working
because we need to go ahead and add it
all right so in order to get this static
file it's working first we need to go
ahead and over here on the app dot use
we're going to say static so just
forward slash static make sure there's a
comma here and then here we need to do
the same thing we did down here because
of our root directory is all kind of it
so it's not really working correctly by
default with this express app which is
kind of annoying but we need to just
tell it specifically where this public
folder is so what we're doing is we're
saying all static requests used the root
directory which is this folder here and
also the public folder to handle that so
we have our CSS and that's where our
main is so if we go into the Jade or
poke template engine in order to do an
external stylesheet we go ahead and we
just down here under the title we can
say link and then inside parentheses
relation equals stylesheet and then
comma is going to be the href and this
will be the actual location to where our
static CSS can be found so we want to
reference the static folder so the
express knows to use that public
directory then we can say CSS name dot
CSS all right so now that we've done
that let's go ahead and restart the
server and if we revisit our page you
can see that the main CSS is now being
rendered so that's how we have our
Express J's writing in just under 13
minutes so in the next videos we're
going to get into the
react Redux side and all the
installation that we have to do to get
that working alright guys thanks for
watching make sure you subscribe share
this and vote up if you would I
appreciate it and check out some of my
other videos if you're interested take
care have a good night and bye hey guys
so a lot of you asked me how do I get my
foot in the door to become a programmer
and I just want to take a moment to
mention dev Mountain coding boot camp is
a 12-week intensive course that focuses
on the technologies of the here-and-now
for web development some of the things
that they're actually teaching in the

the industry by focusing on things like
jQuery nodejs react angular how to use
github so a lot of the things that
you're going to need to do as a
developer as soon as you start they're
going to be teaching you in this and
this coding bootcamp and the entire goal
is to be able to get you into the
industry within 12 weeks so if you guys
are interested in learning more
