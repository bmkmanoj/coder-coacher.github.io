fourth video of this series and in this
video we want to actually get react
rendering something on our page so that
we know that it's working before we get
into the redux so let's go ahead and
open up our index J template and I want
to add a div and then inside here I'm
gonna say app is the name of the IP and
that needs to be in parentheses so now
it's going to make sure that this is in
there if we refresh you can see that we
have this div ID app so that's good and
let's go ahead and over in our j/s
folder let's create our first just say
let's say what we call it we can call it
f JS that's fine this would be like our
entry point to the application and
that's at the top here we're gonna be
using babel and web packs ability to be
able to import stuff that we need so
we're gonna say import react from react
and this is actually the modern way that
importing is going to be working in
JavaScript which is a very new thing for
us are going to import specifically
render and s is specifically important
only a section of a file you do it this
way in JavaScript by saying render
inside these curly braces and we'll say
from react
alright so now we're importing two
things that we need and down here what
we're gonna do is we'll say render I'm
gonna say div div and now we're writing
JSX so if you guys have ever done react
code you know that this isn't quite
normal JavaScript we're actually writing
HTML inside of our JavaScript and it's
really weird so we're gonna say hello
react and all react components inside
JSX always have to be contained there
has to be one outer outer div basically
or container that holds all the inner
containers so now in this render
function after this JSX code we want to
say document dot get element by ID and
then we're going to pass in the name app
all right so now let's go over to the
counter app and we want to say from will
say actually import what do we call this
now it's really not even necessary our
main app can be inside this counter app
folder and that's actually where it's
going to be you know we're gonna copy
all of this information here and we're
just gonna put it right inside of our
counter app this is gonna make things
easier to deal with I think and just go
ahead and delete this app das folder or
a bjs and inside this counter app yeah
we just want everything to be right here
that way there's really no need to have
another app because this is our main
entry point to the application and we
can actually rename this to App ojs so
now we don't have to change anything
inside of our web pack well actually we
do need to change this to app touch yes
I just want to create this app touch a
SSB like the main entry point to
everything so now we've done that if
everything goes well you're gonna see
that our watch is continuing to run
based on our last video this is always
listening for any sort of changes that
are being done to our entry point and
since we change the the actual file name
from the counter app to just regular app
and then that way it's much more generic
for everybody else that might be running
or watching along on this video series I
just want to restart the web pack
watching since we've now changed the
name over to app so this will be our
starting point for the application as
this thing gets bigger and bigger
essentially app is going to be what what
basically the starting point of
everything and it's going to end up
importing and using other pieces of
functionality that we're gonna see later
on as far as how to implement Redux into
our our application but the app can be
considered like the main the main part
of it all right so now that we've done
that let's go ahead and refresh our page
and you can see hello react is now being
bound to our div id app and while we're
in here let's go ahead and get rid of
this react Redux statement so go over to
our index top hug and we're gonna get
this statement here so our entire UI is
gonna be rendered by our bundle j/s
folder which is web pack bundling all
the react Redux stuff into one file and
that's what I was trying to tell you
guys but this whole compilation thing
that the what we need a debug is inside
of our bundle das file and obviously
there's quite a bit of stuff that goes
on in here so as we in import it and use
react and react aam you can see that the
file got much much larger so now we have
a 21,000 line file that we have to that
is actually doing this rendering and it
seems like overkill and it absolutely is
to render one single a header tag but I
mean as the the application gets much
much bigger than then this will make
more sense but for right now I just
wanted to stick to this video and
getting react GS running within our
application alright guys thanks for
watching please subscribe bye hey guys
so a lot of you asked me how do I get my
foot in the door to become a programmer
and I just want to take a moment to
mention dev Mountain coding boot camp is
a 12-week intensive course that focuses
on the technologies of the here-and-now
for web development some of the things
that they're actually teaching in the
Suevi course it's geared to get you into
the industry by focusing on things like
jQuery nodejs
react angular how to use github so a lot
of the things that you're going to need
to do as a developer as soon as you
start they're going to be teaching you
in this and this coding bootcamp and the
entire goal is to be able to get you
into the industry within 12 weeks so if
you guys are interested in learning more
information about dev mountain coding
bootcamp just check out the link in the
description tab of this video thank you
for watching and have a good day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
