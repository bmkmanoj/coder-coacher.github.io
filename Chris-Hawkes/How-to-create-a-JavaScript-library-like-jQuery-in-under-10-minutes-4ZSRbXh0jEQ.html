gonna be looking at how to make a
JavaScript library like a framework
similar to something like jQuery the way
they do it to where you can have a
either powerful library like jQuery or
something a lot smaller that's more
specific to one thing in this example
we're gonna start off very very small
and basic so it doesn't get confusing I
have a directory structure here of a
website and my static file here's my
JavaScript folder so since the libraries
from the JavaScript we're gonna
obviously put it in there so the first
things first I'm going to create a
JavaScript file and this will be the
name of the front of the framework that
I'm building I'm just gonna call it
Bayside for reasons I'll explain later
on and inside this folder what we need
to do is we need to say function and
this means that it's going to execute as
soon as the page loads or as soon as the
document inside the page loads all right
and javascript has a feature where you
can say you strict and the only other
language i've ever seen this in is it's
perl because you can write some very
ugly sloppy code that does crazy things
without expecting or without knowing
that you've done that perl lights lets
you do it so there's a strict mode to
prevent certain things like accessing
undeclared variable so javascript has
the same built-in protections now with
the latest version of javascript version
of ECMAScript 5 so we can say you script
are you strict at the top so after we
use our strict statement there what I
want to do is I want to create a
function which is going to be the
function that gets called any time this
document loads and there isn't a global
variable by the name of our framework
already created and this function will
be executed to go ahead and create that
growing global variable so that we can
access the bayside framework similar to
jQuery within any sort of page that has
jQuery included in it so the same
concept here what we're gonna do is just
say function and we'll say define base
side open and close parentheses and then
open curly brace inside here we're going
to create just one one method on our
library and it's just going to be a
simple alert message for testing so
we'll say Bayside and the name of the
function that you'll call is alert and
that's gonna equal a function open and
close brackets and then the function is
simply just gonna say this is a test
message from the Bayside framework in
case you're interested on Bayside the
name of the framework is going to be
named after one of my favorite rock
bands which is named Bayside from New
York City so in this function here you
can see that define Bayside when it gets
called it returns a Bayside object so
that's all this function does and inside
that Bayside object it declares a method
that you can call which is Bayside alert
and that will call and execute this
alert statement here all right so let's
go ahead and add to this and we want to
say when this document loads and when
it's executed we're going to say if
typeof Bayside and equals in JavaScript
has this crazy three equal sign equal
statement which is drives me crazy but
anyway equals undefined then we're gonna
go ahead and instantiate it so we'll say
window dot Bayside equals and then we
just call the defined Bayside method
that we just created so what this is
doing is whenever it loads if the
Bayside isn't in the global very a
global namespace meaning it hasn't been
declared yet and it equals undefined
it's going to go ahead and instantiate
the Bayside object and it does that here
by calling this method
all right after the squiggly bracelets
go ahead and close this off and we're
gonna say a window
all right and that's it that is the
entire library so now in order to be
able to use this library we have this
Bayside JavaScript folder or file and we
need to go ahead and include that into
our HTML and hopefully you know to
include a JavaScript file but you can
see that i have i'm using a Django web
framework so this is just specific to
Django but you just add the source where
your file can be found Django has a
shortcut where I can say static j/s and
then Bayside Jas okay I'm going to
upload this to my web server so that we
can test it so I've uploaded it to my
web server and let's go ahead and just
view the page source and see if we can
find it here and this is actually out of
date
let me see I'm gonna try to refresh this
all right so we view the page source of
the website here you can see that's
including the base side JavaScript and
we should be able to see that our code
that we just created is available all
right so now that we know that it is
available let's go ahead and and call
that that framework so I'm simply just
gonna do a script statement right here
and all I'm gonna do is say base side
alert and you can see my editor finds it
for me and he's out of the quote open
and closed parenthesis and close that
off and if everything goes well when we
load this page we'll see that alert
message all right so let's go ahead and
refresh this
you know one of the things I actually
forgot to do was up here at the top we
need to actually instantiate the
variable Bayside here
so that was a completely silly of me to
forget that but if we go ahead and
upload it and we try this on our website
here we can see that the test message
from the brave base our framework it is
working so whatever so after we've done
that any sort of functions that you want
to exist I mean they can exist outside
of the base base base side namespace so
you could have like a function like add
and it adds two numbers and returns it
and this function could be called by you
know something inside like the base side
alert if you want to add additional
messages you could say like base I dot
find webpage or something like that and
they're gonna you can each going to Inc
equally function and the function could
take parameters and but that's that's
essentially it I mean the frameworks are
gonna get a lot more complicated the
more stuff you try to do with it but
that is all it takes actually getting a
library and JavaScript and being able to
access it throughout your webpage then
just to make sure you guys can see how
we used it you can see that actually did
wrap this in a document that ready but
it shouldn't even be necessary we can
actually just have it sitting inside
just a regular script you can see base
side alert it's being called and any
other function that you create you would
just call it the same way and like I
said if you needed to pass in a
parameter you can do that and just to
show you that the document already
shouldn't matter it works the same way
without the document already alright
guys thanks for watching that's how you
create a JavaScript library thank you
