actually spent quite a bit of time going
through and reading everybody's common
it's trying to respond to everybody if I
can and sometimes I get some good
comments where I feel like I just need
to make a video and ghost 227's hey
Chris let me ask you something man I see
you do a lot of things on windows so I'm
an aspiring self-taught programmer and
everywhere I go people say if you want
to be a programmer you got to get a mac
windows as garbage is there any truth to
that so is there any truth to that well
if you want to be a hipster douchebag
yeah there is some truth to that
nobody's using Mac's man I mean honestly
I'm just kidding a lot of people do use
macs but to be honest like I I attribute
the entire Mac crowd to the windows
crowd and I actually take a third-party
light outside the box stance on that and
I'm like for me I use windows because
let's face it ninety percent of the
users out there that own a PC they're on
a Windows operating system so that means
if i buy software it has to work on
windows and for the most part it does
work on windows because anybody that's
building software targets at windows
first environment why is that well it's
part of the reason why Bill Gates is the
richest man on earth and that Microsoft
is still a very relevant company that
that has more revenue and more profit
actually than even Google itself so
Microsoft is not a run of the mill or
fly-by-night company they they have been
around for quite a long time and granted
they've always been a proprietary which
means you know their solutions and
software has typically been closed
source meaning that you have to pay and
you get the production support from a
real company instead of like a crowd of
people that have come you know that have
that have given their time to create the
software with Microsoft products you
paid the top dollar but you get you know
this this top service in response now I
say top service whether you take that
with a grain of salt because we
obviously know that Microsoft lags
behind many other companies with a lot
of the things that they do if you
compare Bing to the Google search engine
you know being success everybody knows
that nobody's using being
windows the Internet Explorer is one of
the worst pieces of software I've ever
seen in my life especially anything
windows are and nice so anything
Internet Explorer all the way from like
10 down is just complete garbage even 11
is not very good and the edge browser
although it's made strides is not nearly
as good as chrome so there's just a lot
of sorry about that there's just a lot
of reasons why Microsoft is clearly an
inferior product when it comes to a lot
of other companies however they are a
major force to be reckoned with when it
comes to cloud the azure cloud is a
pretty big market for Microsoft and it's
going to continue to get bigger and
they're competing with the likes of
amazon and AWS and google with their
Google App Engine so Microsoft has has
definitely distinguished itself as a
cloud provider for a lot of companies in
addition their newest Visual Studio code
I rave about it all the time Visual
Studio code is a pretty awesome piece of
software this it's basically like the
atom editor but when it comes to Python
HTML like just the ease of use I've even
seen the Linux guys that have actually
said that that you know PyCharm or web
storm and all these different things
that people write code in you know
they're actually flocking over to Visual
Studio code because it is a great
product another thing is visual studio
for major you know development literally
millions of lines of code thousands of
files humongous projects in thousands of
developers the microsoft offers a lot of
good solutions when it comes to like
visual studio even their team foundation
server which is basically the source
code repository competitor to get a lot
of people most people use git but if
you're not using get there's still this
humongous corporate crowd that is using
team foundation server and you can still
write Microsoft code using something
like it as well so the thing is is like
you know is this is windows garbage well
it's real
late I hate windows like sometimes I
really do the other day windows install
a plug-in or it was like an update or
something but all I know is that every
once in a while this thing decides that
it needs to update my computer and it
will shut down 15 or 20 open projects
that I have and it doesn't care about
saving them or anything like that just
shuts them right down and restart the
only way to prevent that from happening
is to actually hack the windows registry
which you shouldn't you shouldn't have
to do that but with Windows 10 you know
they secretly made people download it
there's just there's so many shitty
things that they do but then again most
of the major companies do some pretty
shitty things anyway and and Microsoft
is no exception to that so are they
getting better they are because they're
releasing a lot of their stuff open
source their Rosalind compiler for C
sharp is actually now an open source
project the Visual Studio code is
cross-platform so you can use that to
develop on Mac Windows and Linux asherz
now you know they're spending a lot of
time saying hey you can deploy python
django website on azure as well as know
Jas on Azure so they know what they need
to do in order to stay relevant in
addition because C sharp and Microsoft
is not in the mobile space since android
is dominated by the java programming
language and objective-c and Swift is
going to control the apple side of the
equation and possibly c++ the microsoft
has taken strides as far as trying to
stay relevant by going out and
purchasing and acquiring these amerand
studios amarin now allows you to create
mobile apps on windows so and it is a
good option because it runs very close
to native and I've talked about this in
a previous video but xamarin is not a
fly-by-night company at all they are
used by major companies like JetBlue
kayak you know a lot of different major
companies are actually building their
mobile apps using microsoft dotnet c
sharp on the xamarin studios in addition
you know Microsoft they go out and they
get into the gaming world by working
with the Unity engine so C sharp is it
programming language of choice with
unity you know I've already mentioned
the cloud as far as like software
applications that run on a Windows
platform if you're trying to target
ninety percent of the market then yes
net is a very very very important option
I mean when it comes to software
development that you distribute like
there's no question between C sharp or
something like you know python python
has pie cutie and all these other you
know GUI editors and things like that
but they don't really compare to the
wind forms applications or to WPF the
bottom line is that i'm not a Microsoft
fanboy but I know enough being that I am
a c-sharp development I've seen you know
a lot of C sharp opportunity out there
that a lot of companies they choose
Microsoft because they will pay top
dollar in order to have what they feel
is like you know corporate backup and
corporate response any sort of major
outages or anything that they can end up
facing so what those people are telling
you is absolutely it's not true and just
for the record I have a website that I
run hipster cocom and this is something
that i use on a linux server so it's a
linux ubuntu and i run it in python
django so nothing to do with dotnet even
though i'm a c-sharp programming I write
C sharp most of the time as well as a
lot of JavaScript I still choose Python
so I think python is great and I'm not
some sort of Microsoft fanboy in fact
for the longest time I hated on
Microsoft but they've done a lot of
things recently to try to change their
image and try to be more open-minded to
the development community and in
addition the naysayers against Microsoft
you know a lot of that stuff is very
unfounded and there there's a true
there's there's both truth and it's
unfounded it's it's it's in the middle
but then again there is no perfect
solution so it really just depends on
you know what is it that you're trying
to do if you really feel like you're
going to be in a Python Python community
and that you're not going to be using
any sort of Windows or C sharp and
you're pretty much going to close the
door for any of those opportunities that
might arise then yes you know by all
means use a linux install or by you know
you're late
this macbook or something like that but
you know developing Python on a macbook
or Windows is very very similar in fact
this website for hipster code calm even
though it's running on a linux ubuntu
server I'm using Python I developed the
whole thing on a Windows platform and I
do and I then upload it in fact i use
FileZilla right here to actually upload
all my files to my linux server and it
just works so it doesn't really matter
what what operating system you use it
really doesn't because a lot of people
you know we've probably flabbergasted
the fact that i built a linux website
using python on a windows system and
that i have these you know this site
right here can run parallel on my
machine locally when i'm developing and
adding new features and things like that
to it so anyway that's my thoughts on
the subject don't believe everything you
read we're here anyway thanks guys have
a good night take care bye hey guys so a
lot of you asked me how do I get my foot
in the door to become a programmer and I
just want to take a moment to mention
dev Mountain coding boot camp is a 12
week intensive course that focuses on
the technologies of the here and now for
web development some of the things that
they're actually teaching in the suevi
course it's geared to get you into the
industry by focusing on things like
jQuery nodejs react angular how to use
github so a lot of the things that
you're going to need to do as a
developer as soon as you start they're
going to be teaching you in this and
this coding boot camp and the entire
goal is to be able to get you into the
industry within 12 weeks so if you guys
are interested in learning more
information about Deb mountain coding
boot camp just check out the link in the
description cab of this video thank you
for watching and have a good day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
