want to take a few minutes to talk about
programmer burnout and really just
programming in general as far as some of
the downsides to it some of you guys
have asked me like it's also being a
programmer right we get paid a lot of
money we get to do a lot of cool stuff
and how anybody who says that their job
sucks man they should try you know spend
some time in Old Town Alexandria
climbing around and crawlspaces with
some rats you know so if you if you
really think your life sucks you could
do that for twelve or fourteen dollars
an hour and I guarantee you're gonna be
bitching about that as well so I work
construction at one point and I was
commuting from Fredericksburg Stafford
area in Virginia to Springfield back
when I was working there and it
absolutely sucked ass like that job
sucked man like I would end up drinking
a whole bunch of coffee and sitting in
an hour and a half worth of traffic just
to get to the job and then having to
drive around all over Northern Virginia
and going from job site to job site
doing terrible jobs back-breaking work
to then get back in my car around you
know four o'clock that afternoon and
head back home and get back to the house
about six or six-thirty
granted I was getting up about you know
4:00 in the morning or so to be able to
try to beat some of the traffic just to
get up north and DC the traffic sucks
but my point behind all of this is that
your job your job sucks in general right
but this this construction company I was
working for what I was doing I was
supposed to be a plumber but I did more
HVAC work than anything but the you know
the job originally I think I was hired
at ten or twelve dollars an hour and I
ended up making up to fourteen before I
left but it was it was a terrible job
terrible experience and you didn't
really have any time off there wasn't
any time off it barely had benefits in
fact at one point that the company had
actually dropped your benefits because
they couldn't afford them so with
programming companies a lot of these
programming jobs you're in a white
collar office there's usually people
that are dressed up you know dressed
fancy you know there's usually younger
people a good combination of young and
old business professionals usually in a
business district
so people treat each other with better
respect than they do on the job site
it's just at least a you know that's
that's been my experience so it's a
whole it's a whole different world but
it doesn't mean
it doesn't have its own drawbacks like
being in a programming environment
sometimes you know you're given
unrealistic deadlines and that can lead
to programmer burnout programmer burnout
is when you effectively you know get put
on a death march a death march is a
project that doesn't really you know
that basically either has a
deadline or it's just not going to fully
realize its its goal or potential or
whatever and and the people in charge
don't want to let the you know hire up
people in charge understand that you
know that they have a problem with the
project and things like that so usually
it's a lack of communication that kind
of leads to that environment and that
can lead to burnout
I'm also but the unrealistic deadlines
so even if a company feels like you know
they can beat their you know their
employees like you know beat them like a
horse basically to get them to do what
it is that they need them to do you know
work 15 hours and days and things like
that it's actually you know that that's
a shitty thing and even if a company
gives you 25 days off for 30 days off
and a lot of times that's including sick
leave or vacations at least you have
vacations because a lot of other
companies don't give you any vacation at
all but if you can never use your
vacation because you're always on some
sort of a deadline than that you know
that that is obviously a problem that
that some development shops have now
sometimes deadlines are tight because of
different you know different things so
if a company is like perpetually are
always in some sort of tight deadline
 crazed environment then you
know I think that should be on you know
the management and the owners of the
company and if they have a high turnover
you know that should be on them because
it shouldn't be expected that somebody
gets a higher salary just because
they're gonna put in you know twice the
amount of effort as somebody that
doesn't work on a salary so that can
that can be a major problem in the IT
industry so once again I'll say though
that just because you have an
unrealistic deadline every now and then
maybe a few times a year or something
like that it doesn't mean that you
should you know you shouldn't try to put
in some extra time make things happen
because you know that shows you know it
obviously shows motivation it shows
loyalty and and the company generally
Awards that type of thing you
through comm time or something similar
comp time is when they give you a time
off because of all the time extra time
that you put in the problem though also
comes in when you have lack of
efficiency and a lack of yeah basically
just a lack of efficiency the longer you
work I mean you can only like scientific
evidence exists out there and I'd i
don't doubt any of it that says that you
will become less productive after a
certain period of time and there are
times that i come home and i literally
I'm like that I'm not looking at
code because I've looked at code too
much the problems were too difficult you
know too many issues throughout
the day maybe didn't get enough sleep
the night before whatever whatever have
you then there's that break that needs
to be taken and and if and if it feels
like you're not ever getting your breaks
or that you don't ever you know get to
unwind I think that also can lead the
programmer burnout and it's a real thing
because our job requires us to be
creative unlike artists that go out and
sketch on a canvas I suppose there's
that certain degree of artist that says
hey we need you to produce this this and
this buy this this in this date but a
lot of artists you know a lot of them
Michelangelo is it seems like they had
time and my opinion at least that's my
kind of my perception of it that they
had time to think about that sort of
stuff but in programming you're expected
to basically use an even deeper level
you know cognitive thinking and your
logical thinking to have to come up with
solutions and sometimes the solutions
you come up with aren't the best work
you've ever done it's just simply
because of some tight-ass deadlines that
you were up against exceptions are made
man I mean exceptions are made all the
time because everything is a trade-off a
good programmer should be lazy they
should they should be trying to protect
protect their craft and to perfect their
craft but they should also have enough
knowledge to really get the job done as
quickly as possible
I love the mindset that I wanna be able
to go home at the end of the day as
quickly as possible so you can take your
pretty code that's written you know
fifteen times over and is like this
perfect recursive algorithm gonna go
shove it straight up your ass
because if it took like all day or two
days or three days to try to come up
with something like that then you're an
asshole we have other stuff that we have
to do you know what I mean so but if you
could just write out code like that on
the fly day in and day out that's great
but a good senior programmer in my
opinion can get things done they can get
things done quickly because really when
you're working in a business environment
you're always up against some sort of
deadline I'd rather not have to spend my
evenings and weekends because it's going
to lead to you know more turnover less
productivity it increases our
productivity paradox that's been going
on in IT since the 1970s or so and and
really you know it can sometimes because
of assholes that have to have everything
perfect and then the other flip side of
that equation you have lazy
 who I might even be and
that's not actually I don't I don't
claim credit for that but you have the
other side of the equation that writes
terrible code that doesn't document
anything that doesn't really plan
anything out and then you have you know
that that productivity paradox that
could come into play there because of
the code being so shitty so there's
always a fine balance in between the two
things a lot of times it's just having a
good perspective if you came from a
background where you did have to do hard
work for much much less money then you
know having to spend a few extra hours
in the office you know with your free
snacks and your free coffee isn't that
big of a deal but if it's if like like I
said if it's if it's every project every
week every month you feel like you can't
take time off then it's you know then
the position is not worth you know the
higher salary because there's plenty of
positions out there that would pay you
most likely a little bit less more even
maybe the same amount depending on how
well they're run and and expect the same
level of productivity so that is
something that I think some programmers
have a hard time saying no to it's
similar to the game programming paradox
as well where it's like game programmers
are sometimes taken advantage of because
they're young kids who always wanted to
be a game developer and now they're
working at a game developer startup and
they're getting paid per line of code
and they're gonna put in all these extra
hours because they don't want to lose
their job they've been working their
whole life to become a game developer
and then they quickly realize that being
a game developer sucks ass because it's
a ton of code ton of work
and there's really just unless you make
your own games there's not like a you
know there's not as like I would say as
solid of a career path as like maybe a
web developer or a you know regular
desktop software developer so those are
my thoughts tonight guys make sure you
check out my two sponsors dead mountain
coding boot camp dev Mountain s 12 and
16 week courses they focus on jQuery
nodejs how to work in a git environment
amongst other developers so you're going
to be working firsthand with developers
are based out of Provo Utah in Dallas
Texas and they provide campus housing so
you have to reach out to them for more
information the link is in the
description tab below the video is also
sponsored by site one two three so if
you guys are looking to get a portfolio
out there to start showcasing some of
your talent you could start with site 1
through 3 while you're trying to build
up to actually setting up your own
servers and all the work that ends that
that entails so if you guys are trying
to save a little bit of time 7 1 2 3 is
an option and they did sponsor this
video so thanks for watching this this
content guys you guys have a good day
and please subscribe bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
