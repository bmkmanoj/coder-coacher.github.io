downtown San Antonio and this video I'm
just going to quickly mention relocating
as a developer and I'm not looking to
relocate or anything like that that has
nothing to do with why I'm down here but
one of the things like with Texas just
in a nutshell like it's always played a
part in my childhood like I've always
loved Texas I grew up watching Texas
sports teams like Houston Oilers was a
die-hard Houston or other family and
anyway like so I've always had this like
fascination with with Texas but I've
been I've been like a DC native my
entire life so or at least most of it
anyway I did used to live in Houston I
haven't been back to Texas in like 20
years
but anyway so yesterday I went and
visited Austin with my kids and I just
I've heard so much about it you know
obviously being a big tech center like
Dells based out of Austin and you know
it was nice you know I got the barbecue
down there and stuff like that but I
guess the point that I would try to make
in this video is that like sometimes
it's just not what you expect man like
I'm not going to try to relate like
Texas look at bird
anyway I'm not gonna try to like relate
Texas to Santa to DC or anything like
that or San Antonio to DC but it's just
kind of a amazing like how like you you
paint this like portrait of this place
and then like when you're finally there
it's like I'm kind of miss home a little
bit so yeah you know I like Texas I like
being down here but you know I I don't
think I'd ever want to move this far
away from like family and friends and
stuff like that so I've known developers
that have done that actually quite a bit
my buddy was just down here in Austin
and I ended up taking a job in Richmond
but his family was based out of New York
I left home at least the home that I
went to high school with with my mom and
my stepfather when I was 17 and I left
Maryland to go to Virginia to go to
college
never ended up finishing obviously but
you know that relocation I had family
that was moving in with so in the case
of my buddy who moves from Austin to
Richmond he's like like his his he
upended like everything that he's ever
known and apparently like that is
something that we do a lot in this
industry but it's something that I've
never done personally I find it exciting
but once you have kids and your kids are
in school and you have mortgages and I
think it just it seems like it changes
the equation a little bit at least for
me but being down here is it's it's
really awesome the Riverwalk is awesome
but I just don't know that I'd ever want
to live in San Antonio
don't get me wrong though I do love
being in San Antonio I love being in
Texas I love visiting Austin yesterday I
just don't I don't know that I'd ever
want to live it just feels so much
different like Texas like they just
don't give a like I mean the
Riverwalk is one one thing I find funny
because it's like people have to fall
into this thing like all the time you
would think like kids maybe maybe it
doesn't but there's no railings
obviously like Texas is like it we
don't even care but if they put railings
up you know obviously it would make the
Riverwalk a lot uglier so I'm glad that
they don't do that but it's just kind of
a amazing that like people don't fall
into this thing like there are some
there are certain areas of this walk
where it's just like it's just
treacherous like you're walking by like
groups of people and you're teetering on
the edge luckily I don't think the water
is too deep but it's still pretty cold
out here I would not want to fall into
it so that is like one thing with uh
with Texas I've noticed for sure is like
they don't seem to care about zoning at
all like don't put up like an office
park right next to a gas station with
like a hotel like right behind it like
there's just no rhyme or reason to
really anything
so some of you guys might be wondering
like why am I even down here and the
answer that question is the Alamo the
Alamo is something that I've always been
fascinated with as a child watching like
John Wayne movies and stuff like that
any time I ever played like with my army
man or like toy figurines and things
like that it was always an Alamo type
situation where some small force usually
like an elite force against like there's
insurmountable odds and stuff like that
so that's the main reason why I even
came down here is because I just want to
see it in person which is what I'm gonna
do today I think one of the most
fascinating stories behind it as well as
like the story of Davy Crockett who was
a US Congress man he was already like a
famous American frontiersman a
best-selling author had presidential
hopeful he was a presidential hopeful in
1836 and because he couldn't get
reelected to his Congress seat from
where he was in Tennessee he and he only
lost reelection by like it was like a
handful of votes but there wasn't very
many people back then but either way it
was an embarrassment for him and he was
really rough around the edges too like
Andrew Jackson and anyway he ends up you
know he tells Congress you know quote
you according to a legend or whatever he
tells and they can all go to hell he's
gonna go to Texas and he ends up down
here and ends up in the Alamo compound
and within like you know days he ends up
you know besieged by the Mexican army
him and his group of like Tennessee
militiamen and the fact that he just
ends up dying down here is just
absolutely amazing
so if your point is to leave a mark on
history I suppose that the guys that
were behind the Alamo really William
Travis the 26 year old commander Jim
Bowie and and David Crockett I mean they
they put their names in the history
books for sure over a small battle a
battle that really when the Mexican army
decided to go ahead and take the Alamo
compound it only it felt within like an
hour and a half I mean they were I think
was like 1500 soldiers or so versus a
roughly 200 so they had no chance and
the compound itself was relatively large
so like that there was you had 200 men
you had to arm the walls and everything
they had hardly any cannons and there
was just no no chance they had met
survival but ultimately with Davy
Crockett dying it ended up involving the
United States I think even quicker to
help Texas and and that was probably
unfortunate for the you know for Mexico
because I'm not gonna get into all that
history and everything but yeah I mean
if depending on which side you're on you
know what happened during the Texas
Revolution I mean obviously still rubs
Mexicans the wrong way and but anyway
I'm not gonna go into too much more
history but I'm down here in San Antonio
