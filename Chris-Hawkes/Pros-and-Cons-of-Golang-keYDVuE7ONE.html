about the pros and cons of go lying I
want to actually get into more detail
about some of these languages that I'd
like to talk about on this channel and
some of you guys have asked me about
this a lot of this information is
obviously available in different places
but you know I just went ahead and tried
to compile some of this information now
I have use golang I'm not extensively
but I basically I've jumped in a couple
times but really have only scratched the
surface with the language itself so I'm
not a golang expert but my background is
more Python c-sharp and JavaScript so
what does go people call it go where
they call it go lang but it's a
programming language it's open source it
was it's sponsored by Google it's
essentially created by Google so some of
the people behind it like Rob Pike and
Ken Thompson created the original B
language so he he goes all the way back
to Dennis Ritchie and the C programming
language which is like arguably the most
important language of all time so you
know some of the greatest minds and
computer science have actually been
behind this language so they made it so
that it was easy to build simple
reliable and efficient so essentially it
was to solve some of the more complex
problems in the world of programming
programming problems that companies like
Google run into when they're dealing
with you know petabytes of data that
they're sifting through each day now I'm
going to start with the pros of golang
so it's built with concurrency in mind
so that means that gleich think they
have things like go routines and
channels which are all built around
concurrent programming and they are
considered primitives in the language
and a primitive means that like a string
or a number in python you know those are
primitive types to Python the you know
this go language has its own primitives
just like strings and integers that they
call goroutines and channels and are
specifically built for concurrency so
concurrency is being able to you know
focus on multiple things at one time not
parallel programming but essentially
it's it's similar to parallel
programming and where parallel
programming is mostly focused on being
able to run things in parallel on
multicores you hear a lot about that
like trying to utilize all four of your
CPU cores
concurrency is more like being able to
run multiple processes at the same time
and the same on the same core I mean you
could have multi-core so you could have
literally four separate concurrent
applications running and and things are
executing simultaneously basically using
switch switch back and forth between you
know running this okay focus on this
switch back to this so it is actually
separate from concurrency and I'm Rob
Pike actually explains that in more
detail if you wanted to look up that
he's done videos and stuff like that but
he's one of the creators of the golang
language and he basically new outlines
the fact that the world is a parallel
place and object-oriented languages
aren't really suited towards concurrency
and with go it is focused almost
exclusively on on on that you know that
issue which is a pretty big issue when
you're trying to solve very very complex
problems all right so go is
cross-platform so it does it runs on
Windows and also Linux so I mean you can
actually so that's a big issue that
we've seen obviously with with languages
like C sharp which are now running
cloths cross-platform but you know for a
language we truly adoptable it needs to
be able to run on on both platforms and
Mac as well so it avoids a lot of the
cruft of traditional object-oriented and
what I mean by that is that you know as
I said before object-oriented acerra lis
suited towards multi-core processing and
parallelism and and concurrency although
you can do those things it's a little
bit harder in addition to that go also
does away with things like classes and
type inheritance which you see in a lot
of other different languages so if those
aren't your cup of tea then you're
probably going to let go quite a bit so
functions are first class citizens we've
seen this in JavaScript that it
functions are just like strings and in
store they're the same thing they're
considered their first class you can
pass them around like their parameters
and things you can do the same thing
with go
and one of the pros would go is that its
generate there's generally one way to do
just about everything now this could
also be a downside because a lot of
people say that golang is is somewhat
verbose and boring because you're
basically laying out you know the exact
same way of doing something there's no
craftiness there's no let me try to put
all this crap on one line like Perl or
you know using JavaScript to do some you
know some tomfoolery I mean there's
there's typically one way to do it and
and golang it's the adopted way and
everybody does it that way and that was
kind of Google's entire incentive to do
it that way because they didn't want to
have to train all these engineers that
they're paying two hundred thousand
dollars a year for to have to you know
run Python in different crafty ways they
wanted things to be super efficient and
and very easy to follow so another Pro
is that it is backed by Google one of
the largest tech companies in the world
and the fact that a lot of those
creators actually work directly for
Google tells you a lot there it has
garbage collection now that's something
that is a major pain in the ass to deal
with when you're writing in like C++ or
and C or any other language that doesn't
have garbage collection in fact it's one
of the reasons why I've never really
been able to truly get into C++ it's
just you know having to deal with that
in getting accustomed to not having to
deal with it's just it's a pretty big
transition although it does take away
some of your flexibility to be able to
write super fast and efficient programs
when you don't actually control the
memory management now let's get into
some of the cons of golang it lacks
third third-party modules so that's just
naturally because of the language being
only six years old but there's a lot of
libraries and things that you use every
single day in c-sharp or JavaScript or
Python that you've just grown accustomed
to libraries that are doing things for
GUI app development or making HTTP
requests or for dealing with JSON data
you know so many different things that
we turn to for you know NPM quickly
install this or pip install that those
things are missing from golang and then
they will be for probably quite some
time to come
it deviates away from traditional sea
based languages and this is actually one
of the reasons why I haven't personally
adopted going a lot of my projects I
don't use go at work there's not going
to be any sort of possibility of us
using go probably any time any time in
the near future maybe ever and and it
deviates away in a way where like when I
read go it doesn't look familiar as
JavaScript or C or C sharp or any sort
of sea based language and for that
reason you know I then it makes things
difficult to actually do something with
go because I have to basically do a 180
and start thinking and things that go
away which is very very opposite from
everything else that I do so also if
you're not as easy to read as Python and
that is just my opinion there's like
that's not even with the community
saying but for me I look at go language
and I it doesn't it doesn't click as
well as something like Python go has
tedious error handling so that's
actually one of the you hear a lot of
people complaining about that
so the built-in error handling that
comes with go is not extremely helpful
go has no generics people have been
bitching about this since the language
started so generics allow you to write
you know code that can be reusable by
having generic implementations so that
means you're not like stat you're not
you're not statically building a
function that can only work with a set
of data you know one piece of data
having a generic you can say you know
what I'm going to build this in a
generic form so that I can have
different types get passed in and
different outputs and things like that
so you know the lack of generics and go
is definitely a problem with the
language after being out for six years
adoption is still suspect outside of
Google and obviously their engineers so
on the community Stack Overflow like you
look at how many questions are on Stack
Overflow or just how many websites are
available for any sort of assistance you
can just see that that golang has not
really taken off as
something like you know react which is a
librarian JavaScript but you saw react
explode in popularity and just a couple
of years and and with go I mean we know
we've been talking about it before it
even came out it's been out for six
years now and and you know adoption is
still you know ongoing but it's just not
this you know this there's not this
mainstream craze of jumping on the the
goaline bandwagon I think some of it has
to do with these cons that I've
mentioned not very many jobs so that
that is a downside that you know there's
not as much employment opportunity
however that can also be a positive
because if you focus on one language and
you become a master at it or even very
proficient you're going to be able to
find a job probably easier and you know
finding something that not everybody
like overseas and everywhere else or
focusing on it makes you a little bit
more attractive to whatever sort of
potential employer you may be looking
for you know what I mean so if you
compare that to Java or C sharp you're
going to be thrown into the mix of like
hundreds of thousands of other
developers that are all competing for
the same positions now granted there's
more positions there's also a shitload
more developers that you're competing
against not as helpful online as with
other languages and I kind of just
mentioned that with Stack Overflow
you're going to have less questions
there's less blogs and all that stuff is
just because there's less adoption a lot
of the people that have adopted it you
know they're not you know they're not a
lot of them are just systems engineers
and things like that and to me I don't
see the same level of enthusiasm as I
saw was like maybe the Python community
or the Ruby community or even JavaScript
so that is about it guys let me know
what you think of golang and whether or
not you guys have tried it and I do plan
on touching on more languages and
frameworks libraries and things like
that in this format as well so thanks
for watching guys have a good day and
bye hey guys so a lot of you asked me
how do I get my foot in the door to
become a programmer and I just wanna
take a moment to mention dev Mountain
coding boot camp is a 12-week intensive
course that focuses on the technologies
of the here-and-now for
web-development some of the things that
they're actually teaching in this
12-week course it's geared to get you
into the industry by focusing on things
like jQuery nodejs react angular how to
use github so a lot of the things that
you're going to need to do as a
developer as soon as you start they're
going to be teaching you in this and
this coding bootcamp and the entire goal
is to be able to get you into the
industry within 12 weeks so if you guys
are interested in learning more
information about Deb mountain coding
boot camp just check out the link in the
description cab of this video thank you
for watching and have a good day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
