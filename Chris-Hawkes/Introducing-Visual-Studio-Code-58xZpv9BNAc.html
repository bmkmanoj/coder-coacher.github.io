is introduce this new code editor that
just came out and it actually came out
in April although Microsoft announced it
early last year one of the things that
drives me crazy when it comes to
developing is if I'm doing something new
like jsx or you know some other sort of
new preprocessor language or any sort of
new JavaScript library syntax or
whatever it is visual studio has
traditionally had a hard time keeping up
with that stuff as much as well when you
compare it to other editors that exist
and although they're not full-blown
integrated development environments
they're considered text editors but they
do a better job of keeping things up to
date with the latest standards for
instance when you look at a text editor
like sublime text or adam editor they
both do a much better job of keeping up
to date than visual studio now it's kind
of an unfair comparison because visual
studio is like one of Microsoft's
flagship products if you guys don't know
the difference between an integrated
development environment and a text
editor don't feel bad because I didn't
really know the difference for the
longest time either they both are things
that you write code into and for the
most part that's really all you use
these things forward a lot of people use
visual studio and they're really just
using you know the you know the code
editing capabilities of it but with
visual studio you have so many more
options there's you know built-in
support for like team foundation server
there's all kinds of stuff that you can
add into it like plugins to enhance it
to do automated builds tons of stuff
that you can do with visual studio
traditionally but once again the problem
was it doesn't really keep up to date as
well as other things now in April they
finally they released this this project
they had announced sometime mid last
year but they call it Visual Studio code
now it's a completely separate editor
but it's very similar to something like
Adam so anybody who likes the visual
studio kind of look and feel the
Microsoft look and feel so it's a pretty
good product the Visual Studio code
seems like a pretty awesome solution so
I just want to show you it is completely
free Microsoft has really had a real
open source initiative lately which is
pretty sweet so I mean I definitely
recommend it especially if you're going
to be doing some I jsx de ville
react development it's not a bad option
whatsoever I think that when you compare
it to Adam editor it's it's pretty much
like I actually personally prefer that's
just a little bit just be a little bit
more just because I'm used to visual
studio but if you don't have a visual
studio background there's really not a
whole heck of a lot of difference
between the two Visual Studio code
though it does have a few cool things
that I think like it has automate our
automatic get support so if you want to
connect to a repository or post your
coat up to a repository my dog is about
to knock over my life based on what are
you doing anyway so if if you if you
want to you know poster repository or
grab the latest from repository then you
know it's it's got a lot of that stuff
built in so it looks pretty good it's
very very slim down visual studio I mean
I'm actually launching it right now so
you guys can see it
so it's very it's very slim down like i
was mentioning before on the left hand
side you just like without them you're
going to open like a new window or open
a folder to open an existing project so
let me just open one of my existing
projects that I have I'll go in to see
and projects
and it doesn't really matter but i'll
just select this folder here
alright so on one good thing about this
compared to Adam editor is like if I
want to zoom in on a file let me just
open one of the files here we'll open
admin dot P why so you can see it has
the text highlighting and everything and
as i zoom in it actually zooms in not
just on the editor code but also on the
file codes because it actually drove me
crazy and Adam that you couldn't without
editing the CSS files of what Adam is
you couldn't make the menu items any
bigger so I thought that kind of sucked
but anyway it's a it's a really sweet
editor as far as just trying to you know
find something simple to write your code
into so just got released in April and
if you guys haven't checked that out yet
just so you know be sure to check that
out because it is cross-platform and
works on mac linux and windows all right
guys let me know what you think of it
you have a good day take care of my</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
