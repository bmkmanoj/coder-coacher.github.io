continue with our blog and the last
video we created a sitemap and showed
how Django can automatically update the
site map based on the blog entry said
you assigned to it so here's this little
tech blog that I'm creating with Django
and I in this video what we want to do
is um when you have a page that's not
found so like we can say like this I'm
you get this error message and right now
it's saying the page not found 44 and it
gives you the structure of your URLs and
that's because we have the debugger on
and by default when you're actually
building your site you want to debug
Iran because that way it will tell you
specifically where the errors are but
you don't want that in production and
instead if there's a 404 or some sort of
internal error you want to display like
the standard 500 meaning something went
wrong or the 404 meaning the page not
found so Django has the ability to add a
custom template for those two pages and
that's what we're going to add in this
video so to do that what we need to do
is open up our URLs file of the post
module the main module and down here
below the end of the tuple for the URL
patterns we're going to create a handler
for a four variable which is going to
point to a view that we're going to
create which is a views dot and whilst a
custom 404 and then we'll do the same
thing for handler 500 equals and there's
other handlers as well that we can add
but we're just going to do these two for
this video then we'll just stay custom
500 now that we've added that we need to
go ahead and add those two methods to
our views function and we actually want
to it above our sitemap class so we'll
say define custom
404 and this will just be a request and
then just like these two down here we're
just going to return the template i'll
just copy this entire line change this
to 500 and then we're going to say this
is a 404 dot HTML this is 500 HTML all
right so let's go ahead and define those
in in the template and we'll just borrow
the about page and will copy all this
stuff just ctrl C and make a new
template call it 500 and then just paste
all this stuff in here we need to change
the title will say error occurred I
guess you can say whatever you want
there we'll just say oops there was an
error
and i'm going to say some sort of
message hopefully our texts are aware
but if not feel I will just say actually
our technicians are working under
problem it's a kind of a stupid thing to
say but anyway I'm I'm just going to put
that for right now we also need to get
rid of this garbage down here we really
don't need that and
now I'll just give her the whole thing
we'll see what that looks like there
might need to be a Content thing there
might mess up the page completely but
what we'll find out here in just a
second now we're pointing to that bout
image we probably want to eventually
have some sort of an error image that
we're going to use instead but let's go
ahead and just copy this and we'll
create our 400 and then this time it's
just page not found
alright so now they've done that let's
go ahead and upload this to our server
so I'll just go here sudo service
apache2 restart
now in order to see these pages actually
working you would have to turn off the
debugger and your settings file so you
would want to open up your settings file
and change this debug equals true to
false
I probably should have done that before
so the reason why that doesn't work is
actually because of a typo that I have
in my URLs here the URL name should be
custom 404 and then custom 500 with an
underscore sorry about that
alright so if we look at this again this
should work alright so now you can see
that i'm on a five hundred air instead
of showing that generic message that
comes from the server there is a
overridden feature to display this nice
little error page and we'd probably want
to change out the image like i said
before so here is an error that this
would be for the 500 error so if i went
like band template or something Jesus I
also can't type apparently this HTML
document needs to be 404 not 400 I don't
know what I was thinking there
alright so you can see it's looking for
four or four HTML you guys probably
caught that I don't know I don't pay
enough of attention I guess sometimes
alright if I reupload this on the four
or four should be working is right now
it's just given the opes error even when
the template is not found so let's go
ahead and um you can see that there
right now it's the page not found and
then like if we go to blog and we try to
a query a blog that doesn't exist like
blog three that will return a 500 so you
can see there's two different error
message message is being displayed
depending on what the actual server
error is alright guys so that covers the
500 and 404 error handling thanks bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
