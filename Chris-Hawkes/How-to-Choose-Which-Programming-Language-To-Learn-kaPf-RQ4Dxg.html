from a person named Ranaut okay last
name starts with a K I don't know if
that's how you pronounce the first name
for now okay that's how it looks like ro
u nak and they had this question they
said how do you differentiate between
languages like this language will be
better for my project and this will not
help me or this has more functionality
and is used by many people and this
language is scoped lists and the whole
programming time for the project using
this language will be a waste so it
looks like that's a little bit miss
worded there but the bottom line is
they're asking how do you choose which
language you're going to use for
whatever sort of project and really the
answer to that it depends on what you're
trying to build for me personally I
typically stick with web development so
if I'm going to be building a website
one of the first things I look at is
actually how much is it going to cost me
to host the website meaning I have to
pay for servers and then install this
programming language on those servers to
run the website and different servers
cost difference different amounts of
money so if I were to pick a web
language like Python or maybe I'm
debating between Python or C sharp C
sharp is a language that's built on top
of the dotnet framework so you're gonna
be using most likely a Windows server so
I is probably a sequel server database
which is Microsoft's flagship database
product and it can get quite expensive
actually hosting a dotnet website if you
want to use you know what I consider to
be a reputable provider so if I were
going to actually build a full dotnet
stack I would probably use Azure but the
problem is azor is pretty expensive so
most the time I dream big with my
websites and I expect them to get lots
of traffic and usually don't have much
of a plan for revenue to be able to pay
for that that's near that technology
stack that I need to have to support all
that traffic so I usually try to just go
with a basic Linux hosting company and
and I usually fall in line and just go
with lenôtre because lino de is what's
called a virtual private host so they
guarantee a certain amount of resources
for you and I've had websites that are
pretty big on that so
the first thing I need to look at though
is is number one okay how much is it
gonna cost me the host and part of what
goes into that is how big of an
application am I trying to build am i
trying to build something that's gonna
have hundreds of thousands of users
every day or am I just building a
website for a friend you know to help
them out or something like that maybe
they'll get ten people a month if that
were the case I could probably do a
shared hosting plan which makes dotnet
and c-sharp a little bit more attractive
and then because Linode would be
overkill probably for something like
that and I could just do a shared
hosting plan I'm never big on the shared
hosts though because they you know this
305 a month for all these resources are
obviously taking a server and they're
slamming it with as many accounts as
they possibly can
webfaction was a shared hosting company
that I used for awhile and they were
really good but the problem is I grew
them because um every once in a while
you know like usually a Friday night you
know some some guy probably on one of
those accounts on the server would just
do like it would slam the server and it
would grind to a halt because he
obviously did some sort of you know huge
sequel read or some you know sequel dump
at the end of it was always on a Friday
night and literally the website would
just crawl so I mean you can't have a
professional web site with unreliable
activity like that I mean your net years
never going to succeed if you really you
know have big dreams and aspirations for
your website
now you asked about what technology or
language and maybe you're not building
websites at all so maybe you're not
interested in you know any of this
hosting stuff if you're going to be in
game development you probably want to
take a look at one of the game engines
that's already out there like unity or
Unreal Engine those are the two biggest
that I can think of right now where
indie developers can jump right in with
game program
so if Unity engine is something that
you're interested in because they have a
free version you can actually publish
your your game for free and as long as
you make it under a hundred thousand a
year its I'm not sure exactly what the
prices are at this point but I'm pretty
sure it was free for a while but the
bottom line is that's very very
attractive for any developers to be able
to use this game engine and try to make
some money most games don't make any
money unfortunately but if you're in
involved in and game
then with unity you can actually use
their their game engine and you can
write code in JavaScript JavaScript
subset called boo which is similar to
type script or CoffeeScript if you've
ever heard of either those two and then
you can also use C sharp which is
probably the recommended route because
c-sharp is a fully object-oriented
language and it's an excellent language
there's a lot of really great things
that c-sharp does when you compare you
know c-sharp the Java or to Python so if
you're going to do game engines and you
want to build a game and you think unity
is the answer for you then I would say
you know c-sharp is probably the best
bet but maybe you want to stick with
JavaScript because you feel like you
could write code and the game engineers
and JavaScript and then you can also
transfer that JavaScript knowledge to a
website because Java Script runs in the
browser and you can so you can kind of
kill two birds with one stone there you
can have one language that's doing not
just your game engine but also maybe
building the website to promote your
game later on however if you're going to
be in hardcore game developer like a
triple-a title you want to push game
engines to new levels or create your own
game engine most likely you're going to
be using C++ so if if if that's your
goal then definitely C++ would be your
best language Unreal Engine is written
so you can actually script the Unreal
Engine which is it which is a triple-a
game engine and you can write code in it
with C++ as well so even if you're not
trying to build your own engine and
Unreal Engine is where you're trying to
go unreal actually has better specs and
then unity but it's typically overkill
for indie developers so that's a
decision you have to make but if Unreal
Engine is where you're headed then I
would probably stick with C++ there was
some talk about a c-sharp wrapper being
put around the Unreal Engine but from
what I've heard I think the Unreal guys
have now scrapped that project and you'd
have to read more about that online but
it looks like there is not going to be
any sort of c-sharp wrapper for Unreal
Engine unfortunately so the C++ is
definitely your language
if that's what you're jumping into if
you want to be an Apple developer and
you're just planning on focusing on the
Apple ecosystem the Apple AppStore may
be building apps or something for the
Mac what you would probably want to use
in that case is Swift which is Apple's
newest language that they built and it's
supposed to be replacing the older
language objective-c so you're gonna see
Swift continue to gain support in 2016
so if you're definitely focused on just
apple Swift would be a pretty good bet
for you if you're going to be doing
Android and you want to write native
Android apps meaning that you're gonna
write Android code that works with the
you know that maybe targets a specific
phone or platform that runs Android then
you would probably want to learn Java
and Java is built for the or the Android
SDK which stands for it's a development
kit is actually Java code and it's built
on top of Java so it's called the
Android SDK but ultimately you're
writing code and Java so if you're gonna
be focusing on just Android and then
Java would be a good bet now if you were
going to try to focus on both it's going
to be difficult to be an expert
programmer and both Swift and Java
anytime soon they're both complicated
languages especially Java then you might
want to focus on maybe a wrapper type
language where you can write code in one
language and then have it compile down
to native either native apple or native
Android and you can do something like
that using a JavaScript library that's
recently come out this was created by
the Facebook guys and it's called react
native and it's built around their react
JavaScript library which is for web apps
but this is actually this react native
allows you to write it in the same kind
of you know same mindset or design
philosophy that they use for the react
web apps and it applies to Apple and and
Android so it's a it's a new thing they
just recently released the Android
portion of it and I think it was in
August or September but you know brand
new thing so you're gonna be kind of you
know treading new water there but it's
definitely something you may want to
take a look at now also in the same
light
react native you also have xamarin which
is a company that's built around it's
the guys who were responsible for the
mono framework so it allows c-sharp to
run on a Linux environment which doesn't
natively work that way so you have to
have this kind of like band-aid approach
to be able to have dotnet code run on
Android but and the xamarin guys have
already figured that out and they've
done that and if if c-sharp is something
you're interested in c-sharp is a huge
enterprise language I'm just like my
Java so that means that a lot of major
companies are using it to power their
entire infrastructure so if you know C
sharp or Java you can definitely get a
ton of jobs and xamarin allows you to
write c-sharp and just like react native
this c-sharp code will be able to run
natively on your Android or Apple so you
can write code once and it applies to
two different ecosystems now one thing I
will say with that the experience that
I've had with these wrapper type
approaches they're never as powerful as
a native environment so if you truly
want to build a cutting-edge Android
game or something like that you're
probably going to be better off sticking
to the actual native SDK you know
whether it's you know the Android Java
for Android or Swift for Apple now maybe
you want to build standard software that
actually just runs inside of a browser
something that you know something like
an excel or a word or some sort of
software application like that well then
you may want to if you if you want to
appeal to most of the audience out there
that's going to be a Windows platform so
it would be nice to have an open source
but a lot of people are now open source
but cross-platform but it's always good
to focus you know on Windows if you're
going to be trying to appeal to like
typical operating system software and if
you're going to do that and I'm WPF is
still around it's still one of the top
technologies to choose from for dotnet
so you can write write WPF code and
write what's considered GUI applications
gooeys can be thought of as something
like in this blender application that's
considered a GUI so it's a complicated
software piece of software like
Photoshop type of thing and
and that's all considered GUI
development so there's a lot of options
with GUI development WPF is one of them
the classic WinForms is another both of
those can be written in like c-sharp or
Visual Basic you have PI QT which is a
Python wrapper around the Qt project
which is all basically like C++ on that
on the lower end there but you can write
Python to create you know gooeys in fact
blender is actually making use of Python
to make this application possible and
then you also have Windows runtime which
can be used for both GUI and it can also
be used for the Windows app store so for
any sort of like you know surface pro or
any of those Microsoft line of products
like the Microsoft phone you can cater
to that using the Windows runtime so you
can write both c-sharp or C++ for that
as well finally you need to figure out
the application that you're trying to
build is it going to be something that
just you are coding by yourself
or is it going to be a team environment
so languages like Python or not as well
suited for large-scale development teams
like something like Java or C C sharp
they have a ton of tools built around
c-sharp and Java that's why all the
corporations use them because they can
assign you know complex pieces of
software out to different teams and then
kind of bring it all together you can do
the same thing in Python but the tools
just aren't as good as something like C
sharp or Java and anybody that debates
that is just crazy because I mean it's
just obvious that that's the case and
you know all the jobs out there kind of
prove that so if you're going to be
doing any sort of enterprise development
and it definitely you know stick with
Java or C sharp so to answer your
question every single thing like no
matter what you want to build you have
to look at what you might build the
price that it's going to take you to be
able to to build that how many people
are going to build it what operating
systems are you trying to run this on
are you trying to make a game are you
trying to make a website are you trying
to make a database I mean there every
every question you could ask about what
technology
best there's there's typically the best
tool for the job there's never any
one-size-fits-all language and that can
solve every problem out there and really
only the noobs and programming you know
try to you know take one particular
programming language to try to make it
apply to everything so they say if all
you have is a hammer everything looks
like a nail so that's kind of the phrase
you'll hear a lot with programmers and
it comes with experience and all the
different areas of programming to be
able to make that kind of decision where
it's like okay you know this language is
going to suit me best because I'm
catering towards this environment or
this phone or this device or this server
or I just don't have the money to pay
top notch for you know this particular
technology so you know I'm gonna have to
kind of you know cut back on my
technology and maybe you know do
something that's a little bit less
inferior but it's gonna cost me a whole
lot less and and my company's not gonna
go bankrupt you know before I even have
a chance to see if my idea is going to
work so a lot of different things to
look at and really just comes from
either experience or just doing research
and asking the advice of experienced
people that I've tried to go down these
different paths and you know just to try
to make the best decision so that is
ultimately how you find the best
language is going to be just either
experience or research and trial and
error which is experience alright guys
that's it that's it thanks for watching
have a good night bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
