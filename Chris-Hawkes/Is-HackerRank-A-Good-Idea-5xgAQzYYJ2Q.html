hacker rank it's pretty good I went
there people have asked me how do I get
better at algorithms how do I get better
at maybe some of the questions that
might get thrown your way and an
interview there's several issues that I
have with number one hacker rank is good
number two though I think it sucks when
you go to a job interview and like they
start getting you to whiteboard problems
that's the whole thought just really
really just irks me I really don't feel
like I would do very well under that
high-stress situation I'm trying to
whiteboard out complex coding problems
however a lot of companies do want you
to do that sort of thing they I think
that in the back of my mind I personally
perceive it as like they just want to
see how you handle something under a
high-pressure high-stress situation and
don't necessarily need to see you like
write the perfect code or anything and I
would also guess that when you go into
this situation that they don't want you
to understand right off how to solve
this problem so if you spent a lot of
time practicing fizzbuzz or something
like that they're probably not going to
ask you fizzbuzz because they know you
could just memorize it and I don't think
they're getting anything out of that
situation a lot of companies you know
there's you know they do it anyway so
you know but that said companies like
like hacker rank which is out of
California I believe you know they've
been created to try to see how well
people can stack up against each other
in solving complex mathematical problems
and you know it's all situated around
programming but a lot of the concepts
are very very math intensive and very
thought-provoking and has absolutely
nothing to do with your typical web
development days so if you're going to
be a web developer for the most part
like I've been doing web development
seven years I look at some of these
algorithms on this site and I'm like
yeah I don't really have to do much of
any of that however that said I still
think it's very thought-provoking to try
to practice and they really are a
challenge but then I I spent some time
on hacker rank and I actually did like
ten or eleven of the problems and some
of the problems that were deemed to be
easy like I
didn't feel like they were that easy so
I think it made me feel bad because
maybe I just personally speaking I don't
think I'm all that great with you know
some of these abstract concepts or
whatever that I don't have to deal with
day in and day out but I noticed as I
was doing more of them they became a
little bit easier for me so I don't know
I I think that uh you know it's probably
just me like I don't have to do this
stuff day-to-day and for the most part I
don't even think it's all that fun or
even satisfying when I get it I'm just
like okay I did that that was kind of
annoying and I don't normally have to do
anything like that you know do I maybe
there's a small sense of accomplishment
there but nothing too major
now with hacker rank though I was
thinking you know these companies and
all these people that are promoting this
this tool and trying to get people to
use it ultimately they're outsourcing
complex problems to other people so a
lot of the easier submissions where like
45,000 people have already submitted
something or a hundred thousand people
you know obviously those situations have
been solved time and time again but what
is the benefit of somebody who goes out
and they solve something that only like
five people in the world have been able
to solve like wouldn't you want like if
you in if you do it in a different way
you're just basically giving hard-earned
extremely valuable information for free
and then you know anybody can see on
Hacker rank that you submitted this
companies then can probably try to see
you know maybe seek you out and that
could be a benefit of using something
like this or they could just simply
steal your code and you know and you
just solve some sort of major algorithm
problem that this company had that it's
26,000 associates wouldn't wasn't able
to solve on their own or that you know
97 percent of their associates aren't
able to solve but it doesn't matter
because you know Company B who doesn't
have 27,000 associates might only have
10 and maybe those 10 guys aren't nearly
as good as as you are they just took
your code as well and they're able to
apply it and maybe they can adapt it in
little ways but they see how you solve
it and I think in a way everybody's
getting better they're getting you know
stronger as developers but who really
if it's from this I mean hacker rank is
obviously getting money poured into it
and it's considered to be a relatively
expensive platform now
a lot of companies are seeing a lot of
value in it so they're going to start
using it I guess what I'm trying to say
is I have a problem putting my blood
sweat and tears into something and then
just having somebody else take it for
free and even if it's in you know if you
could argue that it's for the greater
good of humanity this project though
from what I've seen is not something
like open AI if you guys have never
heard of open AI it's a relatively you
know fascinating concept but here's the
the Wikipedia page on it but it's
created by you know Elon Musk and a
bunch of other people and it's got over
a billion dollars I think already an in
just cash setting aside and was just
founded according to Wikipedia or maybe
know a billion pleasure 2015 when did
this thing start yeah it looks like
assets now thirteen billion anyway I
don't know exactly when this thing was
started but there's a lot of different
people that are actually using this this
platform it's all for the greater good
of humanity because we're all trying to
you know explore artificial intelligence
but as this article cites you know
Stephen Hawking has stated that advanced
AI could if it has the ability to
redesign itself at an ever-increasing
rate that it it could be like an
unstoppable intelligence explosion it
could lead to human extinction which
it's kind of like that movie with Johnny
Depp it was a really bad movie actually
I don't remember what it was called but
it was just Johnny Depp just made it was
like a year or two ago but essentially
this you know he gets his brain gets
intertwined with a computer and he'd
like becomes like a human living
artificial intelligent machine and
immediately he's asking to be connected
to the Internet and he's out analyzing
stock trends and you know just can just
swallow up all this data and get smarter
and smarter one of the things that yeah
with one of the major advantages of a
platform like Facebook or Google or
something else they have so much user
content that they have a major leg up on
everybody else just because of the sheer
volumes of data that they're able to
analyze and parse that leads to that
whole big data and machine learning and
stuff so they have a major unfair
advantage now
because they're so large and they have
so much data that we just provided them
for free and a lot of you guys commented
on the video I just posted yesterday
where I was talking about how companies
are in websites or removing comments
because they pretty much want to censor
trolls and stuff like that but they can
also censor their message and you know
some people have pointed out that you
know it's it's unfair that people and
you know people are providing their
their con their content to these these
websites that are able to then use it
and be able to capitalize on and make
money off it you know so even like
comments is all free data look at Stack
Overflow Stack Overflow is a billion
dollar platform and you have the hard
work and blood sweat and tears of all
these programmers that have helped each
other and it's become a very very
helpful tool and like I think it's great
but who owns all that data it's it's
essentially owned by Stack Overflow and
they can do what they want with it
there may be stipulations in their Terms
of Service that state how they can use
it and things like that but like one guy
got got really mad he was a guy that
contributed to C++ a lot so he's
obviously pretty smart he was out of
Texas which is a relatively conservative
state in the United States and I don't
know if the guy's conservative or not
but I'm just saying from you know Texas
is typically conservative and this guy
had a score of over like a hundred
thousand when I was viewing this article
but he was upset because the US Supreme
Court had just legalized same-sex
marriage so it was a major turning point
in American society and politics that no
longer you could you know discriminate
against you know gay couples or whatever
for you know being getting married to
each other and stuff like that and this
guy had a problem with the fact that the
the logo for Stack Overflow got changed
to you know the Stack Overflow popping
over you know the bits of data on the
stack that we're popping out on a buffer
overflow or whatever that is you know
the Stack Overflow logo they changed it
to the rainbow which is you know
signifying you know I guess the I'm not
sure if it's the entire LGBT community
or whatever but either way you know they
were celebrating it turns out one of the
Stack Overflow founders is actually you
know gay himself and this guy was
raising a problem he's like look my
profile picture is on your your
website and you guys have this logo
that's basically implying that my
profile in that Miami as a member of the
site you know condones and believes in
this thing so obviously he took the
contrary opinion but his whole point was
that look I've contributed a ton of my
you know knowledge to your platform to
accumulate over a hundred thousand
scored on mostly C++ questions and
answers and then they're able to take
his data and do what they want with it
and that was basically their argument we
can do what we want with your data you
provide us the data it's now ours so
Google is the same thing but to the
extreme as we search what made Google
unique when it was first getting started
Larry Page wasn't even the best
programmer at least not that I know of
when I read the in the Plex book Larry
Page was trying to implement his
original PageRank algorithm you know he
found the unique idea that by looking at
and ranking the values of you know all
these websites and then seeing what
websites are linking to what and based
on that value scale to then determine
how relevant content was it was a very
unique idea that nobody was really
capitalizing on so he's able to take it
he tries it right in in Java
turns out Java was like a turret
according to this guy something Hassan
who then takes in writes and in Python
so Google's entire stack was in Python
for the longest time and the thing is is
the entire premise of Google was what
was one relatively simple idea that was
better than other people's and they were
the first ones to actually discover it
but since that time is Google just this
PageRank you know cities a search engine
that does it better than everybody else
I mean he'll know Google has hundreds if
not thousands of different algorithms
and it has so much money and scale that
it can you know it can essentially if it
wanted to pay humans to sift through
this content manually it could do that
and it does that to some extent even
back in those days it was doing that to
some extent but my point is that you
know they're able to capitalize on an
idea they become the biggest you know
search engine company in the world and
now they're one of the biggest if not
the biggest data engine by far and now
they have access to all this data and it
was all freely provided to them through
their service you know by us and then we
don't get to keep it and that raises
even more problems like it's like if you
go and
you promote your stuff on Twitter or
even my YouTube channel right I put in
three and a half years yeah three and a
half years into this channel and I've
done countless videos and stuff like
that if you look at the money that this
channel makes over the amount of effort
that was poured into it it's not even
anywhere close to what a programmer
would normally make in a regular job and
stuff like that but the thing is I enjoy
doing it as it grows there is
satisfaction and watching it grow and
stuff like that but YouTube and Google
could just pull the plug at any moment's
notice and they've done that to other
people and you're not able to then you
know take your platform and all that
work that you've done and stuff so it's
just it's really it's it's it's a really
tough situation I think with where
everything's headed the difference with
this open day I think is that it's all
supposed to be freely available to
everybody so that nobody no one
particular entity is going to be able to
capitalize on artificial intelligence
once it starts becoming much much more
popular so if you want to contribute to
hacker rank I see no problem in that
well I do see a problem I raise the
problem that I see in it I think that
there's good and that there's bad I
think that there's good and bad and
anything that when we provide our
content for free it would be ideal if we
said you know what we've provided so
many of these comments whether it's
Alexa or not Alexa but Quora or YouTube
or Twitter or Facebook or any of these
other sites and if we put in all kinds
of content and we're creating value for
those companies that we should be able
to share in some of that value that
we're creating almost like a BitTorrent
there should be some sort of currency or
some sort of tracking system that
basically says you know this guy Chris
Hawkes has contributed a lot to the web
space you know we like YouTube obviously
makes money off my videos they get 45%
cut or something like that but even
beyond that like that like that's just
the money that they're getting from the
you know the actual you know the
companies that they're paying to market
their products there's like if you look
at like if you do four hundred and fifty
thousand views a month only a small
fraction of that is actually views that
we're getting ads put on them most of
that other stuff YouTube is just freely
you know displaying to anybody for
absolutely free so the content creator
doesn't get anything
youtubes obviously getting something out
of it because they're providing a
service you know something that people
are eating up and watching and stuff
like that so it's a I don't know that
there's a solution to this problem
though I don't and I don't even know
that it's really a problem but other
people have raised this the fact that
companies are able to grab a monopoly
basically on data and then you know use
that where you know now smaller
companies aren't able to compete because
they don't have access to the sheer
amounts of data that that the larger
company is doing that they can only
provide a better product or innovation
which can easily be copied and stolen in
this digital age so I could talk about
this probably for hours but I'm going to
go ahead and cut the video off now since
I'm approaching 15 minutes and I know
you guys a lot of you guys don't like to
longer videos all right guys take care
of man have a good night bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
