be looking into reacts some more and
first things first we need to actually
understand react before we can start
really integrating it with Django so one
of the best sites to actually be able to
do that is a site called plunker so if
we pull up our google search and go to
plunker com I think it's plonker no it's
not right all right so let me just
search plunker
let's not Co
alright so this is a good site here to
kind of give a basic understanding of
how react work so when you get to the
side here go ahead and click launch the
editor
all right now over here you're going to
have these little like live previews
find an extent library and let's go
ahead and search for react and then when
you find it go ahead and click on it and
then just say add so we'll click on that
and you see that it gives us a little
include there as go ahead and search
react again press ENTER we're going to
add react jsx because with react react
wants you to write the UI components in
a jsx which is really just a xml like
abstraction from javascript but it's
just JavaScript that's all it really is
but it's a different syntax and we had
talked in the previous video to use
sublime editor to write our g j sx code
but we need a compile compiler that will
actually turn that jsx to regular
JavaScript so if you're going to go to
production you actually don't include
this reactor that's why we're about to
add here and this would be something
that you compile into regular JavaScript
and then just copy those files into a
production environment so now that we
have that now I'm go ahead and click on
this like I ball so you can do the live
preview and since we're using the ASX
transformer we're going to write our
code here just above the body tag and
we're going to inside up a script
statement but we need to say type equals
text /a a sex and this tells the j sx
transformer to to actually compile that
jsx code so with react what we need to
do is we need to look at our component
as one box that we had talked about in
the previous video so let's go ahead and
create that that box here and if we go
through the actual tutorial series which
is probably the best thing to do just
kind of run through this real quick I'm
not going to go through the entire thing
but just some just to get things moving
along let's go ahead and just do it
though what they have there so via
variable comment box we're if I can zoom
in on this thing
our hopefully you guys can see that a
little bit better so we're going to
define our first react component and
typically it's going to be Pasco hazing
so capitalize each each word and your
your names and then in soon as they
react create component or create class
actually and this is um jsx code that
we're writing now so we're going to say
render function and then down here it
can be just straight HTML so we can put
a div tag here and put a h3 in here and
say this is a test closed off our h3
close out our tube let's get rid of that
alright so underneath our first
component we then need to and we only
have to do this once during any sort of
react code that we write react render
and then we're going to render the
element that we just created which is
comment box and we do it in an XML type
notation which is very similar to like
what you see when you're doing some
basic android programming or just you
know using XML so we render our comment
box here and then we only have to do
this once to where we say document dot
get element by ID and then we'll just
say content and this is just telling
react to go ahead and render this
comment box to this element which
doesn't exist well it's go ahead and add
it up here so let's say div ID equals
content ok
now with our comment box on react
element here you're always going to have
a render function and then you're going
to have a return so the return is going
to be inside the render and that's where
we're going to put here and then just
add the closed parenthesis here
I erased my closing div tag and then we
should have a semicolon after the return
statement and also because I'm so used
to JavaScript and we don't have an
editor that is telling us that the j sx
is messed up we actually don't need a
semicolon there either now you can see
so it is it is a little bit picky and
unfortunately a little bit difficult if
you don't have an editor that supports
jsx so if we were writing in here you
would get warnings that you don't need
the semicolon there but that was enough
to actually throw off the code so it's a
little bit of a headache at first but
hopefully we can we can work through
that but you can see here that this is a
standard HTML that got rendered inside
this comment box now we could have
another react elements Alyssa variable
second element equals react create class
will say render function return
and we'll just say h2 element inside
another element so then inside of here
instead of h3 we can actually render
this this next element and we do it in
the same XML site style syntax that we
did in the render the render should
always just be delivering that that
primary package that top-level package
that will contain all the sub components
in it so it's always going to be that's
the way you have to view it and the
react mindset so let's go ahead and add
the second element here second element
okay and then you can see over here
element inside another element so you
can have an element inside of second
element instead of you know standard
HTML that we have here now you're going
to notice that this isn't exactly the
same thing as HTML you're gonna have to
reference the react library because all
this is is this is JavaScript and Java
Script is creating this stuff and what
they call the virtual Dom and Dom is the
document object model typically the
document object model has a lot of crap
to it so it can be slow the reason why I
react as fast though is because this
virtual Dom only updates itself so if
you have a hundred components and only
one of them changes the entire 100
components don't need to be rear ender
react is able to keep track of the fact
that only that one component needs to be
re rendered and it keeps react very
responsive and and less of a memory
footprint so that's in a nutshell what
react does really well and what people
are really thrilled about it so going
back to having to reference the library
if I wanted to say that this is a div
class name instead of saying class it's
actually class name and you have to
reference these attributes inside the
reactor I brary because mostly they are
the same like if this was an input like
we could put an input here and say type
equals text which is the same thing that
would be in standard HTML class name is
not normally that way but that's telling
react to added so we'll say
past class so that's how you would add
an actual class to your element which is
slightly different but like I said with
input it's the same so some of the
attributes are the same some of them are
different it's just something you have
to get used to as well and probably have
to reference the library now you'll
notice this doesn't have a closing tag
which is causing a problem here an input
doesn't need a closing tag or doesn't
need like a ford / input you can close
it off like this like an image statement
now if we look at the element inside the
element though let's go ahead and take a
look at that that structure if we
right-click using chrome we should be
able to see you have the input and then
you have this main parent which is the
comment box and you can see that it's
test class I probably should have named
a class you know comment box for the
name of the element but you can see
that's how it added the class name you
can see what I was talking about with
the fact that typically an HTML you're
writing class and and react you're
writing class name okay so I want to
keep the video somewhat short and sweet
i'm going to go ahead and in this video
and then we're going to go ahead and get
into some more stuff in the next video
with react thanks for watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
