talking about right now is whether or
not nodejs is actually a stable project
moving into the future there was a lot
of buzz surrounding nodejs for a few
years really a couple years ago nodejs
was going to solve the world's problems
it was out as new technology out
companies were switching over to it
linkedin switched their entire stack
over to it at least our entire web
operation and nodejs was just extremely
popular and over the last like probably
a year or so it seems like the really
probably going back to about two years
ago the popularity of note on it started
quiet down just a little bit however it
recently made the news at the end of
last year just in December when the
project founder one of the contributors
the main contributors to the project
basically the senior architect and top
engineer he actually left the project
and spun off a new project on nodejs
which he called I ojs so I ojs and it
really caused a lot of upper own and the
community and apparently there was a lot
of fighting about the direction that the
company was going to take apparently
they all had the same goals or at least
you know behind the scenes they say all
our goals are to expand note and all
this other stuff but the corporate
sponsor behind nodejs at the time
apparently had some differing views on
how the project was going to be handled
compared to some of the you know actual
contributors to the codebase SI joint is
at this company down here and they're
actually the primary commercial sponsor
of the nodejs project however a lot of
nodes success has come from you know
open source creative developers that are
outside of that company and don't even
share the same vision of that company so
it was a huge blow to the node.js
project in fact everybody thought the
whole project was going to be screwed at
that point because once the lead
developer you know left and smile off at
an actual competing project it was it
was big big problems for a node and you
know at that point node had a lot going
for it and was trying to fight off some
of the you know bad publicity that is
like MongoDB which is like a database of
choice when using node
and basically know was trying to you
know at that point trying to justify its
existence and you know failed
expectations and it was just a huge blow
so the guy that actually spun off the
iOS project and basically took his ball
and went off was uh was been over here
which was uh you can be found he can be
found on the actual github project so
he's spun off and created a I odious
which is right here and for a few for
about three months actually it was big
news and everybody was talking about in
fact it was even mentioned in Wired
magazine so there was no future of
popular coding tool and out after it
splits in the two and all kinds of
articles can be found online about you
know the uproar that was cause once this
new project was spun up however fast
forward three months and then all of a
sudden iOS jaya sri joins with nodejs
and they actually forked you know the
fork project where I ojs had more
features that were being added quicker
than the actual nodejs project they were
able to resolve their disagreements and
they actually merge back in and march
and I think officially again and June so
now they're they're not really two
separate projects anymore so you know is
no J as a stable option in 2015 the
answer would be yes they've gone through
some some definite troubles over the
last year or so but you note is still
really popular Walmart shifted their
entire website over to note and you know
that the mean stack which is the lamp
stack alternative where you mean stands
for like Mongo Express which is the
framework written on top of node and an
angularjs or I would argue react
probably there than nodejs as well but
this whole mean set up is a very popular
choice so you notice is um you know the
perfect option for that JavaScript the
no JavaScript engine now it uses a
something called v8 and I know I'm not
talking about the car engine so we're
not talking about an actual v8 engine
here
and we're not talking about the v8 drink
either we're actually talking about the
VA JavaScript engine which is written in
C++ so what it does is it takes
JavaScript code and it compiles it down
to actual machine machine language so
it's compiled instead of having to be
dynamically interpreted which is what
JavaScript usually is which makes it a
very slow option now one of the things
that's often touted for nodejs is that
it's a very concurrent language it's
actually not true at concurrency it
fails when compared to something like
the the go lang language Google's go
library would actually blow away nodes
concurrency however it is still able to
handle a lot of simultaneous connections
so you know the the ports and things
like that that can be can be used for
notice it does that very well basically
so if you're going to be doing a chat
like forum or something like that then
you know it's a great option even if
you're not i mean notes still probably
going to outperform a lot of the heavy
back end web framework set that we've
had for a long time like ASP or Django
or even rails I mean it's going to do
pretty well and pretty much in most of
those situations it's just that
sometimes you might wonder why you're
going to go through the extra effort
when some of those more established
frameworks have been around for a decade
or more you know have a lot to offer all
out of the box without you having to
write a lot of code so no j us i think
is going to require a little bit more
work compared to something like django
or rails or asp but probably worth it in
the end because the JavaScript you write
on the server side which is what note is
can also you can write you know
JavaScript on the client side and that's
one of the selling points as well that
even though they're two different types
of code they're both javascript in you
know you can stick with one basically
one paradigm so the bottom line is noted
stable in 2015 looks like it's going to
be stable for some time to come probably
isn't a bad idea to build your stack and
note if you want to mongo DB is a
separate story we're looking at MongoDB
in more detail a lot of horror stories
about MongoDB but it does
lot of things right as well so it's not
all not all bad so anyway guys that's
all I got tonight thanks for watching
have a good day and by</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
