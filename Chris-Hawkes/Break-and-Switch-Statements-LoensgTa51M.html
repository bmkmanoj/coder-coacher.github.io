next video for the beginning javascript
tutorial series for hipster code calm
and in the last video we looked at a
raise and how we can loop through them
and in this case what we want to look at
is the switch statement and also the
break keyword because the break keyboard
is going to be used in both a switch
statement and it's also going to be used
to our advantage in a for loop so what
if we needed to take an action if if
like we ran into the word John right so
if I do a four and we've seen this in
the past videos will say for variable x
equals 0 x is less than my array dot
length which is going to be the length
of how many elements are in there and
then we can say x plus plus and then we
could say if and this is a statement if
my array and then we reference the X
variable and we say equals John then we
can say alert holy poo it equals John
exiting now and then we'll just do it
another alert statement down here we
left the for loop alright so we can use
the break keyword here because if we
didn't use the break it's going to
continue to go through the entire for
loop statement so let's watch what
happens when we run this so you can see
holy poet equals John exiting now and
then it says we left the for loop so the
reason why the break statement is so
important is because the array even
though it only has three elements in the
real world we could have an array that
literally has every word and a novel and
I mean there could be millions of words
it could be a humongous amount of words
so we never know how long it's going to
be so we don't want to iterate over the
whole list so if we didn't actually have
this break statement here it could
actually allow every single value to be
looked at so just for instance let's
look at let's look at what happens
because of the break statement so we're
going to
simple alert and it's going to alert the
value so what will end up happening is
it alert Chris the first value and then
it's going to alert John the second
value and then this will be cos that
element will equal John so then this
statement will will hit and then it will
break out it will never try to evaluate
Billy or what comes after so I can even
say what comes after so these two will
never be evaluated because this
condition was met and the break
statement works to our advantage and we
can save a lot of resources on the
computer so here's Chris here's John
holy poet equals John we're exiting now
we left the for loop the other two
values are never are never equated so
what happens if we don't have the break
statement there Chris John holy poet
equals John now exiting now now it's
looking at Billy though and then it
looks after what comes after then
finally we left the for loop so if we
had a million values that entire million
values will be equated before it ever
left so you can see why the break
statement is extremely important it
breaks out of the blocks really the
block scope but and we're at we haven't
touched on the scope yet so just think
it breaks out of the the outermost block
statement that it that is nested in all
right so that being said now we need to
do a switch statement so a lot of people
will use switch statements because they
liked it better than to say if this
equals this they like to just they like
to switch the value so what if I said
switch I'm going to use a switch
keyboard and then you pass in the value
that's being equated so i'm going to say
my array and it needs to be a specific
element from my array and then you can
say case and we can say what what comes
after and then we're going to use a
colon and let's indent our code here and
we could say alert holy p Batman
and then we're going to use a break
statement here because we don't want the
continued analysis to occur and a switch
statement allows us to also have a
default to so we can say default if no
matches are found we can say alert no
matches found and then we also have to
break out of our default statement as
well so for every element in our array
it's going to evaluate that element and
it's going to see does it equal what
comes after which will be the last one
and then it will say no matches found if
there is no match which in this case
there is going this is going to be hit
every time it doesn't match this so
we'll see let's go and look at this so
no matches found for Chris no matches
found for John I think no matches found
a whole EP Batman because it's the last
element we left the for loop so if I
actually had a value for Chris
so the switch statements going to exit
right after
but you can see the way that we did the
switch statement is it's relatively ugly
because we did it inside of a for loop
so in many cases you're not going to see
a switch statement inside of a for loop
you're going to see the the previous
version but this becomes really helpful
when you're dealing with one value like
a fight we put this outside of the for
loop and we just said really we could
just give it an index number so we could
say let's give it to value one so we'll
just say give it Chris and then this
could be used to our advantage to where
it breaks out after the first match so
we left the loop so in many cases you're
just going to simply give your switch
statement one value and it's going to go
through the set of circumstances that
can occur because of that one value and
some people you know like the
conciseness of it i would say that there
I've met people that don't like it
though that try to avoid it that find it
to be you know more logic and just not a
great fashion so you know they you know
whether or not you end up using it or
not it's it's at least important that
you know why it's there and ultimately
why the break statement is so important
for not just to switch statements but
also for our if conditionals when we're
looping through values to try to limit
you know the amount of resources being
dedicated anyway guys out so that's
going to end this video for more
