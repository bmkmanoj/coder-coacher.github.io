video series what we're going to be
looking at is how to set up django and
react as quickly as we possibly can
i'm going to be building a music website
and i'm not going to get too complicated
I basically want to build one app which
is going to be for the rock bands and
then I want to be able to populate that
with some data turn it into a RESTful
API so that I can communicate using
react to grab JSON data back and forth
from the Django server and have all the
view and stuff like this essentially
rendered with react and probably
bootstrap and in the process what we
want to do is we want and we want to
install some tools like Bower and gulp
which is going to help us maintain a lot
of the project dependencies and packages
so this is really about getting the
project up and going the right way now
my Django installation here is actually
on a server so it's on a Linux
environment using a bun to 14.04 I'm
also using a virtual environment so you
can see here I'm using Windows I have to
communicate with my linux server via
putty but I'm assuming if you're on
Linux you're following along you can
just follow along on the command line
otherwise you'll have to use the command
line and on Windows to run your your
django application we want to make sure
that your django application is set up
inside of a virtual environment that way
any sort of modules and things you
install will just be limited to this one
particular environment so that if you
have multiple websites on the same
server you don't have them sharing
packages especially when those packages
become incompatible with even with one
another so in this case I do have the
virtual environment activated and we're
going to need some basic stuff we have a
Django website and I've already gone
through the headache of having my
virtual host small add stuff which is a
nightmare on its own just set up so that
the Django application is actually
running you can see it's throwing an
error so we're starting from scratch
basically there's no template and we're
going to build everything from scratch
so let's go ahead and look at what a
Django project structure should look
like for your noobs out there that
are just getting started you can see on
my music I have basically a local copy
of the web application that I use for
that I would keep on my own computer for
development and then when things are
ready and working I then transfer those
to the server or if I'm going to be lazy
I just upload them right to the server
and debug right you know doing that and
that's typically what I do just because
I don't have you know some sort of
production site out there that has a ton
of traffic that I have to worry about if
it goes down for an hour so in this
particular case I've owned this domain
for several years and like nobody goes
to it hasn't had a website there in
several years I want to change that but
anyway what we have here is we have a
music environment that's why I created
this a virtual environment created for
me when I installed that and you have
mute this music app which is um it's a
single app anytime you set up your
project with Django you're going to have
your initial app set up and that's what
this is here we have the settings that
you are all the views and your whiskey
your whiskey file is necessary so that
Apache knows how to to run your
application it calls on the whiskey
which then calls on django and build
your application and now what I like to
do is I like to have a static folder set
up in the root directory so in the root
directory here music is the root
directory and then in the Linux
environment I would have the same thing
very similar here so I have my name and
then I keep all my projects and web apps
here so it's a little bit different you
can see on my Windows environments
projects and then music here its Web
Apps and then it's music so sorry so
I'll CD in the music here and you can
see that the same exact thing that
you're looking at over here is the same
so you see logs and music music
environment all that crap is down here
so static the reason why I want to have
a different static file is because I
have nginx which is there's two servers
I use to render my websites like here is
a movies website that's using react in
Django and all this static content like
from react to the images all that stuff
is being handled by nginx because they
can handle it but
than Apache and then everything else
that Django needs to be able to run the
application like querying the database
all that stuff all those requests are
handled by Apache so to have those set
up it's easier I find to have my my
engine X instead of saying hey handle
this file or handle CSS files JavaScript
files image files
I tell it instead to handle everything
out of the static directory because
everything in the static directory is my
static content that I do want it to
handle so that's why I separate it out
like that and you can see the admin has
its own CSS stub that's the Django
built-in admin that will end up you end
up using anytime you you run Django so
we have a CSS JavaScript files and then
I also have my templates in my static
you want to delete that that's not
supposed to be there so let's see CSS
JavaScript and one other thing inside
the images are I'm sorry static folders
should be the images folder so we'll
create that now and then outside of the
static in the root directory I like to
keep my templates file separate so if we
want to look at the settings file which
is the main Django file that you use
basically your cockpit it's your
dashboard it controls all the internal
settings of your application if you're
used to
asp.net it's similar to a web config and
in here we have our template directory
identified and like I said that was in
the root directory under the templates
folder you have a loud host you need to
have this if you're going to be running
and on a server so that you can actually
access the file I'm gonna have it set
the debug true for right now so if we
move down here a couple important things
you have the static root which is going
to be pointing to the actual static
folder I was telling about before and
then also have a media root media roots
made for uploads like when people upload
their avatar images things like that and
those should be handled in a separate
folder then then your static so I just
give them an uploads folder so I won't
be doing anything with that for quite a
while but that's just initially what I
have set up here
and then down below is where you're
going to implement your database and it
also has your django secret key but for
security purposes I can't show you guys
that because then you can see my
password and all that for my database
and that's not cool
so that is basically the the internal
Django set up and what we're going to do
in the next video we're going to go and
create our first module and we're going
to start designing our project for that
so go ahead and stay tuned and thank you
