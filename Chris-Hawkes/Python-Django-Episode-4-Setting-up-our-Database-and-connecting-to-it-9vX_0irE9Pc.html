you install my sequel if you follow that
link below you'll have an option over
here to click on the my sequel thing
which doesn't seem to be there right now
you can also go down to your project
files and my sequel and then down here
like you just do on my sequel command
line client so anyway that's what I have
open here I'm just going to type in the
password that you had created and you'll
be able to see that it is working
correctly so my sequel is installed
that's good now we can go ahead and move
on to the next step so what I'm going to
do here is I'm going to go ahead and
setup my development environment so that
I open a let me close this real quick
I'm going to open I'm using Visual
Studio you can use any development
environment that you want and I did I
just use Visual Studio but I'm going to
go ahead and open that up now so I have
access to all the files that I need so
I'll do just go here to open website
and we can go down to
movie dad my bed I said we'll go here
and just open this
so now that we have that open I have
access to all my files in here my manage
py and everything and let's go ahead and
we're going to set up some well the
point of this video is set up the server
we got a lot of stuff to do so I'm going
to try to keep it on track here so let's
go ahead and connect to our my sequel
server so we're going into my project go
and your settings that py file and
spread and open that up and you can see
a lot of this stuff here so what we're
going to do is set up our database
engine so we'll go to database and then
say my sequel the name of your database
in this case I don't have one we
probably should create one so let's go
actually and create our database name
right now so it knows sorry we can
connect our Django project to that so
let's go back to our my sequel show
I didn't want to do that sorry I didn't
want to do that cancel cancel cancel
obviously I have a different my sequel
version here sorry about that
do the five point six to man line
I um log into that alright alright and
now when we're in the shell let's wear
and create our database name so we're
going to say create database and I'm
going to call it moving maybe movies
I'll create I'll call it movies sorry
you have to do a semicolon
if you press ENTER like I just say to a
semicolon there and that's it so now
just to check that it's work you can say
use movies and you can see database
change so show tables there's no tables
because we haven't created any tables
but anyway that's how we go ahead and
create a database in your my sequel
shell so now that we have that created
we called it movies and our user is a
root our password is privileged
information but like you're going to put
your password here right and then the
host and the port on the default should
the vault should be 3306 so we shouldn't
have to do anything with that that
should just work so let's go ahead and
and see if we can do that
in fact since this is just a local
environment I do want to keep everybody
on the same page so I'm going to have a
password of testing 1 2 3 so that way
we're all on the same page here and just
to test out that that works I'm going to
do testing 1 2 3 didn't worked at it on
second
testing 1 2 3
apparently I can't type
all right so yeah I apparently can't
type because I just typed that password
and wrong like at least five times and
like the sixth time it works so anyway I
guess it's one of those days but anyway
I changed the password so that we all
can be on the same page of what the
password is temporarily and since this
is just a local confined environment I
don't I don't care too much about that I
just want to make sure you guys know
what's going on so that's what's
important all right so now that we've
done that let's go ahead and open up
another command prompt here I want to go
into our projects and we'll go to my
projects
damn it and now we can go into manage
when I say python manage not py I'm
going to say sync DB and this is going
to be a problem that I forgot about so
what we need to do is we need to install
the my sequel DB module so that Python
can communicate with my sequel so let's
go ahead and do that now when I say pip
install my sequel DB
and one of the beauties of this is the
fact that we're inside of our virtual
environment so everything you know as
long as that virtual environment isn't
activated or inactive and you know all
the modules and things that we need for
our application are are in my sequel TV
so we could not find that on a second
so if pip install fails I generally I
didn't try he installed see if that will
work before I hit Google and find out
what the hell's going on
and it looks like that's how can work
either so now we have to hit Google
we'll figure out how the hell to install
my sequel DB all right so here's it
here's the deal that's where we are
Caesar from what we what you want to do
is use easy install pip install is not
going to work Aboriginal environment
easy install will work if you actually
try to install the right thing which in
my case I did not let me show you so if
you go easy I'm going back into my
virtual environment here to set that up
so I'm going to say C Python moving this
is scripts and then we do activate so
we're into our virtual environment now
so if you do easy install and it's a
Python my sequel that should work
actually I did that backwards son of a
bitch
sorry it's a easy install my sequel
Python
alright so I've actually already
installed it but it's now in solid so
you'll see a little bit more when when
you do that now that that is installed
we can go ahead and run from our project
here
so if you go to paisan and then manage
py and then sync TV sync DB it's going
to go ahead and create a the first time
you do it it's going to prompt you with
this message here which it will install
all these authorization permissions so
this is all good it means that my sequel
is now working so it'll say auth group
permissions off group other stuff
they'll ask you do you want to have a
super user so you would go ahead and say
yes to create one now and I'm just going
to have my super user be admin cause I
emailed blank that's fine
so I had my password be testing one two
three so it matches my staple so we can
all be on the same page on how to
install everything so long story short
this is like the hardest part of setting
up any website trying to get everything
to communicate properly so I think we've
made good progress we obviously hit a
little bit of a stumbling block there
with easy install and pip install and
trying to get my sequel DB inside a
virtual environment and have Django
communicate with your my sequel
installation but now if you're on
Windows 7 and you follow these steps and
you know that you'll be up and running
now so I'm going to end the video now in
the next video we're going to show you
how to activate the admin within your
Django project</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
