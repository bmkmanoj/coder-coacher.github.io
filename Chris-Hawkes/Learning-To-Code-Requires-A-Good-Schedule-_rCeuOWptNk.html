backyard so does the first video I've
done in my backyard and there's my dog
so in the last two videos I apparently
need to learn how to hold a selfie stick
and it's gonna take a little bit of
practice so my dog there's gonna be my
first introduction to my dog who's
actually a coding partner with me base I
look up just like eating grass right now
hey besan come on
there you are yes alright so this is my
dog and she is a coding partner so it
actually helps to have a dog whenever
your your coding so when remember I get
to like work from home I think it really
does help honestly to just be able to
pet the dog anyway so one of the things
I wanted to talk about in this video is
I get a lot of questions about like how
does somebody learn how to program you
could tell somebody until you're blue in
the face that you can like watch videos
or you can read books or you can just
write code and and ultimately that you
just have to do something and the
problem is though is that some of the
people that ask they're like well we
know what's the bare minimum that I can
do to be a programmer and I can only
speak personally and I'm not the
smartest guy in the world but when I
first started like I was spending quite
a bit of time and I would come home and
I would be tired and I would come home
from work I had a wife I had kids and I
would find time in the evening and I
pretty much would train my brain to be
able to you know relax and basically get
into a schedule so you know you mean you
have to make sure you're eating you're
drinking you're getting exercise you
need to spend time with your family and
if you have children or something like
that then obviously you need to get out
there and you need to spend time with
them otherwise you're gonna feel you
feel bad and it's gonna be a lot harder
to
to learn so ultimately you have to take
care of yourself and then assuming
you're able to do all that stuff then
you need to find whatever time you can
to then try to study so in my case I
would try to program in the evening and
I'm sure that some of those times I
didn't spend enough time with my family
but you know there are sacrifices that
you also have to make in life to be able
to move up and try to accomplish your
goals and everything but I would I would
program for a couple of out of hours
usually at night and I think the longer
I did that the more that my body was
trained in to doing things almost
subconsciously so these aha moments that
you have as a programmer we're like
nothing makes sense and like you're
reading a book and you're learning about
variables and loops and all this stuff
and and the concepts seem like okay well
that's that's simple if I need to use
make a list I just do this or I do that
and that but there the overall big
picture is never there so then when you
need to apply those principles that hell
is that anyway when you need to apply
those principles it you know just
doesn't fit so the overall big picture
isn't there and it's ultimately when you
start actually getting into more
complicated code and you started trying
to compile your program as you start
writing bigger and bigger projects and
things down and then things won't work
right and then you have more code than
you've ever written before you really
have no idea what we're where the
problem lies
because really none of this stuff makes
any sense but ultimately I think being
and having a schedule down when you're
doing something that's complicating it
as complicated as teaching yourself how
to program a constant schedule is going
to be really important so if you're
gonna do an hour a day or you're gonna
do two hours a day if that's all the
time that you have even if it's thirty
minutes a day just try to make sure that
that you're looking out for you number
one and that you're using your time
effectively if you're like me and you're
like a lot of programs that I've read
about and people that I've talked to
we're like literally you won't be able
to sleep at night because you couldn't
get some some project running one time I
had like all this work that I had saved
up on my computer and this is after I
had had
sleepless nights trying to figure out
how to get my program running one time
and this is a completely different story
but I ended up I bought this game like
Witcher 2 I think was Witcher 2 actually
so whenever that game first came out I'm
pretty sure I was an actual professional
programmer at that time I'm almost sure
I was but when that game came out like I
had websites that were in production at
that point and I had all this data that
I had saved up and all these different
programs that I had written over a
period of the years and I went to
upgrade my hard drive to actually play
that stupid game witcher 2 which wasn't
even that great i mean was okay but
certainly wasn't worth what i'm about to
tell you and you know I had to like okay
so I had to buy a new graphics card and
I and I actually didn't update the hard
drive I had to buy a new graphics card
and then I had to buy a new power supply
unit for the computer because the power
supply unit didn't give enough amperage
or whatever in order for this graphics
card to run so I do all that stuff right
and I'm putting everything back in but I
didn't pay enough attention to the wires
that go into the hard drive so like
there were two different wires that
plugged into the hard drive and that
they fit right in and I put them both in
but it turns out like when I turned that
Joker on like I started smelling smoke I
started seeing smoke and I immediately
unplug the computer turned off the power
and I never well I figured out pretty
quickly that I completely provide my
hard drive in a matter of like two
seconds and and that was a terrible
experience because like all this code
that I had written and stuff I'd stayed
up by I mean I basically I couldn't even
sleep at night because I was like I just
blew away years worth of work and
probably all kinds of work I don't even
remember that was on that machine and
probably don't even remember even now
but ultimately the reason why I was
losing sleep over it it wasn't about the
data or anything like that it was about
the like basically the blood sweat and
tears that went into writing these
projects and these you know
all these files of code that ended up
you know getting data for me or parsing
data I had stuff written and things like
PHP and perl and python and I was using
Stack Overflow back then but I had no
confidence that if I didn't know how to
do you know some particular task where
I'm like iterating over two lists at a
time or something like that like it took
a lot of experience to be able to track
down answers to how you accomplish
things like that on Stack Overflow and
either Google's gotten better at it or
I've gotten better at it but it seems
like when I fast forward to today I
don't even say bookmarks for the most
part because I'm like you know what if I
need to figure this out I'm just gonna
do a couple google searches I know how
to search Google and I'll find you know
the relevant information because even if
I save a bookmark I may not remember why
I have that bookmark so so that yeah
that's a long story short is that uh I
got blew away in my hard drive I
couldn't sleep and it was because of all
the code and the effort that went into
writing code when I was first getting
started that I lost and I was just fine
without it actually so it turns out like
when I bought a new hard drive and
that's why I said I had to update the
hard drive is actually blue that hard
drive away and I had ended up having to
replace and I ended up taking all that
hardware including I couldn't return
which I actually still have it in fact I
sold in a yard sale but I ended up
taking all that crap back to Best Buy
and I was just like damn over a computer
game I didn't sleep you know hardly for
a week because I was just worried about
all this simple work that I had blown
away but that's programming for you
there's going to be times where
literally you can't figure something out
for days on end sometimes like when
you're in the corporate world and you're
supposed to get something done like they
look to you to get that job done and you
can't figure it out and and sometimes
you need to be that guy that figures it
out so that's even more stressful
because there's not really anybody to
turn to because you are the guy that is
supposed to have the answers and I think
ultimately that's the biggest stresses
and an even bigger than that I think is
then when you start getting into like
systems architect
sure and you start making decisions that
cost companies millions of dollars and
if you're wrong
it's basically your butt on the line so
I don't look forward to that to be
honest with you and I suppose that the
you know alternative direction if you
didn't want to get into like software
architecture you could try to do like
management but in that case and you
probably need to have some sort of a
business degree from for many of the
companies unless you're actually running
a company yourself which I definitely I
think that's I condone that I actually
do that myself so yeah guys that's uh so
everybody is different when you're
starting out programming how much time
you spend programming is gonna be up to
you but if you're not looking out for
yourself and you're not actually
building a nice schedule in order for
your your body to be able to take in
information then you might just be
wasting your time and spending your
wheels and I think that when you're
first getting started trying to identify
when you're not really accomplishing
much and sometimes it feels like you
accomplish nothing but normally you
should be able to look back over a
week's period of time or a month and you
should be able to seek growth and if you
don't then you may need to just hold
hold the brakes for just a little bit
and and just try to figure out you know
what it is
that's going on in your life that is
it's not allowing you to get this
because it could be things like diet
exercise family or lack of time or
motivation to so everybody can learn how
to program if they want but if they're
not actually motivated they don't really
want to be a programmer then I mean
there's nothing that anybody can do
that's just gonna make this process easy
it's not an easy process at all but it's
something that everybody is capable of
if if you have the desire so anyway guys
thanks for watching have a good night
