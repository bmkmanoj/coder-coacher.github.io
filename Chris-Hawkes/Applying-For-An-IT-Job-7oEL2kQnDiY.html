video I'm gonna talk real quick I don't
have a ton of time actually I'm actually
busy as today but I need to talk
about the experience when it comes to
like applying for jobs so a lot of you
guys are asking me they're like well
these jobs they ask for everything they
asks you know all these different skills
and and then they want a degree
sometimes a master's PhD whatever and
and people are like why'd you get the
job and everything well the number one
like if it won a PhD or a master's
degree probably don't even apply to it
but number two like one of the best
pieces of advice I got from a guy a long
time ago when I was first I was
experiencing the same thing and he was
just like just just apply anyway so
unfortunately you know some of the
automated systems or whatever they're
gonna say ok you don't a degree that was
scanned for like some sort of degree
maybe on your resume and they made me
automatically reject it I've heard about
that happening but for the most part
like the companies that I've seen that
are looking for IT talent they don't
give a whether or not you have a
degree they care if you can do the job
so if you can I wrote down a few notes
on a just a typical piece of web spam
that I get from recruiters that are
looking for IT positions around DC this
particular job they're looking for a
front-end dev and Herndon Virginia and
they said 2 through 10 plus years of UI
experience it's like holy that's a
big-ass wide range there isn't
it like a person who's been in the gate
for two years versus 10 like it's gonna
be a night and day difference really
when it comes to experience for most I
think decent devs so that means to me
right there that they're willing to take
somebody that is a more junior to
moderate and then even looking at you
know seniors so they probably have a
number of roles to fill for this
particular position and they're looking
for a wide array of talent they know
that people that are gonna have 10 years
they're gonna pay those guys 140 hundred
and 150 year probably and earned and I
have no idea what they're getting paid
up there but I know it's a lot because
it's right out of DC and its really
 expensive up there so then
they'll say like proficient HTML and CSS
3 well everybody should be using CSS 3
at this point and if you don't know what
hTML is for god sakes no but applying to
any programming job
that has to do with what web development
but learn that the good news is you can
learn I can learn off my videos or
whoever's videos I prefer mine but
anyway you can do all that now
also see something like this in this job
it says proficient HTML it says it says
knowledge of less or sass or basically
it wants to know that you know what a
CSS preprocessor processing language is
and that's funny because like I got a
job where I got paid a lot of money
where they also wanted less or sass and
I had never used either one of them and
they were fine with that because I was
able to learn it it's it's pretty
 easy if you've been doing CSS
and in any sort of programming like less
or sass isn't gonna be hard not really
no I mean for brand new beginners I'm
sure it's hard like I always never try
to gloss over the complexities of
programming but eventually you'll also
be like yeah that shit's not hard anyway
so it's not like if you did have less
experience that they're gonna be like
 you get out of here we want sass
experience they're very similar so if
you have one or the other just pick one
and don't worry about like so if you if
you think that you're looking for a job
that is gonna deal with that sort of
thing just pick one over you don't have
to learn both and then client frameworks
and there's the same thing climbing
frameworks
it says react to knockout angular lists
all this and like obviously
you're not gonna be experienced like an
expert in every single one of those
because they haven't even been around
long enough to become an expert in all
of those for the amount of time it would
take from one particular developer to
work with literally all those frameworks
it's so basically once again
pick one and and move on maybe gloss
over a few of the other ones to know
maybe some of the benefits of view or
something like that over react maybe
even just comparison videos like I've I
put out or other people put out things
like that client frameworks now it says
jQuery on this bitch and I I am and I've
been telling you guys for a long time
but it's like jQuery sad or whatever
like everybody needs to know jQuery
probably for any sort of corporate
corporate web development any sort of
like yeah any sort of corporate gig
that's been around for a while because
you're gonna have all kinds of systems
that are using jQuery as can continue to
be that way for a very long time and
then this thing it talks about image UI
manipulation version control so again
get your versus TFS I got a job one time
where all I had was version control
experience but with TFS and had never
really used git more than just a few
personal projects and again it was the
same situation they were like well you
understand the concepts of version
control like kid is probably
year to deal with NTFS in my opinion so
it's and once again I was it was a
situation where I just took a couple
weeks to learn the basic console syntax
of git and and I was up and running as a
senior dev but I mean obviously that
that experience becomes a lot more I
think you know the level of experience
you have in programming becomes these
these issues are a big deal here by the
way if you have two years experience so
if you have two years experience you've
never used any sort of version control
you're a complete greenhorn they
know it like you're gonna get hired as a
junior you probably won't even get hired
to be honest depending on how how
demanding the job is but this particular
job did ask for a degree and all I'm
simply saying is that for this job like
I meet the criteria for this job other
jobs that have been similar to something
like this I've met the criteria I don't
have the degree it doesn't matter I
still apply they still call me back
they're still interested they still hire
me and they would do the same thing with
you guys like if you if you show that
you have the necessary skills so I think
my advice is if you have the skills make
sure you're you're you're analyzing it
correctly do you really have those
skills if you do then go ahead and apply
anyway because you're not wasting
anybody's time and if they don't call
you back simply because you don't agree
than we don't want to work there
anyway all right guys thank you have a
good day so this video was brought to
you by a dead mountain coding boot camp
there are eight boot camp that is based
out of Utah but they're also in Texas in
Arizona now and they have very good
reviews so make sure you guys check them
out the link is in the description tab
below they offer courses in web
development iOS development UX or user
experience design Quality Assurance and
just a few other ones in fact are even
getting into Salesforce as well now so
they're continuing to adapt their
courses based on what the market needs
are and major companies are hiring some
of their alumni so make sure you guys
