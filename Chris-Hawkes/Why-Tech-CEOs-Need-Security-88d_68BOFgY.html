is a little bit unorthodox of a video
but it is tech related so I feel like
it's on target a little bit i just
recently stumbled across this this news
and it was completely new to me so I
didn't you know have any idea about it
before but really I think in an
interesting story Adobe was founded in
nineteen eighty two by two guys one's
name is John Warnock and the other one
is our Charles go ski actually I
completely Jack of that name it's gechi
that's how his last name is pronounced
ski patrols guess ki was one of the
founders of Adobe in 1982 he was
actually he worked at Xerox for a time
he actually developed a programming
language while at Xerox which Xerox
didn't want to use which is funny
because they also have a relation going
back all the way of Windows but they
didn't want to use the programming
language so he ended up starting Adobe
and they created this post's Krypton and
post-trip was used by Apple's back in
the early 80s so they'd actually
slingshotted adobe to be relevant and in
the IT world so this guy's a long time i
see person but in 1992 when he was CEO
of adobe and adobe had just recently
moved to its new headquarters and at
this point i think it was own like nine
hundred million dollars in revenue so
they were a major company and you know i
think this was even their headquarters
even in 92 but i could be wrong about
that but either way was it was a new
headquarters something and that could be
it but don't quote me on that but anyway
they had a new headquarters John Gatsby
was the dinner Charles guess he was it
was the CEO and one morning he leaves
his home and Los Altos California which
is relatively kind of small laid-back
community and super rich though they saw
it's a very rich like nice neighborhood
and the mountain view california area so
near Google
and Palo Alto and Silicon Valley and all
that stuff so doesn't look like much
Raiders California and everything's
expensive in California but this guy's
obviously loaded but he doesn't live
like it so he's driving like a nice
Mercedes probably a
hundred-thousand-dollar Mercedes but it
doesn't spend money like lavishly and
when I say lavishly I'm talking about
like a Larry Ellison from Oracle who
spends money like like crazy in fact on
some of the stuff Larry Ellison his spot
is absolutely insane like he at one
point he owned the largest shot which is
now owned by larry page one of the
founders of Google valeri elephant at
one point owns I was like a four hundred
and some foot yacht and I think it had
like a staff of like 18 people that had
to actually run the boat it was so big
but he's also got extravagant properties
all over the place he slides like
military jets and things like that and
even his a human bought a Hawaiian
island for like five hundred million
dollars throw but this story isn't about
Larry Ellison busy Charles guess key was
to the complete opposite of valerian he
wasn't spending money some money
lavishly like like somebody Ellison but
at the same time he didn't actually have
bodyguards so you actually wonder why or
some people may wonder why like somebody
like Mark Zuckerberg has to have
security around them at all times
Zuckerberg is a CEO of facebook it's
because when yours worth that much money
you know bad things can happen to you
and this is a case in point saying of a
bad thing happening to a CEO guy so he
leaves his work he's or at least his
home he's going to work he gets out of
the car and some car pulls up next to
him and this is early in the morning so
he's one of the first ones to arrive at
the office and this guy gets out and
he's holding a map and he's acting like
he's lost and and once he approaches the
CEO either he notices the guy has a gun
three forces them in the car blindfold
him by basically taping his eyes shut
and then making him wear sunglasses and
he gets driven off to some house like 30
30 minutes away he has no idea where
he's at but turns out there was actually
two kidnappers that had kidnapped this
guy
and they ended up taking them back to
the safe house like they're the right
questioning I'm in saying that they're
going to bomb his entire neighborhood
and that his house is on they're going
to kill it family things like that so
they're trying to like probe him and
find out how much money and what a lot
of people especially idiot criminals
don't understand is that a lot of people
that made me wealthy or whatever they
don't have a whole lot of liquid cash
like I don't have liquid assets and
things like that things that they don't
have like a safe with millions of
dollars of lying around i mean only
idiots think that you know it's like you
know people have money tied up in stocks
and bonds and like and real estate and
things that just can't be liquidated
that quickly but these guys are trying
to figure out how much liquid cash you
know he has now millionaires can
obviously probably get their hands on a
few p.m. maybe even a few hundred
thousand dollars i'm not sure but you
know even that i would think would be a
stretch hell you can't even get more
than five hundred dollars out of an ATM
and many ATM so it's your criminals are
just stupid but anyway they're like you
know they're trying to ask them how much
money's worth and things like that they
eventually end up getting in contact
with his wife and his daughter to start
negotiating ransoms and at this point
though this is like day two of his
captivity where they have them chained
up and everything like that and and it
is the you know they're told the family
that they're not allowed to call the FBI
and things like that so the family knows
no they should get the FBI involved or
not but they are concerned that John
Warnock the other CEO and other or not
the United notice position was but the
other executive at Adobe could be in
danger as well so Warnock was actually
made aware of the situation by the
family even before I think the FBI got
involved but I'm not exactly sure how
the FBI ended up getting involved with
the family did it end up doing the right
thing because they did get the FBI and
the FBI was very very hush-hush about it
sound like they told the local news
reporters say we have a kidnapping
situation it was a very low profile
thing because the kidnappers you know
we're threatening to kill the guy if if
the family went to the police and things
like that so yeah they were able to keep
it you know completely under wraps but
this goes on for actually four days
believe it or not so this guy's in
captivity for four days when one of the
the kidnappers ends up ends two guys and
both of them were calliphoridae were
living in California one was at least
from ceará Asteria originally or had
some sort of Syrian descent but these
two guys were in their mid-20s anyone
was 25 the other one was 26 a time and
one of them ends up going to pick up the
cash drop off that is being dropped off
by the CEOs daughter and when he goes to
do that like he immediately knows that
it's a sting operation but he takes off
running with the cash and ends up
dumping the cash and like his weapon
somewhere because he actually was armed
when he went to the kind of drop off and
the apparently even though like the FBI
had all these different resources
including the military and things like
that that the chase was on to like an
entire day searching for this guy who
was able to flee on foot like hiding and
sewer pipes and things like that and
they were able to finally catch up with
him and he was willing to cooperate with
the FBI and take them back to the house
where the guy was being stated was it
was staying at now the the two guys is
our muhannad al bokhari al bokhari which
he was the guy that was doing that was
picking up the cash while ahmad muhammad
SI e was staying behind was with a chav
gas key so he was instructed though if
he wasn't if if the guy picking up the
cash wasn't back in four hours to go
ahead and kill EST but luckily that
never ended up happening because he was
gone for like 24 hours before the nearly
accomplished sent the FBI back to the
safe house after he was busted and FBI
ended up reading the house and saving
trial gasps key and and for the longest
time he like he never really told his
story but he ended up doing a long
interview with the Los Altos community
crier some some local newspapers to the
area that
he lived in but he didn't talk about it
all but it I just think that you know
the story is you know one thing it's not
really you know specifically anything
I'd normally talk about but it is
interesting that that you know these
CEOs can become targets and and in for
situations like this I mean this is why
you see people like Zuckerberg and Steve
Jobs when he was around and things like
that you see them with armed security
because you know they need it you never
know i mean if people end up trying to
pull some crazy like that there
there's plenty of crazy people so the
question is you know where is Mohamed
say II the guy that was left at the
house what well I was trying to look him
up and I couldn't find any record of
them in the california state
penitentiary system or anything like
that so this guy either died in
captivity or he was released on the
hush-hush and i never even found
anything out about it so I'm actually
thinking that he probably died in prison
but I'm not a hundred percent sure the
other guy though his name is Muhammad
al-bukhari and keeping my this was back
in nineteen ninety two he actually pled
guilty in 92 I am with sentence he's
been in prison all this time and he's
actually in San Quentin penitentiary at
the moment that's like that's the
penitentiary you do not want to be in in
California but San Quentin is like in
fact there was a reference to this
service this movie this is a video I
won't even you know linked it's on
YouTube for whatever reason so I guess
you know they they are covered well you
know they are apparently bad things it's
just a joke in this chris hart and will
ferrell movie get hard that they're
talking about Stanton quitting and what
goes on over there but the point of this
video guys exactly you know don't be a
criminal I mean this dude's been
spending you know the other dude
probably died in prison like I said and
and then al bokhari here I mean he's
been there since November fourth 1992
he's been in pendant pendant injury so
think about all the stuff that has
changed since 1992 a lot of you guys
watching this video probably weren't
even
horn so your entire I mean this dude is
just rotted away all this time because
he wanted to try to get six hundred
thousand dollars and that's actually
what I should have ended up mentioning
it was six hundred thousand i think is
what he ransomed was and and six hundred
dollars i mean i guess it was probably
closer to a million back then maybe but
either way it's certainly not worth
risking and spending the rest of your
life in prison because at this point if
they haven't released al bokhari i don't
think that they will at this point I
mean he's now 50 some years old and he
spent you know that many years in prison
edits you know Clinton was just taking
office you know for eight years when he
ended up going into and I remember those
days like that so much time has passed
why would you do something so stupid
like that man you go out and work for
your money don't be an asshole you know
it's a crazy what people will do so yeah
that's all I got tonight I just want to
share that story with you guys and
whether or not you find an interesting
I'm you know once again it's a little
bit unorthodox for my channel but thanks
