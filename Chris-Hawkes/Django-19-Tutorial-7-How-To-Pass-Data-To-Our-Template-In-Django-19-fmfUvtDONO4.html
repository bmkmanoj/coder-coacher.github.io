so what we're gonna do in this video
let's go ahead and clean up this
template here remove this HTML that we
don't need this is for the video page
that we had showed in the last video and
what I want to show you is how we
actually pass data down to your Django
HTML page so it can be displayed so
let's pull up our views dot py file the
one that's rendering the index.html so
if you remember we have two views now
like every app you add to your project
you're gonna have its own views file so
video has its own view and then any
other app you want to add in the future
will have its own view and I had showed
you guys that we have this empty Python
dictionary object which this is actually
what we're going to use to pass down
pass down data to the template so I can
actually have a string right so we'll
just have just a simple variable we'll
call my string equals this is a Python
string and then if we want to pass this
down we can assign it any name that we
want so just like any Python dictionary
that you've ever used the dictionary is
called a dictionary because it has a key
and a value the key is how you get the
value the key can be whatever we want it
to be so this first argument you could
call it whatever it doesn't matter like
I mean this you would give it a
distinctive name that matches you know
hopefully like you know whatever the
data is because you know you wouldn't
want to call it variable whatever but my
point is that you can name it whatever
you want your key can be whatever so a
real name let's go ahead and just call
it the name of the variable so we know
what it is my string and then we're
going to assign the value to it of my
string
so now if we go over to our view that
renders this page we should be able to
reference that data in our template by
saying my string
and because it is data like we need to
have it in some sort of HTML tag so
let's put it in an h1 now I want to be
and make sure you guys are aware of this
if you're picking up this video midway
through you're gonna notice that I'm
using Visual Studio to actually run my
django app so all I gotta do is hit the
little green button and it's going to
launch my my Python development server
that comes with Django you don't have to
do that you don't have to use Visual
Studio and if you go to wherever your
project is located where you're gonna
have access to your manage that py file
so you can see that this projects and
movies too and then the movie main app
name and you could just simply say
Python manage that py run server so just
to make sure you guys are aware of that
I touched on that in earlier videos but
I don't have to necessarily do this
every time I make a change and want to
start up my server so anyway so I went
ahead and I started my application if we
go back over to the videos page you can
see that we're actually printing this as
a Python string and we're putting it
inside of an h1 in our template so it's
just a header tag in HTML so you can see
this is server-side data that got passed
down so it's not some static data
meaning some HTML template that we
created and just reference that never
changes
you know this can be dynamic data that
gets pulled from a database that gets
read from some API that maybe it's you
know scraped or you know read from some
email scraper program that you know you
run every day or something the bottom
line is that the data can come from
wherever you want it to and the server
can get that data and then it passes
that data down just like I showed you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
