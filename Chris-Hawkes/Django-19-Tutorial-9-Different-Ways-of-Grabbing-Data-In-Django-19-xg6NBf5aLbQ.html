the last video we went ahead and we
queried our database and we grabbed all
the database objects but most of the
time you don't actually want to do that
you just want to grab one or two objects
so instead of saying all you're actually
gonna give it a different keyword called
filter and inside the filter what you're
actually going to do is pass an argument
of how you want to you know filter all
of your database data down so what you
can do is you could say like filter and
then I could just actually say like
title equals so basically you could just
put whatever you're you're trying to
query like we obviously know that our
model file has a title here right so we
could say title equals and then we
should get just one result back on our
data so instead of our data I'm having a
bunch of different data it should only
it could actually have multiple matches
if you had more than one title there
that has that that name then you would
get more than one object back now the
thing to keep in mind is that filter
does return a query set so not just an
individual query it could actually be
multiple queries and of only one matches
you're only going to have essentially a
list a Python list with one entry in it
but filter can actually have you know
multiple entries if like I said there
was multiple matches so just keep in
mind that there's a difference between
the way you reference data that is in
like a list format like we did in our
template where we iterated over each
object and then there's also going to be
a different way that if we know we only
get one object back it's not going to be
unlike a list iterated type of format
and we're going to reference it in our
template differently so that may not
make a ton of sense right now but just
know that the filter actually returns
the same thing as you know grabbing all
so since we made this change let's go
ahead and see if this works typically I
wouldn't have such a long title I don't
think that I would be looking at as a
query set here but I'm gonna be running
my server now from the command line
instead of having my editor do it just
in case they actually confuses some
people out there
so that being said I need to change my
report okay all right so now this way
there's a reason why I'm not using my
editor is it keeps changing the port and
that friggin drives me crazy so now I
can just start it from the command line
and it would use the same port every
time so I can make I think it speeds
things up but you can see that now we
list one object back right and our
template didn't break right it was good
okay so let's look at what happens if we
only instead of using filter and all
which returns list lists of different
query set objects that match from the
database we're gonna say just get one
right and instead of filter we can say
get right so we're saying you're only
going to return once in one object and
if multiple objects actually match
you're gonna actually run into an
exception so now you can see video
object is not iterable and a Python list
is iterable meaning you can run through
the list one object at a time a single
object can't be iterated like that and
that's what I was talking about it's
gonna throw this error and it's gonna be
confusing to you guys you're gonna be
like why the hell is it doing this
because you referenced your data and
your template as if it was in list
format and filter and all and other
types of queries and Django will return
a list type format others will not so if
you're saying I'm only wanting one
object you're not gonna reference it in
this way so we would actually you could
essentially just get rid of this and get
rid of the loop and instead of saying
video you would pass down data title
because you're still referencing the
data object that we're passing down in
the views which is right here but data
instead of it being a list of objects
it's just one object and it's one object
that is a video object and if we went to
the video class we know everything
that's available on that object title
description upload date video ID blah
blah blah so if I went over here I can
do this
and I could do something like this data
that video
I D so let's go ahead and take a look at
what we see now the exceptions gone we
now have the title we have the video ID
and where that becomes cool is like
let's look at how we can actually make
that data look a little bit cooler so if
we went over to the video like if we
click on share right and we go to embed
you can see that django django but
google gives you all this embed code
right and we just copy that and we can
reference this inside of our template so
let's do that and then you can see the
one unique thing about any embed video
that you're looking at is that the ID of
the video itself so what we would do
instead of doing this we would just get
rid of that get rid of this and then
right there that's where we would
actually say video ID data that video ID
see these two curly braces are very
unique to Django and if you ever start
getting into angular and stuff like that
you'll run into some collisions with how
that works but there's ways to work
around it but just know that you know
these curly braces are extremely
important to the Django template in
lenguin and how everything fits together
so if I went back over to our video here
and we refreshed it you can see the
video code is now embedding so that's
pretty sweet right so that's why it's
important because that date is actually
coming from a database but because it's
predictable data you know you can
develop a web page built around that
predictable data and then you just plug
in the little data points so you could
have one particular template that's used
by you know a hundred million different
videos out there and it just it saves a
lot of you know code reuse and stuff
like that and that's considered to be a
dynamic database driven website at that
point now I'm not going to sit here and
touch on every single piece of how you
can actually query a database but I can
refer you to the documentation of Django
which is absolutely awesome by the way
for any sort of you know not just
proprietary or opens
some of the best documentation I've ever
had the pleasure of working with but if
you go through guys it's gonna show you
like you can use the exclude so instead
of filter or get you're gonna be using
exclude to say hey get everything but
don't forget this to anything that
matches here and there's ways that you
can query by date there's ways that you
can query by hell there's all kinds of
different ways that you can query
querying is very complicated subject you
can see there's a lot of documentation
here so I think that if I went into
every single little niche field of how
you query you guys would get lost and
you probably it wouldn't do you any
justice at this point but as you start
you know developing your data and you're
like oh I have all these unique ways
that I need to display the data that's
where you're going to spend a lot of
time with this documentation looking at
all the different ways that you can grab
data but one other way that I do want to
show you because it's gonna be extremely
important and how we we reference our
data going forward I do want to show you
how to get by primary key and explain
that in in Django any sort of database
table that's created for you and it's
done for you by default when you create
a new models file for your apps that you
add there's always going to be a primary
key and I think I've already touched on
this but it's really important that you
know that the primary key is handled for
you it's just an integer and it's gonna
be automatically incremented for every
new object that's added to your database
so it's extremely helpful and a lot of
times you're going to be referencing
your data by primary key and in order to
do that let's look at let's look here so
instead of saying get you're gonna be
saying a lot of times it's funny because
this trips people up right and the
reason why I want to touch on this is
that you can see it says ID right but
then it also says PK so a lot of people
try to reference your ID equal blah blah
blah it's actually not going to work
that way you need to say PK equal and we
can just say PK equal 1 right
and it's the same exact result and if I
said PK equal to its gonna pull the
second video which is my tutorial video
so you can see us that's dynamic
database driven stuff PK is gonna give
you one result and that's a primary key
and the reason why this is important is
in the next video we're gonna look at a
little helpful feature on how to really
take advantage of template reuse in
order to to be able to to just try to
minimize the amount of code that we have
to write alright guys thanks for
watching have a good night</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
