it's my Borat impression that's the best
I can do so I got a interesting comment
tonight and actually I apologize - dude
emailed me like three weeks ago and I
just now got back to him there's like I
don't get like inundated with mail but
honestly like when I feel like it needs
a response like I can't I can't respond
right away so I try to respond I
apologize said it before I can only do
what I could do though so one of the
things he was talking about is he's been
learning JavaScript and CSS and HTML and
he's basically at a crossroads where he
wants to know whether or not he needs to
do good and jump down a you know web
server side language like PHP or Python
and Django he's leaning towards PHP
because of WordPress and I think I
mentioned laravel but he was asking me
you know whether or not PHP would be a
good decision for him now it seems like
his intention and he has no college I
think he's taken a few courses maybe
unrelated at Community College and plans
to go to a coding boot camp and that
being said definitely check out my
coding sponsor which is Deb mountain
coding boot camp they offer all kinds of
courses and modern JavaScript so you can
learn about nodejs and and jQuery and
things like that and apparently they
have a very good track record so I've
actually read up on them quite a bit
even though they are my my sponsor the
innovate they are definitely one of the
larger companies that seem to be coming
up with these coding boot camps so check
them out if you're interested I think
they have courses like actual on-site
courses out of Provo Utah and also
Dallas Texas so that being said this guy
it was like he wants to know should he
jumped down PHP and start going down
that road right away now one of the
things that I did constantly when I was
first getting started my first scripting
language was Perl and I struggled with
Perl and I always tried to run before I
could learn how to crawl and I would get
frustrated and I'd started doubting
whether or not I could be a programmer I
started doubting whether or not Perl was
the right language for me ultimately
those doubts ended up you know
manifesting themselves to the point
where I eventually
Python and I never really looked back I
mean because when I came from Perl and
started learning Python I just like I
saw the light of the day there the
Python had a better community they were
definitely more helpful there was only
like one pythonic way of doing things
where Perl there were so many different
ways but the thing is is that the
struggles were real though the struggles
of not understanding some of the basics
of the language after I had been messing
with it for three and four months you
know because I never properly learned it
I was trying to jump into things I was
trying to do too many things too fast I
was building website templates into a
lot of you know looking in the jQuery
plugins and JavaScript and back then it
was like do I learned jQuery or
JavaScript and you know there were still
this you know huge learning curve when
it came to CSS and things like that and
even software applications like
Photoshop and my cat is attacking me now
Photoshop and things like that and it's
just like there was so much that I had
on my plate not to mention being married
two kids long commute full-time job even
going to school here and they're just
you know so I would come home I'd be
tired man I mean I'm trying to deal with
all this stuff and it was a lot it was a
lot of smaller so my suggestion is that
based on her email and I should finish
what he was talking about he was talking
about that he wants to go around the
companies and basically charge like $250
or so to build websites for them and
he's worrying about like PHP and
databases and full stack frameworks that
PHP has in WordPress and stuff and it
was just like number one I told him I
was like look you're not charging enough
so $250 is not enough even if it takes
you you know one day to do I don't think
the $250 enough you're selling yourself
short now that said if you were gonna be
charged from $250 and you're making a
website for somebody then I would say
that you don't need a server-side
language at all I actually created this
website I didn't even realize that it's
up after all this time is that I created
this website for this this small company
that literally is a very very tiny
company in Fredericksburg Virginia and I
made this this simple website it's all I
need to do was get a free image a
bootstrap theme and basically plug in
some basic
so this website actually looks much more
professional than some of their
competitors that do the same thing and I
ended up I did it for free because it
was a buddy but I would have charged
$250 for that easily and it only takes
me an hour to to actually do it and if
you want them to actually if you want to
actually host a website for them and put
it on your server you could even get a
shared not even share but like a virtual
private server for the node and I could
literally host probably 50 websites just
like that and charge somebody probably
20 bucks a month or something like that
just to host it I mean you're not
breaking their balls they're still going
to be there would be huge amounts of
headaches for them to have to figure
this out on their own so my point is
though is that none of that even
required a server-side stack it required
some you know setting up a virtual
private host you could probably go with
like a share host maybe that does a lot
of that that initial setup for you but
you're not going to have as much
flexibility or resources for such a
cheap price as you would with something
like one node or the digitalocean but
there's no reason why you need to jump
down PHP and try to get somebody to use
a wordpress site and all this other
stuff I would avoid that as much as
possible if they want databases and they
want authentication you need to start
getting into the thousands you know five
ten thousand dollars for a site I mean
an e-commerce site or somebody ami if
you're if you're doing a lot of freeform
stuff then you know definitely you need
to raise that price significantly but if
it's only gonna take you a couple hours
you can do a site that's it literally as
simple as using a free bootstrap theme
and then plugging in some data here and
there no email servers no no mail
authentication no database none of that
stuff even if you needed some data you
can even have a JSON file that is just
literally sitting in the 8th you could
have a JSON object that's sitting in
your HTML file that can literally handle
a database for plenty of restaurants and
things like that out there that
literally don't need a major database or
anything like that so I think there's
plenty of opportunity out there for
people that are eager especially some of
these indie developers to get out there
and start you know
thereíre to the or axe to the grindstone
or whatever that shit is and the point
is like if I were going to do that and I
needed the work there's no reason why
you can't even go into you know a
section of town where you can literally
start going into stores and being like
look this is what I do this is what I
can do for you oh you know $250 I'll get
your website up for a twenty dollar a
month reoccurring fee you can even buy
the domain for them and all that stuff
you know and get a domain name that they
are happy with basically you can make a
business model I think doing something
like this and even building a name for
yourself as a company but one of the
things I will tell you is that when I
first started getting into web
development there was a horticultural
like hydroponics type company in
Washington DC I'm not going to name them
because this this business can actually
list through a third party and I never
even really communicated with these
people I got fucked out of this deal so
hard though I worked for several weeks
on a website for these people and all
these jackasses gave me was like an
image of what they wanted it to look
like so I didn't even have the proper
placeholder for data and stuff like that
so I basically created this entire site
from one image and it was all working it
all worked great it worked on multiple
browsers and then I didn't get paid and
long story short these assholes were
we're bickering and arguing between
themselves about you know who authorized
this this this actual design it wasn't
what they wanted blah blah blah and then
they didn't even really understand who
was even building the product for them
so the thing is I got screwed out at
$2,500 I I should have asked for half of
it up front you always want to get like
half of it upfront at least thirty
thirty thirty three percent of it
upfront that way somebody can't
completely dick you over it's enough
money to where they want you to finish
the deal and you want to finish the deal
to get the rest of that money but you
know that situation sucked and I never
want to go down in fact to this day like
people have asked me to build websites
for them and I'm just like no no I'm not
gonna do it but if I needed the work and
I needed the opportunity I would do it
and I've done a few sites like I did
that site that just showed you I did a
landscaping site for another buddy of
mine in Maryland and even that is just a
hassle the other day he called me and
said
no js' site was down I'm like fuck I
don't know I mean I don't people need to
pay me you know I mean you need to pay
me at least 50 to $75 now you know what
I should be asking for 75 to 150 an hour
I don't even know what I should be
asking for it but the point is I
shouldn't be working for free but the
thing is is like at least I know them
and if they try to get me to do
something I don't want to do I'm gonna
tell them I don't want to do it I'm not
going to do it so when you're dealing
with customers and money and contracts
and somebody that you can't really do
that you have to you have to be
professional you have to try to work out
these are these are these agreements you
know the customer is generally always
right so you want to make sure that you
don't you know act like a dick because a
lot of your business is probably gonna
be word-of-mouth and that's another
thing too I worked with an architect one
time a guy that loves to talk about
technology and and what a great great
guy Steve Jobs was and all this stuff
but doesn't know dick about technology
and he had me um he gave me three
templates and and and he was like you
know this first one that's what I really
want it was like this darker theme and
all this shit I made this beautiful
website and it's in the very same format
using bootstrap using a template
modified it you did some maybe little
decent Photoshop work for the logo all
except this shit looked at macula and
then he was like trying to backtrack and
like talk about you wanted the lighter
theme and all this stuff and I don't
know man I I just I couldn't help but to
get pissed off in that situation like
that's the kind of bullshit you deal
with with a customer and that you can't
basically just walk away and be like
yeah fuck it you can but you're gonna
hurt your business relationship at least
with a friend or a buddy you could be
like dude you're fucking me here you
know what I mean like I just I did this
because you fucking wanted me to not
because I just wanted to make it you
know I mean like those are the type of
deals that I don't ever really like to
get involved in because I don't need to
if I ever needed to I would actually do
that in fact I would go to my old town
and start going to all these businesses
and being like look I can do this for
you
and I can even appeal to the internet
and things like that and try to say hey
I can do this for you there's plenty of
companies that are doing that but you
can undercut
you could undercut them on price and
stuff like that as a single man
operation there's no reason and another
reason another way that you undercut
people is to not get caught up in the
bullshit of what is the here and now and
what is the popular tool get the job
done and I just did a video yesterday at
the time that this is recording which is
going to be released couple days from
now but basically I did a video
yesterday where I talked about working
is good enough and for the most part and
the business world working is good
enough like get it working you don't
need redux and react and all this stuff
in order to display a little bit of data
on a website for a business you know you
could charge them you know and here's
your here's your data here's what it is
you want to go ahead and update your
your your menu or whatever yet I can do
that for you no problem it's gonna be
twenty five hours now out of fifty
dollar you know fee or something like
that or if it's it's fifty dollar fee
and then if it takes more than two hours
and it's going to be you know an extra
twenty five fifty bucks or whatever per
hour on top of that to do that kind of
thing and if you have this business
trustful relationship I mean you get a
lot of those contracts I mean you can
easily be making some some decent Bank I
think in the United States at least
doing stuff like that and I know plenty
of people have actually gotten by that
way this horticulture site and DC them
and they fucked me real bad and and that
was like that was twenty five hundred
dollars in like weeks worth of work so
that's another thing too if if you're
only charged in two hundred fifty
dollars and it's only taking you a
couple hours it's much easier to lend
the kind of credit to lend the business
trust to say hey I'm gonna go ahead and
do this and I'll make money and my cat
is driving me nuts
so that's that's what I would do man
don't worry about PHP or WordPress or
laravel or any of that stuff if you're
only charging $250 per site and get out
there start worrying about marketing
start building your Pinterest channel
your Facebook your your Instagram your
YouTube you do all that stuff for your
business start marketing your product
set up your Linkedin make sure you make
yourself look professional set up a
stripe account so you can start getting
credit card payments you set up a PayPal
account because PayPal even though they
got
large fees I mean it's very easy to send
somebody a PayPal invoice and get paid
there's all kinds of stuff that you you
should be focusing on before you start
involving yourself and so much of that
other stuff for a simple 250 dollar
website and and that's really just my
thoughts man so let me know what you
guys think make sure you subscribe also
once again check out my sponsor dope
mountain coding boot camp for any sort
of boot camp needs that you guys might
have out there take care bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
