Python scraping tutorials in this video
I just want to we left off where you
guys were gonna enter your proper email
and password which is gonna be right
here I want to say that there is another
thing that we want to add to our little
program here we're gonna go ahead and
add just follow these lines here we're
adding a plus and then and single quotes
with a space we're saying cookies file
equals cookies txt so by running it with
this argument we can now I'm going to
change my variables here and pause this
for a moment right so this thing
actually failed and the reason why is
because if you look at the project here
you can see the cookies and it's now
saving all that cookie stuff and where
we take a screenshot after we try to
click the like button we capture this
example dot PNG
and before you added those cookies and
everything if you would have viewed
example you would have seen that you
were not logged in but as you can see
now we are logged in so if it's reading
from those cookies and it didn't have to
log in again so that is a pretty sweet
deal there so we can go ahead and get
rid of all this sign and stuff
and now that we've actually clipped it
I'm gonna go ahead and log in here and
see if we've liked that video
so now that I've logged in and I visited
the page in question you can see that
the like button has already been clicked
so in a nutshell that these this
tutorial series has showed you how to
log in and like your own video and at
this point before we start jumping into
a different subject just to keep things
on point I'm just going to go ahead and
in this particular video now and we'll
get into some more stuff in the future
all right thanks guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
