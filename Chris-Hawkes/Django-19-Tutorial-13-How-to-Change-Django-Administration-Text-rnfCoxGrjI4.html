going to show you the easiest way to
alter the standard behavior for the
Django admin a lot of people want to get
rid of the branding up here the Django
administration and kind of put in their
own name or whatever sort of a website
that they're using in Python 3.5 there's
a very easy way to do it with our
project so here's the project directory
here if you're going to have a templates
folder obviously for your application
and inside your templates folder you
just need to create a folder in the root
of that directory which you're going to
call admin and then inside the admin
we're going to create an HTML file so
let's see new new HTML file and then
we'll call this it's called base site
with an underscore so Bayside underscore
if you're using a sort of editor just
get rid of all this and then we're going
to use an extend statement which is
actually just going to say extend base
tml which is it's going to end up
getting that from the admin project
directly and directly and then all we
need to do inside here is we're just
going to go ahead and do inside the
block branding which is going to
override the block branding of the base
HTML in the actual admin folder and
block and then this is going to be your
custom so custom heading I guess it'll
work alright so then if we go ahead and
we look at our admin again and if i
refresh the page you can see that we now
have the custom heading and you can also
see from before where you probably want
to wrap that in like an h1 or h2 I'm not
sure which one it is by default you'd
have to actually look at the admin
template so that's why I look smaller
there yeah so if i refresh it looks like
it is an h1 so that's the easiest way to
just extend extend that customize that
custom ability without having to rewrite
a lot of the stuff that Django has in
its inner workings so anyway guys thanks
for watching
and please subscribe have a good day bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
