today what we're going to be looking at
is the most influential computer
programmers of all time so this list is
rather large I want to talk fast and go
through it quickly because I know that
you guys have complained in the past
about long videos and there's too many
to mention in fact i'm sure i've missed
several but these are just some that
come to mind and hopefully i did them
justice so let's go ahead and start and
just be aware that the first few that we
named really the first 20 25 or so
there's really no particular order so
first ones John Knoll and Thomas all the
creators of photoshop so photoshop
definitely started with those two guys
and now it is a game-changing software
application Sean Parker creator of
Napster single-handedly brought down the
music industry Larry Ellison founder of
Oracle worth 50 billion dollars and the
crater of db2 database engine Tom
Anderson creator of myspace hick Tov the
social networking craze miguel de icaza
he's the creator of the mono projects of
the c-sharp mono project peter norton
revolutionary and antivirus software
obviously it's taken after his name chad
hurley steve chen and jawad karim these
are the creators of the YouTube website
so they changed the world with their
video platform john r e cig the creator
of the jquery language which ultimately
revolutionized the way we do javascript
and the web edward snowden the US
government whistle blower who exposed
the NSA for all their data collection
tactics Phil cats the creator of the zip
file Michael widen asst creator of my
sequel Carl SAS and wrath I'm hoping I'm
saying these names right creator of
multi-threaded programming essentially
processes so he's considered the father
of that Martin Fowler creator of the UML
diagram language also known as universal
modeling language
John McCarthy father of artificial
intelligence he should actually be
higher on this list I apologize he's
down on this list he should be towards
the top Barbara Liskov one of the
founders of object-oriented programming
object-oriented programming doesn't
necessarily have one single founder but
she can be mentioned in the same breath
Jean I'm not even gonna try it you guys
just say yourself creator of the ADA
programming language one of the most
sophisticated arguably the most
sophisticated language of all time david
Turner who created the Miranda the
precursor to Haskell essentially
functional programming he's a doctor he
had he headed a development team so he
can be considered as one of the founders
of functional programming whitfield
diffie and martin hellman they created
the diffie-hellman cryptography standard
which was used for a very long time and
in fact it's still being used today now
Neil Co blitz and Victor Miller are two
that are attributed to the elliptic
curve cryptography which is more vyas
basically it's the next revolution of
cryptography on top of diffie-hellman
Brad Cox and Tom loved the creator of
objective c that is apple's programming
language of choice which just recently
got replaced by swift but there's still
a lot of it markus persson the creator
of minecraft so the guy that at 33 was
able to create a video game in his spare
time and then sold it for two and a half
billion dollars after about five or six
years to Microsoft walking away with
over 1.5 billion dollars in cash to live
the rest of his life at the young age of
33 showing that any programmer can make
a game and make a ton of money charles
randlett and flint the founder of IBM
IBM has done a lot of revolutionary
things not so much as of late but they
are still a revolutionary IT company one
of the most important maybe arguably top
five most important language
companies of all time and IT fills
emerman the PGP email encryption which
is the common common way that we encrypt
all email he created it Lars back if I'm
even saying that right creator of the v8
engine which is also no jayus which runs
on the chrome v8 engine palmer luckey
the oculus rift guy the guy that went to
Kickstarter raised a couple million
bucks started to oculus rift project in
the garage of his house two years later
sold it to Facebook for several billion
dollars John Carmack creator of doom but
he's also involved in oculus rift
himself and he's a big part of virtual
reality and you know as a whole also you
know with the the advent of doom did a
lot of first-person gaming and is also
involved in WebGL a little bit or at
least I've seen them give interviews in
regards to it stephen kleene the creator
of regular expressions regular
expressions are a huge part of how
programmers do their job it doesn't
matter what language you're using
regular expressions are hugely important
in this guy created the first going all
the way back to the 50s I believe
Charles Goldfarb ed maschera and ray
Lawry creator of the XML language very
important data basically data protocol
data access protocol or data transfer
protocol XML standardized that Douglas
Crockford came along created Jason which
is I alternative to xml so it's a
JavaScript buddy and just simply using
javascript objects it's a much better
translation or data transfer protocol
then XML has less overhead Jesse James
Garrett founder of the Ajax now Ajax is
not like necessarily a piece of
technology or anything it's just a
simple way of not even really simple but
it's just it's just a way of being able
to communicate with a server from a
client browser without having to refresh
the page this can also be attributed to
both Microsoft and Google so it's I
don't know that there's necessarily one
specific person but this guy actually
wrote one of the first articles on you
know what would be the Ajax way so he
could be considered a
a founder of Ajax but Ajax was
absolutely revelation revolutionary to
the way webpages work it brought on the
whole web two point O and three point 0
and going into four point oh but even
Google Maps is one particular occurrence
where Ajax just revolutionized the way
we handle mapping systems David hina
Meyer Hanson creator of ruby-on-rails
ruby on rails started off the whole web
framework craze which ended up giving
way to like NBC net and asp.net well asp
might have been around before that but
the whole MVC django basically Django
Ruby on Rails I think changed the web
framework landscape quite a bit but
definitely Ruby on Rails was the first
in that regard Miyamoto I'm not going to
impress in that process first name but
he created the Ruby programming language
Edgar did yeah one of the most
influential members of computer
assignment computing Sciences foundation
founded generation geez I can't read
help shape the new discipline from both
an engineering and theoretical
perspective so he brought a lot of
theoretical insight into computer
programming computer theory Bram Cohen
creator of the peer-to-peer bittorrent
client basically the thing that
everybody uses on piratebay or whatever
to download stuff and pirate software it
was originally created in the Python
language but this guy is the founder of
that but it is a game changer the way
this stuff works because it can be used
for legitimate reasons as well donald
chamberlain and raymond boys the creator
of the sequel language one of the most
important things that have ever happened
mark zuckerberg creator of facebook so
basically the guy who took what myspace
was trying to do and did it right and
ended up changing the way social
networking works in the world Larry Page
Google founder and creator of PageRank
so I could have mentioned Sergey Brin
but Larry Page gets mentioned because
not just because he founded a company
but he created page rank which
ultimately changed the way search
engines
evaluated data and it did it and his
algorithm was so much better than
anything else that came out or that was
around at the time it truly changed the
way the world operated Alan Cooper
father of visual basic steve jobs and
steve wozniak even though they're not
really computer programmers per se they
are creator of the Apple personal
computer obviously iphones ipods and
certainly revolutionaries in the IT
world anders helzberg one of the well
creator of turbo pascal c sharp and
typescript an absolute genius when it
comes to language design Rasmus lured
off the creator of the PHP programming
language one of the most popular
programming languages of all time Larry
wall creator of the perl programming
language at one point pearl held
together the web they said it was the
duct tape of the web the swiss army
chainsaw that could do anything you
wanted it to do absolutely crushed
everything in the 90s and early 2000s
and is still around and still very very
legitimate but just not as not as
popular as it once was over the last
probably five to ten years Bill Gates
and Paul Allen Bill Gates could probably
be mentioned by himself since he is
considered to be the creator of the doss
and I know that there's some arguing as
far as like you know what he actually
accomplished but we can safely state
that these two guys did change the world
with Microsoft Microsoft still the
leading operating system Dawson Windows
changed the way everything was done in
the world in personal computing Richard
Stallman he's a software freedom
activist and has always been you guys
can read up more on him but that's
essentially the best way to describe him
Ada Lovelace the creator of the first
computer algorithm so she worked with
another guy Charles Babbage actually who
and then helped write the actual what
would be the first computer algorithm so
she definitely has to be mentioned at
any time you mentioned important
computer scientists Grace Hopper coined
the term bug so we refer to bugs in our
systems because of something that Grace
Hopper entered
Nicholas worth the crater of Pascal
Brandon Ike the creator of the
JavaScript language arguably one of the
most important languages right now james
gosling the creator of Java really
revolutionized object-oriented
programming made it a mainstream thing
and between Java and C sharp we see
these fully object-oriented languages
absolutely dominating the enterprise
development or enterprise development
across IT organizations guido van rossum
the creator of the Python programming
language truly change the way things are
done python is continuing to be one of
the most important and popular languages
out there especially for newbie
programmers so Guido definitely needs
his name mentioned as one of the most
important of all time Barney I can't
really ever pronounce his last name
stroustrup but he created a C++ language
so we can thank him for a lot of the
game engines and things that we have but
C++ is certainly a popular language and
he needs to be mentioned in the top of
all time Alan Turing computer scientist
pioneer and cryptography the man who
broke the cryptography that that for a
message communication that the Nazis
were using during World War Two arguably
could have saved the world and then I
ended up killing himself because he was
persecuted for being gay Linus Torvalds
creator the linux operating system very
very important and obviously with the
amount of websites that are run on a
linux operating system he truly did
change the world with his with his at
work tim berners-lee the creator of the
world wide web considered the father of
the browser HTML like he is definitely a
game-changer although the HTML has truly
been you know the work of literally
millions of people but he is considered
the founder of the World Wide Web Donald
Knuth the Godfather of computer
algorithms so if you ever wanted to
listen to a genius talk this guy's one
of the best computer scientists of all
time worked at Stanford for quite a bit
of time very humble guy and I don't even
have a fraction of what this
brain power is brian kernighan helped
create the c programming language he
also did other stuff among that but
that's his most notable feature ken
Thompson also helped create the C
programming language and then number one
on this list I think this is
indisputable amongst most list that
you're ever going to see is that Dennis
Ritchie who died a few years ago and
unfortunately but he is considered the
best of all time on this list and
certainly the best of all time not just
on my list but pretty much everybody's
list he created the C programming
language while he would worked at Bell
Labs and ultimately that truly changed
the world probably more than any of this
other stuff that we've talked about
because all of that other stuff not all
of it but a good majority of everything
we've mentioned can all be you know
pointed back to what dennis ritchie was
able to do along with some you know some
help from others but he was the primary
brains behind the operation and truly is
somebody that should be you know admired
for somebody that that that advanced
human civilization all right guys let me
know what you think of this list i left
it under i got it under 15 minutes
that's pretty awesome please subscribe
