in this video it is gonna be a little
bit of a rant video and just saw this
what one has nothing to do with my
sponsor so my opinions are not in my
sponsors opinion but now thanks to
thanks to a Gentile New York sponsored
good college ave that's bothering me for
quite some time so make sure you guys
check these guys out now one of the
interesting thing well in the coming
future I'm hoping I'm going to be able
to do a collab with this guy that I know
and that I've worked with and he used to
be a boot camp instructor in fact when I
was telling him about the fact that Deb
mountain was sponsoring my content he
was like he was like no way cuz I mean
he worked at a competitor and honestly I
remember the name of the competitor but
he said Deb mountain was like their
biggest competitor so I thought it was
quite funny but I'm he's doing i'll
hopefully be able to come on this
channel and then we'll just have a
conversation about technical stuff this
dudes like he loves elm you guys know
that took like kind of like why bother
kind of a position without but i'll be
the first to admit that it wasn't really
well-rounded in you know reality or
anything like that in fact this video
itself is not going to be ground to it
in any sort of well I'll tell you this
segment but make sure you guys check out
that mountain coding boot camp the
interesting thing that I want to tell
you guys about this buddies I've worked
with is that he used to be a coding
instructor he said at one point like
like 120 150 people that he had actually
taught it was around that he was giving
some thought you know a rough figures
and things like that he said actually
ended up getting jobs and in the market
in fact that making you a geeky he
remains in touch with a lot of his
students that he worked with addie
school camps and so that's actually good
news because not only that this dude
actually graduated from a boot camp I
know another guy from Austin who I'm
working with and his girlfriend just
graduated from a boot camp and now she's
a PHP laravel programmer and rich
Virginia so the fact of the matter is is
like a lot of Union and high mighty
people there you know high money program
is our layover by before your degree in
no way as your you know boot camp is
good you know I it's really a
case-by-case basis it's always been a
case-by-case basis there's terrible
people that have degrees in that and
terrible programmers that have degrees
and there's they're terrible coders that
they're probably should have went to
college you know but it's you know it's
always a case-by-case basis just like
whether or not you can listen to music
and study at the same time or talk on
your phone and drive it's always case by
case and it's always about how much
that's where you're willing to put into
it obviously if you're texting and
driving you probably shouldn't be doing
that but if you're like staring at your
phone type and 10 characters before you
look up as opposed to like typing one
character looking up you know I mean
like there's just like there are certain
people that just I guess only use their
common sense but anyway guys check out
that mountain coding boot camp they are
my sponsor than my main sponsor and I
love those guys alright so that's let's
go ahead and talk about what I'm going
to talk about here and that is redox
form now i just stumbled upon this today
and I acted like a complete role-based
glanced at over plus my name is
something I normally responds you but
the dude I'd like specific questions
about some redox form problems that he
was running into where he was simply
just trying to display an input based on
the value of an of another input and um
and I saw this project and I was like oh
man six thousand stars I readouts formed
what the hell is this thing doing but it
does exactly what it says it does which
is it manages your forms for you so
apparently forms have become so god damn
complicated that we now have to extract
all that out into redox with a stateless
functional system to keep track of what
our individual input elements and things
like that I don't understand it I don't
understand why this thing has 6,000
nearly 6,000 stars I just don't get it
man it's got 1,400 commits 178
contributors and a hundred and sixty
releases Jesus Christ and then on top of
all that
like if you look at the issue that's got
nearly 500 reported issues so I got an
idea hey I need to bring in a form into
my system well I just go ahead and bring
a redux form and it's 500 outstanding
issues that you know are just just
sitting out there like I don't know what
the average amount of issues are that
are out there but all I'm simply saying
is like look why like why do we need an
entire project was 1400 commits and a
hundred and seventy-eight contributors
to handle some mother effing forms oh my
goodness I can't like I haven't even say
it and obviously like as there's a rant
video so I'm not Sandra dog forum is it
is terrible visioning it as an example
of like my goodness like why can't we
just have a forum where we handle the
input in fact everything that I've seen
of late is that you want to have
functional components or you know these
stateless functional components within
react and then you have like state full
container type components so why not
just go with that architecture that
works the architecture that you know
that Redux is preaching in the
architecture that Facebook uses so with
this like the last thing I'm trying to
do is bring in a million dependencies a
million contributors 500 open issues to
be able to handle something as simple as
a forum all you need is some constants
you know just have some functional
inputs right have you no functional text
boxes drag them onto your page and then
you're good to go man dv8 that state
either with react container space or you
can have redox but readouts is all about
like connecting these components
together right so I've never seen I've
never seen a situation where I have a
forum on a particular page where I feel
like I need every single input on change
and everything else to fire a read up
action to be stored in a read upstate
where the only time I ever needed that
form was on that one page right there so
why and the s what I need something like
that I don't they just just write the
container store your state in the
container and call it a day man like
it's just some believable but read out
form it might be a great project clearly
a lot of people like it six thousand
stars or five thousand stars a lot of
contributors I'm not touching it though
I'm not touching unless I'm getting paid
to touch it by somebody else's decision
to use this because I would never want
to bring in this kind of like I don't
even know what half this is doing I
don't want to have to learn about it all
none of this stuff is necessary like you
don't need any of this to admit handle
complex forms this is I mean this is the
kind of software it's like yeah this is
insane this is just one random file look
at all this stuff in here when did forms
ever get so complicated yeah all right
so yeah that's that's really my thoughts
today so I know a lot of guys are going
to take this literally because I really
should Chris talk so to speak but not
only weighed like think like that I
actually like react and read out that i
truly do I think readout steps plus a
lot better I've done full of exciting
fluxes over complicated Beast don't like
it es 6 is really growing on me like I
really do like yesterday once you wrap
your head around the hope that one and
wetback thing it's really not nearly as
bad as a lot of people make it out to be
I'm even coming around on things like
Les and Seth where my man I can just
write CSS but I understand that their
their purposes as well especially within
your large team environments and and you
know you know those total toddler places
so that is great all I got to say is I
hope I never have to work on this thing
though but you know that's it is these
decisions are sometimes out of our
control the more pay to be a programmer
you have to do things that you don't
want to do but this dude from Spain so
Eric Rasmussen definitely has an active
github profile which is another thing I
was going to dedicate another video to
but i guess i'm going to just tell you
now before i forget i talked to a dude
who said that he peppered his github
profile every single day with tim its to
 repositories in order to boost
up to a so it looked like every single
day he
commit but all he was doing with pushing
code changes to a repository
that he owned and it like is like
peppered his entire ghetto profile in
green so it looked like it was like the
most active person in the world and in
another instance just recently I think
I've told you guys about this is well
that another guy that I saw he was like
from Bangladesh or something like that
and he was going around all these
different github projects and any github
project whether it was in the
documentation on the project itself it
ended up using an image he was running
it through like an image manipulator
something i guess i would like bring
down you know the amount of size or
maybe lost lossy mess or whatever that
stuff is lossless anyway he was running
this tool on these images and then
pushing up his changes and they were all
being committed so the dude looks like
it was a core contributor to like all
these major projects but he wasn't like
writing a lot of the complex cody was
just kind of superficially going in and
messing with all these different
repositories go in the same sense well I
go I don't want bus like if somebody
finds a competitive advantage by doing
something like that I guess good for
them you know but in the same sense that
like we thought it was a terrible idea
and I said we talked about in this
channel that's a terrible idea is to hey
which would get a your stack overflow
score because I'm going to determine
whether or not you're a good programmer
by how much of a score you have just
today I saw a guy who posted a simple
question on get in ahead the answer has
1300 of votes on the answer and it was
basically about I think we're tracking
and get statement you can look at I was
probably the first result Google gives
you but it's like 1300 of votes maybe
more and then his question has something
like that's just 13 RS I don't remember
what let me let me look at him real
quick all right so this one is not it
this is not it there was one that was
even worse than this but like here's
something like there's this really such
a decent score but in the case that i
was talking about i don't really looking
at for right now they do does like a
7,000 score on my or seven dollars he's
got more points than i do and i was like
sure it's only question he posted one
question and got nearly 7,000 points on
like a simple github and he does better
profiles and somebody who's
answered a bunch of questions like I
mean I don't know man it's it's kind of
a busted system is what I'm trying to
say so like everybody should always like
you know take things with a grain of
salt I try to figure out I don't know
man people can cheat any system
basically and it's not like somebody
cheated the system it's just like your
system kind of flawed if somebody can
answer like a hundred questions that are
accepted and then still have less of a
score than somebody who just asked a
question that was like you know really
popular you know because the site was
brand new so I don't know man that's
just my thoughts for your daddy guys let
me know what you think once again not
trying to bust on individual projects I
know how hard people work on these
things but I work hard enough to not
have to want you to want to make my life
even more complicated with some of these
projects so I'm going to do my best to
avoid them all right take care bye hey
guys so a lot of you asked me how do I
get my foot in the door to become a
programmer and I just want to take a
moment to mention dev Mountain coding
boot camp is a 12 week intensive course
that focuses on the technologies of the
here and now for web development some of
the things that are actually teaching in
the 12 week course it's geared to get
you into the industry by focusing on
things like jquery nodejs react angular
how to use github so a lot of the things
that you're going to need to do as a
developer as soon as you start they're
going to be teaching you in this and
this coding boot camp and the entire
goal is to be able to get you into the
industry within 12 weeks so if you guys
are interested in learning more
information about Deb mountain coding
boot camp just check out the link in the
description cab of this video thank you
for watching and have a good day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
