tutorial series and in this project what
we're going to do is try to build a
music website I am gonna use PyCharm for
an editor and I suggest you use the same
you don't have to but whatever project
you want to set this up under if you're
gonna be following along you need to
have a virtual environment set up within
Python so your Django installation and
any sort of additional modules and
things that the application is going to
require will be all contained in that so
inside that virtual environment the
reason why I recommend PyCharm is it
actually does a lot of that crap for us
out of the box when we just set up a new
project here and I'm gonna go ahead and
pick a folder and you need to do the
same about you know where this thing is
gonna live and we'll call this thing I'm
gonna call it new music I already have a
music application there and we just want
to go ahead and select that it is a
Django project we're going to be using
Python 2 7 I want to use Python a 3
version but Django is still not quite
there as far as the libraries and things
we may need in the near future so I'll
go ahead and add that as an interpreter
and just select ok
all right and now the applications name
is gonna just be called my project in
fact I want that lowercase my project
and we'll go and enable the Django admin
all right so this is gonna go through
and set up a new installation assuming
you don't have a PyCharm you don't you
don't want to go this route really as
far as the Django documentation you'll
need to get this online the aim at this
particular tutorial series is not going
to be to really explain how to set up
Django so hopefully you can get that set
up and we can go from there so another
good thing about PyCharm here is that
it's really built for Django so you can
see new music is the name of our project
and then we have a first module name -
my project really that's kind of stupid
yeah it's kind of stupid looking but we
can deal with that and one of the good
things is that we can just simply run it
and it will start an actual Django
development server so when I click to
run you can see that it's now running
down here at this URL location so let's
go ahead and navigate to that
and you should see this page now if you
go to the separate route you just have
to install django yourself
like I said preferably you want to put
that into a virtual environment so look
to install that and then as long as you
get that Django help page we should be
good to go so let's go ahead and review
a few things with my application here I
want to use my sequel as the database so
first things first let's go ahead and
change this back ends and we're going to
say dot my sequel
in order for my sequel to work in fact
I'm not gonna do any of this this is the
first application I've actually
developed using PyCharm
and honestly it's been years since I've
even set up a Jenga project even though
I've run several Jenga projects I kind
of borrowed off of the previous one as
far as the installation and this is a
Windows setup that I have going on here
and normally in production I have Linux
and just to make sure you guys do you
know that I do have some idea of what
I'm talking about one of those sites
that I own and run for Django is new
movies comm it's been around for a
couple of years now I get decent traffic
but you see here so it's pretty modern
looking it's even responsive from a CSS
standpoint so so it's a decent looking
website and it's built in Django so I do
know django development I just some of
these initial setup things can be a
little bit of a problem name is going to
be the name of the actual database on
our my sequel setup and we're going to
call this we'll call it just new movie
let's go ahead and specify a user and
the user is going to be root and then a
password
so I think that is my my setup for my
local my sequel server now you do need
to go ahead and install my sequel if you
plan on using that I already have it
installed so I want to go ahead and
actually run it alright so you want to
make sure your my sequel server is
running after you install it and if
you're using like Windows 8 or 8.1 I'm
really in the any Windows you should see
this my sequel command line client and
you can just um click on that and all
you have to do is enter the password
that you set up I set up a password
testing one two three just for our
testing purposes so make sure you can
log in there and we're going to go ahead
and create the database new movie
otherwise it would throw an error
message so we'll say create database and
now you can say use new movie
and I don't know why I'm calling it
movie that's really stupid because it's
a music website I get that confused
because I do run the movies website all
the time so let's go ahead and use
another command there's a sequel command
to drop the database movie that we just
created
he's a semicolon so now we removed it
and it's gonna be called a new music so
we'll say create database let's go and
put that there
now with our new Django setup here let's
go ahead and open up a command prompt
and navigate to where we installed our
application and I put it under projects
alright so there's my manage that py and
that's going to be something that you
use a lot in Django and you can see here
that the name of our first app is is my
project and then we have a templates
directory and then the new music which
is the application name so let's go
ahead and we're gonna run sync DB for
the first time and what that does is it
creates a super user inside your Django
setup so that way your super user can
control all the other users and
everything on your system so we do that
by saying Python managed that py s YN c
DB
all right so what it's gonna go through
its gonna go through and do a lot of
built-in Django work for creating these
authorization groups and things and
that's really a lot of work that is done
out of the box for you and Django so
that way your users can log in to your
site you can set specifically what
permissions those users can do what they
can see what they can erase or add and
things like that so when you do this for
the first time that when it creates all
these tables you it asks you to build a
super user so you want to type yes to do
that I'm gonna go ahead and just say
admin is the name you can put in an
email address if you want here's my
email address which is noob niche at
gmail.com you guys feel free to email me
if you have any questions and let's go
ahead and create our password so I want
to actually do test one two three test
one two three and now it created our
super user so when we go ahead and we
run Django I'm gonna go ahead and start
this server down here
and so it's successfully running now we
want to go forward slash admin and if
everything works correctly you should
see this Django admin and we can go
ahead and log in admin and then test one
two three and now you can see that we
actually have access to this back-end
administration system that just works
out of the box with Django and it's been
this way for you know since it's been
around and it's one of the biggest
selling points with Django that you
don't have to actually write this
yourself so it's really nice so if you
want to add another user like your
friend or whatever you can set up their
username the password for them and then
you can once you have that person you
can then assign what permissions they're
allowed to do by you can see over here
like if you have different modules and
things installed you can say that they
can add or change or delete the
different different items that you have
so we'll get more into that later but
now we have the Django application up
and running let's go ahead and take a
look at this first module that got
created for me out of the by setting up
through pycharm I wasn't expecting that
because like I said is the first half of
ever created with PyCharm and I didn't
think it was going to do that so it
created this my project app which
included like the admin and all that
stuff I actually don't want this crap at
all so I'm going to delete the entire
thing alright so let's go ahead and in
our new music directory here this is
actually kind of small unfortunately I
don't know how to zoom in on this which
really sucks yeah let me see if I can
zoom in on that anyway that's some bull
crap I can't change the font size over
here it's gonna be small as hell so
hopefully you guys can read that I can
change this font size no problem but
they should definitely do something
about that I don't if you have any idea
on how to do that please email me or
leave a comment I appreciate it anyway
so let's go over to our URLs here and we
want to actually uncomment this first
line which is going
the default index page right now it
shows the helpful Django you know
jangled welcome message and I want to go
ahead and just say instead of home I
want to say index I just kind of in fact
you know I'll keep it home if they want
me to say home I'll keep it at home and
under the new music were to create a new
Python file and we're gonna call it
views dot py I don't know what that
shit's all about and some of the stuff
it does it is kind of weird I said well
first things first we're going to import
a few things that we're gonna need we're
gonna say from Django dot shortcuts
import render to response and from
Django dot template and poor request
context
right now let's go ahead and defined our
index method so the way Jenga works is
that your URLs are a it's a virtual URL
so when the URL is requested Django says
okay what you were was requested which
of you is supposed to handle it and then
in which view method specifically so the
view method and the URLs here the view
so it's new music and then the views dot
py file and then the name of the method
within the views dot py file so we're
gonna go ahead and define that method
down by saying to find home and every
method in Django always takes a request
and which is who is actually requesting
the information and and the request will
actually store information like the IP
address of the person that requested
this page and things like that so that
is always inside the request object and
we're simply going to say return render
to response and then inside the open and
closed parenthesis we need to go ahead
and give the location to where the
templates are going to be stored so
we'll just say home dot HTML and then we
want to say request context
and then inside open and close
parentheses we're gonna say requests
alright so let's go ahead and run our
application
okay we got an error message because we
deleted my project so what we need to do
is anytime you have an app and my
project was technically an app not the
project the project itself is new music
and the app was my project that we got
rid of so you see that it's not being
found inside our installed apps because
it won't no longer exist so we need to
remove that and we should be able to run
this now
all right so now we're getting a view
does not exist so let me see the best
way to handle this
I really don't even need this name here
and get rid of the comment as well I
don't want that I want to keep this as
clean as possible
all right the reason why it doesn't
exist is I actually have homes you want
to have this under in lowercase
all right now it's saying request is not
the fine which is a new error did I
capitalize that that's capitalized it's
stupid okay sorry about that so as you
can see things are case-sensitive now
it's saying the template does not exist
so let's go ahead and take a look of
what we need to do and this can actually
trip up a lot of new Janko users and our
settings we have a template location
when my project was created actually
created a template directory for me but
the templates obviously not being found
and it doesn't exist anyway so in our
view you see that we're referencing a
home dot HTML we need to add home dot
HTML to our template so it's just out of
a straight HTML file and we'll call it
home I'll just call this our home
alright so the template is now there in
the home directory but it's still saying
it doesn't exist because it doesn't know
where to look for it and it actually
says it'll tell you here where it looked
it's a template loader post mortem and
it says it tried to find the templates
and all of this crap but none of it
existed so it's actually looking in the
Python installation itself for the
template so we need to tell it to look
somewhere else for the template so in
order to fix that problem we need to go
to our application and you want to make
sure at the top of your settings file
that import OS should be already done
which is operating system it's a
standard Python module it's been around
for a long time and we want to identify
to our Django project where the
templates directory exists because right
now it doesn't know so let's go ahead
and say project path and we want this
all uppercase to keep with their
convention of everything else here and
we're gonna say project path equals OS
path dot real path and then we'll say OS
path the directory name and then two
underscores file and followed by another
two underscores now let's go ahead and
define our template directory so let's
say template ders equals and this is a
Python tuple and we're gonna say project
path which we just identified plus
forward slash under all lowercase
templates and another forward slash and
make sure you have the comma there it
will mess up if you don't have that
comma so make sure that comma is there
and now that we've done that what we're
saying here is that get the project path
which is actually the new the new music
directory and then look for the
templates folder inside of there and if
you look at the actual folder structure
that we have of our application you'll
see templates is not in new music so my
editor automatically set it up this way
and in order for this to work we need to
actually take our template directory
and drag it into their new music
directory so templates and our static
folders and stuff will be inside of that
that new music directory once you do
that you should be able to request the
page again if the server is still
running and now you'll see our home is
being found alright guys so we're making
good progress on this tutorial series
with Django and the next one we're going
to go ahead and bring in bootstrap and
all that crap
to make developing our UI a lot easier
alright guys thanks for watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
