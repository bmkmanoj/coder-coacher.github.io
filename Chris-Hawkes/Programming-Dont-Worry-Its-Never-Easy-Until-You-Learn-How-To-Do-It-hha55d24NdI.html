and it was funny because this guy Larry
E and he kind of reminded me of a few
people that I've worked with in the past
but he says he's refering to a video
where I talked about how my progress of
learning CSS like when I was just
starting out as as a non program are not
ever going to any sort of IT classes or
anything so you know a lot of the
vocabulary that comes with being an IT
for a long time wasn't with me at all
and it isn't going to be in anybody you
know it's not gonna be in anybody's head
who comes from a similar background and
they just started getting into the IT
world whether it's CSS HTML or or
something a little bit more advanced it
was like an object-oriented language
like C sharp or something like that but
he was saying yeah you hit the nail
right on the head learning HTML and CSS
is not easy just as you said I'm brand
new to programming and I'm putting in
four hours a day learning
you were right repetition is the mother
of all skills thanks for the background
story so anyway he's talking about the
video that I have of how I taught myself
to be a program so he's talking about
this video here and um to be honest with
you like my video cam is not that bad
it's funny because I never thought that
this video would get like 38,000 hits
and it's like such a grainy like crappy
looking well see the thing is it's top
of the line video camera I'm getting off
on a tangent here but anyway he's
referring to this video you guys should
check it out it kind of explains a
little bit of my backstory but I go into
explaining how for me it wasn't easy to
do CSS so I'm reading out of a book and
I didn't understand you know overflow
you know display:none overflow:hidden
margins the box you know the whole you
know the box model that they refer to
and CSS you know relative positioning z'
and absolute positioning z' and all this
crap none of that stuff is very easy and
I've actually worked with a lot of
senior programmers that have been in
this gate for a long time and when I
came in as a guy that taught myself off
the streets I was very good at CSS
things that you know people weren't very
good at and honestly like CSS 3.0 was
just around I can take any image now and
turn it into a web page no problem but
back then
all everything is a dip it's difficult
and it's a process like you go to
position a box and you want it to be on
the top left but for some reason it's
hanging down on the bottom you want the
footer to be on the bottom you don't
know why it's hanging up on the top
you're trying to float a box to the left
and float a box to the right and like
you got you got different divs that
aren't clearing each other and stuff
like that and back in those days we
didn't have bootstrap that made things
so much easier where you just learn the
you know the bootstrap way still people
struggle when they deviate away from the
whole bootstrap thing but my whole point
is that when I was saying that it wasn't
easy it's never easy when you're just
starting to learn something like you
know I would say that probably even
Albert Einstein probably said physics
wasn't easy before he learned how to use
it you know learn it not use it
obviously but learned you know the basic
your mathematic mathematics and
principles of thermodynamics and all
this other stuff that you probably
learned that's way over top of my head
but the bottom line is that until you
learn something you can't really say
something is easy and you shouldn't say
that something is easy even if you
learnt you learned it when somebody
hasn't had the chance to learn it
themselves
so it's always been a pet peeve of mine
and I think it actually kind of
belittles people a little bit when you
say hey that's you know it's easy as
part it's easy as this you know look I
can make I can query a database in
Django and turn it into XML and just
like that blah blah blah well you still
have to know you know where to find this
documentation if you don't know how to
do it just even finding a documentation
and finding good advice from bad advice
is almost like a lifelong career process
that's just something that takes time in
the IT world and I've actually gained
that just recently after doing this for
like five years I can like sometimes go
along with a blog and I look at this
blog and I'm like well Dan that seems
way too complicated that just doesn't
seem right so I questioned you know
these you know some of these you know
these sources that are out there online
and not just in programming anymore but
the thing with being a programmer is is
you do end up spending a lot of your
time trying to research and find
solutions to your problem and it's
usually never black and white it's
usually not like okay I need to figure
out how to use a variable or I need to
figure out what a list does or how to
add to
list or takeaway it's never that easy
it's always something way more than that
and when you're talking about CSS like I
don't even help people with CSS problems
on Stack Overflow even though I could
probably solve most of them I don't get
involved in that crap because CSS it's
like Izzy it's even more not black and
white when it's CSS because they could
have so much crap on their their page
that could be interfering with you know
this particular style that just isn't
you know isn't working right for them so
yeah I'm sure a lot of people go out
there the blasio cinema programming
language it's it's you know it's easy
and whatever but no nothing is easy
until you get practice and you've done
it a bunch of times and then you can say
something's easy but you should only say
that it's easy to yourself or maybe
somebody else that's experienced there
as well but I don't know anyway that's
just a pet peeve of mine I worked with
somebody before where they're like well
this is ooze you know but you know and
they had been doing it for like five
years and I had just started doing it
and it's like why are you even telling a
newbie that are you trying to be an
asshole like what are you doing so
anyway if somebody says something is
easy and you're struggling with it screw
them you'll get it eventually but you
definitely don't want to listen to the
naysayers because it's not really going
to help you out in it very much so and
it's not to say that everything is easy
by the way because it sometimes you will
look backing up like oh well that was
easier I missed something that was quite
obvious but you know that comes also
with experience and it's going to happen
to you throughout your career at least
it's happened to me non-stop there's
certain days where I can't figure out
something and it's because I forgot how
to do something that like I you know I I
thought I knew how to do or I'm just
simply missing something and I get
frustrated and I'm just not seeing you
know what's clear as day in front of me
and that actually happens to a lot of
programmers in fact probably everyone
that I've ever met where they'll come
over they'll ask you for some advice to
look at something because even though
they've done a you know a million times
and their code seems right and they've
checked it over a bunch of times they're
just missing some obvious things so yeah
I guess that's different than you know
whether or not something is easy but the
bottom line is that nothing is easy
until you learn it
and then once you learn it it doesn't
mean that it's easy for somebody else
anyway guys so this is kind of a I guess
strange video off the wall but it's just
something that his comment made me made
me think of that I'm like yeah I worked
with that guy and that guy was like
always trying to tell me how easy
something was and I've actually watched
tutorials where it's like oh this is so
easy and I just don't do that on my
tutorials either right I try to avoid
that I'm sure I'm guilty of it every
once in a while but I've always couldn't
stand that you know it's so easy just
you know just do this anyway guys thanks
for watching and please subscribe it's
as easy as that just hit that subscribe
