j/s tutorial and quill is a project it's
basically Microsoft Word that runs
inside of the browser
another / another pio well people
commonly refer to something like this as
like a WYSIWYG which stands for what you
see is what you get so if you take the
first letter of all those words you end
up getting WYSIWYG and that's actually a
common thing that we've always looked
for these WYSIWYG to help us do blogging
and things like that now I just recently
started messing with quill as far as
being able to use it as a blogging tool
this is more built towards using really
just having a microsoft word inside of
the browser so what would you use
something like that for well if you had
a company that was using some sort of
product and you allowed them to write
and draft you know documents that could
be written and shared inside of the
editor just as you do with words so what
do you do when you you get a Microsoft
Word document click on it and you open
it up in Word and you have all these you
know these tools at the top of it like
the the bold italics underline you have
all of these tools even though you may
just be reading some word document
letter that somebody sent to you so
quill is the same thing it's not made to
make HTML for you but what it does in
order for it to work it actually writes
HTML so I find that kind of interesting
because when I first looked into this I
wanted to use it as like a blogging tool
where I could just create all my HTML in
here but it's not really exactly why
this thing was built and and you can see
that there are ways of doing that it's
just it's not quite what it was for so
we're going to get into just some the
basics of how do you get going with
quill because there there's a decent
amount involved but this is all just
going to be done in one video so it's
just how do I get this set up in a
website so first things first we need to
have an editor I'm going to be using
Visual Studio code and what I'm going to
do is open up a new new window here now
Visual Studio code I definitely
recommend it to everybody it's not just
me it's actually a lot of people right
now it just makes writing code
a lot easier for at least me I mean I
can write a lot of it's my tool of
choice basically from Microsoft and on
and web not just Microsoft actually but
Python and web development but you can
download it for free it's actually
cross-platform too so anyway when we do
this we want to go ahead and open up a
folder that we're going to do this
tutorial in and I think I have a
tutorial folder down here so I'm going
to create a new folder which I will call
will and we're going to select this
folder I'll just say select so now this
is really all we need it will open up
the folder here in just a second on the
left hand side we click on the documents
and we're going to add our first
document which is just our index.html
so let me zoom in so you guys can see a
little bit better but what we need is
just a standard HTML page so the best
thing to do with something like that
instead of having to write all the tags
is just saying w3c they probably have an
example and let's see I'm just seeing if
they have like a full form that we can
just copy there there that's that's what
we're looking for right here let's go
ahead and copy that and we'll paste that
into here so alright so now that you
have that what we want to do is we want
to add some script tags to the front to
the head portion so underneath the title
and before the closing head tag just
pause the video real quick and type this
in word for word because what this is
doing these are public publicly
available scripts that we need for quill
in order to work and then we're also
going to include two style sheets that
is going to allow quill to be styled the
way we want so once again just make sure
you pause the video and copy those in
next thing we need to do is we need to
create a two div tag so let's get rid of
the content inside the body here and
we're going to paste this instead it's
just to gives one ID for the toolbar and
one for the actual
editor and then down at the bottom of
our page we're going to say
and this needs to be wrapped inside of
the script tags to do an opening script
tag and a closing script tag all right
so what this is doing is it's telling
Kuo hey I want you to use this div ID
for the editor and then it's saying
here's your toolbars and we need to
actually have a toolbars option object
so I'm going to add that here so you can
see we're assigning toolbar options to
toolbar which is a property on a
JavaScript object but that toolbar
option does not exist let's go ahead and
create that and it's just going to be an
empty array for right now alright so
let's go to our page where we have this
running so now when we press play we do
have some styling going on let's take a
little care
alright that'll work
so now we clearly need to give some some
options here so what I want to do is the
first thing we're going to give on our
toolbar is the bold italic you know the
typical stuff that we normally look at
on a word Docs let's go ahead and put it
enter here and this will be our first
little argument that we're adding so now
we have our bold and underline and
italics all right so now if we wanted to
add the block quotes to allow like
people to put raw code inside of our
editor then we can go ahead and put a
comma after this argument and we'll add
block quote which code block so let me
show you what that's going to do
all right so now that allows us to
actually write and raw HTML so one of
the interesting things to note let me
get out of the code block here is that
like if I were to say this is a sentence
and you look at what's being outputted
here if we right click and say inspect
you can see that the elements actually
in P so it's giving us HTML and believe
it or not actually use this for a
blogging tool for hipster code because
even though it's not built for that I
still ended up turning the tool into
something that makes it easier for me to
blog with hipster code all right so that
is the the block whoa now let's go ahead
and add the header tags sorry about that
my phone rang so it's going add header
options
and now this gives us H 1 H 2 so if you
wanted more h 1s or h 3s and you wanted
it to go further than you would do that
you would just add another H header
argument so the next one is if you want
to make lists like bullet point lists
for you know either either bullet point
or numbered lists then you would add
this javascript object for list ordered
let's take a look at that now we can
make a list
all right the next one is going to be to
be able to add scripts
okay
so I do whatever you want with that
our next tool bar option would be for
indenting
so I could select that
and then to
now you can end it multiple times
basically it's using tabs
our next argument is the direction
completely puts it on the other side of
the page I don't even know what the hell
I did let me make this a little bigger
all right so the next argument we can
add to our little document is both sides
for size for large and small and now
instead of like actual font size you can
use this to adjust it in case you didn't
want to use like a header which is over
here
now another thing that's interesting is
you can actually have a header with
multiple levels so one of the easier
ways of going the header instead of h1
h2 like this you could actually just
replace it with something like this it
says header and then you pass in an
array of 1 2 3 4 5 6 and that goes all
the way through the headers so now
instead of over here we have normal and
you have heading 1 2 3 so this is more
standard with probably what you would
see in word so that's an alternative now
if you needed to add a link to another
HTML page or something like that then we
can go ahead and use this next tool
which is link so we can add images
videos and such so let's go ahead and
take a look so now if I were to say
hipster code and I highlight that whole
thing click on link or maybe not
must be giving an error message here
all right so the link is not working
that's not cool
that sucks but here's the image now this
is cool because if I were to select an
image I can like select this image and
what it will end up doing is instead of
having to save physical locations for
your image it will actually encode it to
this data parameter which is this
humongous thing but if you ever wanted
to just store that inside of a database
instead of the actual image that's an
option is basically like a blob of data
and this does that for you I don't know
why the links not working that's very
interesting it's not even throwing an
error message either so let me go ahead
and let's go ahead and add our colors so
this this part is pretty cool too
all right so now we have colors
something like this and change it to red
like how awesome is that make this big
so once again that's pretty sweet we
also have the font option because that's
pretty common so we can try to change
font styles you can even have custom
fonts put into this but for right here
it just has some few basic fonts sans
serif and syrup but you can add other
custom fonts if you want it to
all right and then the final argument
that we can pass to our toolbars options
is the align
and this just allows us to Center things
and such
all right so now another thing that you
may want to do is it's actually
something that I did just to say you
know what the the standard for being
able to take quill and be able to
transport it around is to actually turn
it into something called a delta and a
delta is made so that it's a JavaScript
object and you can turn this quill
document into a delta store the delta
object and then you retrieve the delta
object and then you redisplay it inside
of this page but the problem with
something like that in my opinion is
that you know you're you would then have
to have another page that doesn't have
the toolbar which is really probably the
identical or the ideal way I would say
to do something like this but let me let
me go into that for just a moment
so it's create test document so this
test document is testing header I'm just
gonna I just want to make sure that I
have some formatting and everything in
here so let's go ahead and have and
won't even change the color to a nice
red alright so now we have this going on
you know what before I even did that
damn it I should have got added the code
here so what I want to do is we're going
to add a button underneath out of our
toolbar so say button ID equals button
or we'll say save Delta say
all right so now down here in my script
before the closing script I'm going to
do a jQuery click event to listen so
I'll say save Delta dot click function
so I'm listening to the click event and
then what I'm going to do is say
variable del T equals pulled on get
contents so it's going to get the
contents of the page but then I want to
say console dot log Delta that way we
can see it all right so I just simply
added this in the button and it probably
should have saved all this but what I
can do is just copy refresh the page so
it has the newest code paste of this and
I say save Delta but I need to open up a
console real quick and I want to look at
the console logging so we're going to
say save Delta here it is as has all
this stuff it's an array of values test
document return line all kinds of stuff
so now what happens if I wanted to
display this information so the question
is going to be then how do we then take
the content that we saw saved and logged
out as Delta and then load it back in
what I want to do is I change this code
here so instead of saying bar Delta I
want to say window Delta that way we're
storing into the window object so we can
access it and and typically this
variable that you have here is what you
would end up saving to a database as
like JSON format now this this will get
rid of the console dot log but now we
know that there's going to be this
window Delta variable it's going to be
the contents of the quill so let's go
ahead and take a look here if we go in
let's go back to the page
all right so I'm going to say this is
some style better testing I want to get
their color and everything in here
are there we going to sit down a minute
I'm going to save the Delta so it saves
it to the window object now if I
actually wanted to say I grab that value
from a database and I load this page if
you just wanted to display it the way
that you saw it and then obviously you
don't want this entire you know toolbar
and everything showing up because you
know you're not you just want to display
the content so you would end up having
just simply the quill editor and it
would just be an empty box essentially
and then you would take that quill
editor and you would then paste in your
formatted code so how would I do that
I'd go in the console basically you
would on the loading of the page you
would say Delp sorry quill dot set
contents and then you pass in the delta
dot or window dot delta that was the
name of our variable so you can see it
actually did it looks like nothing
happened but let's go ahead and get rid
of this and then press up to execute
this code one more time
and boom you see that it gets loaded so
once again what did we do we stored this
value which is created for us by quill
and it's stored as a JavaScript object
so what you would end up doing is most
likely storing this these contents
inside of a database somewhere
assuming you trust what the user sending
you but say you were using it for a
blogging tool like what I'm using it for
so you would have that saved and then on
top of that you would um you would then
on the loading of a page the page that
you actually want a customer or user to
see you would display an empty box the
quill box and then you not display the
toolbar so essentially you would just
not show the toolbar at all and that
would be no problem then in fact I can
even edit my HTML so it doesn't do that
I can go to the toolbar and just delete
the entire thing and we'd also get rid
of our button so basically to have this
and you can even get rid of the
bordering border styling
so get rid of the border so you'd have
something like this and then now let's
delete all that and then say console and
there you have the formatting so that's
basically how you would do it now the
weird thing is that you would have you
know this the ability to be able to like
delete the contents of the article that
they're reading which obviously doesn't
delete it for other people that load the
page and load that from your database
but you know it's fairly interesting
because in typical web pages you would
never see the ability or you don't have
the ability to just delete like you're
in some sort of editor now I was looking
online if we wanted to actually delete
that I think we could say we might and
I'm going to try this quilt dot enable
false and sending a false flag either
and then it deletes so you could load it
all and then run that command and then
they don't have the ability to like
delete your content which is good
alright guys so hopefully I answered all
