this video we want to actually look at
for loops and for loops are an important
concept in Python you can actually loop
over stuff like lists which we saw in
one of the previous videos and in
addition to lists you can actually loop
through a string so a string is just a
set of characters so if we said my
string equals this is a string so it's a
set of individual characters this is a
character this is a character so those
are all characters in here so if I were
to actually say how many characters are
in my string I can actually say 4 and
then I'll just say character C har which
is short for character in my string and
I do a colon and then once again you
have to do the indentation because we're
doing Python and then here I can say
print character so it's going to loop
through every character in the string
and it's going to print it and we're
going to go ahead and run this and when
we look at the debug console in our
window below it's taking a while
actually I don't know why there it goes
you can see that it actually went
through the entire string and it printed
off a character one line at a time each
individual character including though
the actual spaces the white spaces here
so those are also characters within a
string so you can break a so a string is
very similar to a list and that you can
actually reference characters of a
string by using the index and the index
once again you pass in a number to this
square bracket you can say print me off
the fourth character and remember it
starts counting at zero so it's actually
going to be the fifth character so this
is let's see T is one two three four
five so it's actually going to be a
space if we do fours we're going to do
five so it'll print off the a character
which is actually the sixth character in
this string so let's do that
you can see a prints off a now the
reason why this is significant is
because sometimes you're like okay I
need to see if this string has the
character I in it you know what I mean
it so this has the character I twice
let's go within because there's only one
and could also go with G because there's
only one in but I could say for
character and this actually doesn't have
to be character this could be X it could
be Y it could be whatever whatever you
want because this is a temporary
variable variable that's being populated
just while we're going through the loop
so I'll say and my string and I'm going
to actually put a breakpoint here so you
guys can see that whatever you want gets
changed as we loop through the string
and we're going to say if and we looked
at if statements we're going to say if
there's no brackets there that's me
using other languages I'm going to say
if whatever you want equals and once
again we're not doing a single equal
we've got to do two equals because we're
comparing it and we're going to say G so
we'll just go with G we're going to be
like print holy crap it's a G right so
now let's go ahead and run this and you
can see that we're in this this loop so
the first character whatever you want is
assign the value T we know that T does
not equal G so it's going to continue to
go through its loop so if I press the
play and I come back here now we're at H
and you can see that's not going to
match and I'm going to keep doing this
for a while because G is at the end so
right eye now looks like right in now
and now the next one it's going to be a
G so whatever you want equals G so now
we're going to go to the print statement
print holy crap it's a G and we're going
to see this at the console at the bottom
holy crap it's a G and that's why you
would want to do a for loop with a
string because you might be looking for
individual characters now sometimes you
could even build your own HTML scraping
that that
looks for greater than and less than
signs to figure out when you're inside
of an actual HTML element and when
you're inside the the text that is
between an HTML element so that is why
you would want that granular which means
very drilled down control over your you
know your string so in addition to this
though you could also do the same thing
with a list so like we saw my list
equals in fact we'll go with a better
enable safe fruits equals banana apple
pear and now I can loop through every
element and the fruit and I could say
for F because remember this can be
whatever you want it's just a temporary
variable in fruits friends F so this is
going to loop through every one of them
and say it'll print every single Lua
fruit down here to the thing so I can
even do a string concatenation to it
where I could say I like to eat plus and
make sure you have your space here that
way the fruit won't be pasted right
after the T and will say I like to eat
banana I like to keep it Apple I like to
eat pear so you know that this is why
you would want to loop through and once
again I said if you build like a
scraping program where you had a bunch
of different websites you needed to
scrape this list could be a bunch of
websites and as you go through each item
you're going to then fire off some you
know a huge section of code that
actually is going to then do whatever it
is you need to do but lists and for
looping over lists and strings are very
important alright now here's another
concept that I want to explain to you
guys if we were to say for F in fruits
if I keep doing the parentheses or if F
equals banana print I like bananas
all right so if F equals banana this
statement is going to display so I'm
going to put a breakpoint here at the if
and we're going to press play now we're
at F we know F equals banana so it's
going to go ahead and print now what if
you're like you know now F is equal to
the next item in the list and it's Apple
but what have you reached banana and you
said I don't want to evaluate the rest
of the items in the list because if you
have like a million items in the list
and you already found what you're
looking for you just want the program to
return without continuing to run and
that's actually where we're going to use
something called the break statement and
we just have to say break right here
underneath our statement and if if
banana equals or if F equals banana it's
going to break out so it's not going to
evaluate the rest of these items and
that's like I said helpful if you have a
lot of items you don't need to actually
go through all of them so F equals
banana and this equates and we're going
to print the statement never going to
break and you can see that none of the
items get evaluated anymore so that's
why we need to break statement within
within Python alright guys so that is it
for this video this is how we do for
loops and Python and also break out of
the for loops if we feel like we need to
at any particular point and we've seen
that we can loop over lists and also
string characters so let me know what
you guys think please subscribe please
share this video and I appreciate all
the support you guys have a good day
take care bye hey guys so a lot of you
asked me how do I get my foot in the
door to become a programmer and I just
want to take a moment to mention dev
Mountain coding boot camp is a 12-week
intensive course that focuses on the
technologies of the here-and-now for web
development some of the things that
they're actually teaching in the Suevi
course it's geared to get you into the
industry by focusing on things like
jQuery nodejs
react angular how to use github so a lot
of the things that you're going to need
to do as a developer as soon as you
start they're going to be teaching you
in this and this coding bootcamp and the
entire goal is to be able to get you
into the industry within 12 weeks so if
you guys are interested in learning more
information about dev mountain coding
boot camp just check out the link in the
description tab of this video thank you
for watching and have a good day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
