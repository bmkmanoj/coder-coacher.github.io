have a good question from p.m. oh and
3's and I don't know how you pronounce
that but he said what programming
language did you learn first so I wanted
to make like a dedicated video about
this because this kind of goes
hand-in-hand with something else that
somebody the Tran Quang Ming had said
down below he said diving into docks as
a beginner has a real pain in the ass
and it will raise the mood to give up
because so many terms that even
experienced programmers need to Google
for that and go through about thousands
of pages to search for what they you
know you know what he's talking about
he's basically saying it's a pain in the
ass to have to search and find stuff so
where did I start man I've done similar
videos on this I know but it like just
in an in a nutshell you guys can watch
some of the other videos I should
probably start pointing to links in
these videos but I started with HTML and
I was writing up some basic templates in
like Photoshop and illustrator they'll
be illustrator and I started
understanding what HTML CSS was I moved
over to CSS and eventually I was moving
over to like I basically dabbled with
JavaScript but move right into jQuery
because it was so much easier so then
from there though I ended up having to
do some data scraping and stuff like
that so I decided to get into Perl now
Perl back in in those days which was you
know almost eight years ago now maybe
more it was still talked about quite a
lot now Perl is still around the problem
with our Perl is that it took over 15
years for them to release Perl 6 and
Perl 6 has a terrible logo so you can
see the goal Anglo logo here for Google
boo the Perl 6 logo is one of the worst
logos I've ever seen in the history of
programming in fact it probably goes
down as the worst logo it's even worse
than the Java dude so maybe it's you
know it's supposed to be like I'm not
sure man I'm not sure what they were
going with Larry Wall is kind of a kooky
guy he's always been a very kooky guy
and that's not a term that I use lightly
or or say ever really but very weird
dude like you where you know these types
of shirts and everything but he's more
of a linguist and he created
pearl is very smart programmer he's been
an I mean pearl ruled the web for the
longest time it really did and Amazon's
the big portion of Amazon was based off
of Perl code and it was really it's
really even to this day like it does
regular regular expressions better than
any other language I mean it pretty much
invented how you crunch text and
everything through regular expressions I
can I've seen some very very fantastic
text scraping Perl applications out
there some of the best so Perl still has
its place and even if you look at the
TLB index it's always hanging around
there in the top 10 or top 11 and that
says a lot because it doesn't have a
strong newbie community it's a lot of
you know older hacker types now nowadays
that are still holding on to Perl
nobody's really programming anything new
in Perl a lot of people are like you
know Sipan is like you know Sipan of the
web well dude Sipan with you know
purling you could download anything on
it on Sipan like that does all kinds of
stuff a lot of times it didn't work but
just like NPM like NPM is the new CPN or
Sipan that you know we have with nodejs
so you can get any sort of module out
there on NPM so another thing with like
python is pi or put a pip or yeah pip
pip pip installer package manager and
then you also have new get for c-sharp
so what am i saying behind all this I'm
saying that this person asked me
directly what language I was starting
with when I first needed to start
getting data on rock music as I was
building a rock music website based on
my favorite band which I'll go ahead and
give them a shout out even though I
don't get paid to mention these guys but
I love besan I'm gonna be seeing Bayside
in Richmond Virginia here pretty soon
so if you guys are in that area you'll
see me at that show and it's gonna be at
the National and enrichment so Richmond
is where I work I don't live in Richmond
but I do I do work in Richmond I'll
probably be relocating there eventually
but Richmond is the capital city of
Virginia I actually worked right here on
the water so the building next to this
tall building it's not he doesn't even
exist in this picture
because this picture was taken before
the building that I worked in was even
build so Richmond is actually growing
quite a bit that's like a 26-story
building it's a Federal Reserve building
so I mean decent-sized buildings there
and stuff like that but yeah I'll be
seeing bass I'm a favorite man but when
I was getting started I was trying to
collect data for rock music so I needed
something to be able to do that well
you're not going to do that with HTML
and CSS obviously I need something to
start scraping so I chose Perl and and
Perl at that time like I said like the
books and everything would tell you that
Amazon was heavily using it and pro/5 is
still a solid feature Perl 6 has still
been like the downfall of Perl I'm not
really sure what they're trying to do
with Perl 6 but it's just a common it's
a complicated clusterfuck of like
different releases and things and I
don't know man I hope it I wish it the
best but I just don't see it doing too
much and then your future so alright
that that's where I started man now
eventually I was able to get my foot in
the door as more of a UI type of person
and then I ended up transitioning and
becoming a c-sharp programmer so I was a
senior c-sharp programmer when I left my
previous job at Geico which is a large
insurance company in the United States
fortune 500 owned by Berkshire Hathaway
one of the largest companies in the
entire world
so it's a wholly owned subsidiary of
them but c-sharp was their net shop so
it was a lot of c-sharp their c-sharp
isn't is an excellent language it's hard
as when you're getting started
especially coming from something like
Python so if we go to let's just say
like web forms we'll just say web forms
actually so asp.net web forms and then
here you go you look at this and let's
like you're just like where do where do
I even get started so maybe I go to
learning and here you can see so there's
just a lot of clutter here as well like
asp.net webforms now web forms is like
the bane of a lot of people's existence
it's a real shitty tool real real shitty
tool actually but you look at some of
this stuff
just like woe to a non-programmer like
what is this like why is there so much
text on one single page what is this all
about
so absolutely man web forms can be a
very complicated thing like let's look
at the grid view which is a controller
for web forms so web forms is all about
asp.net it's basically taking the old
GUI forms type controls and things that
people use to build distributable
software on Windows platforms and then
they tried to make it you know work the
same way on the web so you look at like
this you know here's the inheritance
hierarchy oh that you know it's a fully
object-oriented language so you have
system dot object which is like you know
that obviously that the parent object
and all these you know classes derived
from until you get to this grid view and
then you have names like composite data
bound control data bound control base
data bound control and you look at any
one of these beasts man and you have
constructors and it'll tell you you
click on this or here's all the
properties of that control and then look
at all this documentation just for that
one class so absolutely man this like I
used to say and then here's their
example if I go here let's do a little
snippet here's an example and you got to
write all this stuff for a simple
example on how this control works like I
said web form sucks nobody wants to use
that anymore dude but some people still
do it because you know there's a lot of
legacy code and people's entire careers
could be spent writing that garbage but
the funny thing is is that a lot of
people that I used to work with that are
still like heavily in this existence of
like web forms and all this way like
they've totally missed the entire boat
ride for es6 like so the es6 and you
know using babel to compile your es6
code this is a terrible looking site so
one person had mentioned that the md n
which is Mozilla developer Network for
es6 is difficult es6 also known
Atmos Corp 2015 so some of this stuff is
is difficult away it's laid out as well
but as far as being in-depth like you
know if you're dealing with a map and
you're like okay like what are all of
the different ways I can use a map so
it's various programming is not easy as
I guess is what I'm trying to say the
documentation is definitely going to be
difficult some are more difficult than
others
now if you're not ready for this you
know es6 stuff you want to start with
like w3c and then JavaScript so you
would start with something simple like
right here just go I mean w3schools is
not a bad site to just do some really
basic stuff we're just get a basic
JavaScript book and then I would still
suggest it well maybe not in jQuery I
would probably forego jQuery at this
point and start using es6 unless you're
going like a lot of Ajax and you don't
want to use something like blueburger or
I don't know man
I would definitely start with something
basic like this before we start trying
to mess with react or something like
that because even react is a complicated
thing but their documentation is pretty
fantastic like you're not going to find
more up-to-date documentation than what
is on their site and any sort of book or
even a plural site tutorial especially
in the JavaScript world things go out of
date so quick that you're better off
with the main documentation here but
before you even do that like so I'm
gonna be doing Python my first language
was Perl Jesus Python can kill humans in
medicine as well okay so if I was going
to start without with Python though I
would definitely go to there you could
go there official documentation there
official documentation is kind of ugly
compared to some of the other stuff let
me see if it looks any better these days
it looks a little better but it's still
like I don't know man like I would
rather look at a book probably for
getting started with with Python but
then if you're gonna move into django
Django has I think fairly good
documentation for getting started like
you can go into their documents and you
do a tutorial you're gonna build your
django app once you build the Shango app
you still might be left
singing how to like take it to the next
level and then there you can get some
inspiration from YouTube videos you can
check out mine if you wanted to on
Django and pretty I covered that fairly
well I think and there is that so
yeah I started with HTML moved to CSS
moved to JavaScript moved to Perl found
out Perl was too difficult mainly
because Perl there's so many different
ways to write even the most mundane
things that it was a hard language to
read and write a lot of people say it's
like a write only language because you
write and you forget how it works and
and you can do crazy stuff with with
with Perl like with you know it'll try
to just magically figure out like mix
match types like strings and intz and
things like that and if you don't use
strict mode and perl then you could find
yourself having some some headaches they
also use a lot of symbols which are
really weird like for their hash arrays
and regular arrays and just variable
names you know some unnecessary stuff I
think but the point is is that Python
was developed by a mathematician so
Python to me just it like clicked more
there was more of a community and more
of a community for beginners and you
know it's just very very simple like I
mean this is a function here within
Python then it's calling that function
and it's like their documentation
obviously is much easier than c-sharp
and everything so you know go with
something easy it can begin with because
nothing is is actually really nothing is
easy dude even Python like you look at
some of the more complicated Python code
like okay Django and github if you go in
here like you look at their their
commits here's the Django library
you're gonna look through any of this
stuff here and you're gonna be late on
migrations okay so this is how
migrations work it actually does all
this stuff is working together to make
migrations and you know Python can get
you know very very difficult as far as
like trying to figure out what's going
on so you're not going to be ready to
contribute to code like this probably
not for five years I mean to be honest
it might take that
if not longer and that's fine because
you can still make money and be a
developer it's just you're not going to
be one of the world's best Python
developers in a matter of like you know
a couple months or even a couple of
years it's just not possible there's
going to be Peters people have been
using Python for decades and like it's
just and there's some people that just
write code and it's just like they can
do it better than other people
but that's kind of just went off on a
tangent on this video they'll be
honestly it just kind of went all over
the place but I like it I like it I'm
just talking to you guys so here here's
the state of our programming and I think
I mentioned both Java and c-sharp as two
serious languages to learn for a
corporate development Python is up there
obviously Python has a lot of beginner
stuff a lot of startups using Python but
not a ton of jobs when it comes to like
corporate gigs because Python is
obviously an open source project where
c-sharp is owned by Microsoft and Java
is owned by Oracle and both have that
you know huge corporate level of support
same with visual basic.net PHP another
open source language a lot of small
shops and and WordPress blogs and things
like that that are running on PHP
laravel is pretty popular I know
somebody that or I know of somebody who
just graduated a boot camp and ended up
going and getting a laravel job so
depending on what type of position you
get like just because it's going to take
years to be a real programmer it doesn't
mean that you can't be like a junior
level developer like a lot of places
like especially with 100 hundred 20,000
our salaries they want people that have
been programming for anywhere from you
know five to ten years at least and your
people that can figure things out pretty
quickly and and sometimes we just can't
do that even at a senior level like
there are days that you know that you're
just going to run up against the wall
man it just happens and and you'll never
be that for that perfect programmer so
like don't get me wrong I'm just simply
saying it is a process like it's been a
seven almost eight year process for me
to get where I'm at other people will
probably get there quicker depending on
what's like how long a technology has
been around obviously levels the playing
field so just
because one person's been a program
doesn't necessarily make them a better
program than somebody that's been doing
it for a year or two like there are the
mileage varies obviously everybody's
different every industry is different
every language is different like you're
going to run into all kinds of different
situations but I think I'm fairly
confident saying that somebody can
become a programmer fairly quickly but
you're just not going to be you're not
going to be that good you know not
enough for a little while it takes some
time but anyway so let's go ahead and
give a shout out to my sponsors here
number one step Mountain they've been
sponsoring my content for a long time
they keep the lights on for me guys so
please support my sponsor these guys
literally meant you know they'd do more
for me then you know the YouTube ads and
stuff like that so you know what dev
Mountain I think has provided me is
pretty awesome and in return what
they're doing is is providing 12 and 16
week courses that people can sign up for
they offer housing assistance as well
because it is on-site you're going to be
learning with a real instructor and they
focus on stuff that is in demand right
now like even things that people are
like oh it's not cool like jQuery but
every companies out there still using it
but they're gonna focus on nodejs and
angular and how to actually set up a
github repository work with other other
developers so at the very least you know
the goal is that you're going to be able
to get your foot into a beginner level
position and that's where really where
all the learning comes from you ask
somebody that went to college you ask
somebody that didn't go to college
you're going to learn the most about
programming once you actually have a job
as a programmer that is a fact so if if
you're trying to get that first gig like
you usually need education or you need
some sort of project out there but Deb
mountain is helping people get their
foot into the door you know for those
people that don't have the educational
background or you know a large portfolio
maybe businesses that they've owned and
things like that so they have good
reputation check them out the other
sponsor is site one two three so if
you're trying to get your portfolio out
there you're trying to build a website
maybe for a friend
trying to get just anything out there to
say hey I'm a programmer this is some of
the work that I've done or I'm an artist
or I like gaming or whatever it may be
you could do WordPress and set up your
own blog but you could also go to save
one two three pay a small fee get your
site set up and literally start right
away so it's up to you guys but just
make sure if you're interested check out
the description tab below the links to
both of these companies are in that in
