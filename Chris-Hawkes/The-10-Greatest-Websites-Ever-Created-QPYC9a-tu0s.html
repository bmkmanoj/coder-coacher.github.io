deaf mountain coding boot camp I know
you guys know that I'm always pushing
their stuff but they've been my sponsor
my primary sponsor for about two years
now so please do me a favor look in the
description there's a link to deb
mountain coding boot camp if you are
interested in learning how to become a
developer you want to go to a coding
bootcamp you can't pick a better one
check out deb mountain they got good
reviews i appreciate it hey guys what up
good evening so i took a few days off
appreciate your patience in this video i
just want to kind of been wanting to
make this video and really it's it's
just a personal opinion type of thing
once again so like don't try to act like
it's definitive or some and like
it's like it's just really one person's
personal opinion but it's really the
most influential websites that I could
think of like and when I think of that I
think of websites that literally change
the way we do things so like I didn't
include apps like if I were going to
include apps I would have included uber
so uber is not in this list forewarning
any any other apps and things like that
so this is really strictly just websites
so I think number 10 on this list goes
to Craigslist Craigslist basically took
our personal classified ads that we had
in the newspapers and they brought it
online it's amazing because the site is
like timeless it looks the same like you
can go back to the 1990s by visiting
this website because this is what all
the websites look like during the advent
of the Internet Craigslist has been
there since the get-go and they've
really never updated their website in
fact I think Craigslist in one point was
I was using Perl it was written in Perl
but maybe not anymore but yeah
definitely a game changer when it comes
to even looking for apartments looking
for personal ads how looking for hookups
and stuff like that Craigslist is the
place to go and it's still the place to
go for for that
number nine on this list is eBay eBay is
gonna make number nine because it was
really the first website that brought
you actual auctioneers that were
licensed in all 50 states so a lot of
money involved in eBay to actually get
something like this off the ground a lot
of people probably don't realize that
but in order for eBay to even legally do
auctions you have to have auctioneers
and they have representatives for every
state that they do business in at least
in the United States I'm not sure about
overseas and things like that but eBay
brought you a marketplace for buyers and
sellers as opposed to just people buying
stuff so it gave you it was not beta it
was essentially very similar in
Craigslist being able to post your
commercial stuff or your classified
listings eBay gives you the ability to
sell your stuff and like they were one
of the first ones to really popularize
that idea and make it feasible to make
some money and actually have a place for
both buyers and sellers
number eight on my list goes to stock
exchange or stackoverflow we as
developers know stack overflow but stack
exchange is actually the company that
own stack overflow and they have a bunch
of different sites the reason why I list
them if you're a programmer then this is
probably number one on your list but if
you're not a programmer it still
revolutionized this entire
community-based like organization and
maintenance of user submitted data they
seem to do this better than anybody this
website is written in MVC net using
c-sharp it's all microsoft.net stack
stuff it does a phenomenal job though on
maintaining everything from like the
keywords to the community to how like
moderators or how they elected and even
so number seven on this list goes to the
Pirate Bay and I could have picked any
BitTorrent kind of thing like I could
have gone with Napster which was really
a game changer but the Pirate Bay I look
at longevity when I when I consider
what's going on this list and the Pirate
Bay has had that longevity I mean
everybody and their mother has tried to
take the Pirate Bay down for all the
rampant copyright and everything but if
you wanted a good--nice case a nice
fresh copy of the everything from
Photoshop to the latest games movies
things like that Pirate Bay has it all
it's all stolen
doesn't make it right in certain cases
some people can't buy the stuff so they
end up torrenting it as they can't as in
like not physically able to not as if
they don't have the money or whatever
because just because you on the money
for something probably doesn't mean you
can steal it I'll let you guys be the
judge of that or whatever legal systems
you guys have that represent your
countries but I could tell you that
generally that's frowned upon but
everybody in their mother has also used
the Pirate Bay at one time or another
so number six on the list is gonna go to
match.com
match is like the first one that
actually at least in my opinion revelers
I guess you could say eHarmony as well
but in like these two websites they're
responsible for a lot of marriages a lot
of relationships things like that online
dating wasn't a thing obviously before
the internet so match.com probably gets
the credit for actually revolutionising
that in creating the most popular dating
app which we now have so many different
and it wasn't an app was a website
because once again we're not including
apps but there are so many other dating
apps websites and all that other stuff
that kind of get a lot of their
inspiration from like machen eHarmony
so number five on this list is gonna go
to Amazon Amazon gets credit for being
the first major e-commerce platform
that's really become the largest
e-commerce company by far one of them at
least ecommerce and and now being being
one of the the largest retailers as well
even if you count like the likes of
Walmart and things like that so Amazon
they would certainly get the credit
there's obviously so many different
ecommerce platforms that came before and
after Amazon that are really good but
Amazon being the biggest you have to put
him there at number five probably above
all else and Jeff Bezos has been
flirting with the richest man or being
the richest man alive on and off for the
last couple years now because of Amazon
stock prices and the amount of shares of
he owns and Amazon it's it's made them
uber wealthy
number four on this list is gonna go to
github this is one that probably a lot
of people didn't expect but github has
been around for ten years now it was a
venture capital backed funded startup
now it's probably worth billions most
web not websites but most companies are
doing most of their development in
github and whether it's open source or
not some companies are even using github
for closed source stuff that we don't
have access to we know that most of the
major projects that are on github and
even certain things like dot Nets Roslyn
compiler for c-sharp that's now even
though it's Microsoft technology it's
now being developed by Microsoft
Associates on github so you cannot you
just can't ignore the impact that github
has had not just on developers we're
really just in the entire world because
so many people consume the websites and
products and everything that they're
being built on github so anyway that
that is definitely the reason why it's
number four
alright guys so number three on this
list is gonna go to Wikipedia Wikipedia
has been a humongous game-changer before
we had Wikipedia we had things like the
Encyclopedia Britannica yet people that
went door-to-door trying to sell you a
humongous encyclopedia volumes and
things that you could put in a library
somewhere it looks really cool until you
actually needed to find the information
it was great when you had it only the
elite and rich could afford that kind of
stuff and everybody else just made-up
 like those stories that you heard
about like though the Winnebago that the
guy went to the back and got a sandwich
while he was working or while he was
driving his Winnebago because he thought
the autopilot or the cruise control was
gonna drive itself anyway those are all
just weird myths and rumors and
that the internet kind of brings about
well I think Wikipedia does a really
good job at kind of dispelling some of
those things like we had a lot of those
rumors before the internet that we just
believed all the time like we just
believe without being able to fact-check
because it was very difficult to
fact-check Wikipedia is not entirely
accurate not all the time but the
studies have shown that it's about about
as accurate as even the Encyclopedia
Britannica volumes and things like that
so yeah there's not like a single
trusted authority behind this but the
community has done an excellent job
Wikipedia showed that you can use
community submitted data and absolutely
make it fantastic and reliable and
things like that so Wikipedia most
certainly is a major game changer to the
entire world and the reason why I
mentioned actually the community is I
picked this particular web web page on
Wikipedia is because I created this
Wikipedia article I uploaded the image I
did everything and I did it for this
band that you guys know of Bayside
Queens is a city that they're out of but
this guy's the founding member lead
singer of the band Bayside he didn't
have his own page even though he's his
own artist so I went ahead and created
his own page like a year and a half or
two years ago or something like that and
it's still there other people have
contributed to this so it's not like I
wrote all this I just wrote the initial
I did the initial investment the
community picked up on it
Wikipedia has kept it around and this
data that is accurate is out there for
everybody to consume you know thanks to
Wikipedia thanks to volunteer efforts
like myself and anybody that's
interested in this guy or the millions
or billions of other articles that they
have out there for all types of
different things under the
son you could look up something just
random like potato and learn all kinds
of stuff on Wikipedia
so number two is gonna go to none other
than YouTube I feel like YouTube is a
game changer not just because I've had
success on it but you have average joe's
like myself who basically told his story
about how he became a developer who now
has a hundred thousand followers on
YouTube and and who knows where it goes
from here but YouTube's the reason why I
was so special is because it proved it
provided the the the funds and
everything necessary to house
essentially millions of servers of
petabytes of data of all this video and
 and then providing the bandwidth to
be able to stream only a Google size
company could provide that sort of thing
but because that they were able to do
that we were able to take the product
that they that they created and we were
able to express our individual
individuality through it and the reason
why it was so much better than blogging
is obviously when you see somebody in
the real life and you're hearing their
their their voice and you're hearing
their expressions and like you know in
their enthusiasm and excitement
everything like it it hooks you like I'm
hooked to other people just like people
are hooked to me and like it just it's
just humans connecting with each other
in YouTube has has given us that medium
where it didn't exist before so now you
know in in the flesh and the you know
the human flesh were able to to reach
out and just entertain each other really
so number one on this list is none other
than Google you can't point to a website
that changed the world more than Google
did Google had an interesting concept
from a guy named Larry Page who was
going for his PhD at Stanford at the
time University of Michigan graduate or
Michigan State I apologize Michigan
State graduate going to stand for his
PhD and ended up finding this unique
concept where he basically was able to
say you know what the way websites link
together is how we determine whether or
not a website is good or not because
they basically looked at the backlinks
now Google you fast forward to today
there's literally thousands of different
things that they're looking at so it's
not the initial concept but essentially
one in like one tiny concept that was
developing and one person's brain ended
up being you know nearly a trillion
dollar idea so it's it's absolutely
unbelievable
he almost sold the web site by the way
for a hundred thousand dollars before
Google was even getting its first
injection of capital and things like
that he actually considered selling the
company for a hundred thousand and and
he said it was the best decision of his
life obviously not to do that I mean
changed the world by not doing that but
anyway guys that is my list let me know
what you think and make sure you guys
subscribe for more have a good day vote
up appreciate it
and here's 200,000 bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
