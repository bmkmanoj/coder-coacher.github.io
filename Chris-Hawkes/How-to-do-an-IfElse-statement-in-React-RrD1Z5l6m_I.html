last video we had discussed how to pass
data from a parent to a child and what
we did is we just created this variable
blurb and I made it so that it matched
up to comment a blurb which is part of
my JSON data that was being returned
that I explained before so when we look
at this you see blurb is right here so
it could have been called anything this
could have been called literally
anything and when I go to reference it
down here I would say this stop props
taught anything so that's how we
reference our data but anyway we're not
gonna do that right now that was in the
last video this video though I want to
talk about how we deal with null data
that could cause a problem this variable
that's being created called comment
nodes is being comprised of a list of
comments that are being walked through
or loop through and however many
comments are in this list are being
created in to react elements stored into
this variable and then just concisely
print it out and returned as part of
comment list so it's just kind of a
shortcut way of making this thing pretty
we put we could probably could have just
yeah it's really just the best way to do
it so anyway let's go ahead and take a
look at the problem at hand we're going
to go and create an author object and
the author is going to equal comment dot
it's called added by and then we're
gonna say a user name right now this is
gonna create a problem because and the
particular data that we're dealing with
we have added by is not a null down here
you can see that it was added by the
user named Chris Hawkes
this added by up here is null so we're
trying to reference a user name of a
null object so it doesn't exist it's
going to throw an error it's going to
break our react code and just so I can
give you an example of the problem let's
go and take a look at it and just so
that we can actually see author just
like we did before with blurb what we're
going to do is we're gonna put author
inside of an H
so we can say this that prop stock
author and then closed off RH to get rid
of this type over there I'm gonna pull
up my website so nothing gets rendered
because it throws an error so if we want
to see the error message it's go ahead
and right click and inspect element and
you'll see in the console that it cannot
read property username of null because
added by is not therefore one of the
components so you see if one error
happens then nothing else renders and
whole things jacked up it's got to be
perfect so in order to fix this problem
we need an if-else statement to say if
added by is not equal no display the
username if it is no then we need to
display something else or display
nothing at all at the very least just
don't break and screw everything up
so in order to do that we need to do a
ternary expression and what we do is
inside the curly braces on the left hand
side is going to be the actual
conditional operator so we're gonna say
comment on added by not equal and we'll
just say no and then we do a question
mark because if it's not equal null that
we want to go ahead and reference the
username which will be there so we can
say comment I added by dot username but
if it is equal now we need to add a
semicolon and whatever is after the
semicolon is going to be what is in the
else statement so if comment not equal
null do this else and this is this
signifies the else this signifying see
if basically all right so let's go ahead
and we'll just say that the person that
posted this is anonymous so now this
shouldn't choked up and author should
have something in it should be either on
anonymous or a username if it exists so
now when I go back over to the web page
and I reload this you can see that this
object this first when I was showing you
that was no it's coming back as
anonymous and it's executing just fine
because we handled it the second one
and the added by is not null so we could
reference the username now this
obviously assumes that the username is
part of the added by object otherwise
you're gonna have a bigger problem
but this conditional could have been
like if this equals null you know this
could be a string that says jerk or if
it is equal null then it's anonymous so
anyway that is how you do a ternary
operator nary conditional statement
inside of of reactor is X there are
other ways to do it but that is the
basic one and that's what I'm going to
touch on on this video alright guys
