to be doing a new Python tutorial which
is going to be for the new Python 3.5 I
think the way it is the wait is finally
over as far as finding a reason to jump
from Python to series to Python 3 series
there's really no reason to drag our
feet anymore
short of you work for a company that
won't allow you to upgrade to Python I
think everybody in the Python community
should try to do what they can to start
embracing the new 3 series Python there
are some you know minor differences and
there's also a few libraries that are
still lagging support but with the open
source community hopefully we can get
those up so now it did take me
personally a long time to actually jump
on the Python 3 series because I was
using a lot of Django stuff and Django
really only worked really well with
Python g7 but Django is now starting to
support the Python 3 series and one of
the main reasons to actually use Python
3.5 is the newest a sink and a weight
feature which is something that the
c-sharp language has had for quite some
time but Python now will allow
concurrent operations because typically
a dynamically interpreted interpreted
language like Python it did not allow
for any sort of a synchronous
programming which it now does so it uses
those through what they call Co routines
and in this tutorial series we'll get
into how we can use the asynch and a way
to try to conduct simultaneous processes
and you know function calls at the same
time to get more work done with more CPU
and power it also has some additional
support for packing and unpacking
argument variables and we can get into
that later on too but the bottom line is
there are going to be some minor
differences with Python 3 versus Python
2 just little things like how you print
and I print hello world to the screen
you'll see there's a little bit
different than Python 2 and that does
rub some people the wrong way but all in
all it's time for the Python community
to get together and start supporting 3.5
and we
this language further especially now
that you know pythons more popular than
it's ever been and I think I checked OB
index this month they have Python now
listed as a fifth most popular
programming language so anyway those are
the main reasons for why we want to jump
on Python 3.5 it's a faster more
efficient language with more features
and the lack of supported libraries is
becoming less and less of an argument as
we move into the future all right guys
thanks for watching this tutorial and
we'll get started in the next video
thank you bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
