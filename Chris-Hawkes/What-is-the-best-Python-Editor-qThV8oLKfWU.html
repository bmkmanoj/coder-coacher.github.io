so I'm trying to figure out from the
community here what the best editor is
to use in Django development I've been
jumping around like from one to the next
typically like I'm using like Visual
Studio which is kind of unorthodox or
you know uncommon because most people in
the Python community they're not
touching visual studio since it's a
Microsoft project but then I hear a lot
of people say that I should use the
sublime editor but the problem with
sublime is that it doesn't really have
very good intelligence so then if you
wanted to do intellisense and hopefully
you guys know what intelligence is it's
work it automatically detects what
you're trying to type and then give
suggestions the best tool is probably
for at least Python anyways the
JetBrains pycharm but the problem that I
find with pycharm is it's just an
inferior product to Visual Studio like
everything from the navigation menus to
the fact that it's a greedy bastard when
it comes to memory consumption so it
just seems like it it's almost
impossible to run multiple projects with
JetBrains at least the part PyCharm
product that they have they do a reach
our poor project for c-sharp which is
like phenomenal so I guess I'm just
spoiled when it comes to using Visual
Studio because as far as I'm aware I
mean it's the best editor by far I've
used eclipse and I just find Eclipse to
be terrible so I know a lot of you guys
recommend the atom editor and I was
using it for a tutorial series I was
putting together it you know looks
really pretty doesn't have nearly the
features of either pycharm or Visual
Studio in my opinion and really just is
an inferior product but it is open
source and I think it says a lot that
you know people were able to put this
together and it gets better over time so
I think that's good I use Windows 8.1 I
can tell you with Adam sometimes it just
freezes up for like 15 seconds even
though I got sixteen gig of ram and a
pretty decent process or it'll just lock
up and I have no clue what the hell it's
doing and all of a sudden they'll just
start working again so that's like a
common occurrence when I'm using Adam
another problem I have with Adam is that
there are so many packages out there for
doing Python development
I never know which one is a good one I
typically go with whatever has the most
downloads but sometimes those are
out-of-date so I guess the community
sometimes confuses me with using a
demand I think that's one of the
downsides just the fact that it freezes
up doesn't have as many features as
pycharm or Visual Studio and way too
many packages to figure out which ones
are good and which ones are bad like
just even executing Python code from the
actual editor I have to download a
plug-in and then I haven't even done
that yet it was a suggestion on one of
the videos that I do that for a tutorial
that I'm using atom with so I'll look
into that but once again it's just like
another package has to be downloaded to
do something that most editors just do
out of the box a lot of people will talk
about sublime text and sublime text kind
of revolutionized this whole look and
feel with the different you know
fluorescent colors which is pretty cool
but the problem with sublime as once
again it's just a lack of features I
think that it's a quicker product though
from what I've used of it it's
definitely quicker than atom it doesn't
have those weird glitches and freezes
but once again just lacks product
support the problem with Visual Studio
even though Visual Studio is really nice
is that it doesn't have the latest and
greatest so when python 3 5 comes along
and the PI tools doesn't work with it
which I found out yesterday or earlier
this morning one of the two there's also
issues like when I'm writing JSX code
which react JavaScript uses in Visual
Studio doesn't have any support people
have been asking for the goddamn thing
for like two years and Microsoft is
basically giving people to finger and
say hey we'll get to it when we get to
it and they don't seem that you know
have any sort of urgency there as far as
trying to get some new products to the
floor especially if it's not going to
make Microsoft money so that is
definitely the biggest downside to
Microsoft and probably the same thing
can be said for pycharm as well pycharm
has a little bit more of a niche
community so I think you know they have
a little bit more openness to getting
new features to their editor but they're
not perfect as far as being able to get
the latest and greatest I absolutely
hate pie charms menu system so when I'm
looking at all the files and the
structure of my application pycharm
I think is terrible at least a version
that I have um as far as I know I was
never able to figure out how to like
make the text on the left-hand side any
bigger but then just you know when it
comes to running the code in the editor
and stuff like that I find it could be
just inferior to what I get with Visual
Studio and yeah that so let me know
that's kind of the downside and really
those are the main editors that I can
think of for a while I use like apt on
estudios and like I said I definitely
would not go with that clear winner for
me if I had to recommend is Visual
Studio just because it does so much
especially if you want to branch off
into some c-sharp development maybe do
some Unity game programming Visual
Studio is going to help you and take you
a long way in that regard so I would say
Visual Studio number one pycharm number
two
probably sublime text number three and
then Adam is a number four and then
everything else is I think distant
behind that I'm probably missing a few
like I know pythons editors terrible the
one that comes with Python which is Idol
and Eclipse is terrible for me and
there's one that I'm also that I use for
a long time and it's like I can't
remember what the hell it's called but
anyway it was not that good either
in fact it was terrible I would say
because once my project got over a
certain size like it basically couldn't
function anymore so I can't remember the
name of it so I guess I'll spare you
know publicly uh I can't think of
the word but publicly crucify whoever
made that product anyway it was terrible
so alright guys I'll yeah let me know I
just say let me let me know if I'm
missing any editors there that I could
try out I feel like with Python I'm a
bit torn just because I'm bouncing back
between Adam sublime visual studio
pycharm and just kind of bouncing
between I'd like to have one specific
you know Python Django
environment and I'm yet to find that
alright guys thanks for watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
