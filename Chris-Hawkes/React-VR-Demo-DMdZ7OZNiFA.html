share with you real quick this reactive
er I'm sure you guys have heard of it
but a few months ago react recently came
out with reactive er and obviously the
next big thing is going to be virtual
reality slash Lee and maybe even well
not really I've been in reality of a
virtual reality from within into the
browser and that's something that the
browser and Internet can still give us
that experience where we don't have that
you know cell phone or everything but
what's interesting about reactive er on
it i think is that it does bring the
whole react construct a lot of people
like reacts modular approach the way
that it has like essentially web
components that you're assembling and a
lot of people really really like JSX i
hated it when i first started using it
but it really started to grow on me now
I know it quite well I'm still not a
huge fan of Redux I think that Redux um
sometimes over complicate things a bit
but I'm not even going to go on that in
this video but react itself is a pretty
solid project so with react there's you
know react native right which is giving
us the ability to use react and all of
its constructs and everything to build
Android and iOS apps but then also now
with reactive er we're able to use VR in
the browser so that's really cool
the downside is though is that number
one you need a VR headset so something
some sort of VR headset now there is the
Samsung gear VR actually got that a long
time ago Samsung gear VR this thing it
was like now it's much cheaper I paid
$100 for it at the Verizon store when I
got this was last May so about a year
ago and it was pretty cool this is my
first look into virtual reality and I
would definitely recommend that if you
have an Android device because I ended
up writing a and really I just I do this
to also just share with other people
kind of what I learn along the way but
on hipster code I have like this little
snippet section don't not a huge fan
anyway not gonna get into that either
and I know I'm talking really fast but
this little snippet I just wanted to say
if you have an Android device in you go
into your settings and you click on like
basically you follow these steps or you
look online to figure it out but you can
put your phone into developer mode and
and after doing that I didn't realize
that if your phone is connected to the
same Wi-Fi you can then run a local
version of react VR like on your your
personal computer and then you just
simply point to the IP address that is
your IP and you do that by actually
going into a CMD and then typing in IP
config and it will give you your your IP
address that you can connect to from you
know on your network I'm not going to
give that out to other people but that
said like so you need to you need to
point to that and then as well as point
to the port for where reactive ER is
running I'll probably put together a
tutorial series on this in fact I can
show you just you know basically this is
this is what it is
you end up creating this this project
was actually built for you and then I'll
show you and running here but this
project you basically all you gotta do
is NPM install and reactive ER will
create the project for you it's almost
like that if you've ever used Django or
use the Django admin to start your
project same thing with reactive ER so
is it was really simple to get it set up
it's behind the scenes running on nodejs
and you can see inside of its package
JSON this thing has you know some
dependencies one of them being 3 3 J s
is a creative out a genius mr. Duke and
mr. Duke brought the ability to use
WebGL which is the OpenGL standard which
got brought over to the browser's a few
years ago it's been several years now
being kind of slow going unfortunately
but you can see that that's like at 360
tango anyway alright now how do I get
out of this ok alright so yeah I mean
some also stuff is being done with WebGL
and it's it's been you know somewhat
slow going but you know these things
take time and mr. goober three G has
done an excellent job but now they're
using it within gear VR so if we look at
the right project you can see it's also
using react native and that's because it
needs to be able to run on
you know different devices iOS and
Android and everything so it can run on
those devices as well as obviously to
react library and then it's also got
things that even like if you want to
bundle this thing like this allows you
to deploy your project very easily just
by running NPM run bundle so all that
said the app is running no no no
all right so I guess I put them
goddamnit here it is so this is this is
the indie project running here so I'm
able to pop in my phone into the gear VR
headset and then and then if I'm running
on my computer I can go ahead and go
through VR index.html and then you can
see that we have the VR experience
running now this thing will actually run
so if I'd navigated like I said you have
to go into developer mode on your phone
make sure you're connected to the same
Wi-Fi of your network then go to you
know the IP config to figure out what
your IP address is you're going to put
the IP address here on your phone you
know whatever your IP address and then
colon the port number which is 80 81 and
then you'll be able to view your VR self
within you know reactive VR on your
phone which is pretty sweet but there's
quite a bit to learn and everything
there so I I wasn't ready to make a
tutorial on the subject yet I'm still
learning it myself but I think it's
something to be pretty excited about
because there's been a lot of effort
behind this reactive VR project that has
been you know put in by Facebook and I
think it's going to be something that
that's big and getting bigger definitely
in the in the future because if
everybody could on you know if you could
have a fully immersive like YouTube
experience where you're watching your
music videos you might try to probably
do that vo well you know it varies but
every once in a while that VR thing can
be gimmicky and at the same time it's
like menaces kind of a new experience so
it has to get better for kvr and the
browser is going to get much better I
think but we're on the instant in its
infancy and in it it should definitely
get better with time
so you can also use a Google cardboard
and but that is not going to work that
let me work with your I don't know
what it's going to work with to be
honest let me say once again if you go
to this web BR dot info this actually
tells you what is being supported so you
can see Google cardboard works best with
chrome on Android so if you have so
cardboards obviously it's pretty cheap I
think you do it for like 15 bucks or
something but it's the same thing as the
the gear VR you're putting your phone in
the actual cardboard headset and then
you're able to work PlayStation VR does
not support web VR whatsoever so you
can't use your PlayStation VR for this
obviously if you're able to afford an
oculus or HTC that's great but you also
need a super powered computer to run
both of those but that's about it man so
just stick with a gear VR the Google
cardboard you should be able to use your
Android phone to view this stuff as far
as iOS you know man iOS good luck with
that
but yeah check it out I'll try to do a
tutorial on it eventually but it's
something brand new if you guys are
trying to get in on the ground floor or
something that's a good idea I think all
right thanks for watching guys hey guys
so a lot of you asked me how do I get my
foot in the door to become a programmer
and I just want to take a moment to
mention dev Mountain coding boot camp is
