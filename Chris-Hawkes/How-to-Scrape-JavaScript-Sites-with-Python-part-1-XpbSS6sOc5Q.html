talking about this for a while I
apologize I'm just now getting around to
it but a lot of people ask well how do i
scrape Ajax sites you know sites that
require a lot of you know Ajax which
stands for asynchronous JavaScript and
XML and basically you don't know what
that is you probably need to look it up
essentially allows your web page to
communicate with your server without the
need for page refreshes and things like
that so it pretty much revolutionized
the web and about I
I guess anywhere from my eight to ten
years ago or so so nowadays most
websites use some form of Ajax or
another but um that's what that is but
it's a bitch to scrape because I'm going
to give you an example of what we're
talking about for a particular site and
then how you accomplish scraping a site
that can give you some problems so I go
to just as an example I'm not saying go
out and scrape Applebee's I'm just
looking for an example of a site that
uses Ajax and things like that which you
cannot spray under normal means of
grabbing an HTML source code and then
parsing it using something like
beautiful soup or something like that
because you'll see what I'm talking
about in a second and once again
Applebee's don't get pissed off of me
this is just an example it's a
public-facing web site so anyway I'm
just showing this as a as a means for
learning so anyway you click on the site
like this and go ahead and click on
locations now this thing is actually
pulling up the nearest one to my house
as I live in Fredericksburg so it's
pulling my zip code and then use
html5 geolocation to pinpoint two
closest locations now what's interesting
about this is that I'm going to go ahead
and I'm going to go I'm going to
right-click and just view my source and
you'll see the address here so let's
look at um let's look at this one here
because this one is going to show up now
we don't want the default one that shows
up for a zip khoka say I have a bunch of
zip codes that I don't live near you
know what I mean I'm trying to find
Applebee's for New York so I'm going to
show you for an example here so this
let's look at 2851 Plank Road so we're
in the source code here I'm going to do
a control plank road guess what it
doesn't exist it's not in the
source it's not there so you cannot just
request the webpage and get this data in
here because this is actually a JSON
object which something like JavaScript
something or another I don't know but
basically it's a it's a it's a means of
structuring data using javascript it's
JavaScript object notation I believe is
what it stands for something like that
but it's essentially the alternative to
XML but all it is is just structuring
data so that a particular client or
hosting client can then communicate with
each other and a common language that
both parties understand so it's the more
type of web services types of things you
end up getting into it like api's things
like that so it's just it's a way of
structuring data so that like I said
it's easily understandable for
business-to-business but anyway when I
put in a zip code here I'm going to put
in a zip code that's not near me so I'm
going to do two one
one and I believe so that's in Frederick
Maryland so once again just so you guys
know look at Spectrum Drive so we're
going to go ahead and do view source
view page source and let's go ahead and
just ctrl F and look for spectrum drive
so I can show you one more example
so we're spelling it just like we're
supposed to spell it and it doesn't
exist in the source code so in the next
video I'm going to go ahead and explain
how one particular person would end up
trying to automate and scrape a website
like this so that you could get data
automatically so and just go ahead and
we're going to we're going to use a
selenium webdriver so in the next video
I'm going to explain how we go ahead and
we just quickly install that using easy
install but anyway just make sure you
