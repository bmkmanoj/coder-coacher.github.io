interesting quote from a dracaen horwitz
re i think its mortgage recent or it
might be the Horde would Scott I don't
remember it's one of those too but it's
from the aegis in horowitz guy this is
the bald the real big bald bearded guy
not sure which one he is but he was uh
he said something that I thought was a
little bit interesting he was saying
that he was a kind of fed up with the
fact that a lot of the startups that
he's dealing with currently they they
have this growth model where they charge
a lesser amount then you know what the
product is actually worth in order to
try to grow and we've seen a lot of
companies try to do stuff like this like
Sony for the longest time hasn't really
been profitable like they've been you
know marketing their PlayStation fours
and at one point with the PlayStation 3
I mean back when there were like six or
seven hundred dollars like 10 years ago
they were losing money on every single
item that they were manufacturing but
they were willing to do that because
they obviously wanted to capture the
market and they were losing market share
to xbox and basically this kind of thing
has been going on in business for it
seems like a really long time in fact at
my age at 34 I don't really recall ever
being in the business world where this
type of stuff wasn't going on but
apparently with it with this a person or
a whore bitch guy he was saying that you
know he's just kind of upset and the
tech world that you know these these
tech products are being built and and
you know hundreds of millions of dollars
being poured into it and the entire idea
is that you're going to charge a lesser
mouth and what the product is worth and
hope to make it up on the back burner so
companies are not quick to become
profitable and one of the things that I
find interesting about that is that um
well I it's not really something
interesting but I guess I'm wondering
you know how much of that entire mantra
of just not charging enough money I mean
how much of it is related to this
economy in the world that we live in
right now like how much of this is is it
plays into the fact that people just
don't have a bunch of excess money that
a lot of you know younger kids if
they're if they're buying software that
you know some of these companies are
producing you know many of them that are
tech enthusiasts and things like that
they have a ton of college debt they
probably don't have a job paying them as
much
money as they'd like you know but how
much of this is just the simple fact
that we can afford less and less so
we're we're being charged less and less
for products i look at tvs when i
brought by my first flat screen for the
longest time I wanted the flat screen by
couldn't afford it i think i bought my
first one in like two thousand eight and
they had been around for a long time
before that and i was able to do it you
know through you know saving up and
things like that but i spent like eight
hundred dollars on a sony 32 inch i
think it was a 1080i or something like
that but it was a good TV but for the
you know but i had to save up a ton of
money that was eight hundred dollars
that's i mean i could have spent that on
a lot of different things and but now
we've seen the price come down
drastically and it's probably because
the technology is cheaper but you know
how much money are these TV companies
clearing if they're only charging like
less than two hundred dollars for a 32
inch flat screen like I'm just really
curious like what their profit margin is
there are they just looking to gain
market you know market should market
market share more than you know actually
profiting off the products with the the
tech startup world I definitely think
that's the case if the products are
geared towards younger kids on if we
look at some of the software that's out
there today it's very expensive a lot of
the software I mean it's being pirated
and stuff like that because it's it's
being used by kids that probably
wouldn't be able to purchase the product
anyway so in some cases I could see that
you know companies would be really
pissed off their stuff is being pirated
but in other cases I'm like well you
know if they're not really losing money
because they wouldn't have gotten that
sale in the first place it's probably
not as big of a deal and then I also try
to think positively on that as well
we're like maybe if somebody's actually
like you know if they if they did take
the product without permission or
something like that if they're learning
how to use it maybe their intention is
to buy it I'm not sure what the
intentions of these people are but the
fact of the matter is though is I don't
feel like there's a whole lot of you
know extra money that people have in
this day and age at least in the United
States I know the EU is not doing very
well in fact Britain's like currently
debating whether or not they want to
drop out of the EU well together the
United States since the Great Recession
in 2008 has only grown by like less than
three percent every year which is very
unusual
well especially coming out of you know a
recession and you know one of the
greatest recessions that we've ever gone
into so there hasn't been you know a
whole lot of excess money and and i
think you know if you also look at the
stats and everything I mean going back
like three decades now that the middle
class has been shrinking but you know
could that play into the fact that the
companies are charging less for their
product I don't know maybe you guys have
a have an idea on that but I thought it
was interesting another interesting
thing that he brought up was that um I
guess he was getting upset with some of
the terminology that gets you is like he
uh he and the Lean Startup mantra in
case you guys have never heard of like a
Lean Startup but the lean startup is I
talked about this in a few videos where
you just get your product out there and
I mean even if it's an early prototype
you just get it out there you start
getting market feedback from your
customers you try to make money as
quickly as you possibly can in some
cases not all cases but you basically
try to get the product out as soon as
you possibly can and adapt on the fly so
it creates this completely you know on
unpredictable environment you know you
could fail overnight and it's very
exciting and things like that but you
know that is the whole lean startup and
the Lean Startup coined this term which
they call a pivot point and a pivot
point and Adrian actually points us out
I wish I would have remembered his name
if it's Horowitz her a dress in any way
but he points it out that you know it's
it's actually a fuckup which has been
returned to pivot so a pivot means I'll
we up on something now let's
pivot and and make up for it and that's
something that a lot of younger
businesses are doing nowadays so in the
IT world it's it's it's certainly
interesting that also it kind of reminds
me like some of the the you know the
detectors that are actually running some
of these companies it's pretty
interesting because you know they don't
have a lot of business sense in many
cases but you know they have the vision
and the passion to to bring it forward
but I was watching Bloomberg the other
day and I saw this Facebook special
where Mark Zuckerberg had to answer for
the fact that um you know somebody in an
IM conversation with him because
Facebook's have a lot of issues with
privacy that's actually been like their
main issue problem when they have a
billion users and the privacy because
they make money
sharing data and things like that but in
this IM conversation actually captured
him like somebody was asking zuckerberg
so why do people trust you with their
personal information and zuckerberg
responded by saying because they're dumb
or they're effing dahmer one of the he
but he said because they are done they
he called his customers dom which is
funny there was another CEO i wish i
would have actually researched this as
well but he he was a CEO of a tech
company and he thought that he was
talking with one of his co-workers about
a customer complaint but the actual
customer was cc'd on the email and he
responded by saying something like tell
this dumb bitch to you know f off or
something like that but he was you know
he was saying it what he thought was
confidentially to another co-worker and
i thought that was pretty interesting
that's kind of a side tangent from what
this video is about but the thing is is
that i think you know that there is some
sort of correlation between the fact
that people just have less money
nowadays and the fact that you know so
much stuff is being pirated and so much
stuff it was not being month not being
purchased and companies are trying to
you know push it for as cheaply as they
possibly can to become relevant and
hopefully make money at a later time now
another thing i wanted to mention which
is interesting that i was kind of
reading about recently is that some of
the companies that are you know some of
the startups like and personally
speaking I've actually worked on
products where like I was working on a
website or a new business idea or
something like that and there's this
entire there's this excitement of of
trying to well there's an excitement of
making a lot of money with the product
and as you're building it before you
actually try to release it to the wild
and see you know what kind of feedback
you're getting but you know you're all
you have those motivation to build it
you're thinking of all these you know
great things that could come about you
know once your completed and or once
it's you know finish to your
satisfaction and stuff like that and
then you end up going live after you've
worked so much you know
so hard and spend so much time on it and
you go live and you realize that like
nobody is going to your website nobody's
trying out your product you're not
making any money all those affiliate
deals that you thought you had we're
going to pan out and none of that's
working out you know what i mean but
reality hits and my goal of a sudden you
realize what a pain in the ass it is to
try to get a business off the ground and
then it becomes less fun to work on it
so there are so many projects that i've
had in fact i had a couple of you guys
asking me about products for these
domains that i've bought in the past but
I've been in inches where I built
businesses around like like selling
selling photography like I tried to get
into that business I was building
automated scrapers at one time and
trying to sell software I got in to the
idea of trying to do web templates and
stuff like that I've considered doing
consulting gigs and that never really
panned out I've obviously done my movies
and music and all kinds of different
content sites that have never really
panned out I built stuff that you know
was essentially just scrape data Andrey
displaying it to make money and that
never works out like you're never going
to succeed on a you know a sleazy
product like that but surprisingly that
did make some money before it didn't
work out but the thing is is like once
you actually go live like the reality of
the situation hits you and you realize
that damn nobody's using my product and
and all of a sudden it's not fun to work
on anymore because you're working for
free and all this other stuff and part
of me wonders whether some companies
operate under you know without trying to
earn revenue for a reason like we've
seen companies like Instagram and the
oculus rift company that in fact both of
those companies were bought by Facebook
for over a billion dollars a piece too I
believe and then we've seen companies
like you know read it and all this stuff
like be very very popular and not you
know not making any money and you know
they have these promises of future
revenue that they're going to earn and
in many cases you'll site a company like
Facebook that was literally losing
hundreds of millions of dollars a
quarter but everybody knew the kind of
value that Facebook was going to provide
because they had so many accounts and so
much real data on so many different
people that they knew that it could be a
cash cow I'm just having access to that
much data but with companies like reddit
you know reddit is a very popular site
and it has a lot of a large user base
and stuff like that but it was competing
against you know robots and if you look
at the UI of reddit man it is it's it's
relatively garbage you know it's
especially if you're registering a new
account like you hola allow you to use a
new account to post some sort of you
know link to your video and then and
then it kind of like monitors how much
stuff you're allowed to comment and it
will say stuff like you're doing too
much and all this other it's just a
terrible website it really is but when
it comes to the content you know the
people that are on that site is what
makes it valuable and you know reddit
was like not they were not making money
and last time I checked I don't know
that they were very profitable but they
had you know this this vision that they
were going to be pop profitable one day
and they would cite their users and
their growth and stuff like that and in
a way I'm thinking that some of these
companies do this on purpose because if
there is an excitement of the fact that
this company can make a lot of money
then it's there there's going to be more
of an incentive for for them to be able
to get venture capital funding and
people just to be excited about their
product including their own employees if
they go public and by public I mean like
go go go forward with their product
trying to make money before you know
they really feel like they have a good
footing you're going to see poor results
you know out of the gate and for many
products right most products fail and
once you start seeing those poor results
and then you have the employees that are
building this product no like damn we're
not making any money this product sucks
you know like I think that there's like
there's certainly a lack of incentive
for venture capitalists to pour more
money into the product if it's not
making money and there's probably less
incentive for employees that are working
for stock options and things like that
because you know they're thinking that
they're going to get rid
and their stock is essentially worthless
at this point because they're starting
to realize that the company is not
making anything so I'm just wondering
how much of that is true you know do
companies intentionally not try to earn
revenue and just focus on growth in
hopes that you know they can continue to
build the product to a point where it
like it can be nothing but profitable at
some point I mean I would think there's
probably a pretty good you know there's
probably a good amount of companies that
actually operate that way because just
personally speaking I've been in that
situation where you do and work on a
product for very long time put it out
there and nobody uses it and it sucks
and I've never had venture capital
funding or anything like that but if if
I did and I was like hey you know I made
a hundred dollars this quarter you know
and I spent hundreds of hours developing
this product and I only made a hundred
dollars and why is somebody going to try
to pour a ton of cash in there but if I
if I don't tell them that I'm making a
hundred dollars a quarter and basically
I didn't even try to make any money I
could be like look I'm you know I'm
growing and you know I'm not even trying
to make money yet and blah blah you know
so I think that there is some some truth
to that that companies would
intentionally do that anyway guys that's
pretty much all I have tonight let me
know what you think and please subscribe
I appreciate all the support you guys
take care have a good day and by</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
