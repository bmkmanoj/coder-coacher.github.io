I just wanna do something short and
sweet in the last video we added the
ability to just show the text of
whatever pole was that we were trying to
find so it makes things a lot easier if
you start having hundreds of these
though and they're not you know they can
be ordered alphabetically or whatever
but Jenga is only going to show a
hundred results per page so when you
start having thousands of pole objects
n' it's gonna be important to be able to
search for whatever pole object you're
looking for by text so to enable that
functionality what we want to do is go
to our admin PI file and then we're just
gonna add a search field and then you
just feed it a list so it's a Python
list and I'm either saying what items
you want to be able to search inside the
admin so now by doing that Reis freshing
might might work sometimes you have to
to restart the server yeah it's going to
do this alright so
I'm super Singh
if you need to reset your server you
just press control-c and we're just
gonna restart it here
all right and now you see that we have a
search ability so is this C is this
matches so it'll match like really it
doesn't have to be 100% perfect
so we can say tutorial and I'll still
find the same result so that's pretty
good and cool to be able to add the
search capability to our Django admin
I'm gonna go ahead and in this video
just at that point just keep things
simple enough for this tutorial series
and in the next video we'll get into
some more stuff thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
