getting in front of a camera because
I've had requests from multiple people
multiple people that subscribe to me
they've asked me to get in front of a
camera for some reason it's like all
five of the women that followed my
channel want me to get in front of the
camera understand this is this request
the latest one actually gave them a dude
so anyway Here I am so where am i right
right now right now I'm in my basement
oh no I think I've done one other video
down here in my basement other than that
like I have this house it's a thirty
3300 square foot house five bedroom
three not baths I only have my two kids
with me and have an entire floor
that I don't use that's what happens
when you become a program you get an
entire floor and a drum set down here
that you don't use so what else is going
on while I'm down here in front of a
camera let me thank my latest patreon
supporters I know some of you guys are
dropping off some you guys are having on
but so the Bitcoin market is just
absolutely tanking I know that we've
talked about that in the past and a lot
of you guys were like no Chris you gotta
jump on it I think when I made that
video that was it like nineteen
thousand and right now like I saw it
drop below seven thousand today so it's
like I'm glad I didn't listen to you
guys and buy into it right then and
there in fact I'm waiting bitch the
falling below like a thousand and then
I'll jump in at this rate like it just
keeps falling but it doesn't help when
the market collapses like six and a half
percent at least the Dow collapsed 6.5
percent of last two days from an IT
perspective like I don't know that I'm
necessarily seen the effects too much
but I feel like I have seen somewhat of
a slowdown and IT and like recruiters
and people reaching out to me for
different jobs and things like that and
I wish I could be more scientific about
it but I just noticed like there's less
emails and that I'm getting on
LinkedIn where am I going in 2018 I have
not figured that out yet like when it
comes to technology and things like
this is still like a year of me just
kind of gathering what I want to work on
and what I want to learn one of the
things I did start messing with recently
is view
everybody talks a huge game about view
and I'm definitely going to use view of
my next project I think it's going to be
an azure project for the music website
and it's really just going to be a basic
kind of single page app that's probably
going to be using a view like it is the
plan right now and it's gonna be hosted
on as you're probably a dotnet site I'm
not sure I feel like I need a dotnet
site I've kind of stopped with Python
and PHP and other programming
technologies that are outside of
Microsoft I'm not a Microsoft fanboy and
some of you guys think I am
I'm not even though I get paid to write
C sharp and JavaScript mostly they do
also have some good technology obviously
BS code is like a really good editor
that they've come out with recently
dotnet cores of open source and
cross-platform now Visual Studio even
works the IDE now works on maps so
they're making some major progress I
think as a company and then Asher is a
solid product man like when I what I
like so I would recommend to you guys
like when I tell you guys to build a
portfolio website or put something out
there like you could go to like a Wix
like if you didn't want to do any code
whatsoever but if they're like hey where
do you host oh I built that website I'm
Wix probably not probably not the best
look for a developer that's like hey I
can build something like Wix
blaring anyway so so then like if
you look at like the websites that I
have I host them on one node and the
nodes only cost me like 20 bucks a month
plus a $5 backup that I do like they
handle the automatic backing up and all
that because I know I could do that
on some Linux you know shell scripts or
whatever but then I was doing that but
it's just easier just to have that once
I started taking credit card payments on
certain sites and everything even though
I'm buying storing the credit card data
I just didn't want to lose customer
accounts and stuff I was just lay off my
family extra five bucks now
back it up for several months anyway but
yeah well Noah man it stuff like $25 a
month I could run literally 20 websites
off that VPS probably that each get you
know several thousand people a day and
still be able to handle you know they're
the free resources I think maybe I'm
probably talking out my ass on that but
at least at least one website that gets
in fact as I know I've posted a website
when new movies was at its peak there
was 250 some thousand people that I got
they drove to the website in one month
that was like my absolute peak and it
was it was a very disappointing month
too because all those those views and
 like that website I don't remember
the exact figure but the figure was very
very low I'm talking like $100 or less
on advertising would that that many
views and everything so like nobody was
clicking the ads and I it took a
tremendous amount of effort to drive
that much traffic to the site only to
get those kind of returns so that was
about the peak of what I my content
website days so I spent a lot of time
building content websites where I was
like trying to compile data writing data
doing things like that and it was kind
of doing that around the same time that
I created this channel many years ago
and and I think when new movies peaked
at that 250 some thousand views in a
month I realized that it's it's it's a
 model to be in like you do you
don't want to just you don't want to be
in any sort of like if companies like
New York Times can pay the best writers
in the world and still can't make money
advertising on their website like don't
even bother you know it's like if you do
there was a big old you know discussion
I remember at the time about okay do I
go for an authority website which is
like you know YouTube's an authority on
videos right or Instagram is an
authority on my personal photos things
like that and that's probably a shitty
example let's look at something like
like CNN as an authority on all news
right if you want some general news
information you're gonna go to CNN
versus like some local like that's why I
don't even know why like in my city that
I live in with I don't even know why
they even have like major news stories
about whether it's the local light
whether it's the DC football team or
like something in Northern Virginia it's
like nobody gives a like what's
going on in Florida if I'm on
you're like puny ass website I'm here
for the local news because I don't give
a like what your local reporters
have to say about some national story
like the stories aren't going to be
better for the most part and then some
of these major providers and everything
so it's like that's just a business
model that I don't want to be in and
even if it's something that I haven't I
can interest in like astronomy right so
you want to be like a full you know
website like an authority on a strong
you like you're gonna have to compete
with NASA and all that stuff like you
just don't even bother like but if you
were gonna do a specific website maybe
about that one mission from you know
that Juno mission that went to Jupiter
last year I believe it was and I mean
you could probably I mean and this is
just as an example but it's like you
could build like a single-page niche or
niche focused site that just focuses on
that one thing and that's the only time
you're ever gonna have success probably
in this day and age with with Google and
all its rules and all the spam and BOTS
and everything and all the authority
websites out there you know just good
luck getting it and getting that kind of
traffic so it's the unfortunate reality
I think of content based sites but the
Chris Hawkes recommendation in 2018
having been there and played that game
for several years and you know look I've
had some success obviously we're getting
a lot of views and making money on views
and things like that but this video
is completely different than building
content based websites and and in my
opinion 2018 content based websites like
do not try to be an authority and
anything and in fact I would also stick
with something like and right now you've
already missed the boat on Bitcoin but
all the that we hear about Bitcoin
and then you have all these Bitcoin web
sites whether it's a big coin web sites
that just monitor the markets like the
different crypto currencies and things
like that like there was a market for
that when this first hit the fan
there was a market for gambling websites
that first use Bitcoin what about
websites that just list gambling
websites they use Bitcoin things like
that you know little things like that
little tiny Authority websites
I call them Authority like now I'm
confusing because I just call the
authority and I'm confusing myself but
hopefully no I'm talking about you want
that in that micro niche focused website
to become an authority one day but don't
try to be a authority
day one people will tell you that online
and people will attempt to do that and
so we've done that's probably just the
people that have been there and know
better and just want to you know do that
out what's that old English term that's
called a red herring where they used to
when they were training their dogs to
hunt down the animals and like they
would try to like throw off the dogs
trail or something was like red herring
I think I don't know why they did that
but if you look at the term red herring
or something like that I think that's
where it derives from anyway guys that's
basically it man so yeah I'm gonna be in
front of a camera and answer that
question they get like well Chris is
better here in front of the camera
there's that there's a fine balance I've
found with YouTube between growing
appeasing your subscribers and not
making absolute content 24/7 I've
made my fair share of content I
know that but I'm simply saying not all
my stuff is and obviously hopefully
hopefully you guys agree with that if
you're watching all right take care make
sure you subscribe bye so this video was
