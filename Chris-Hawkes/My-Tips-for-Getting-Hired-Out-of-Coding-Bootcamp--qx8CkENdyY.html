this on this video unlike tips to
getting hired so I've actually been
hired clearly by programming places I
don't have a degree however at this
point it's a little bit easier for me
because I at least have the experience
and everything so it's kind of a
different world and the world is always
changing the environment everything so
nowadays with the boot camps like
there's a lot more boot camps in fact my
sponsor good mountain cording blue
canvas sponsoring this video is a coding
boot camp that has a very good
reputation they're owned by a
multi-million dollar company like they
they are nicely multi millionaire
they're actually worth quite a bit of
money on but the the coding boot camps
like they they are there's a lot of them
and there's some that are more reputable
than others and I have somebody here
from New York who is saying hey Christ I
just want to say thanks for making the
videos as often as you do I'm a father
understand how much effort it takes to
make these as consistent as you do I am
a recently graduated boot camper and I'm
looking looking for work in New York
City if you have any tips or know of
anyone I could connect with I would
greatly appreciate it
keep taking us thanks I plan to keep
taking house yes so yeah it do yeah the
schedule of my videos and everything you
know I really can't afford to take off a
week or two and it's not really about
the growth but it's actually about you
know through through business
connections and things that I have now
for this channel that have kind of
cropped up along the way so I owe it to
you know my sponsors to my viewers
everything else to make content and and
to be honest with you I like it so it
doesn't take a tremendous amount of
effort however it took a tremendous
amount of effort like years and years
ago and like if you look at it from a
whole is a ridiculous amount of effort
yes it is but now that I'm at this level
like the effort was there and eventually
it's it's less effort I would say than
it than it used to be but I don't know
that said anyway it's a great question
so I'm going to focus on like what I
would do if I were trying to get a job
and I developer bootcamp
grot as I was a graduated developer
bootcamp I'm curious about what
technologies you were learning a lot of
places they might be focused more like a
PHP you know laravel
if that's the case like you want to go
ahead and start you know get started on
on github get a website out there so buy
a domain host the domain set up your
stacks so you can be like a full stack
developer say I'm a full stack developer
because I have this website over here
it's using my sequel it's using and you
know I always going to go back to like
hipster groves it's only full stack web
site have up and running right now that
I truly manage all of it but this is
Postgres is Django it's Python it's
using react it's got and everything a
lot of stuff going on the site but I can
I can like I can say that I'm a full
stack developer and I can point to
specific things questions that may
people may ask me about you know this
stack so having that experience is
really good so I would put hipster code
down even though like this website you
know not impressive raining it's just
typical and kind of website but it is
certainly a credential you can put on
your resume and things like that so I
would definitely I would try to have
some sort of project out there that that
your you're working with that was this
one asshole who made a comment I was
looking up this guy but I he was and I
just said terrible person um that's a
side tangent basically this guy's like
laughing about that New York Times the
people can run over in New York New York
Times Square in New York City I don't
know man like I believe in justice man
like here now like I believe in absolute
justice a lot of people it might be
religious so they'll be like you know
justice will be in the afterlife odd I'm
like screw that I want justice now like
I don't have enough faith to say that it
just might be carried out later on but
anyway that's a completely side note so
beyond the actual project that you guys
should be creating and running yourself
I am I would say that you need to number
one have a positive attitude knowing
that you're not going to get calls back
on certain jobs that you even might
think that you're going to be a good fit
for you have a lot of jobs that say they
want the bachelor's degree ladies you
feel like you like you have the skillset
that they're asking for and you don't
have that
so it's degree you might want to go and
apply anyway a lot of places Stadium on
that bachelor's degree but once they see
a resume they see that you have the
skills they're looking for they'll go
ahead and wave it but if you don't have
the degree and you don't have the skills
they certainly don't want a bunch of
people that don't have either one trying
to reach out to them so that said like I
know that I personally had attention on
jobs now we're asking for a four-year
degree why specifically said I don't
have one so that's really not that big
of a deal if you have the skillset it's
really not a lot of other companies are
bending over on that now the next thing
is you're going to have a lot of
companies that are just going to
overlook your resume like there's like
companies out there that are literally
getting five hundred to a thousand
applicants that are being sent to in
fact I know I have a relative who works
in property management and just for
maintenance and stuff she's getting by
several hundred resumes and job
applications for a particular
maintenance job like in Northern
Virginia so it's like just even that
like you could be inundated with with
resumes and things like that so a lot of
these companies they may not see your
resume you might fall through the cracks
like it could be like they could add a
typo on your resume a lot of people
don't care about that some people do
like and but so for the professionalism
that is kind of twofold there make sure
your resume looks very professional look
at resumes that you can have you can
have like google docs resume template if
you do that like a professional resume
template or google docs is there any way
like if you do some searches on here man
you can yeah you can find templates here
so yeah look at this template use a
format like this try to talk about a lot
more than just like you need that you
need to be able to list out the
technologies and things and focus on
obviously the areas that you're able to
focus on you can't just make stuff up
but do your best make sure it's
professional no typos or anything like
that
beyond that make sure you are sending
yourself out to as many
people as possible right so you might
end up having a situation where like
you're not going to get calls back and
sometimes like it might because you're
not going first unless you're just fall
into the Crouch but send out a lot of
different applications so that you can
eventually get a call back on top of
that make sure that you are building
your online portfolio make sure you have
a stack overflow it cannot get over
count I would have all that stuff
available there just in case actually
don't even worry about stack overflow to
be honest with you but I would try to be
on github if you can like my github is
nothing spectacular but let's see if I
move here it's okay
all right nevermind so yeah like so I
can point to the projects and you can
view point to get over something that
next thing that's going to be important
is the sheer amount of resumes you're
going to be sending out there to try to
get get bytes or nibbles and things like
that sometimes you can get nibbles
sometimes you're going to get bytes it's
very difficult to say even for
experienced developers like you can send
your resume into an abyss that you never
get a contact back on like so that is
certainly possible next thing I would
say is you're going to want to look up
like questions for job interviews like
okay so you're looking for a JavaScript
job we'll go ahead and put into Google
these jobs for 25 essential questions s
and Java like believe it or not a lot of
the people hiring you are reading the
same stupid to ask you what they
think they need to ask you to figure out
your of a program or not because they're
not even a good enough programmer to
figure out what they're supposed to ask
you so it's a big game you got to play
it man so they're going to ask you all
kinds of things like what is the arrow
function do what is the disk context in
JavaScript what is a call and apply do
like what what is uh it is JavaScript
strongly typed is it single threaded
like there's going to be all these you
might get like random questions like
that and believe it or not a lot of
times it's not overly important that you
know that stuff but eventually you kind
of know it you know I've been doing this
a long time but you can certainly study
up on those things like to answer all
that you know that that nuri question
format type stuff now the next thing
that you didn't want to focus on is
making sure that you're professional
within the job interview
I've actually had videos should you wear
a tie Christophe now I come from the
East Coast Washington DC so like for me
and a lot of companies that I've
interviewed with you're supposed to wear
a suit and tigers are working for a
business like a multi I used to work for
Berkshire Hathaway like their company
that was owned by Berkshire either way
it was still a traditional suit and tie
type of place where like that was the
status quo so even though programmers
don't have to wear a suit and tie every
day there are certain extent you know
exceptions like if you're in some sort
of public light you're not always some
like sandals wearing douchebag and some
sort of like startup you know what I
mean like it's not always like that and
one of the things that pissed me off on
out the videos like there's this one guy
who apparently worked for Amazon and
he's like Amazon any and he's right
about the fact that Amazon would
probably look down upon you if you wore
a suit to an Amazon interview I'm not
saying wear a suit Amazon interview for
Google or even you know facebook grana
so because they probably wouldn't hire
you because they are douchebags and in
that sense where it's like they think
you're trying to prove something and I
don't know man it's just like there's a
you have to do enough background search
on the business that you're dealing with
and whether or not a student ID is
applicable but from the status quo of
like business-to-business relationships
and things like that
typically it's been a student type type
of thing especially in my part of the
country where I live which is in you
know the DC area which is where most of
the jobs that I was applying for but
anyway this guy from Amazon was like the
Amazon has done more to change the world
or something like that then he was
talking about Raytheon like a cyber
Raytheon cyber security department but
anyway he was talking about number one
he had never even heard of Raytheon
Raytheon I believe even had I'm trying
to remember this correctly I think even
Einstein at one point I worked for a
radar net now I couldn't
long about that because right there is a
Dharan military base that's not too far
from from where I live were nearing that
military base I did work out of there
but in recon has a pretty large presence
over there for some of the missiles
defense things sometimes stuff like that
but if you look at Raytheon man they
bought Hughes Aircraft right so they
kind of merged that Hughes Aircraft
stubb they've done stuff like build
chips that go on computer satellites and
things that are going on the space out
in orbit that deal with intense amounts
of radiation like their engineers are
doing a shitload of stuff they invented
the microwave like they are doing all
kinds of stuff when it comes to like
guided laser-guided missiles and all
assembly dude there's no question when
it comes from a technology perspective
that Raytheon is doing just as much as
Amazon if not more and has been for like
a hundred years so it's like but this
this guy was like oh you can't wear a
suit Amazon it's better than Raytheon
who's Ray's dad never even heard of them
never heard of the microwave like all
this difference now you know it's like
people just kind of like people can be
very very short-sighted including myself
maybe I'm being a dick in this in this
video maybe I am I don't know this guy
just kind of irritates me because he's
the kind of guy that probably doesn't
know a whole lot about like the real
world outside of maybe his uh you know
his his left coast like you know bubble
that he lives in but I don't know man
business is different you know different
parts of the world different parts of
the country and stuff like that so
getting off of that soapbox the next
important thing that you want to do is
practice your coding exercises
fizzbuzz like there's going to be
companies out there that don't have
anything better to ask you than to do
like a certain buzz example but even
beyond that just look for like you know
coding challenges for job interviews
like you want to just practicing these
stupid things will actually help you out
a lot because a lot of companies even
though it has nothing to do with like
how well you do your job are going to
ask you to whiteboard coding solutions
things like that which is really a
shitty way to evaluate somebody's
credentials especially for a lot of
introverts like you know what
programmers typically are including
myself who's like not really like the
computer nerd type of background but but
I'm still somewhat of an introvert where
I feel like I choke under pressure
especially around like people I don't
know like and then like having to like
think in front of everybody like I don't
know man it's just for me like I've
never had any sort of coding example
I've white board adopts solutions
somebody that when I'm with like my
friends and things like that but for the
most part like being in a room full of
strangers is not really something that I
think demonstrates whether or not
somebody has coding ability or not but
like he says at best I always go to
Scott Meyers he's want to see plus
busses like most influential programmers
so it does I hate anything that asked me
to inside on the spot that's asking the
demonstrators feel rarely required on
the job in a high-stress environment
where it is difficult for a candidate to
accurately prove their abilities I think
it's fundamentally an unfair thing to
request of a candidate absolutely agree
this guy's smarter than most of the
people that would ever interview you and
and they should also I think have some
words wisdom there but once again there
are douche-baggy type of protocols and
things that are at stake in that play
especially in the technology industry
they just doesn't play along with and
the best way to do it is you can go to
hacker rank
I hate hacker rank actually like I don't
like solving other people's coding
challenges for free and stuff like that
but if you go here there is all kinds of
different logical type of programming
things that do make you a decent
programmer they actually do but I
typically try to solve problems that
that I'm trying to solve that I you know
that I that I find you know as I'm
trying to solve you know a business
problem things like that so Mike my
coding has always been to stall business
problems and hacker rank is more about
like let me try to you figure out some
sort of you know logic or mathematical
computation that might feel it rip
somebody up or maybe like a legitimate
use case for some sort of business
problem that somebody has but if it's
not my own and I have no
I have no desire to just go and start
you know looking at one brainteaser
after another however if you're looking
at the job interview place and then and
you're gonna have to do white boarding
in front of people it's best to go ahead
and practice that out maybe even if you
have a wife or you have a friend or
something that could actually you know
watch your white board a solution that's
going to be the best way to learn it
really is it's even something that I
should do as well like if I were
actively searching for a job and things
like that that's something that I would
probably want to do as well so that's
something for me I find it difficult to
do that on under such a high-stress
situation but it is something that is
asked of you unfortunately and not all
the time but a good good majority of
companies out there are doing that to
try to figure out I suppose whether or
not you'll crack under pressure and know
like I said I don't agree with it but it
is what it is and you just have to roll
with the flow so alright guys thanks for
watching this video is sponsored by GAD
mountain coding boot camp so we talked
about that mountain and M Mountain is a
coding boot camp they're out of Provo
Utah Dallas Texas and Salt Lake City
they have 12 and 16 week courses if you
look at their courses are focusing on
technologies that will get you into the
industry as a junior developer and I
have actually worked with people that
have actually attended boot camps that
were not as reputable as Deb mountain or
the company that owns the mountain and
they are still able to get their foot in
the door once a PHP laravel developer
another ones actually working as a u.s.
six JavaScript developer and actually
two of them reassessed JavaScript
developers but that's kind of what
they're focusing on on the web end here
like they're going to teach you how to
use git and github and nodejs for your
server-side stack they're still talking
about jQuery why because it's still used
widely in any sort of production
application that's been written in the
last like two or three years which is
what a lot of applications that are out
there still are but on top of that so
focus on angularjs and things like that
and now they're going react so react an
angularjs
to the to hardnesses and in the web
development world they focus on both of
them the other sponsor is ed monix and
they are as opposed to an in person and
I just went to the wrong wing son of a
bitch I spelled it wrong Edda monix is a
on line coding solution basically a
website that has all kinds of different
courses that you can then sign up for to
learn their courses are they vary widely
from web development and mobile
developments are typical like even
marketing graphic design things like
that but here you can see it you can do
a Django Ruby on Rails WordPress full
stack development the courses the prices
vary so you can you know obviously be
able to you can pick and choose which
courses are most applicable to you but
but the links to both idiotic as well as
Deb mountain coding bootcamp or in the

watching and you have a good day bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
