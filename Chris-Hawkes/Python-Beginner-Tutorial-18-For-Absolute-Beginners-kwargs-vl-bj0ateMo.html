the last video we looked at dictionaries
in Python this video we actually want to
look at something that is it's going to
be more helpful when it comes to
actually arguments that that we have for
our functions we can have functions that
can have unlimited named arguments so
what is a named argument we saw in
previous videos that we could have a
default argument in Python within our
function that automatically gets
assigned the value if you don't pass one
end in this case though we want to have
a actual parameter within our function
that can accept any number of named
arguments and named arguments are
nothing more than just a dictionary
that's it just that's it that's all it
is so let's look at this we're gonna say
my when I say define my function that's
a terrible name
but anyway inside of here we're gonna
say star star kwargs
which stands for keyword arguments this
is a special reserved thing that does
some magic in Python and it just says
hey I accept an unlimited amount of
keyword arguments inside of this
function so let's just simply say print
orgs
that's all we're gonna do and then down
here I'm going to call this function
this long terribly long function name
and I'm gonna pass it a bunch of key
values named Chris Paul height equals 6
so and then we're just gonna pass in
those two actually for right now we
could pass in two we could pass in a
million it doesn't matter this keyword
arguments is flexible in the fact that
you could pass in any number of
arguments and it's going to then it
prints off all of them but look what we
have we have what we talked about in the
last video this is simply a dictionary
one of the ways to actually know is we
could say you know what print type and
then course this is something that type
is a built-in keyword within Python that
actually returns the type of
the object that got created so we can
see that type of quarks is a dictionary
dict which sounds very vulgar is short
for dictionary and you can see it's a
built-in type that comes with Python
talked about dictionaries in the last
video and that's all quarks is and so in
more a more advanced cases we could say
you know what if if wargs height you
know it not height I'll just say name
equals Chris talks
Bard's and then outside of here I'm just
gonna print orbs so this is all taking
place inside of my function what I want
to show you guys is that you reference
the named the name value that you passed
in by just using it the same way that we
reference stuff within a dictionary
because that's all it is is a dictionary
so you can see that when we print
everything off after this stuff is
executed it changed the name of Chris
Hawkes because it ran into the name
Chris Hawkes and it changed it to Billy
Bob so if I actually put a breakpoint
there you can see if I highlight over
kwargs you can see name equals chris
hawks height equals 6 1 and because
kwargs name equals chris hawks it went
ahead and reassigned it to Billy Bob so
we look over here you can see it's now
Billy Bob anyway that is the keyword
arguments parameter and and Python the
reason why that is something that you
would need to use is because you can
pass in like I said any number of
arguments in most cases you're gonna say
if keyword arguments equals Chris like
you're gonna do something do something
special here you're probably not gonna
you're probably not going to reset
something but this might be like you
know what okay and because we passed a
name
we're gonna do this or something like
that so keyword arguments once again
it's just simply a dictionary this
convention of two stars for your keyword
arguments is is somewhat special and
it's a special little character and
somewhat confusing I must admit but
hopefully I did a decent job explaining
this concept and thank you guys for
watching you have a good day bye hey
guys so a lot of you asked me how do I
get my foot in the door to become a
programmer and I just want to take a
moment to mention Deb Mountain coding
bootcamp is a 12-week intensive course
that focuses on the technologies of the
here-and-now for web development some of
the things that they're actually
teaching in the Suevi course it's geared
to get you into the industry by focusing
on things like jQuery nodejs react
angular how to use github so a lot of
the things that you're going to need to
do as a developer as soon as you start
they're going to be teaching you in this
and this coding bootcamp and the entire
goal is to be able to get you into the
industry within 12 weeks so if you guys
are interested in learning more
information about Deb mountain coding
bootcamp just check out the link in the
description tab of this video thank you
for watching and have a good day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
