what I'm going to be doing is trying to
build a website with meteor Jas and case
you haven't heard of meteor Jas is a
popular JavaScript full stack framework
that's built on top of the node engine
which is really just seeing C++ code
with a JavaScript API they used to
actually code in it so the benefits of
using something like meteor or node in
general or any sort of web framework
that uses node is that it's all
JavaScript so javascript is the language
of the web runs in the browser you can
write JavaScript code that runs in the
server and it also runs in the browser
so it prevents you from having to switch
between like Python or C sharp and
JavaScript because no matter what sort
of web development you do you have to
use JavaScript you need CSS and you need
HTML so having something like meteor
which uses no it is actually very
helpful and it's one of the reasons why
I want to play with this now so meteor
promised to be like the the best
solution for modern web apps and stuff
like that it's supposed to to replace
Django and all that stuff
but none of that is really true and you
can just call and call it what it is and
it's just hype so reactors are not react
but meteor has been around for several
several years now just recently there
was a popular article on hacker news of
what went wrong with meteor meteor
despite some opinion it's not you know
the the solution to solve all your
problems like it was once advertised as
but it's still a very healthy project
and I don't think you can do any wrong
with using something like meteor
especially if you're interested in using
nodejs one of the limitations you're
going to find pretty quickly is that
really meteor is built for the MongoDB
no sequel database if you're a
traditional sequel guy with like my
sequel or Postgres you're probably not
going to want to use meteor at least it
was that way just as of a few months ago
that may have changed I don't know but
in this particular case I don't actually
have any sort of preference of using a
sequel database I have no problem just
using Mongo so on github here you can
see that meteor is a free open source
project is MIT license which makes it
free to adapt
to add and to contribute to and
everything meteor has a pretty popular
codebase and developers and a lot of the
project itself actually did get venture
capital funding quite a few times now
because it did have it had this promise
that it was going to change the way we
all write code and everything and the
fact that it's an all JavaScript
approach and that he uses a no sequel
database by default and all this other
stuff had a lot of venture capitalists
very interested in the project so they
put a lot of money behind it a lot of
people were like well with all this
money whereas media are going to make
its money back well they try to make it
under like things like this galas galaxy
subscription where you try to host your
website with them and stuff like that
none of that interests me either I
actually host my websites with one node
but you can you can host your websites
wherever you want I think one node and
digitalocean are the two best companies
out there when it comes to small indie
developers or small businesses where you
know they can just host a website
without costing an arm and a leg so
anyway that's pretty much enough of what
meteor is all about and in the following
videos we're just going to go through
and just try to get everything installed
and I will give you forewarning I am NOT
a meteor expert at all in fact this is
gonna be my first go-around but I am a
programmer and I've been doing
javascript for quite some time and I
write professional code in both c-sharp
and Python so I do have a pretty strong
programming background I'm still a newb
when it comes to meteor and I'm not the
smartest guy in the room so I'll
probably make mistakes along this
tutorial series but I figure this series
is good for anybody that might want to
try to fumble their way through the
application similar to what I would
would do here and the end goal is that
we're gonna get something working and
and we will get there so anyway thanks
for watching and please subscribe bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
