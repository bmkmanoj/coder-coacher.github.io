tutorial for hipster code comm and we're
gonna be learning how to program and
rust for any other tutorials that you're
interested in just check out hipster
code
first things first so we need to go
ahead and install rust on our machine
and whenever you're dealing with a new
programming language you need to figure
out whether or not it even works on your
operating system well good thing with
rust though as it actually does work
with Windows and Linux with Windows
let's go ahead and just use a google
search and we'll say rust download and
hopefully Google will know what what
we're talking about here alright and
it's gonna be this downloads the rust
programming language and just pick the
MSI installer for your operating system
so we're just gonna go with the GNU ABI
version and I have a 64-bit machine so
I'll select that and while this installs
so I'm gonna go ahead and just pause the
video alright so I'm just gonna click
install
all right so now this is finally
finished I saw after this installs rush
should actually be added to your command
line so if I go to the command prompt
and I say command prompt admin and
windows I change this font here so it's
bigger
all right so hopefully you guys can see
that little bit better but I should be
able to type Russy and it should pull up
information about Russ so that way it's
added to your environment variables if
it's not added to your environment
variables and you're running that and
Russ can't be found you need to look at
how to add Russ to your environment
variable and I actually have a I have a
video on that if you just type Chris
Rock's environment variables this first
one that pops up here that it's just a
two-minute video but it shows you how to
add it to your your path and that
actually trips people up sometimes
alright the next thing you guys do need
to do whenever you're writing code is
you need to have an editor to write your
code into I recommend Adam because it's
just less hassle to deal with this it's
just a simple text editor so it's not
going to do as much as like a visual
studio but it's also less headache and
trying to figure out how everything
works I mean you just write your code
into it you save files and that's
essentially it so just download this
installer for Windows if you don't have
that already it's completely free it's
open source and just it's gonna be good
once you have it installed open it up
and you should have a blank screen like
this if you press ctrl shift P it's
gonna open up your package manager and
just type rust inside here actually that
didn't work at all you know instead of
go to packages go to go to settings view
and say manage packages and then on the
left hand side over here go to install
and then inside here what we want to do
is type rust
and it's actually searching across the
internet for rust matches and we're
gonna use this rust language support and
Adam it has 52 thousand downloads
compared to the 3,000 for this project
listed above it so I'm just gonna go
with the more trusted more downloaded
version now what this is gonna do is
actually allow syntax highlighting so if
you as you start writing rust code like
the colors will change depending on
variable names and stuff like that so
it's not gonna be a ton of support
shouldn't be a ton of overhead either
for Adam now that we've done and we're
done with that we can just X out the
settings file let's go ahead and make a
directory where our project is gonna sit
so I'm gonna open up my file Explorer in
Windows I'm gonna put all the code
related to this tutorial series inside
my projects folder and then inside my
projects folder I have a hipster code
folder and we're gonna create a new
directory in here that we're gonna call
rust okay so now that we've done that
let's go ahead and open that folder by
saying open folder and Adam and I know
that unfortunately some of the fonts on
the menu and everything is hard to see
there's really not much I can do about
that with Adam at least not that I'm
aware of anyway so let's go to the new
projects directory where we just created
the rust folder inside hipster code and
I'm just gonna say select folder and now
all the files associated with this
project within Adam are gonna be on the
left hand side and all you see is just
one folder that says rust the folder we
created and there's nothing in it so we
need to go ahead and add our first file
and we're going to call this
the filename will call hipster code dot
RS now anytime you're writing a truss
file the type of code goes into files
with an extension of dot RS so like CSS
is dot CSS python is dot py rust is dot
RS so let's read and create this new
file that we're gonna call hipster code
RS and now we're just going to simply
create a small function which is our
function main the start of the program
and then we'll say print line hello
hipster code now if you notice that
there's some different syntax
highlighting going on and that's because
of the plugin that we've installed so
this is just say although you can see
it's got some jacked-up NISS going on
though in fact instead of single quotes
there should be double quotes my bad
there our syntax isn't all screwed up
now all right so now that we have this
hipster code RS file let's go to a
command prompt the same command prompt
we were at before and I need to CD into
the directory
it's a project's hipster code rust and
now I need to go ahead and compile that
file so I'm going to say rough C and
then just the name of the file that
needs to be compiled so hipster code got
RS now just to let you know how Russ
works rust is a compiled language so it
is going to create an executable file
from your rust code and it just it just
works it's gonna be fast so the
compilation time is gonna be a little
bit slower it feels like compared to
something like Python but it's not a
dynamically interpreted language it is a
compiled language so once you have the
executable it's actually extremely fast
so you can have a ton of code and then
Russ compiles it in this perfect
executable and you can run the
executable anywhere on your Windows
machine and it's going to be
lightning-fast so you know don't think
just because of the compilation time
that it's slow it's really not
so now what just happened we need to go
ahead and look and if we look and we can
see in our editor and also in the
directory if we do adder command to view
everything in the directory you can see
that we now have the hipster code exe
file which is a Windows executable file
so if I just ran hipster code you can
see that it prints out hello hipster
code so we actually created our first
program in rust we compiled it into an
executable and then we ran the
executable just like we do with any
other executable file in the Windows
environment alright guys so that's where
we're gonna leave off the first video of
this learning rust tutorial series and
if you guys liked the content please
subscribe it actually it helps me out
anytime somebody subscribes it also lets
me know that I'm not doing this stuff in
vain and also if you would vote it up I
appreciate that if you guys if you guys
have any questions feel free to leave a
comment in the description I'll try to
get back to you and I do appreciate all
the support have a good day bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
