be doing some nodejs
so first things first let's go to no js'
org and just click the install button
I'm gonna be doing this tutorial on
Windows hopefully you guys have Windows
Linux should be similar but we're gonna
go ahead and just go through the install
process here accept the license terms on
your life away
and
install this joint
all right that's it we've installed
nodejs all right so I plan on using
Visual Studio for my editor as I'm
building this website and I'm using
Visual Studio 2013 so I want to download
this nodejs tools for Visual Studio
which is a good plugin and you can find
it at no js' tools CodePlex comm and
this is only a step if you're using
Visual Studio so you do not need to do
this if you don't want to use that
editor hopefully know what an editor is
if not it's just a place where you store
your files and a program that helps you
write your code files and manage the
structure and things of your files so
I'm gonna go and update or install this
all right so you guys can use whatever
editor you want I use Visual Studio 2013
so I have that pulled up here I'm gonna
create a new project would that plug-in
that works with Visual Studio makes
things a little bit easier for me
because I can just go over here to
JavaScript projects and then you have
the options here of using you know
different node.js applications Express
is a framework almost like Django type
of framework is a you know Python
framework for the web
the nodejs is not a framework so there
are frameworks built on top of node.js
almost like Django or Ruby on Rails
things like that Express is one of those
and we're not going to jump right into
Express I'm just going to go with the
blank nodejs some web application and
I'm gonna call this thing our history I
don't really know what type of app I'm
gonna make I'm thinking it's gonna be
something to do with like some sort of
historical type app but not 100% sure at
this point and this is really just a
learning experience but just wanting to
go ahead and show you a few things so
you see that the first requirement is
that requires HTTP this gives a port
number and let's go ahead and just run
this because this is going to work right
out of the box if you're on Windows you
have to allow access
and you can see hello world and that's
all it took for nodejs to be able to
print hello world to the screen so
essentially it's a server everything is
all included that you need right here
all right the variable HTTP it basically
says use HTTP protocol nodejs were
supports different types of protocols so
if we wanted to have like Secure Sockets
Layer x' we could use HTTP but by
default it's this projects just HTTP the
next line here is port what this
statement means is that it says use the
port number which is located in this
this variable here or in the environment
port and if nothing is set there if it's
null then you're going to use 1337 so
since we don't have anything there we're
actually on port 1337 that's the wrong
sorry anyway so we're actually listening
on port 1337 alright now here's where we
actually create our server HTTP dot
create server and there's a request and
response argument that is passed in now
in this particular case the right head
this determines what type of content to
display so the content type in this case
it's text plane so if you put HTML in
here it's not going to actually show as
HTML it's just going to show is a static
text so I'll show you that and you can
see the outcome is not the HTML that
we're looking for so if we actually
change that over to 8 the HTML we can
say text HTML and then now when we run
it
you can see that an h2 is actually
displayed and you can see that it's
assigning it the server to listen on the
port that we had created up here so
that's all it is that's all that's all
that's needed to actually get a basic
node.js application up and running now
in this I'm gonna go ahead and cut this
video off since we've already set up the
nodejs
tutorial in the next video we're gonna
get into some more stuff</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
