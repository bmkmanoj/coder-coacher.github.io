hey guys what's up welcome back to the
Django website series how to build a
Jenga website and I want to go back to
what we did in the last video where we
had media queries which could actually
turn on and off certain visibility like
far so we can actually display our
mobile now versus our standard desktop
navigation and that's all well and fine
except for the fact that we used the
media query inside of the CSS file for
main dot CSS and that can really start
to gum things up if if you start to have
a huge CSS file so what I propose is to
actually add a new a new CSS file here
and we're just going to call this mobile
dot CSS and inside mobile dot CSS we're
just going to take that same logic that
we had in our regular CSS for the
navigation in the last video I'm going
to cut that out of here and delete this
from that CSS file and then just put the
code itself inside mobile dot CSS now in
the base tml page this is where we're
going to detect the media query and then
serve up the right CSS file now every
web page the idea is that every mobile
web page is going to still use main dot
CSS styles but what mobile does is
actually overrides main dot CSS when we
have to change certain things to be from
you know a certain specific width to
like a hundred percent whipped and you
know make them more fluid so it still
uses that inheritance style thing so
anyway that'll make more sense as we
move along but we're saving relation
relation stylesheet type text CSS
and this is where we're going to put our
media in here so we'll say screen and
we'll say min with one pixel and Max
with 600 pixels and then we're going to
have our hrf which is going to point to
the it's going to use the static URL
that we've been using before and let me
scroll over so you guys can actually see
this
okay so static URL and we'll say CSS
mobile dot CSS so that should work
so I'm just looking it over right now
just to make sure that will work I
believe that will work just fine
my editor seems to be confused here but
besides that it should work just fine so
let's go ahead and them and upload what
we have here so we're going to upload
the templates and then also our CSS
files and if all goes well we should
have the same functionality except a
different way of approaching it and all
did not go well so let me see what's
going on here
so that should be the right leg I think
and so that can be found what's up with
that I guess my editor wasn't confused
it was me I'm missing a a quote there so
let me update that again
alright so here we have it's just it's a
different way of handling it but we have
the same functionality so now we can
have everything for our responsive CSS
tied to a mobile CSS style sheet that is
separated from the regular desktop
stylesheet all right and I'm just so
that we can keep each video on target
I'm going to end this video now with
with this particular example of how we
can handle our media queries inside of
the HTML page the base HTML alright guys
thanks for watching bye
the
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
