we're looking at is how to actually set
up a code repository in order to keep
track of all your code your changes
repositories are important anytime
you're dealing with more developers than
just yourself it's a way of being able
to keep track of all the changes in a
code base so that way if you end up
screwing something up you can revert
back those changes or at least you can
compare what your new screw-up is to
your old code that was working and
easier or having an easier time trying
to figure out what the problem is the
reason why bitbucket is an attractive
option over our github which is you know
obviously the number one repository
online is github is not free for private
code bases so if you want to set up
anything that's not public or
open-source which is pretty much any
sort of proprietary project you may want
to work on you're gonna have to pay like
seven bucks a month and I know seven
bucks a month isn't that much but come
on you can get Netflix for like you know
$8.99 or something like that so a lot of
people know $8.99 a month is a lot in
fact for me that's a lot so I don't want
pay $7.99 for a repository if I don't
have to so that's why bitbucket is good
and bit bug is actually really easy to
use now if you have Visual Studio the
Visual Studio is free you can download
that it's an editor I'm gonna use that
for this example if you're using a
different editor you can you you know
you don't have to probably figure out
how to do it on that editor but for this
particular video we're gonna be looking
at just how to do it with Visual Studio
and you could probably compare the
process with you know whatever sort of
editor you're using I mean really it's
not even really an editor is called an
integrated development environment
apparently there's a difference although
I think of both of them as the same
thing it's a program you write your code
and that's what I think of any editor
anyway so Visual Studio here what you
want to do when you create a project
we're gonna go ahead and just create
like a actually only have to create a
project my bad what we want to do is run
go to bitbucket you want to go ahead and
setup
your account and once you have your
account go ahead and log in so I'm a log
in this joint and you see I have a
project down here but you don't want to
disregard that so there's a couple of
options here if you're actually setting
up a development team you can have a
development team of up to five people
without having to pay for anything and
you can go over here to create team if
you want to but we're not gonna do that
in here and then you have your
repositories and that that's actually
where you're going to create your first
repository so we're going to create a
repository and you give it an owner here
which is going to be the name of your
user account and then we'll just go
ahead and we're gonna create this thing
called test this is a test of how you
set up this joint and then you can make
it a you know allowed only for private
and make it private you know by default
which like I said github will not allow
you to do you want the repository type
to be get and even just leave all this
other stuff just blank here and then you
just say create repository now once you
have it you go over to this clone option
here and just take the HTTP address part
of it and if we copy that if I go over
to visual studio under team Explorer I'm
gonna have an option over here click on
the little plug icon which says connect
to team projects and then under the
local git repository we're gonna click
on clone go ahead and paste in the get
URL that you would copy from bitbucket
and then select a folder down here of
where you want this thing to sit and
we're just gonna put this under C colon
projects directory I'm gonna make a new
folder called test and we're going to
delete that after or at least I'm going
to delete it after I'm done with this
and so I'm just doing this as an example
and now we can simply say clone and it
said the repository was cloned
successfully so if I click on test if I
double click on that now I can go in and
I can click on changes there's nothing
actually changed here but here's my
branches and stuff
so so what we need to do is when you go
ahead an add a file to this joint so
we're in the test here and here's under
the the master branch and we're gonna go
ahead and sync it all right that didn't
work don't worry about that let's go
over to actions here and say open and
file explorer and this will go ahead and
open up your project and here's where
we're just going to go ahead and create
a new file alright and another way of
this new file let's go ahead and see
when we sync it come on what's going on
here
all right so if I go back go to changes
okay here it is it's untracked files
here that actually bothers me I don't
know why it's not included changes but
go ahead and drag this folder into the
included changes here and now let's go
ahead and create a name so we'll say
this is our test and then now the commit
option will be unselected so we can go
ahead and commit that and now we're
going to click this sync button it's
going to take you to this unsink commits
where you're gonna see that there's
outgoing commits pending you can see my
name here and this is a test so if I go
ahead and push that it's successfully
pushed to master so if I go over to this
repository and I'm gonna refresh it and
now we're gonna look at the source and
you can see that the file that we just
added which is just an empty text file
is now in our repository okay now I
wanna go ahead and get rid of this
repository since um I think this will
allow as many repositories as you want
but either way I don't want this thing
around this was just an example for this
video so if you ever want to delete your
repository just go to the settings and
then say delete repository and then just
delete it alright guys so that is
actually how you set up a project in in
Visual Studio and using git so anyway
guys thanks for watching please
subscribe have a good night bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
