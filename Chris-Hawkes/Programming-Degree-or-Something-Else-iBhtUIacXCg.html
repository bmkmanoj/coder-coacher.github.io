from Rafael he says hello Chris I have
been trying to learn to code for about a
year now but things don't stick in my
mind I get bored really easily with
learning to code and I don't I just
don't enjoy being in front of a computer
all day long ever since I was eight
years old I wanted to be a biologist but
I always had a lot of interest in
technology and two months I'll have to
choose my degree and I really don't know
if I should follow my true passion or
get into informatik engineering and just
for the job promises I'll have
bioinformatics and I saw that if i
choose biology I'll to learn some job
and I'm kind of scared that if I get to
enjoy it then I'll be in the wrong
degree so any advice thank you in
advance so basically it sounds like you
know like his his his passion is to be a
biologist he doesn't want to be in front
of a computer all day long which I can
understand that because that is one of
the downsides to being a programmer that
you do spend a lot of time in your desk
in your office I learning staring at a
computer screen I mean I like to try to
take walks and everything because I've
honestly solved problems that I've been
dealing with you know based on either
just having a walk especially if I'm
trying to brainstorm like how I'm going
to go about solving some specific
problem or even how I'm going to
architect some new project I think
getting outside and interacting and
trying to get out there nature I think
helps a lot so so as far as I you know I
would definitely caution you by saying
that if that is your true passion like
then why do you want to be a programmer
like I mean I wouldn't do programming
just simply for the fact that there's a
lot of jobs in it right now or that it
pays a lot we've had these bubbles that
have bursted before like you know during
the dot-com bubble a lot of people say
that we're in a tech bubble now over
text salaries are just too high and
eventually that that bubble will burst
and I am we're going to start going back
down to reality where maybe you know a
programmer makes 70 or 80,000 a year
some like that but the thing is though
is you really can't be a programmer like
if you don't enjoy programming is so if
you don't have a lot of satisfaction and
the progress that you've made so far
then I would definitely suggest that you
lean more towards following your passion
and not just where the Mont money and
the jobs are and as far as whether or
not like it like say you do go and you
you make that decision like just even
having a four-year degree is enough to
get your foot in the door in a lot of
places a lot of companies out there you
know they have this like strict
requirement do you have to have a
bachelor's degree so if you went and had
some sort of like a biology degree for
instance and then you you said hey you
know I went for biology but I love being
you know programmer and I found my true
passion after college like a lot of
companies that have that degree
requirement would be like oh yeah
perfectly fine with that there are a few
i would say rare occurrences where like
an actual computer science degree is
necessary my dogs making a lot of noise
back there up so that is that is
something that i see i would say rarely
now a lot of places are like starting to
really lighten up on the whole degree
saying it seems like which is good but
um with with your particular case like I
think just even having any degrees it's
perfect so yeah definitely if you decide
to programming something for you down
the road then it's going to be much
easier for you to transition into a
programming job from a biology
background than it would be for you know
vice versa so you know if you didn't get
like a sort of biology degree and you
try to get in into that field without
that degree then it i'm pretty sure that
either you're not gonna be able to do
that so you know definitely I would lean
towards that biology debris and then do
programming later it's that something
that interests you and as far as like
feeling bad about like not wanting to
sit in front of the computer all day I
think that's probably a good thing
there's you know there's there's
definitely been times where I'm like man
I spend way too much of my weekend
looking at a computer screen or I spent
too much of my day but for that reason
like I said I try to get out at least an
hour a day to take a walk near and
launch even if I'm slammed finding the
time to be able to do that I think helps
my overall mood and everything and then
I really try to limit you know the
amount of time that I'm spending on the
weekends as well so when I was first
getting involved in this o like I spent
like almost my entire weekends and like
late Friday nights lights already nights
trying to do things but I feel like you
know I'm at a point where I probably
should relax a little bit but some
people may not feel like they're at that
spot so every to reach their own they're
my
eligible very all that stuff so people
will fly them what their balance should
be but I think your body and your mind
your you know your overall happiness is
going to kind of dictate how much time
you can spend looking at a computer
screen because for some people an hour a
day is too much and on other people you
know they can easily do it five six
eight hours ten hours a day it's still
not feel bad about it very similar to
how some people can play video games
like all day long and and that's to them
that's like a perfect way to unwind what
other people feel like they're wasting
the day or something so I guess speaking
in general generalities is something
that we should all be cautious though
because like when you hear somebody say
oh you know that you're going to ruin
your health like staring at a computer
screen for eight hours a day well you
know like to them they might feel that
way into other people they they won't
and and I've already said like it many
times there are jobs out there that will
literally ruin your house and everything
and programming could be bad on your
health temperature but once again
everybody is own everybody should have
their own gauge of how of what they're
tipping point is basically so you know
don't feel bad about not wanting to get
outside arts is not wanting to sit in
front of the computer and stay going
outside I just spent a lovely day
outside on if you guys can see the
sunshine in my window here but in
Virginia it was like a beautiful 75
degrees ended up going to my niece's
birthday party and just you know just a
beautiful day and it was nice getting
outside so even you know doing that and
then coming back in like I was thinking
I was there I want to do a video today
but like I just didn't really have much
and then I saw this comment so anyway
yeah get outside and enjoy yourself so
every now and then guys on and and don't
worry about what other people you know
say is like you know there is no black
and white issue when it comes to like
how much time you should spend learning
or how much time you should spend
outside or any of that stuff like
everybody is different so let but listen
to your own indicators are like if you
feel like you're unhappy because you're
spending too much time if I the computer
you're probably right and you probably
need to do something else just you know
for a little bit even if it's a you know
something temporary but all right guys
that's my advice today thanks for
watching thanks for subscribing you guys
have a good day
and take care hey guys so I just want to
take a moment to mention that this video
