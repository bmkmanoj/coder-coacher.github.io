is the second video of the Express redux
and react video tutorial series that's a
long title but I feel like I have to
include all three in order for people to
actually find this series because
nobody's gonna find it otherwise alright
so in the last video we went ahead and
we install react not react damn I'll be
installed Express and if we did all the
process of setting up our templates and
our CSS so if you guys are just starting
on this tutorial I'd recommend you back
up onto the last one before continuing
on so this video is gonna be a lot more
about the install stuff and we have this
directory where everything sits and
inside of our public we have this J's
folder I want to be able to open this up
because we're gonna need to do quite a
bit of installation inside of here and
first things first though we need in
order for to use modern react and redux
we have to have module loading which is
but it's by default it comes from like
the common j/s module loading but it's
about being able to break up your
javascript files and the multiple files
and then having something like web pack
be able to import them as you need them
and it's it's definitely a necessary
step and confusing to beginners but
definitely a necessary step that we have
to do so let's go ahead and CD into our
public folder and then go into the jas
folder and in here is where we're gonna
install the actual actually I won't even
matter
you know what I'm gonna back this up I
want to put everything inside the root
directory here so we're gonna create one
major app dot J's folder and we'll
actually put it inside we'll just put it
right in the root directory of the
public so I'm sorry we'll go right into
the public I'm thinking about this on
the fly and we're gonna say npm install
- ivenn save web pack so web pack will
allow us like I said to build a to
import modules and everything it should
just take a few minutes to install
well this thing's taking forever I'm
gonna pause it and then I'll continue
after it's done all right so that's
finally done installing this go ahead
and installed now I'm babel so we say
how i can have been save and then babel
all right now we need to install and I'm
gonna paste this in because I don't want
to mess it up and I'll let you guys see
it but we're saying - - and I'm gonna
put this as save I'm sorry
so NPM install - I haven't saved babel
CLI which is command line interface
Babel preset react so both of those have
to be installed
and for anybody that doesn't know Babel
is used to be able to take some of the
latest standards of JavaScript like
using ES 2015 things like they're brand
new like classes arrow functions
constants and a lot of other things like
promises these are all new features of
JavaScript that older browsers don't
support but what Babel allows you to do
is to code in modern-day JavaScript but
have it work on older browsers so you
don't have to worry about trying to make
it backwards compatible so it actually
does quite a bit for you in that regard
but it does make it a little bit harder
to initially set up all this stuff
because there's going to be an extra
compilation step or we're writing code
one way and then using babel and web
pack to compile it down to a different
version that actually gets loaded into
the browser so eventually this kind of
stuff will make sense but unfortunately
this is the modern day direction of the
you know the current JavaScript
ecosystem of developers and once again
this is a big install so I'm going to
pause it for a moment all right so
that's now installed so now I want to go
ahead and install actual react so we'll
say - I've been saved again we're going
to say react and then we're also going
to say react Dom and those are two
separate projects that's another thing
that react has done as of late is that
they broke out their Dom rendering
project into its own separate react Dom
project the reason for that is because
they also have another project which is
react native which allows you to write
react code in this component based
system that we're going to look at but
it allows it to work with a react native
project which is geared towards actual
native development for Android and iOS
phones
all right now finally we're gonna
install NPM install Ivan Ivan save and
then we're going to do redux and then
react redux and this is two separate
projects Redux can be used for different
applications not just react applications
and then react Redux simplifies the
process of bringing those two projects
together so that it makes it easier to
build a react and redux project
all right so that should end the video
that should be all the npm installs that
we need to do at the moment I may have
missed one and if I did it's just going
to be the same simple process that we
followed so far to npm install this
stuff and i know it's all confusing as
far as wire it's all needed but
hopefully that will all start coming
together as we start using it but trying
to explain it verbally i think is just
gonna lose people so if you guys can
just continue to follow along i think in
and the upcoming tutorials a lot of this
stuff will start to make sense as to
what we're doing with everything alright
guys thanks for watching please upvote
share and subscribe bye hey guys so a
lot of you asked me how do I get my foot
in the door to become a programmer and I
just want to take a moment to mention
dev Mountain coding boot camp is a
12-week intensive course that focuses on
the technologies of the here-and-now for
web development some of the things that
they're actually teaching in this
12-week course it's geared to get you
into the industry by focusing on things
like jQuery nodejs
react angular how to use github so a lot
of the things that you're going to need
to do as a developer as soon as you
start they're going to be teaching you
in this and this coding bootcamp and the
entire goal is to be able to get you
into the industry within 12 weeks so if
you guys are interested in learning more
information about dev Mountain coding
boot camp just check out the link in the
description tab of this video thank you
for watching and have a good day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
