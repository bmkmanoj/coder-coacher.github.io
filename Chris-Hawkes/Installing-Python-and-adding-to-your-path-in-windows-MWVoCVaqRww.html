guys we're gonna be looking at Python so
python is one of the most popular
programming languages out there it's not
the most powerful by any means but it
can do a whole lot of stuff from
websites to games to just server tasks
things like that so there's a lot of
different areas that you can use Python
with and it's one of the easiest
languages to start out learning so it's
it's always a good idea to be your first
language and one of the best things
about it is that you can pretty much
start coding right away without having
to do too much backburner stuff in this
video we're going to go through the
installation process with with Python
and one of the other notes that Python
is great at is it requires the indent
your code so you're gonna learn proper
coding syntax and styles when you do
your loops and things like that you'll
end up taking on to other languages
whether it's JavaScript or C sharp Java
or whatever it may be
Python is definitely a great language to
start off with so I'm gonna try to keep
things moving in this tutorial series
and also try to keep things as fresh as
as I possibly can because some of these
damn tutorial videos are very very
boring hopefully I can answer your
questions I have another Python tutorial
series and I'm hoping that this is going
to end up being kind of a replacement
but what I want to do is I kind of want
to jump into everyday tasks that you
would use Python for as opposed to going
through all this like what is a
string and what is a list and all stuff
I'm gonna try to just lump all that in
as we actually start building things
because I feel like that's the best way
to learn to actually see meaningful
programs being used so if you guys have
any questions feel free to leave a
comment I try to respond to all the
comments that are left and please
subscribe I appreciate that
alright so first things first we need to
go ahead and download Python and what
we're going to be using is Python 2 7
well there is a Python 3 series but
we're gonna go ahead and get acclimated
to Python 2 7 first to 7 is gonna be
around probably for another 5 to 10
years before it's completely deprecated
in the meantime though it is still
widely used so that's why we want to use
Python 2 7 before moving to Python 3 a
lot of libraries and things that you're
gonna need are still only written in
Python 2 7 or less but that is changing
quickly so pretty soon it will be all
Python 3.0 and and and beyond so let's
go ahead and just type in Python so I
gotta do and when you go to python that
work we're going to go ahead and
download so we go to downloads and i'm
running on windows it doesn't matter
what operating system you have but we
want to go ahead and grab the latest
python 2 7 so we can just say python
release 2 7 8 alright and go ahead and
download the Installer there is a 64-bit
version but once again it's another
problem where there's libraries not
available in the 64-bit version that
would be available in the 32-bit version
so we'll make sure you get that 32-bit
version i want to see actually on my
file I already have a Python installed
but this video is to show you guys I
don't stall this write Python d7 I'm not
sure which version of Python I have but
anyway we're gonna go ahead and install
for all users and it's gonna go to
python t7 so it's pretty much gonna
overwrite what i already have you can
see it's gonna replace my existing one I
might have teased 7 7 or something like
that but they're gonna be pretty much
identical so I don't mind overriding it
all right
and we're gonna go ahead and let this
thing install so all I need to do is
download and install this I
can't believe that is all there is to it
alright so um once that is done
installing we're gonna get a special
thanks to mark Hammond who is a hacker
from North Carolina that's been involved
in Python for a long time he wrote
Python he wrote dive into Python 3 I
believe anyway probably don't care about
that but let's go over to our command
prompt um we need to go and make sure
that we add Python to our our path so
that way windows knows whenever a Python
program is executed how it's supposed to
handle that because natively meaning
originally when Windows is first
installed it doesn't know what a Python
program is or how to run it or anything
so by us adding to the path that'll
change it so click on system go ahead
and click on system again go to advanced
system settings environment variables
then up here in the path we want to make
sure that I just click Edit and when you
have that in here make sure that there
is a C colon forward slash Python 27 and
then semicolon it's got to be a
semicolon between each statement in here
but you wanted to point to Python 2 7
and you want it to go to Python 2 7
forward slash scripts and that's it so
once you have that just click OK and
then ok and then ok again and let's go
ahead and can open up a command prompt
and if if everything's working well and
you install Python and you add it to
your path you should just be able to
type Python and you can see that it's
launching 2 7 8 so just by typing Python
it knows you know what the hell you're
talking about alright guys so that is
really it in this video this is just the
installation procedure of installing
python on windows and adding it to the
path for some reason should even me I
had problems doing that the first time
around I think I never came from like a
school that said hey do this step by
step or whatever so I remember being
like why the doesn't this work but
that is why you need to install it add
it to your path
and then Windows knows how to handle it
alright guys make sure you subscribe
thanks for watching and in the next
videos we're gonna start getting into
some stuff with Python alright talk to
y'all later bye so if this thing
does not work when typing Python inside
the command prompt then I should
probably check my path variables again
because they're probably up this
is good to know I'm well on my way to
becoming a badass programming
