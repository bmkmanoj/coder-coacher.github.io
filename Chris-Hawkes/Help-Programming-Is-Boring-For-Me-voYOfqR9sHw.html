from a guy named Emma here and he says
hey Chris I recently started seeing your
videos I'm a computer engineering major
and many times I feel like nothing
interests me in software any more I can
think of apps and software I want to
create but just coding doesn't interest
me anymore it all seems like a lifeless
algorithm now learn their technology
your idea needs to be implemented start
writing hack together existing api's
Google all the bugs implement better
algorithms to make the software faster
and keep up with technology it all feels
the same and hence boring for some
reason tips or advice so thanks for the
question and I'll be perfectly honest
with you I mean software engineering
isn't always great like yeah but I don't
know that they need any job really is
truly that awesome but here's the good
news for you though is that most well
maybe not most but a lot of programmers
that I've worked with and that I know of
they they don't necessarily enjoy
programming all that much either I mean
they they don't go home and try to study
the faster ways of discovering or how to
recursively do something better or you
know what I mean like they're not trying
to even hone in on their skills and a
lot of cases they you know if they're
doing c-sharp or something then they're
they're content being a c-sharp
developer they don't really want to
learn JavaScript or or Jason or jQuery
and all that stuff and assuming that
their job doesn't push them down that
path of making it a requirement and
they're ok would just essentially just
you know the status quo so I would say a
lot of programmers are probably in the
same boat you know they're not thrilled
by the problems and things that need to
be solved so it sounds to me like you
know maybe maybe you're well I think
what you're going through is normal
number one so if you're being pushed
really hard and you're working for a
company that is you know writing you're
working you to death and I could see
being burned out a lot of programmers do
get burned out because they start
working some crazy hours and they get
sold on one company's vision after
another and eventually they do burn out
like I mean people want to experience
life you need to get out
don't you want to go on vacations you
want to you know own things that make
you happier most of all you want to find
happiness and whether that's in like
family or you're doing something else
and then that's yeah then you know to
each their own everybody's got their own
path that they need to follow but with
programming and I said this in one of my
previous videos that it gives you the
opportunity to get your feet wet in all
kinds of different areas that you may
not normally be able to another job so
like say you wanted to be a zoologist
well obviously you have to go and study
to be a zoologist or you need to be a
veterinary veterinarian or whatever but
you know in programming you could be
working on a veterinary project you know
that is helping veterinarians you know
build some sort of vision or something
to help animals or and you know SPCA or
whatever it is you might be interested
in doing and and you can be doing that
one day and then maybe one day you want
to get into you know space and so
aerospace and design and stuff like that
so if you're if you're good enough you
can transition I would say in many cases
to do different things in different
industries so I you know depending on
what you're doing right now you know it
probably does suck so if all you're
doing is just some some basic API
lookups or unit happening into api's and
you know maybe it is boring but the
thing is is that it if I'm developing
though I never truly feel like it's like
really really really boring in fact I
would say that my days go by relatively
fast for the most part so you said that
you're an engineering major so I'm
assuming you don't actually have that
degree so you're probably spending a ton
of time studying to get that degree I
would imagine I didn't go to school for
a variety so I wouldn't know but I don't
know man I mean and another thing too is
I don't have the the actual stats in
front of me but I had read that a
majority of stem graduates which is like
you know engineering and and programming
that a majority of them at least in the
United States that have that stem degree
they don't even have a job in the stem
field so I would say a lot of people
they get into programming because they
think it's gonna be a lucrative market
and it doesn't agree with them and they
end up doing something else and maybe
that you know they work as you know a
sales manager somewhere or something for
some I mean it could be any like there
there's so many different possibilities
that you could end up you know with the
computer science where you might go into
insurance or banking or something so I
don't know man if programming is not
your thing I don't know that you've
given it enough time to make that
determination but I would say in some
sense like right now because I've I got
a question I want to make a video about
this but just briefly I'll touch upon it
somebody asked me if I was interested in
UX so like user experience design like
CSS and some of the latest web trends
and stuff like that and there was a time
where I was very interested in and that
was like the the thing that I was most
interested in so even though I was
running a Django back-end I was like
very in touch with a lot of the latest
web standards and where everything was
going and headed and that actually led
me down to be able to land my first job
because I didn't just get hired as a
c-sharp engineer like I mean I didn't
have the necessary experience to be able
to do that so I get brought in more as a
user interface kind of guy like a good
guy that was really good with JavaScript
HTML and CSS and eventually I quickly
Babel was able to adapt to being a
c-sharp engineer because I had done a
lot of Python and Perl and other other
stuff before that but so the thing was I
was very passionate about that and and
when I got asked that question I
realized wow like I have not visited
blogs discussing the latest UX trends in
quite some time and I don't really have
any interest why because all day long
I'm hacking away at it was back in
c-sharp coder I'm doing react or redox
or you know I'm doing not like it's
necessarily more complex or anything
because there's nothing wrong with web
design like web design itself like if
I'm doing WordPress themes and stuff
this seems like a terrible job for me
but the the actual you know style and
templates and you know making these
these you know these basically if you're
gonna be in UX like I see nothing wrong
with UX because you X Engineers make a
lot of money and they just they study
come human-computer interaction and they
understand you know what colors make
people feel a certain way and
position buttons and do you know and
that stuff takes a lot of talent and
it's very very important for every
website in every business and to be able
to drive transactions from start to
finish and things like that so UX plays
a huge key in that but it's funny
because if somebody were to ask me if
I'm if I'm passionate about it now I'm
really not so I might as well answer
that freaking question right now in this
video because I'm knocking out two in
one video but but the truth of the
matter is I like I don't have a whole
lot of passion to come home and start
reading Smashing Magazine value I
haven't read Smashing Magazine in
probably two years
number one the site also started going
down it started falling by the wayside
in my opinion like there was too many
guest appearances you know somebody
who's like started a blog and it's got
10,000 people a month now let me go
ahead and give my expertise on some
latest but the thing is I think
that stuff comes and goes man like right
now in my life I'm not really too
interested in that but if I get into you
know more website stuff more content
stuff in the future I might be more
interested in it but like right now you
know I want to build my music website at
movies website again one day and and I'm
kind of waiting for a key moment to jump
back in it but it hasn't arrived yet man
like between you know just working and
coming home and doing YouTube like I
don't have a desire to spend this
doesn't spend a lot of time on these
things so if you're kind of in the same
boat maybe where you're learning all
kinds different things that you need to
learn day in and day out all the kinds
of deadlines that are involved in going
to school because I mean I've obviously
gone to college myself and I I do have
an understanding of the deadlines in
fact that's what I hate the most is that
you know certain things have to be done
at you know this particular time usually
I go with online courses so I can wait
until the last minute to get stuff done
and it just I create extra stress on
myself
unfortunately because I'm traveling so
many things released that's the excuse I
give myself made maybe I'm just lazy but
um I don't know so the you know this is
where you're at right now you don't know
where you're gonna be a couple years
from now I would say stick to stick
through it because honestly even if you
can land this through this computer
engineering degree you can get into
other things assuming that this doesn't
work out for you because obviously the
majority of stem garage
in the United States can get into
something else and I don't know exactly
where you're from but I would say that
it's probably a similar situation for
you that you can find something
somewhere else
assuming you have that degree but if
you've come this far I wouldn't I
wouldn't close the door on it now now if
you were asking also what other stuff is
there for you well yeah I mean have you
looked into like you know maybe you know
something like the raspberry pie or
maybe you've been trying to you know get
into some basic robotics or something or
even game programming if you want to try
to transition because it looks like
you're doing a lot of web stuff so maybe
the web doesn't interest you so what
about gaming or like Unity engine I mean
there's also I mean what about making
money I mean there's may I mean they if
sometimes I think the possibility have
been able to make money doing some sort
of engineering job or you know some sort
of side project that I'm working on is
another motivating factor it's like if I
you know get good at this technology and
I put it all together just right you
know this thing has the potential to
make money now nothing has ever worked
for me and for most people they don't
ever you know have that kind of success
that you hear about online and in the
news and stuff like that but you know
that can be a motivating factor as well
so I don't know I mean I've had some
 jobs dude like I've talked about
I'm in this and this and this on this
channel before but I mean my jobs have
been you know HVAC so 150 degree attics
you know just slaving away and and that
wasn't even as really as bad I mean some
of the stuff that's even more degrading
and then that is like you know making
pizzas and you know stuff like that like
I I work for this one boss it was such a
prick I was also a young jerk myself but
it was just like dive of a pizza joint
and he was paying minimum wage but
trying to work his associates as hard as
he possibly could and we're all like
either fresh out of high school or you
know just graduated in my in my position
and um I don't know man I just I wasn't
putting up with it I only worked there
for a short time but I don't I guess it
gonna be worse is what what I'm trying
to say that it could definitely be worse
but don't work for somebody that
gonna burn you out though that's that's
for sure because it's tough when you
have to go into work and you have to
think and you're getting paid to think
and come up with creative solutions but
then you're not given enough time to be
able to actually or given the
environment to be able to you know be
creative so it could just be the
environment that you're in right now but
let me know man
I guess if you want to reach out to me
again just give me a few extra details
like where you're at right now how far
are you away from getting your degree
and let me say you're developing now so
who are you developing for alright man
thanks for watching and have a good day
guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
