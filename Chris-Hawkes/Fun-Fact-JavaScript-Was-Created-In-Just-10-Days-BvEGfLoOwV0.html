JavaScript was created in ten days by
Brendan Eich back in 1995 so it's kind
of amazing really if you think about it
because of all the work that's been
poured into the language itself in fact
when it first came out it was rather
lacking yeah there was no there was no
block scoping or anything like that it
was considered like dynamically
interpreted I guess it's considered
dynamically interpreted I think so
anyways but um you know a lot basically
when a Brendan Eich was asked whether
you know why he didn't add this feature
in that feature he pretty much responded
by saying there just wasn't enough time
I mean it's not like the language was
like properly thought out to the point
where like they were trying to you know
figure out all these edge cases and I
guess it's not that much different from
some of the other languages that we've
seen like in Python Python was started
by guido van rossum on a board holiday
weekend it was like an extended weekend
and and he was bored so he decided to go
ahead and build a a new C compiler which
ended up turning into the Python
programming language and here we are
going on almost 30 years and you know
it's now being used by companies and all
kinds of stuff so with JavaScript so
it's you know it's a similar case like
and when you compare that to something
like like C sharp like C sharp you know
they brought in a guy that was
responsible for turbo Pascal you know
this Anders Helzberg guy he was
considered a you know a you know I guess
a relative you know expert and
programming language design and
obviously had you know all the backing
of Microsoft of the money involved in
something like that in order to get a
language like that off the ground so
there was a lot of thought put into it
if you compare Python to Perl pearl used
to own Python I say that like not like
literally own the entity or anything
like that but I mean if you look at the
90s or even when I started programming
like Perl was still considered like a
you know like well depending on who you
ask like Perl was the faster version of
Python and Python
you know was this other language that
didn't really have the market share that
pearl had but pearl used to hold the web
together all through the 90s and into
the early 2000s in fact I think for the
longest time Amazon most of their code
was written in Perl and you know the
Perl was you know really popular
language you look at somebody like Larry
wall he was this quirky I don't know if
you'd call my fun-loving but basically
kind of a weird guy an interesting guy
more of an artistic kind of guy I would
think then you know a number crunching
programmer type me I'm more of like a
down-to-earth kind of program right I
don't really think that I'm any sort of
mathematical whiz in fact I know I'm not
I just I go through repetition and
determination and just sheer brute force
to to learn concepts and things like
that but um if you look at like a
language like like Perl with Larry wall
he you know he designed that language to
be relatively quirky from the be from
the get-go
the problem with Perl though is that
there wasn't a whole lot of forethought
put into like you know what the language
features were and probably the worst
offender that I know of all these
languages at least of the major
languages would be PHP I'm just you know
some of their built-in method names and
things like that it just you could just
tell it was just tacked on there was
really no thought put into it whatsoever
it was just like oh we need this feature
and it does this one particular
education let's call it this and you
know there may have been some sort of
committee involved in that but it
doesn't seem like it was very effective
that's for sure
so looking at like Python you know it
was it was the opposite of Perl and
Larry wall Guido van Rossum came for
more of a mathematical background he had
been a programmer for quite some time he
put a lot more I think you know
mathematical I guess perfection behind
the language and it's not like python is
a perfect language or anything like yeah
I mean there's a lot of deficiencies
that that Python has but it wasn't
really trying to solve all the problems
you know programming related problems
that we encounter day to day I would say
to begin with so it doesn't really
matter but
it's just it's just a funny thing how
like a simple weekend project turns into
something much larger I remember hearing
a long time ago when I first got into
development that eBay even my dog
rolling on the ground over there that
eBay
I met they give her a bath but eBay was
created in like a weekend by a couple of
developers and now it's a billion dollar
platform and I'm not sure how true that
is but I know that there have been
websites that have been made and you
know such a short you know period of
time obviously you know I mentioned
JavaScript being developed in just 10
days and now you know 20 years later the
aect my scripts 6.0 standards get
released and javascript is pretty much
everywhere in fact I have it is the top
one or two languages to learn in
2016-2017 so it's just kind of amazing
though that you know small little
contributions turned into such large
things even like when you don't really
think it's going to happen you know even
this channel for instance when I started
this channel I had it was almost it was
three and a half years ago and I didn't
think anybody would watch it you know
and and Here I am I'm getting ready to
surpass three million views and I guess
that's a drop in the bucket you see
people with like sixty million views on
just one video but no other way I think
it's a heck of an accomplishment because
I mean I passed 25,000 subscribers and
none of this stuff was ever planned I
mean it really wasn't it was just
something I started doing so now like I
mean I I don't think I would stop for
any reason I guess I you know I haven't
thought about it a ton but I don't see
any reason to stop I mean I like doing
this I like reaching out to you guys but
yeah that's just a fun fact of the day
that JavaScript was created and in 20
days or 20 yeah ten days I'm sorry
ten days all right guys talk to you
later man peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
