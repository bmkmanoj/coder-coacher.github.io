want to go ahead and revisit this last
component that we made it we want to
look at something that shows how does
data get passed into reacts so react is
going to reference data from within its
components in one of two ways one is
this state and we're going to get into
state in a different video and then the
other one is the props props is faster
than the state because props are
immutable immutable means you cannot
change them once you actually declare
them so react doesn't have to worry
about changing values and once again it
uses less computer resources when it
doesn't have to monitor every piece of
your data looking for any sort of
changes this dot props says hey I'm
never going to change I'm going to be
what it is so let's just say your mom is
the name of a property and we're going
to pass it a value called johnson rod
all right so your mom is named Johnson
rod and we passed it down under this
value called your mom so how do we
reference it from inside here well what
i could do is i just have to say inside
of curly braces in my return statement i
could say this props dot your mom the
name of the property so if we go ahead
and we compile it save it go ahead and
pull it up into her example you can see
johnson rod and once again this is going
to be the fastest way so if you have
data coming from your server you're
going to pass it into properties within
your react component in order to view
the data so this can be a little bit
more complicated as well this can be
something like let's pass in an array of
data so instead of this we're going to
use the curly braces here because
anything inside of if here is a is just
regular JavaScript so we're going to say
12
three so we're basically assigning your
mom an array value and you can see all
of it gets set one two three and just
get to output it so what we want to do
is let's just display the first one I
don't want to get into four loops and
this Intel a later video but you can see
that will just display the first value
of the JavaScript array that gets
assigned to your mom the thing that I
want you to keep in mind here in this
video is that everything that is passed
down is referenced through this dot
props this dot props you need to
remember is going to be the most
efficient way of passing data to your
component because it's immutable and it
doesn't change after it's been assigned
so you can add any sort of values that
you want here if I wanted to I can even
pass a JavaScript object where I can say
like I can get key value pairs so one
will just say the name travis or
something to anthony so instead of this
what we can do is we can pass in a key
will say one
you can see it's Travis
and since it's an object you can even
say through dot notation a lot of people
like dot notation they think it looks
cleaner and if i said to you can see we
get anthony so there's all kinds of
different ways but this is nothing
special or magic this is JavaScript
object being assigned to a property
called your mom which is referenced in
react by this stop props that your mom
now props can be very very very
complicated in fact you can pass entire
components and by the way this entire
section here would be a react component
you can pass a component to a property
you can pass a JavaScript object you can
pass an array a string and int or
whatever is you can pass it it can be an
entire novel if you wanted to pass it
probably won't be efficient but you can
do whatever you want you reference it
through this props it's faster than this
state and we're going to get into that
in the next video alright guys thanks
