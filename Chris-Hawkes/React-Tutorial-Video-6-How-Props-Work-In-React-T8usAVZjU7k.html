want to go ahead and revisit this last
component that we made and we want to
look at something that shows how does
data get passed and to react so react is
going to reference data from within its
components in one of two ways one is
this state and we're going to get into
state in a different video and then the
other one is the props props is faster
than the state because props are
immutable immutable means you cannot
change them once you actually declare
them so react doesn't have to worry
about changing values and once again it
uses less computer resources when it
doesn't have to monitor every piece of
your data looking for any sort of
changes and this dot props says hey I'm
never gonna change I'm gonna be what it
is so let's just say your mom is the
name of a property and we're going to
pass it a value called
Johnson rod alright so your mom is named
Johnson rod and we passed it down under
this value called your mom so how do we
reference implements out here well what
I could do is I just have to say inside
of curly braces in my return statement I
could say this props dot your mom the
name of the property so if we go ahead
and we compile it save it go ahead and
pull it up into her example you can see
Johnson rod and once again this is going
to be the fastest way so if you have
data coming from your server you're
going to pass it into properties within
your react component in order to view
the data so this can be a little bit
more complicated as well this can be
something like let's pass in an array of
data so instead of this we're going to
use the curly braces here because
anything inside of if here is a is just
regular JavaScript so we're going to say
one
three so we're basically assigning your
mom an array value and you can see all
of it gets set one two three and just
gets output it so what we want to do is
let's just display the first one I don't
want to get into four loops and this in
until a later video but you can see that
will just display the first value of the
JavaScript array that gets assigned to
your mom the thing that I want you to
keep in mind here in this video is that
everything that is passed down is
referenced through this and dot props
this dot props you need to remember is
going to be the most efficient way of
passing data to your component because
it's immutable and it doesn't change
after it's been assigned so you can add
any sort of values that you want here if
I wanted to I can even pass a JavaScript
object where I can say like I can get
key value pairs so one will just say the
name Travis or something to Anthony so
instead of this what we can do is we can
pass in a key we'll say one
you can see it's Travis
and since it's an object you can even
say through dot notation a lot of people
like documentation they think it looks
cleaner and if I said to you can see we
get Anthony so there's all kinds of
different ways but this is nothing
special or magic this is JavaScript
object being assigned to a property
called your mom which is referenced in
react by this dot props that your mom
now props can be very very very
complicated in fact you can pass entire
components and by the way this entire
section here would be a react component
you can pass a component to a property
you could pass the JavaScript object you
can pass an array a string and int or
whatever is you can pass it it can be an
entire novel if you wanted to pass it
probably won't be efficient but you can
do whatever you want you reference it
through this stop props it's faster than
this state and we're gonna get into that
in the next video
