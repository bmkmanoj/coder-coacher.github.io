we showed how to use a built-in feature
that basically says when I query the
database and the object doesn't exist
deliver a 404 you can see that we have a
page not found there is no 404 to
display which is better than our
application blowing up but it's not what
we want so we want to go ahead and add a
custom 404 page it's important for
websites to have a consistent 404 a lot
of like with uh I know some people try
to be cute with it for instance some
Bloomberg's redesign this is their 404
page it's an animated gif it says a 404
page not found and any time you try to
query a page that doesn't exist in
Bloomberg you're gonna get this little
you know cute animation that's pretty
cool and everything so we're not going
to do anything as is you know a
sophisticated in our site but we are
gonna have a consistent 404 now that
should be displayed instead of a page
not found which by the way this is a
debug error message that only exists in
Jango because we have our settings debug
mode turned on so if we went up to our
settings and we said debug equals true
that's why we're actually getting that
if we had false you would get nothing
but we're not we're not going to in fact
I'll just set it to false right now
and you can see we get nothing actually
it's because of our loud host we're not
gonna get into that in this video I'm
sorry never mind I'm not gonna get down
that road not yet anyway
just make sure that's true but the whole
point is that you get these helpful
error messages when you're in debug mode
and whenever you're developing you want
to get those helpful error messages so
you can figure out what you know what's
wrong with your app so here it is I'm we
have this 404 page not found so let's go
ahead and and fix that if we look at
Django's documentation actually talks
about this and it says that customizing
your error view so you could have you
know this custom 404 page not found
before we get into too much of the
specifics one thing I did what I
mentioned in the URLs file which is
creating some sort of confusion my
editor once again kind of messed me over
a little bit and it used the old way
which isn't the Django 1.9 way of
defining your URLs pattern you don't
need to use this tuple anymore or this
stuff so let's go ahead and get rid of
that now all it needs to be is an open
square brace and a closed square brace
because it's just a Python list of URLs
so URL patterns equals and just like
that so let's go ahead and do the same
thing instead of here
I don't even need that empty you were
all right there I was always kind of an
ugly bastard to be honest with you we
are missing one print to see there must
have thought so
okay let's go we only need one all right
so let's let's make sure this thing
still runs here one second
and since we made those changes I just
want to go ahead and just see if the app
still running right okay good all right
that's all fine all right so that makes
things a little bit easier to read I
think so one of the nice features in
Django 1.9 is that you used to have to
actually mess with your URL patterns in
order to be able to display a custom 404
error message but the way this thing is
supposed to work is in your root
template directory you should be able to
just put in a 404 page and then have it
referenced so let's go ahead and try to
do that now we're going to create an
HTML page and we'll just call it 404 it
needs to be titled 404 dot HTML though
in order for it to work and I want to
make use of the layout so let's go ahead
and and do that here
so this is our page not found
not nearly as cool as the Bloomberg one
but should be good enough
okay I mean I have to restart the server
now in order for this new template that
we just added to actually be able to
work your you have to actually get out
of debug mode which is what I just had
touched upon earlier and didn't want to
explain it at that time but I'm gonna
explain it now this 404 page is actually
a helpful debug message saying hey the
page is not found it's meant to be
helpful for you but it's not meant to
actually be served up to the customer so
we're in debug mode and typically when
you're debugging your app you want to
know when there's a 404 you don't want
the like helpful customer 404 page so if
we if we go ahead and we change and we
go to our settings dot PI file and we
change our debug mode to false we need
to go ahead and add a new feature in
Django 1.9 which is on something called
a loud host and it's going to be just a
an actual Python list of a loud host and
what that means is um actual domains
that you allow to run your application
outside of debug mode if you want to
allow any domain which is what we want
to do you're just gonna have one single
string which is star which means match
any domain so it could be example.com or
it could be new movies now it doesn't
matter where this thing is deployed it's
gonna run outside of debug mode because
we allowed the allowed host and - you
know this star to match everything so I
went ahead and I restarted the server
the new template should now work and you
can see that in a production environment
because we have debugger turned off this
404 HTML template is now being rendered
for all our four and what four of four
pages it's not as cool as the Bloomberg
one unfortunately but you can go ahead
and get an animated gif if you wanted to
and and get it you know looking like
this if that's what you absolutely
wanted to do alright guys thanks for
watching have a good night bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
