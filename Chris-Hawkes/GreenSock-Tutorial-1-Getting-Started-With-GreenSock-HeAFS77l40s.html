newest video tutorial series for hipster
koat.com and this video tutorial we're
going to be looking at green sock the
javascript library built for animations
animations in JavaScript or something
that are going to become more and more
popular as we start to see older
browsers being sunsetted you can see the
animations being done with green sock
here is actually quite a bit more
detailed than what you can normally do
with something like jQuery by itself so
green sock has become the emerging
animation library for javascript in
order to get started using this tutorial
what we need to do is have a text editor
so that we can go ahead and start
writing code and we need something to
help us write the code so I'm going to
be using atom which is a completely free
open source text editor it's not a
full-blown integrated development
environment and shouldn't get it
shouldn't get in our way as we start
writing code so I followed through with
the tutorial or with the install of the
atom editor so what I'm going to do is
say open folder and I want to point to
the folder where I'm going to put all
the files for the tutorial series and I
actually have them in my projects
directory inside hipster code and then I
have this green sock folder since we're
learning about the green sock library
once I select open you're going to see
on the left hand side that green sock
the the folder is there so now we can
start adding new folders and new files
and we're going to add a new folder
called js4 a JavaScript file and then we
also need to add a new file called
index.html and let's go ahead and create
our in our index page here so every
every HTML page should have the HTML
head and then we're gonna have our body
tag
then we'll close off the HTML tag so now
what I want to do is download jQuery and
put it in this folder so if you go to
jQuery com
then you can just click on download the
compress production version and that's
all we're going to need and you're gonna
want to take the downloaded file and put
it in our Jas folder that we just
created so if I go over to my downloads
over here I should be able to find the
jQuery folder here it is so I'm just
gonna cut that and I'll put it inside my
J's folder of our new project and I just
want to rename this and just call it
jQuery I don't need to know that it's
you know one point two or one two
whatever it doesn't matter so now you
can see that the jQuery folder or the
file is being found in the folder and we
want to go ahead and include that jQuery
file at the top so inside of our head
tag let's create a script tag and the
script tag is gonna have a source where
it's going to point to the jQuery file
so we'll say Jas jQuery Jas and then
close off the script tag and now inside
the the body let's go ahead and just put
a script tag down here and we're gonna
run some code that uses the jQuery
library so we'll say a document dot got
ready function and then just a hello
world or a hello green sock so this
document dot ready is actual jQuery code
what it does is says execute after the
entire page is loaded so if we pull up
our file we're green sock folder and
index page that we just created or
located and we just double-click on
index your computer should know to open
up the HTML file in a browser and you
can see that the hello green sock was
executed and it was done so after jQuery
loaded and everything so so that's good
that's what we want now we need to go
back over to our green sock library and
we're gonna say download GS ap and you
can actually download it the zip file or
you can point to the the CDN here which
is content
distribution network and if for this
case let's just go ahead and point to an
external file that's not gonna hurt
anything and this should be using the
latest and greatest with green sock make
sure you put it after the jQuery file up
here some so that way jQuery reloads
first and then green sock loads so what
we need to do in our HTML page now in
order to actually test a animation using
the green sock library we need to go
ahead and have an image so I'm just
going to go to the website here hipster
code comm and use this big main image
which is really large but it's not gonna
hurt anything for this demonstration
purposes but I want to locate the image
here so here's the image I can copy the
link address for that image and then
inside my body tag we're just gonna say
in a header green sock tutorial and then
in an image so a source I can go ahead
and paste the location to the file and
because I don't want it to be too big
I'm just gonna make it will say ID but
that's gonna be the idea so we'll say
test image and then a width will say 300
pixels and then height equals 200 and
really we don't need to do the pixel I'm
sorry I just say 300 and 200 so now if
we refresh this you can see we're still
doing the alert statement we probably
need to get rid of that but here's the
image so now it's nice and nice and
small and what we want to do is we
actually want to move the image so how
do we move the image using an animation
using green socks so let's go ahead and
get rid of this whole script down here
and what we want to do is actually don't
get rid of all of it just get rid of the
alert statement and inside the document
ready because we want to make sure that
everything is loaded including the green
sock library before we try to use it and
let's go ahead and use something called
tween light and then we'll say dot - and
then this is a function so we're passing
in arguments to
the you know to this tween light dot to
function and the first thing we need to
do is we need to actually give it an
element so and there's multiple ways of
grabbing an element and JavaScript but
jQuery makes it so much easier to grab
an element because it works the same way
in all browsers grabbing elements
doesn't work the same way naturally in
JavaScript so jQuery just makes it
easier for us so we're just gonna use
jQuery here to reference the test image
that I just brought in and that's gonna
be the first argument so this whole
thing is called a jQuery selector and
the pound sign signifies ID so we're
saying find this element so it's going
to return this entire image that's what
all this part does right here and
hopefully you guys can see so that
that's the first argument to this method
so in order to understand how to use all
the different features of the green sock
API we should go to the green sock
document you can see tween light to this
function that we're using it has the
first is the target that's why we use
the jQuery selector which is going to be
the object which is an element and then
duration is going to be an integer
number and then the last one is going to
be an actual javascript object that we
get that we pass in so you can see
duration is the number in seconds or
frames you know so basically it's the
delay or not to delay I'm sorry it's
just the number of seconds that the
animation runs so anyway let's go ahead
and run this here so we're just gonna
say two and then here this is where we
pass in the jQuery or not jQuery but the
JavaScript objects so the X everything
in any sort animation of x and y so Y
starts a you know top to bottom is the y
axis and the x is left-to-right access
so if we said X and we move it over like
a hundred it's going to take the image
and it's going to move it over quite a
bit so it's going to be a hundred pixels
from where it's at moved over to the
right hand side because it's going to
move from left to right
so now let's go ahead and if i refresh
the page you can see that the image is
now moving over to the right hand side
so that's pretty awesome alright guys so
that is the first video of the series
and getting started with the green sock
library to do animations and JavaScript
and once again it's a really cool
project hopefully you guys can subscribe
to this channel please vote it up please
share it if you would please check out
the hipster code hipster code comm
website in order to get more tutorials
on anything and programming video
similar to this and also a ton of
different stuff from Python to to Ruby
to whatever anyway guys thanks for
watching have a good day bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
