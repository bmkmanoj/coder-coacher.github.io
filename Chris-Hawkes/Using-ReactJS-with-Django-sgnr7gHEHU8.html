video what we're gonna talk about is
reacts and react is a new JavaScript
client-side framework which is developed
by the Facebook guys normally I'm a
Google fan but I've tried angular and
I've also given react a shot and so far
I really like react I'll pull it up here
and what the web seems to be headed
towards is having the entire webpage be
just a bunch of reusable components
standalone components that are all
wrapped together and don't have any sort
of reliance on anything else and that's
ultimately what Google is trying to do
with their polymer project they envision
a world where once again you can just
download a couple of different modules
and and they might be a module for like
like a photo viewer or like you could
have a module for a navigation similar
to what we see with the jQuery plugins
but there is some complication with the
jQuery plugins which these which react
in polymer trying to do away with like
typically with jQuery plugins or having
to build some initialization code you
have to kind of copy and paste big
chunks of HTML stuff like that so then
polymers trying to do away with that
polymer is not really ready for
production yet I mean Google says that
they're not there's also a big question
with angular 1.0 in angular 2.0
apparently 2.0 isn't going to be
anything like 1.0 and some of that is
still in the air right now but it has a
lot of the community concern with
whether or not they want to build a big
project and angular knowing that the
entire thing is going to be rewritten
from scratch and one of the speculations
as well is that angular is kind of
redoing the entire project because of
what react does really well react has
been used in by Facebook and their group
for several years now and they've had a
lot of time to try to iron out some of
the deficiencies with it one of the
things that I really like with react I
created a another video on trying to
integrate
angular with Django and angular you
don't have to use the routing but you
know typically people are using ng route
module to build the you know single page
app and then there's also this craze
where everybody seems to want to use
angular even though there really isn't a
point you know they're using angular for
crud applications with like a no js'
back in there's really not any reason
for that
for a lot of cases and my website that
I'm actually messing around with right
now and doesn't need any of that either
so the website in question is new movies
calm which is a django website and like
this particular functionality here is
actually all just custom rolled Jason
being returned from the back end and
then I'm using javascript to paginate
and everything that's besides the point
but react could make something like this
a little bit easier because I could have
the entire page or be one component you
know that makes a call to the backend
API that returns from Jason and you know
basically I can make this self-contained
if you looked at the source on this
particular page I mean this would be a
nightmare to debug I wrote this a couple
months ago I mean you see this nightmare
of data here that it's interpreting and
honestly you know I I would be able to
look at it and really realize myself
with it pretty quickly but the bottom
line is that you want to make these
things self-contained so that there's
not a bunch of not a bunch of stuff tied
to a particular set up and stuff like
that so it's the best way I can explain
it so that being said with reacting
Jiang one other thing with react that's
really good is that it handles the view
like it doesn't care what your models
look like and what you're back in looks
like or what your database looks like or
anything or whether or not you're using
Ruby on Rails or Django or node or ASP
it doesn't matter and that's really what
I like about it because a lot of people
say oh everything's going all JavaScript
but I kind of like the fact that I can
continue to have my Django back in my
Django authentication have Django handle
the initial page request and then have
else be rendered by reactor or have you
know Django templates render part of the
page and and then have you know react to
a lot of the back are there a lot of the
manipulation of the page on the client
side so there's no reason why you know
react can't be this awesome project cuz
really I mean I think it can be to get
started on what you would want to do is
you want to download react you're gonna
get a standalone JavaScript file so if
we look over at my editor here um this
is a new movie site so there's quite a
bit to it so I apologize for that but
you can see that in here I have react on
a s which is here so you're going to
just get a big react file
I don't have the minimized version I
want to keep it on minimize for
debugging purposes and then you also
have this Jazz X transform and this is
probably the biggest pain in the ass
when it comes to dealing with react at
the moment number one usually I use
Visual Studio for my editor but Visual
Studio doesn't have any support for JSX
because JSX is just the JavaScript
notation but it's used by react and it's
similar to XML kind of similar to like
example and WPF or even probably you
know the XML II using like Android
development so you know you build your
entire component and these XML style
syntax which is JSX and it just makes
things easier so I've been told and I'm
no react expert or anything I'm actually
just getting started with it all that
JSX is the way to go even though you can
do raw JavaScript most of the tutorials
and things out there are going to be for
the JSF syntax so it's probably best
just to bite the bullet and get JSX
working for you and then as we move into
the future you're gonna see more and
more editors supporting it so that being
said pycharm which is what i have pulled
up here doesn't support it at least not
my version the so what ends up happening
is the only thing i could get was this
sublime editor and i've never actually
used this i've heard a lot about it
looks really pretty and like the syntax
everything but I'm using this sublime
text version 3
and I followed these exact instructions
right here to downloads sublime
I'm notice I'm sorry I downloaded a
sublime text 3 and then I followed the
instructions on this package manager
while I had to do is pull up the console
and then paste this code in there and
then I followed these instructions here
to add react so now I use this sublime
text and any JavaScript file that gets
opened it's going to interpret it as
react and it actually has code
completion and syntax highlighting and
stuff like that so the bottom line is
it's kind of a bitch it's kind of a big
hoop to jump through and you're like why
do I do that but react is really cool I
think and I'm hoping that will pay off
so you can see down here it's JavaScript
JSX so as I get into the tutorial here
we'll be able to to look at that and
then I'll continue to do other Django
development inside of pycharm alright
guys so that is the main setup here so
let's look at the the base page that I
have and the base page actually is not
gonna be the base page it's gonna be I
have this um the modules called gossip I
kind of a bad name I don't even know I
didn't even give it much thought but
it's kind of this new interactive type
of thing that I'm trying to add to new
movies and it's really just in a
diagnostic phase right now new movies is
really just a playground for me it gets
some you know decent traffic and I
apologize to any visitors that go there
because I'm constantly changing it and
breaking things and leaving things in a
state of disarray but anyway that's not
the point it's really just a playground
for saying hey you know I can put
together websites or whatever and I kind
of just build on top of it I hope to one
day make it a lot better than it is one
no but anyway so you have react.js which
I'm bringing in to the head of the page
and then you have this JSX transformer
and that's part of what you're gonna
download from react and what that does
is when we're developing our JSX page it
actually gets compiled and turned into
native javascript cuz that's all it is
so you would not use this in a
production site what you would end up
doing is taking all of your JSX code you
run it through a compiler to get this
you know the the minified perfect
version of it in JavaScript and then you
would use that as your your page so the
jsx transformer once again is just
temporary to play around with so the
next thing I have here is you can see I
have a script where it says text JSX and
the reason why the J's X needs to be
there is because this is what's going to
tell the Jo sex transformer to take
anything in here and then turn it into
that native JavaScript that works with
react so a lot of hoops but once you're
and once you get that out of the way
then development should be pretty smooth
alright guys so let me go ahead and in
the next in the next segment here we're
going to go ahead and get into actually
developing inside of this JavaScript
page which is gonna be our JSX
alright guys so let's go ahead and I'm
in this sublime editor hopefully you got
all that figured out and squared away
let's go ahead and start messing around
here now everything in react is a
component so you have to it's and it all
just gets printed out as one particular
box so if I can explain that any better
here let me just give an example the
bottom line is a component is gonna be
like a present right and it's a
wrapped-up gift and inside of that
present can be an infinite number of you
know sub presence and and that president
could be you know like I said it could
be a video player it could be a photo
gallery it could be some sort of stock
market ticker or something like that but
that is essentially I've you know you
have to look at it but ultimately
there's gonna be you know one parent
rapper and that's going to be the first
object you create with react and what we
need is we need a div tag on our actual
HTML page which we're gonna see here
which is discussed about HTML we need an
ID that we can actually plant that net
present that module that
just explained into and that's what I
have here so I just have a simple div ID
gossip and I'll just zoom in so you guys
can see a little better so it's just a
simple div ID gossip that's all we good
all right so let's go ahead and create
our first component and we'll just call
it variable gossip and I'll call it box
since this is the main new present thing
that I was describing so we'll say react
create class and then we're gonna say
render function return' and then any
anything inside this return statement is
going to be the actual HTML it can be
HTML if you want it's a different form
of HTML since I'm JSX is just JavaScript
you're you're gonna write it in a
different way so like if I'm different
I'm gonna give it a div and we'll say
class instead of class normal like div
class its class name so you're using
attributes that JSX
and react understand and can turn it
into actual you know HTML when the
JavaScript compiles so we'll say div
class name we'll just say our test for
right now and then inside here we'll say
hello my my not really fans you guys
aren't my fans hello my viewers I wish I
had fans anyway so we're gonna go ahead
and close off that div and that's really
it now we need to actually and you're
gonna do this once for every component
and remember component is gonna be you
know it can be big it can be small but
ultimately a component is just one
wrapped up gift and you're gonna have to
then render that gift so you're always
gonna do this at least once in your
component react dot render probably
shouldn't be a space here and then we're
gonna go ahead and just say in this XML
syntax that I was telling you about with
with JSX you're gonna say gossip box
which is the name of the class that we
just
created and my editor wants to put that
in there for me which is pretty cool
I've never actually used this editor
before I really like it so far a
document dot get element by ID and if
you remember the element that we're
gonna be assigning this to was gossip is
the name of the ID that I showed you
guys in the template may not need a
semicolon there I'm not a hundred
percent sure but let's just go ahead and
just test what we have here yeah it
looks like the semicolon is not needed
so I'm not 100% familiar with the JSF
syntax but you definitely don't want the
semicolon there because it is throwing
an error so let me try that again
alright so you can see that there Jo sex
transformer which is the script that
we're not going to use in production
we're only using it right now because it
is for development purposes it takes
that JSX document and then it just turns
it into HTML so we can view and inspect
element and this was all done for us by
reacts when we look at their on the
element here you can see data react ID
our test bowl of law now you're probably
wondering what the big deal is because
there's really no big deal about that at
all anybody can do that with standard
HTML and all that stuff so it does a lot
more than that like if we went ahead and
we create a different class we'll just
say a variable gossip
most of the gossip list equals react
create class
render function return and here we'll
give it a div ID or whatever Dib will do
a class name again another test how's he
keep doing that on like that okay so we
close that off and instead of the gosset
box rendering I'm straight HTML here
what we can do is we can actually just
give it the gossip list that we just
created and then when we render it so
now we have like two items that comprise
of our component and we're just
rendering the one component you know it
all wrapped up as a parent because it's
you look at it from like a top-down
structure so this is almost like if
you're dealing with HTML there's like a
HTML document and this is just like you
know your header or something like that
but then it all just gets wrapped up and
delivered to whatever ID that you need
to assign it to so now when we run this
you can see gossip list is comprised of
this and then this is just saying return
gossip list and then this is saying
assign this entire thing over to this ID
so I'm going to the page and see how
there's another test you look at this
and it has our class name that we
assigned to it and then once more let's
go ahead and just copy something similar
to this so we'll copy this and
and then we'll change this we'll just
call this a gossip item
and then just for an example purpose
will say this sucks okay
and gasa bliss will then instead return
a gossip item and a gossip or another
sucks
okay if we look at the page looks like
we might have an error
okay and the reason why is it's actually
returning to items but it needs to
return one so we need to contain that
inside like a give one just say div last
name our container that way it's
returning one item with a couple of
children in it
so that is one caveat then is that you
have to have a parent so the return
should only be returning one item and it
can have you know one item with an
infinite number of children or whatever
like in this case it has two and
ultimately this is just returning the
one which is being assigned to this ID
so this is just a quick intro into how
to use react this isn't so much to do
with with Jango since react just kind of
handles the view so I mean I guess it is
somewhat to do with Django in the fact
that I showed you how I did it with
Django but react is not dependent on any
sort of back-end server side stack at
all so it's what I really like about it
it's number one thing to be honest with
you and I have a lot of work I need to
do in order to get better with react and
I plan on making some more tutorials as
I started learning more about it but
anyway there's are just a brief
introduction so I appreciate you guys
watching and thank you and please
