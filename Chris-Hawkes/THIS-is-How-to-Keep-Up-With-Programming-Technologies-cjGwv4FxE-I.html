from one of the viewers and he's asking
me like and I get this question a lot
and I've even talked about it to some
degree B lasted like you know how do you
you know not worry about missing the
technology buster and not worry about
you know keeping up to date and how do
you know you know what to keep
up-to-date for so basically is you know
he's asking like he's worried about not
knowing enough to know what he showed or
certain learn and thing is like what I
just said it's so confusing this is all
just bullcrap anyway like nobody knows
man
like you don't know what technology is
going to hit just like you don't know
what kind of lottery numbers out there
you can see things with potential one of
the most potential the language with the
most potential I think this year is
probably go line for sure that's it's
like a fantastic language that is
definitely growing a lot you've seen it
a huge uptick I think I'm like
monitoring it on TLV and github and
things like that so I don't know and
just you know they're just the cool
things that the going can do in fact
that's garbage collect it has built-in
concurrency support much greater than
some of the other languages anyway I'm
getting on a side tangent here but the
question is like how do you how do you
worry or be able to worry of maybe not
knowing what you should learn it and
answer my question is man just you know
spend your time I mean the answer is
just to watch like Kendrick Lamar videos
man check out humble one of the top
songs out right now now I'm just play
the reason why I say don't worry about
it is because like I guess what I'm
trying to say is like eight years into
this gig man like I'm not worried about
it like I'm really not like oh I will
keep my ear to the streets on some basic
stuff like you know hacker news I'll
look at github you got the basic you
know bread and some of those sites I
mean I somewhat dislike it the ones that
are just run by a few community
organizers that kind of control the
whole you know the whole situation over
there I think is sometimes why I don't
actually go over there but you know that
you can learn a lot from technology now
once you're in the gig obviously you get
a lot of stuff from co-workers and
things like that but in certain
positions that you're kind of
back today I am really I would say in
most software development positions like
they want software developers to be
passionate they want you to like be all
like passionate about the upcoming
technologies everything but there's not
like to me there's not a whole lot to be
passionate about about some of these
languages that are coming up that aren't
going to help me like make money or
build a product or even be able to
implement it in a larger corporation you
know it works and things like that so
for those reasons like you can't jump on
every single sort of hype train and for
those and it really that's why I don't
care like I guess I I don't care as much
as I used to I used to worry about I got
to get into this everybody else was
getting into it and there's no time for
that man remember CoffeeScript like
everybody was telling you policy script
was the future nobody talks about
CoffeeScript anymore everybody that
devoted their time to CoffeeScript if it
didn't help me do your product and make
money for you and things like that then
you know it's it's pretty much a waste
of time right CoffeeScript is not going
to replace typescript and it's not going
to replace just you know writing modern
JavaScript using a compiler like babbles
so yeah man don't don't worry about
trying to keep up sometimes and like
just it's like I said watch Kendrick
Lamar or just do something like the
other day I found myself watching like
an hour's worth of ship shipwreck
documentaries like on YouTube and like
just you know there's some so some like
actual real sinking ships like that's
kind of creepy like in the middle of the
ocean
that stuff's on YouTube and between that
and watching people bull riding and
getting completely effed up by the
bull's eye I was like man I just spent
like an hour or so just sitting there
watching this stuff and you know it's so
good man because you got to get away you
got to be able to recharge your
batteries get proper sleep you have
other haven't have another life out
there with such just programming that
that is definitely an important thing
that I'm learning more and more
especially eight years in but I did make
sacrifices along with a lot of you guys
out there as well and girls that have
devoted like a significant amount of
time to college or to to whatever it's
not like we're not all working hard
what we have but it is it is definitely
difficult man you got to be able to
relax man that's what I think so relax
every now and then and don't get
stressed out by the little things and
little things include oh man I might
miss this technology because if you're
just learning each day you're going to
be able to pick up some new technology
over another technology fairly quickly a
lot of the same information that you
learn in the way that you process the
information just carries over to the
next technology that you use you know a
lot of the constructs of the language
itself water types and type coercion and
and it's like just basic programming
concepts like for each loops and or for
loops and you know that stuff's just
it's from one language to the next and
nobody is really reinventing anything at
the moment
go lying as I I think it's somewhat
different as far as a programming
language is concerned I mean but even
then it's not like it's like reinventing
how we program everything it's just
making certain programming tasks a
little bit easier than other languages
that are out there now so I don't know
man I'm just kind of rambling on but the
thing is like have we truly changed any
sort of like core technology that we're
using I suppose like in a sense that
have programming languages from C like
when she came out everything seems to be
Paige Sophos T or very C like it's like
but that was all the way back in the 70s
so we're looking at many decades now and
there really isn't a greater successor
or a greater programming language then
probably C I mean because C made all of
this stuff possible everything on
YouTube and everything we have was all
done through C in one way or another
clearly you know languages were built on
top of that you know Java scripting and
Python since that YouTube was using
Python for a while but even in a C++
like it you can't get away like C it's
still the job father of all programming
languages and maybe there's not a lot of
C development work and things like that
out there right now but we'll have to
wait and see and maybe things will
change if you guys get that pun anyway
all right you guys have a good night man
take care button hey guys so a lot of
you asked me how do I get my foot in the
door to becoming pro
I just want to take a moment to mention

12-week intensive course that focuses on
the technologies of the here-and-now for
web development some of the things that
they're actually teaching in the 12-week
course it's geared to get you into the
industry by focusing on things like
jQuery nodejs
react angular how to use github so a lot
of the things that you're going to need
to do as a developer as soon as you
start they're going to be teaching you
in this and this coding bootcamp and the
entire goal is to be able to get you
into the industry within 12 weeks so if
you guys are interested in learning more
information about dev Mountain coding
boot camp just check out the link in the
description tab of this video thank you
for watching and have a good day this
video is also brought to you by Edwin
exploding solutions make sure you guys
check out their latest two courses that
they have that are on full on full like
hat or not well it's a full-on
