so after we installed the windows binary
mono game installer will be noticed that
we have to we have to install some
dependencies I'm just looking at the
straight up documentation that's
available on github and some of the
dependencies are we have to have this I
think this is the junk already installed
install mono game and pretty sure this
is what we just installed let me check
actually doesn't look like we installed
this at all let's go ahead and click the
windows version then and
so there are three options i'm going to
go with the mono for windows should be
alright
this may be the same damn thing I just
installed on the last video but I just
want to make sure it's not gonna be a
big deal but just a confirm that we are
installing the right thing
it's taking a little bit of time here
apologize for the delay
hopefully nothing is already on port
8080 sure I can change it if it is
so one of the reasons why since we're
waiting on this install the mono game
platform is is gaining a lot of
attention lately just because the XNA
framework that was heavily supported by
microsoft is actually being disbanded in
2014 so unfortunately a lot of people
they spent a lot of time developing an
XNA and it's a pretty good framework
it's easy to work with with the.net
environment and visual studio so i mean
i had a lot of promising things a lot of
games were developed on that but you
know microsoft i guess they felt that
there was no long-term success recipe
there they decided to disband it which
is you know unfortunately it's that's
what sucks ass about some of these big
ass companies like you know Google comes
out with a new music player so I'm
supposed to drop everything I'm doing so
I can use your music player instead of
just using iTunes or something I mean
companies like you know Google they're
notorious for just dropping if it
doesn't have enough support so may I
guess I can understand that but at the
same time and say why should I invest my
time in your product if you're just
going to you know disband it when it's
not working out for you you know what I
mean and maybe even in the short term so
I don't I just think it's
really I mean there's probably a lot of
people that are pretty pissed off about
XNA game disbanded luckily i didn't
spend a ton of time doing it i have very
limited game and developing experience
in fact almost none so I'm somewhat I'm
doing some C sharp tutorials asp.net so
you know even dotnet like you know I
haven't been using dot net for years or
anything but plan on developing you know
hopefully some cool games and think it's
um almost like adventure type games is
really when I'm aiming for like almost
like the old school leaders who Larry
stuff like that I think that'd be pretty
awesome so I you know I don't I'm not
trying to create the next Call of Duty
or something like that I know my limit
but that's kind of where I'm hoping to
go with this so you know just a typical
2d platformer or some basic 3d stuff
it's a Minecraft type stuff or what I
would that be awesome anyway so I
alright so we installed that first
dependency let's go ahead and hit the
back button here actually alright so
here we go and then we got to go ahead
and open or use this open TK so let's
click on that install this dependency
down the rope and TK
shader 1.1 requires visual studio 2008
that kind of sucks I have 2010 it
hopefully it'll work with a 2010 there
might be some patch or something that I
can here's an extension so it
automatically detects the visual studio
i have installed so we're good there I
hopefully the shader thing will work now
let's go back to github and let's go and
install this monodevelop 2.8 plus says
number one the website for mounted
available mention that you need gtk if
you installed mono you will have gtk so
we did install mono i believe yeah if
you are installing the windows binary
confirm you have dot net 4.0 and the gtk
number for dotnet two-point 1210
mentioned here
right now so let's just go ahead and try
to install monodevelop
I will has both of the ships that we
need right there anyway so that's good
so comes of the source color that's
pretty cool
okay so obviously this exam RN or
whatever develops to do they created a
msi binary download that we can use to
just install on windows and that's what
I'm doing hopefully these requirements
are already met but if not there right
there for us after we install this thing
one of the things I mean obviously
William person to open up i'm going to
do a quick google search just i'm
curious to see what father's day oh yeah
so i'm looking to see what games have
been developed with XNA all right so
obviously we need the dependency that we
were just talking about let's go to this
channel back to this job
so I'm hit this gtk number assuming
you're using visual studio 2010 with a
dotnet four-point-oh framework
this thing's not going to take more than
a couple seconds to download
so here's some simple games for the iOS
and
you
goddamn I computers going so slow
I got like eight gig of ram on his bitch
and it's just going slow terabyte hard
drive all right let me see what the hell
was the name of that thing that we were
just trying to install the gtk jumper
now goddammit anything good
you
alright so we should be making some
progress here his videos taking a bit of
time in fact since we're approaching 15
minutes I don't like to have a videos
longer than 15 minutes I'm gonna kill it
installing X Armand studio and we're
going to pick up after and install this
is arman XMR and studio lovin i
pronounced outfit after you install it
may be up in the next video finish the
dependencies on on that alright
calculator
