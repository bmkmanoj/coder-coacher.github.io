video we're gonna do something really
important and that's how to create any
file in Python so what we're gonna want
to do is number one we're gonna want to
go ahead and create our file by saying
file equals open and then within these
parentheses we're gonna go ahead and put
a single quote then you want to do if
you're dealing with windows forward
slash and we'll create our our little
file in the same directory on our
training directory under my projects so
projects forward slash training or slash
our file and then we'll say dot txt and
then after you declare where the file is
going to be written to you want to do a
comma space and then inside another
single quote you're gonna want to do a W
which means go ahead and write the file
if that file already exists it's
actually gonna overwrite our file dot
txt so make sure you're not trying to
overwrite anything that you already have
in there because right says hey and even
if it's there go ahead and completely
overwrite it and create a new one if
it's not there just creates a you know a
new file so let's go ahead and we're
gonna write a string to our file so what
we do is we say since file is declared
right there we're gonna say file dot
write this is a string we are writing to
our file so it's go ahead and do that
and that's going to save it and then
we're gonna pull this up in our command
prompt which is right here
and let's go ahead and run this joint
and I still have it saved as list op py
so when we do that just go ahead and say
derp you can see that it now has our
file dot txt saved there alright guys so
let's go ahead and open the Windows
Explorer then to see the contents and
the text file so my windows explorer
here is open right to where we're saving
everything so here's our file dot txt
that we just created and wrote to and
when you click on you can see that it's
a simple text file and our string is
there which is pretty cool let's go back
to our program
and what we're gonna do is go ahead and
since we wrote to this file it's a good
practice to go ahead and just say file
dot close so we're I'm not gonna confuse
the program when we try to reopen it now
if we wanted to read the contents to our
command prompt we're gonna go ahead and
just create a new file say read the file
equals open and then do the same path
projects forward slash training forward
slash our file dot txt and this time you
don't do the right because then they
would overwrite everything and then just
say dot which is invoking a method which
is built into this read file so we're
gonna say read and then open and close
parentheses so this reads the entire
contents of the file into memory if you
have a very large file you probably
don't want to do that because it's gonna
consume a lot of resources maybe even
crash your computer if it's a huge file
but in this case it's one string so it's
no big deal and we'll say read file
let's print that out to the console open
this joint and run it and you can see
that I just printed that joint out so
that's that's good and that's about it
for reading and writing files on the
next tutorial let's go ahead and jump
right into grabbing an HTML web page all
right I'll see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
