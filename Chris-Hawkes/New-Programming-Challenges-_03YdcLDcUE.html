talking about robotics and the other day
I was thinking to myself if I ever
needed to have like some sort of like
surgery I would much rather have a robot
surgeon the reason why I even mentioned
that is because I saw this article the
other day about how a lot of surgeries
are nowadays being done with robotics
and I started thinking to myself like
what what type of programming languages
are involved in those types of robotics
and like how do you how would you even
enter into that field like the
programmers have to have medical doctor
they have to be medical doctors in order
to be able to write the code for some of
these robotic it's just equate the
surgical robots to the same thing as
self-driving cars and you know the
split-second decisions that these two
these systems have to make in order to
be able to save lives there's that whole
like morale thing with with with driving
you know do you swerve right and hit a
pack of kids or do you swerve left and
hit you know the pregnant lady and just
you know those those types of things
that have to be you always hear those
arguments nowadays with the self-driving
cars and to me like I feel like I would
much rather have robotic systems that
are programmed by computer scientists to
do a specific task and do it well
because it can be done cheaper and with
a much less chance of of a mistake than
an actual human like I don't want some
guy with you know with the jitters or
whatever because he's been drinking
alcohol all night last night you know
working on me so and with computer chips
you could create certain things like
this with spare parts like a Raspberry
Pi robotics developer studio that
Microsoft has is is a good way of
getting started with that there's other
programming languages as well like
Python is a very good choice so if you
wanted to get started with Python before
you even get into robotics you should
actually learn about the syntax in the
language first I have a tutorial series
here which is pretty popular that you
can get started with so I would from
here I would take Python and then
possibly transfer into something that's
more robotic space like probably the
most that one of the best ways to start
is going to be either with the Raspberry
Pi or the Arduino so you're probably
asking like what are the main
differences between the Arduino and the
Raspberry Pi and here's the Arduino
website so they look very similar they
both look like computer chips the main
difference is that the Arduino is a
micro
controller motherboard so it's really
just a motherboard whereas the Raspberry
Pi is more of a general-purpose computer
that has like the Linux operating system
already installed basically if you're
trying to build a basic robot that is
going to do some just like like a basic
task like I always wanted to build a
robot that was going to just like like
if you want to build the AI robot that's
going around and cleaning up stuff it's
basically behaving in a similar way it
hits a dead end and it just rotates
randomly and starts moving away the
Arduino would probably be a pretty good
option for that it's not saying that the
Raspberry Pi can't do that as well but
the Raspberry Pi is gonna be better for
something like if I ever wanted to build
a mechanical mount from my telescope
that automatically tracked the position
of planets and things like that then
you're going to need you know GPS
probably definitely some sort of
vertical and horizontal like sensory
system and things like that so there
would also need to be intense
calculations probably based on where you
are in the planet at the rotation of the
plan and things like that so a lot of
math involved and and for those types of
purposes the Raspberry Pi is going to be
much better because it has the ability
to have let you know more data crunching
and calculations as opposed to doing one
specific repetitive task over and over
again
so there's all kinds of free resources
to get started with your Arduino if you
go to Coursera you can actually sign up
here there's a course that's that's free
to enroll and it's gonna teach actually
how to get started with your Arduino
there's also kits that you can build
robots using Arduino and and that's also
a very easy fun way for children to get
involved in something like that so the
final recommendation on a good
programming language to learn for
robotics I would say that my favorite is
probably Python because it's the easiest
and it's going to come with the
Raspberry Pi second to that is probably
going to be c-sharp because of the
robotic studio in the Kinect and then I
would probably say C++ because that is
the language that's being used by
Arduino C C and C++ and that is not for
really I would say novices or beginner
programmer one of the things about
robotics is that a lot of the
programming is actually embedded into
the system itself so it could be using
like assembly language that's something
that a lot of robotic systems are going
to use
that's another thing that is even more
difficult in C++ assembly is going to be
programming ones in zero so it's all the
way down to that level where C++ is not
and then c-sharp c-sharp in like Python
are much easier than even C++ so yeah
definitely I would say start off small
and go from there another thing to about
the programming languages with robotics
is a lot of times the developers of the
computer chips and things like that are
actually developing their own
programming language instead of
instructions that the motherboard or
whatever it is the electronic device is
using so there's like a language a
proprietary language most likely by the
developer of the product that is is
being used for that product itself so
that makes it a little bit more
difficult to say ok one language rules
all over robotics so that's one of the
big reasons why there isn't like one
specific language that you could easily
point to and say oh that's the one you
have to learn to be into robotics I
would imagine some of those medical
devices that I was talking about earlier
in the video are probably using
languages that would that were built
specifically for that particular product
there's so many millions and maybe even
billions of dollars invested into some
of that equipment but that's just my
assumption anyway guys thanks for
watching have a good day bye so this
video was brought to you by a dead
mountain coding boot camp there are a
boot camp that is based out of Utah but
they're also in Texas in Arizona now and
they have very good reviews so make sure
you guys check them out the link is in
the description tab below they offer
courses in web development iOS
development UX or user experience design
Quality Assurance and just a few other
ones in fact they're even getting into
Salesforce as well now so they're
continuing to adapt their courses based
on what the market needs are and major
companies are hiring some of their
alumni so make sure you guys give them a
look they have great reviews and thanks
for watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
