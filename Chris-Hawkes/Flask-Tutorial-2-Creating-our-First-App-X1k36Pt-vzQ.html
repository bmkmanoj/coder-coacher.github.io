we need to do is we need to set up our
directory structure of where our
projects going to live I'm going to put
it in the projects directory of my C
Drive and you can see I already have a
folder created there so let's go ahead
and make the actual directory of this
things incident so we're going to say
make directory and we'll just call this
this is going to be like a movie site so
I'm just going to kind of go with the
typical feel that I have from other
tutorial technologies that I use so
we're going to kind of build a basic
movie website so we'll say make your
movie movie I'll just call a flask movie
that's good and go into that directory
now we need to use virtual environment
and that comes with Python 3.5 and it's
really important because we want to be
able to isolate our development
environment for each project that we're
working on so if you're using Windows
all you have to do is just say virtually
and V and then I give it the name env as
like an environment just that's what I
call my environment so this is going to
go through it's going to install some
basic things that your environment needs
which is like pip which is a common
installer that that we use to install
Python pip files and wheel files and
makes things a lot easier for us now
that this environment has been set up
for so we need to actually enter into it
so that's what we're going to do now not
even me to do that I'm going to go back
into that directory so we're going to go
into the environment directory that was
created for us know what I'm going to
make this editor just a little bit
bigger so you guys can see it alright so
we're inside the environment directory
there and now we need to go inside the
scripts directory and in here you're
going to notice that we have this
activate and that's actually what we
need to run in order to start our
environment and now you can see on the
left-hand side inside these parentheses
we have env which is the name of the
environment that we created so that lets
us know that anything any sort of Python
library that we need to use flask
included because really that's just a
Python library that's going to be put
inside inside that folder or inside of
this virtual environment so now that
being said make sure you have Python
installed so if we type Python you
should be able to see that Python went
ahead and it went into the Python editor
the Python interpreter I'm sorry so
we're going to run the install command
the pip install flask and this will
automatically detect the version of
flask that we should be using with our
Python installation
and right now it's being flagged by my
antivirus which is kind of annoying but
it'll go through in just a second
so now everything should be installed
correctly and that will be installed
just to that environment so that way
flask is not shared with any other
projects that you may have and to make
sure that's working let's go ahead and
pull up our Python interpreter and we're
going to try to import flask so we'll
say from flask
import and make sure it's a capital F
for the import and then say flask and if
you get no error message there that
means that it's actually working inside
of your virtual environment and if you
want to exit out of it press control-c
and enter and you'll exit alright let's
go ahead add some directories that we're
going to need that every project needs
and any sort of web application you have
you should always have a folder for your
templates and then you should have
another folder for your static content
and when I mean static content I mean
like CSS HTML CSS J's files and
JavaScript or image files so let's go
ahead and create those folders now we're
going to create a folder called static
and then we're going to create another
one called templates and now I want to
go into the static folder that we just
created and we're going to create make
their CSS maker maker j/s and then we're
going to do it again for images so if we
look we now have three folders here CSS
images in JavaScript
let's go back to the main project folder
and here we're going to go ahead and
create our first minimal flask
application just to make sure that
everything is working
so this is what we're going to need to
make use of our editor with Visual
Studio I can just open a website and
sometimes I find it easier to do this
but I can just grab flask movie and just
kind of open up the entire directory
Visual Studio also has the ability to be
able to set up a flask project if you
like it that way but the problem with
that sometimes is that it adds folder
structures and things for you that you
may not be familiar with and it doesn't
kind of follow along with this tutorial
series so that's why I'm going to just
simply edit the Python files inside of
the editor and then yeah I will just add
it inside the editor instead of creating
the Python project actually it's a
Visual Studio I'm going to go ahead and
have this be a project so this is
dependent just on what type of editor
you have so if you do not have Visual
Studio you don't have to have a setup
that looks like this my particular
editor is telling me when I create this
Python project that you know I have all
these uh these tools that are installed
I work Zook was something that flask is
built on top of so those are all
libraries of flask installed with its
markup like this Jinja - that all came
with it and everything so that's just
being helpful by telling me that it's
there but this flask movie here this is
the root directory of the project and
what I mean by root directory is that
like if I went over to my C Drive and
clicked on projects the flask movie here
this is the root directory so that shows
me that that's what I got here so if I
went ahead and just I added a new Python
file so you just need to add a new new
file no matter how you do it it doesn't
matter these two have the dot py
extension obviously for a Python file
and we're just going to call this uhm
app dot py
all right and now any flask application
you're going to have to have the actual
flask name imported so we're going to
say from flask import flash just like we
did with our interpreter earlier when we
tested the installation and now we're
going to say app equals flask and then
we need two underscores and then say
name and that gets passed in from the
command line when we started up now
we're going to create an app dot route
and now this
if you've ever done django before is
you're just defining a route so a
forward slash means we're directory so
it means this will be like the home page
and we can call that like index so you
can call this whatever you want but I'll
just call it index and we'll just say
return
hello flask
now we're going to say if name and this
has to be under two underscores on each
side of it equals and then once again
204 is main and we'll say app top run
now what this does is it says that if
this app name like app top UI is run
directly it's going to be assigned the
value main and it's saying if that is
the case so if you run that directly
from the command line the value will be
main and if it's main go ahead and run
the application now if you were to
import this application somewhere
typically the import code gets run but
main the name of the main gets changed
to whatever the imported app is called
so that therefore like if this was
imported like if another script imports
this file it says import app then it's
not going to equal main anymore the name
will be changed in this code will not
execute so this is only going to execute
from the command line if it's executed
directly that's what that means and it's
very confusing by the way I think for
newbies in Python so now in order to go
ahead and run this we need to pull up
our command prompt and we should be able
to say just Python app py and now by
default flask comes with a development
server so that we can test your
applications instead of having actually
deploy to an actual web server but it'll
host it on that localhost address with
the 5,000 port so if we actually went to
it the root directory is going to be
executed and you can see we defined our
root directory with this right here so
this is where we actually said root
directory fire this function and this
function just simply return the string
that said hello flask it's not even
returning HTML or anything like that so
if we inspected it you can see that this
isn't anything but just text
but if we wanted it to be HTML HTML we
could actually do that we get to say h1
I can even put like a inline style
inside here so I can say style equals
color red
so obviously I'd have to actually
because I it's a string that we're
returning I need to change that to a
single quote so it doesn't matter where
I could escape it either way it doesn't
matter but single quote might be a
little bit easier to visualize so if we
restart our server and we refresh this
you can see that it's actually HTML with
the inline Styles applied alright guys
so that's how we get up and running with
flask quickly so we're going to go ahead
and end this video here we'll get into
some more stuff in the next video
alright thanks for watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
