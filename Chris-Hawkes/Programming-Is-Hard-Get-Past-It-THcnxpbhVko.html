with you man
some people say have negative I
personally feel like I am a pessimist
but really I feel like I'm a realist
with a slight bit of pessimism but I'll
be the first to admit that you know I
can be construed as negative in fact I
might even be full-blown negative but
just in my own personal egotistical
asshole mind I feel like I'm just kind
of a realist like I said with a slight
bit of a dash of pessimism but here's
the thing so like this one dudes like
dude do you have any idea how to teach
people how to ask can you go this far
when you knew you were absolute beginner
man in Bulova I don't know how the eff
should I know what HTML s is you did
that anyway so he was mad because like
in the third core the third video of my
course my Python for absolute beginners
I ended up VI for the string
demonstration you know a lot of times
people like strings and and you know
they're like hey that you can build a
string and it says hello world and how
the world is a string but from my form I
like when I look back on my beginner
mind I used to put their boats and be
like Oh a string and not really
understand what a type is and what a
string is and like how a string could
actually be beneficial to me so for this
course like I was like okay you could
take a string and you can make an HTML
page I thought that was rather unique
because there's so many different
like-minded who are on the
internet that are trying to teach people
how to do this stuff that just kind of
glossed over that whole thing it's like
oh it's training hey blah blah maybe you
could use a string you know but I mean
truly when you're first beginning
program you don't know the type is you
don't know their string it and and
hopefully if you're doing Python web
development that you know what HTML is
really I mean because honestly if you're
doing web development dude you got to
start with HTML at least understand the
basics of that as well as CSS and then
probably JavaScript as well just a
little bit just even though you know how
it's used in the browser and then from
there you can then I think you know
expand into other programming
server-side languages like Python
c-sharp job or whatever but the thing is
is like I guess
the point I want to drill home here is
that clearly this guy is frustrated and
I've been there dude I have been there
like I was just frustrated the other
night actually last night when I was
looking at some pearl I was going to do
a video on how I was going to use pearl
to show somebody how easy it should be
to be able to log into a website and I
in build a session and things like that
but lo and behold pearl is a shitty
language and there's no documentation on
anything everything was written 20 plus
years ago Sipan is a complete nightmare
pearl is a terrible language there's no
future in pearl I don't see why anybody
wouldn't want to waste her time with it
but I'm sitting there last night at
eight years into this industry like how
the am I going to do this like how
am I going to understand this there is
no documentation none of this stuff
makes any sense it's all just part of
being a web developer not really deliver
what developer but its developer in
general like this stuff it's hard man
you have to get past the mental hurdles
that should give you nightmares like I
had maybe not nightmares so I literally
dreamt of code and I would actually have
a hard time getting to sleep the night
before because I couldn't solve a
programming problem and to me like I
feel like that is the status quo that's
the normal part of of being a programmer
now luckily for me I still have a hard
time walking away from my desk when I
can't figure something out but I'm
actually much more able to do that now
than I was in the past and for the most
part it doesn't even run in I don't even
run into a situation all that often now
or it's like you know I can't figure
something out whether you know if I
really sit down a lot of times now when
I do run into it like a mental hurdle
I'll just be like dude I'll just do it
later or I'm going to do it this other
way and I'll try to get back to that but
like I don't like pull my hair out
trying to figure things out as much
anymore but it does still occasionally
happen and like I said with the Perl
thing it wasn't like I was pulling my
hair out I basically spent about thirty
minutes to an hour of looking at
documentation and realizing the language
is terrible the documentation is even
worse and like there's just no future in
it so I I just didn't want to even waste
my time with it even though it's helping
somebody else so all that said man like
dude I went from being somebody who
didn't understand what a type was didn't
understand what a string was and even if
you wanted to argue on the lowest levels
of
of programming constructs and like how
languages are compiled and things like
that I still don't fully understand what
what types are now to build my own type
systems in a low-level you know see like
or even assembly level type of a
situation like I'm used to using Python
PHP never member ly PHP guy but I can do
any of those higher-level languages
Python PHP even C C++ whatever I've done
a little bit of it
but do I know the core concepts of
programming languages and things like
that no I don't and the thing is is like
nobody will and like you can spend time
trying to teach types and strings and
stuff like that and you're never going
to be able to do a very good job to a
complete beginner and then here's the
thing as well like that Python course
like it clearly it's gotten this guy
frustrated because he can't follow along
a video 3 which no no blame on him like
he died I feel like in his case so he
probably doesn't know enough about HTML
it maybe wasn't really trying to go down
that over out and then and I I don't I
don't know why he's also probably pretty
hot off the handle as well as far as you
know getting annoyed pretty easily
because I'm not really sure I ever liked
custom layout on their YouTube channel
about not being able to understand their
stuff but you know I certainly you know
I hate certain people uh-huh and I've
had some 8% evil and in the past was
like you smartass bastard like why are
you doing it this way why are you
complicating things but the stocks
another is like things are difficult man
and and you have to get past those
mental hurdles so I was there I was able
to get past them I make a lot of money
now as a developer man like I am set to
big house like new cars family kids I'll
be able to go to put them in through
college all that stuff dude all that
stuff is possible because I didn't give
up and I ended up you know persevering
over these mental hurdles that all of us
had to go through so what somebody said
it best when I was talking about the
five five ways to not make money as a
developer on that video they were like
well you know clearly you just have to
fire up an IDE and you have to learn how
to program and he's absolutely right
when he says that like if you truly want
to be a developer you have to be great
but the thing is is it's like it's
almost like that
21 Jump Street reference we're chat
Channing Tatum
who was talking to Jonah Hill's
character and he's talking about the
five rules or three rules of of going to
high score knees like number one be
awesome number two if anybody says he
punch them directly in the face things
like that but when he's talking about
the awesome that's kind of like when
you're talking about firing up an IDE
it's starting to be a badass program or
you're basically saying be awesome some
people aren't awesome like most people
aren't awesome so I would say everybody
is not awesome when it first comes to
learning how to program so it's simply
I've always said this man it's
perseverance it's dedication it's
getting kicked in the balls going to bed
at night not being able to solve
problems and having that home you
want to go to sleep getting up in the
morning and having a solution maybe it's
not an actual solution to solve the
problem that you had but it's an
alternative solution to say hey I don't
need to solve that problem
because I can do it this way instead
that's what being a programmer is all
about and if you can do that you're
going to make a lot of money in this
industry there's a lot of money to be
made there's a lot of opportunities so
don't get upset man you know try not to
and this is not just for this dude who
cussed me out on this video but it's for
everybody down the road man this is the
best advice I can give man get kicked in
the balls or in the you know if you
don't have balls get kicked in the jaw
whatever genitalia you got you get
kicked in that and you get back up
and ask for more and you'll be fine
alright guys thanks for watching have a
