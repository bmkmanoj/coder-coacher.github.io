just doing a quick run-through of some
things that you should avoid saying as a
programmer now some of this stuff is
really not that big of a deal and you
know so don't I guess you take it with a
grain of salt don't don't be like
freaking out because you say some of
these things and really you guys will
see the list it's nothing special but
here we go
so nothing at all do you'd be surprised
how often like we're in a conference or
a meeting or something like that you
have a bunch of senior devs on the line
and like a manager ally or somebody will
ask okay we need so-and-so to do this
like you know who's gonna step up and do
it dude I've seen a roomful of senior
developers making excess of a hundred
thousand a year and nobody speaks up so
one of the things I would say you want
to avoid saying is saying nothing at all
no no obviously if your slam busy
that you're not going to be taking on a
bunch of additional work you can't take
on work that you can't complete but like
if it's something small it's going to
take you five ten minutes to just
volunteer especially if it's a roomful
of people that are not volunteering
because I can assure you your your
managers and your leads and everything
else like they they understand who is
stepping up and who is not you know who
they can rely on and that stuff matters
man it matters at the end of the year
when you get bonuses and performance
reviews and all that stuff so I
definitely don't say nothing at all
don't be that guy or girl all right next
one it works on my machine so this one
is like a famous thing like developers
will have some working on their
machine like it's communicating with
some service and you know through
localhost and all this stuff and it
works fine and then they go and they
deployed somewhere and it doesn't work
or they try to share the codebase with
somebody else's machine it doesn't work
because of some config setting or they
their PC might not be in some sort of
config table or something there's all
kinds of reasons why ship would work on
your machine and not somebody else's or
not in production anybody that's been a
developer for a period of time knows all
about that next one is lying about
testing their changes man so many times
I've seen people like slamming some
at the last second and then like they
don't you know they'll tell everybody oh
yeah I've regression test you know tests
it's gonna work and everything well this
becomes even more of a problem I think
when you have complicated client-side
frameworks that are JavaScript files
that are bundled like
and I was working on a project one time
that the development bundle for the
JavaScript for the react Redux project
was like nine and a half Meg I mean it
was a humongous thing and like that
thing has to work like otherwise I all
hell is gonna break loose
so it's just so easy to regress and mess
things up you know over the slightest
changes it seems like it's much easier
these days with the you know with the
angular's and the reactant and aralia
and the views and everything of the
world so you know lying about testing
your changes don't don't do that you
know just that this is gonna bite you
though because it's not even like it's
intentional like you may not have
intentionally lied but there's gonna be
times where you're you slam something in
on a Friday afternoon and you didn't
test it as well as you should have and
you should own up to that
I mean so don't lie about saying oh I
tested it was working and now it's not
working you people that people
know that you just didn't test it you
know what I mean so like don't don't be
that person either I don't know how to
do that now this is actually something
that is borderline like okay it's
actually appropriate so even as a senior
developer if you haven't done something
especially if you've been in the gig for
ten years and you have not had to do a
task that you're being assigned with
it's perfectly acceptable to be like hey
you know I've never done that but don't
just leave it all I don't know how to do
that like oh I don't know how to do that
but all you know I'm gonna look into it
I'll figure out what needs to happen you
know and you'll make your best effort or
I'll reach out to someone so who might
be an expert like you have to be like
your manager or your lead should not be
telling you how to go about figuring
something out like our jobs especially
when you become a senior developer is to
really figure out stuff that you don't
know how to do and you have to do that
all the time so you know don't be that
that person like as I like once again
I've seen that person that's like oh I
don't know how to do that and then like
they just think it's acceptable that
they don't know how to do it and
that they're still gonna get a paycheck
like everybody else it's like no you
figure out how to do it you know it's
and I'm not hopefully I'm not coming off
arrogant or being a dick or whatever but
just like do we all have like a job to
do so if there's other developers you're
working with like everybody needs to be
holding their weight otherwise other
people end up getting you know the brunt
of that weight that they're not holding
so that's all I mean by that so I'm not
trying to be a dick
do you have a second to help me now this
one I kind of threw in there probably
shouldn't have but it's funny because
like somebody else a oh yeah just take
it I do you have a quick moment to solve
this complicated as bug that I've been
stuck on for three days no I don't
have a moment but I will help you but
you know it also depends on like if I'm
if it's a Friday afternoon and we have a
code release tomorrow and I have my
manager asking me to do something now
you need to go to somebody else and you
have to learn how to say no and things
like that to certain requests now if you
know that you can help somebody in five
seconds then you're just a dick if you
don't help them you know what I
mean but but like nothing ever takes
just a second between two senior
developers that are trying to figure out
something that might be difficult now
actually I take that back there is a lot
of times that senior devs will come to
me or I'll come to somebody else and I
just need another pair of eyes at it so
that's another thing another way of
approaching it's like nobody has a
second but they're probably going to be
willing to help you anyway especially if
you are the type that help them out so
I've always been the type to help people
out and I never turn anybody away I've
never turned anybody away that's asked
me for help I don't think I can't think
of a single occurrence now there's been
those times that I'm up against a
deadline where I'm like dude I will take
a look at I'm doing this one thing right
now but I just put it on the back burner
but like I've never like I said no you
got to figure out that on your own or
you got to talk to somebody else but
like nobody's got you know seconds and
minutes and then or hours really but you
know a lot of these things that really
do stumped people can really take you
know sometimes hours of debugging and
things like that and and you know the
whole second pair of eyes saying you
know that that is something that you
know we developers do so maybe you know
maybe this one shouldn't necessarily be
on the list but just at least know that
they're doing you a favor it's not like
they have extra time and they're just
twiddling their thumbs and you know
most people don't you know you're
probably taking time away from something
else that they could be doing that they
could be getting credit for and
everything so I'm just kind of keep that
in mind calling JavaScript Java
or a jscript or any of this other old
 that like he's either old names or
completely unequal name so yeah
obviously Java is an object-oriented
language in JavaScript is the language
that we use in the browser scripting
language so it's like they're not the
same thing it's so many people call Java
JavaScript it's just insulting
it really but I think that's just a lot
of older devs for you but but you'll run
into that I'm sure
let's abstract our abstracted
abstraction so like did so many times
like this one I probably shouldn't have
thrown in there as well but like there's
developers like that just love to
abstract to like the max like they
want this black box magic like you pass
in a letter and this just
does some crazy you know what I
mean like spinning up an entire MVC up
or something so you know obviously
there's there's reasons for why we would
want to do that and then there's reasons
why it's just not necessary a lot of
times when we're trying one more paid to
debug something it's better to not have
to dig into a black box full of magic
and it's much easier at least in my
opinion to go through some you know some
more verbose code where I can actually
step through it a little bit easier and
things like that but yeah like dude we
love to just abstract things out and
abstract an abstract and abstract and
we're going to continue to do that and
obviously there's reasons for that we're
not trying to reinvent the wheel and
everything and if we can prevent bugs
and things like that we're going to do
that as well but I've just seen I've
seen abstractions be created where they
just there just wasn't enough of a need
for it you know like if it's used in one
application react for a crud application
like if you're gonna do like a wordpress
blog you probably don't need react like
you're just wasting your own time and
effort probably when you go to have to
maintain that one day like like
especially when you get out of your
project for six months and go back in it
I can speak to that firsthand as well
because I use react through a Django
project one time and I left it for like
six months came back and I had no
 clue what was going on it took
me like three weeks to kind of analyze
everything and there was a lot of mess
going on with that project as well but
and this was also in my spare time so
it's not like I was like spending three
weeks straight it was just like oh you
know it's it's been two days since I
looked at it now I'm gonna look at this
thing again I'm looking at for 15
minutes on my off this you know
it's like that's me learn more about
what I'm talking
anything that comes off arrogant to
programmers can be arrogant especially
male programmers it seems like and
hopefully that's not an attack on males
or anything like that but like did we
come off as arrogant I'm sure like I
know I've come off as Arian everybody's
arrogant sometimes but with programmers
like they think their favorite library
is the best they think their favorite
language is the best they think their
education was the best they think their
experience is more if more than somebody
else's like we are we are all guilty of
being arrogant so especially in a room
full of people like you don't want to be
the arrogant asshole like you just don't
so it should just be careful with that
saying yes to the impossible now this is
where like a lot of junior devs come in
and they'll say that they can fit oh
yeah I can get that done in like like
two hours and they don't even account
for unit testing like regression testing
they don't count for the fact that their
requirements aren't even finalized yet
like there's there's so many different
things like you don't want to say yes to
an impossible deadline and this is
something that a lot of programmers are
guilty of and this is the last one which
is fighting or disagreeing with your
boss and the presence of others do not
do that like if you're in a meeting and
there's like five or six developers
whatever analysts if there's even more
than just you and your boss and like you
have problems with what your boss is
asking you to do maybe because it's a
bad idea because dude that that
happens sometimes but do not question
them or her and do not like you
definitely don't fight and disagree with
them in the presence of other people
like if you feel like they're making the
wrong mistake then it is your job to
obviously go to them and tell them but
don't make them you know don't make them
look bad don't make them look like you
know you know like like they don't know
what they're talking about you're just
gonna you're gonna you're gonna create
some massive problems for yourself and
you'll quickly find that out but that's
really my list here today guys I
