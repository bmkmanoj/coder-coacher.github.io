this video and in this video what I want
to talk about is the top ten programming
languages that I think anybody should be
learning if they want to be a programmer
in 2016 and beyond so it's not
necessarily just a look at where all the
jobs are it's more of an opinion on
where the industry is headed and where I
feel like you know the different
paradigms should be as far as your your
toolbox or arsenal of programming
languages and like I said paradigms that
you should know to be a well-rounded
programmer so we're gonna start with
number ten number ten on the list is the
C programming language it is you know
the Godfather of all programming
languages out there I don't think it's
the best first language to learn there's
no reason why you can't learn the basics
of C using something like Python C sharp
or C++
you don't need C to do C++ but C is
still involved in basically everything
so if you want to be a true hardcore
hacker learning the C language is never
going to be a bad thing it's never ten
on the list though just because C is so
verbose and so low-level that typically
you're not going to get an industry job
and at least with regards to web and
where things are headed going into the
future
I feel like C is going to be a little
bit less on the lesser end then the
other language is in this list but
definitely C is a good language to learn
and if you've done c-sharp or JavaScript
or Python or any of these other
higher-level languages built on top of C
then you pretty much already done C
programming so the syntax will be
relatively similar you're just in for a
lot of headaches with memory leaks and
in verbosity of writing C if you go with
that route
alright guys number nine on this list is
Go Go's golang or go programming
language and the reason for that is also
the same reasons why I mentioned C go is
a very low-level verbose language that
is gaining a lot of traction as far as
like server-side technology or
systems-level language
Google is slowly incorporating it
throughout their entire stack from
YouTube to old C++ libraries that they
used to use go was invented by a lot of
guys over at go as well as The Godfather
and creator of the C language himself
ken Thompson so definitely an awesome
language to learn and I would put that
ahead of C at this point because if
you're going to go system's level and
low level you might as well go with go
and you won't have to deal with the
garbage collection I would imagine we're
going to see a major uptake in Google
jobs Google group go anyway
but we're probably still a couple years
off but you might as well jump in the in
the water
before it gets warm in that way you'll
be you'll be ready when the explosion
happens and there's a lot more demand
for Google Go jobs
I say Google go is really not you know
it's the open source language but go was
created by the Google guys it was kind
of a company level project but it's it
can be used by any company it doesn't
have to have an affiliation with Google
our number eight on this list is PHP PHP
is a web-based language was built
specifically for the web it can be used
for other things besides the web but
that's really asinine and the corporate
world it's really just a PHP engine it's
what powers WordPress and millions and
millions of blogs out there so there is
a ton of demand for PHP it can be a real
ugly bastard at times it was written by
a guy who is a self-proclaimed non coder
guy that didn't doesn't really like the
code as opposed to like you know
geniuses that are like math whizzes like
the guy that invented Python or the guy
that masterminded the c-sharp language
with PHP it's a different story so you
know sometimes people refer to it as
like having unique tools to do certain
things like one guy referred to it as
like you know basically a toolbox and
you pull out a hammer and it's got a
claw on both ends and you're like well
it's kind of useful you know I can kind
of hit things with it sideways but
didn't really expect to have claws on
both ends but that's typically some of
the complaints that come from PHP is
like just kind of weird variances and
and not a whole lot of I guess foresight
into additions to the language and and
its biggest issue being security issues
mainly due to inexperience coders since
PHP is a very easy language to jump into
non coders non programmers can quickly
get a website up and running even though
there could be like major security holes
with the website and that's been known
to plagued PHP sites in the past so it
gets a lot of negative publicity for
that but so many websites are written in
PHP because it is an easy language if
it's a web-based language it's kind of
like a successor to Perl and Perl used
to run the web in the nineties PHP kind
of took a lot of that and in Python and
Ruby are taking even more from PHP now
so that's why PHP is number eight on
this list but still a great language to
learn especially if you need a job
because there's going to be a lot of
jobs out there in PHP
you
number seven on this list is Ruby and
the reason why Ruby is so popular is
because of its web framework Ruby on
Rails which was originally what Twitter
was set up under Ruby on Rails still
powers a lot of very successful very
large websites and it was really the
first to mastermind the entire web
framework as we see it now so a lot of
alternatives like Django and asp.net and
really Ruby paved the way for a lot of
the features that you see in those
modern web frameworks now I mean they
kind of they just they have a lot of
magic included so it's like a
all-inclusive type framework so one of
the complaints is that there is a too
much black box magic going on underneath
the scenes but it's also very easy to
install a gem and get your website up
and running with the latest features
that you could need so it's got a huge
community a lot of a ton of Ruby on
Rails jobs the reason why Ruby is all
the way down on the number seven though
is because it's really just seen as a as
a web language so there is not much
demand for this language outside of Ruby
on Rails so if you're not if you're
going to be in like GUI development or
basically like Windows any sort of non
web-based language or approach even like
you know data crunching and stuff like
that you're typically not going to see
that done in Ruby you're going to see
other languages that we have on the list
here so anyway Ruby is still a great
language to learn especially if you're
looking for a job in the web development
field using Ruby on Rails
alright number six on this list is a
swift which is the newest replacement
for objective-c which is Apple's
programming language of choice which
works just out of the box works
everything on a Mac iOS iPod Apple is
obviously a huge company we're the
largest companies in the world might
even be the largest company by market
cap at the time of this video I haven't
looked it up recently but they're
obviously a huge company I'll give you a
little hint into the remainder of this
list that objective-c is not on it and
the reason why is like I said there's
still a lot of objective-c demand
obviously but Swift is looking to be
like the Python of C but basically the
Python of Objective C which they call
Swift so it's very Python like very easy
to use much less verbose than C
Objective C and I think we're going to
see in the future more and more jobs
transitioning from the Objective C
environments as more libraries and
things get ported over to Swift and
you're going to see a lot more demand
and Swift and specifically just whiffed
so anyway that is why that is number six
on this list so obviously Apple speaks
for itself it's a huge huge environment
with a lot of potential for jobs and
future growth
alright number five on this list is
c-sharp and we just went from Swift with
Apple now to c-sharp and the reason why
c-sharp is so popular is because it is
the language of the dotnet framework
which is the Microsoft proprietary
systems technology so anything Microsoft
from forums to websites to the Windows
Phone c-sharp is going to be your go-to
language and that is once again it
speaks for itself the net profits of
Microsoft even with all the negative
publicity at times is still like
astronomically high I believe they clear
like 20 billion in profit every year or
something ridiculous like that still a
humongous humongous company one of the
most reputable and most distinguished
brands of our history so not going
anywhere anytime soon and with the power
of Microsoft behind it c-sharp is still
going to be poised to be a very good
language to learn in the corporate world
going forward now if they had better
options for hosting and maybe with their
open source open sourcing of their
technologies that they've been
announcing over the last couple years we
may see more growth into like non
Microsoft operating systems which would
be a breath of fresh air so that Windows
developers can actually move outside of
the windows the platform and not just
not be so restrictive restricted to just
one particular operating system which is
really the downfall of c-sharp is that
it really only works with Windows so
it's number five on this list
I'm just because Microsoft is so large
you
number four on this list is C++ and C++
has seen a huge rejuvenation and the
amount of followers it's been receiving
with its newest C++ 11 standards it's
really looking to standardize everything
about C++ so that it's much easier for
new developers to come along and
understand what and how they should be
coding C++ because it's such an old
language dating back to the 80s and it's
such a like tacked on language where
they just tack random on here and
there that it gets a really bad rap for
like outdated documentation and just
really just mind-boggling confusion
about how to do like certain you know
mundane tasks and it can be very very
difficult it doesn't have any sort of
memory management or anything like that
so it's very difficult to jump into but
with C++ 11 it is making it a little bit
easier for newcomers to join and jump in
the warm waters of C++ because there are
still a ton of jobs out there for C++
game engines are almost entirely written
in C++ so any sort of computer gaming
Unity Unreal they all use C++ and it is
definitely not going anywhere so any
sort of graphics physics engines or
anything that you'll see out there it's
going to have some sort of C++ wrapper
for it or directly be a Super C++
library so anyway on that is definitely
not going anywhere anytime soon and
that's why it's number four on this list
alright number three on this list is
Python and the reason why Python is
emerging as number three is it's now the
number one most hot programming language
introductory language taught it top IT
schools around the nation around United
States and worldwide Carnegie Mellon MIT
Stanford Caltech all these major IT
firms are all teaching Python as the
number one introductory language it's
also emerged as a very good web
alternative to something like PHP or
where were perl used to dominate Python
is now eating their lunch with a
web-based site so the django web
framework is arguably what's not as
popular as Ruby on Rails or is widely
used but it's certainly just as well
regarded as Ruby on Rails I power sites
like like discuss Pinterest Instagram
some major web sites are using Python
Python still heavily used by Google
Gmail and YouTube so pythons not going
anywhere anytime soon
there's been an explosion of jobs and
then the biggest industry that it's in
right now is also bioinformatics it's
the go-to language for any sort of
biologists and and huge number crunching
with with different libraries that
python has and the reason why is it's so
much easier for a data scientist to pick
up Python than it is for them to pick up
C sharp and on Python is fast enough for
them to be able to do their number
crunching and make their jobs a whole
lot easier so python is is well ahead of
ruby in this regard just because there
may be more Ruby on Rails jobs Python is
growing in multiple industries and
doesn't appear to be slowing down
anytime soon
alright number two on this list is going
to be Java which is the programming
language for native Android development
so Java is not just big in its own right
it's like the number one language used
on like DVD players blu-ray players and
embedded systems servers gooeys
web-based anything search engines
basically Java is in everything it has
the most jobs there's there's a ton of
Java demand out there and since it's
androids native environment so it's
entire SDK is written in Java it is
definitely number two on this list for
jobs for future for anything if you know
Java you'll have a job so doesn't
necessarily mean it's the best but um it
is it is head and shoulders um and more
demand and then the other languages that
I've mentioned so far when it comes to
actual jobs
and the number one language on this list
and for good reason is JavaScript
JavaScript seems like a boring number
one but it is by far and away the most
important language for web-based
development pretty much everything in
the programming IT world nowadays is
web-based it's used in conjunction with
any sort of back-end server-side
technology that you want to use whether
it be PHP Python Ruby c-sharp Java Java
scripts going to be used in all of that
stuff Java scripts now also emerging as
a full server-side technology as well
and not just a browser base line which
so we're quickly moving into in almost
entire JavaScript UI and it can be very
difficult to learn in some cases I mean
the beginner concepts are easy but
javascript has a lot of a very unique
behavior compared to other languages and
a lot of people do overlook it popular
libraries like the jQuery library or
more modern frameworks like angular
backbone knockout those are all
JavaScript based frameworks you also
have tools like react which is still
just a JavaScript framework so it's
really just JavaScript JavaScript
JavaScript everywhere you learn or
everywhere you turn and it should be
everywhere you learn to so that actually
worked out so anyway if you want to get
in web development definitely learn
JavaScript it's probably the single most
important language you could possibly
learn right now alright guys thanks for
watching this list and please subscribe
let me know if you disagree call me a
jerk whatever people are very passionate
about their languages I try to be as
independent as possible so I you know
I've been in the IT world for quite some
time now so these are just my own
personal opinions and I could be wrong
so anyway thanks for watching guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
