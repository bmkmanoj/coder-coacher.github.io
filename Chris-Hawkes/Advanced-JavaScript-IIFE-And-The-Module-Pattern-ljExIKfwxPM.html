video and the advanced JavaScript
tutorial series and the remainder of
this video series is going to be
conducted in accordance with a hipster
code comm it's a new website platform
that I created for e-learning and
there's plenty of other tutorials out
there for any sort of tutorials and
different technologies that you might be
interested I just suggest you check that
out I'd appreciate it so that being said
the next video what I want to talk about
is the module pattern in JavaScript and
why it's so important the module pattern
uses just a standard JavaScript object
in order to self contain code inside of
a JavaScript object which takes
advantage of something called closures
so closures allow variables and
functions to exist inside a scoped
module and they only exist inside the
scope module so in the previous videos
we looked at how you can pollute the
global namespace by attaching functions
and variable names to the window object
what in what a module does it's the same
thing that jQuery uses where everything
is self contained inside a JavaScript
object and then the JavaScript object
exposes the public parts of that module
however just because it exposes the
parts parts of the module doesn't mean
it exposes everything it only exposes
what it wants to expose and then those
exposures can also call private
functions from within the module pattern
so the best way to explain this is going
to be able to just go into a description
to show you guys how it works now one of
the things with the module pattern is
that in order for the module that you're
defining to actually exist and be
callable by other code it needs to be
invoked so after you define your module
you have to call it and then that way
it's available in the you know though
it'll be attached itself to the window
of the global scope and then you'll be
able to access it from other parts of
your code so there is a term that was
coined by a guy named Ben Allman back in
2010 that he called the
immediately invoked function expression
and what it means is just simply a
JavaScript function that's immediately
invoked all in one execution statement
so that way it becomes publicly
available and able to be consumed too by
the rest of the code so in my atom
editor here which is a free editor that
you can download it's on github it's
free for all the different environments
it's just a simple text editor editor I
have a JavaScript file and then I have
an index file which is just an HTML file
that references my JavaScript file and
we're going to go ahead and create a an
iffy and that's the term immediately
invoked function expression which was
coined by Ben Allman and they pronounce
it iffy so an iffy is I have equals and
then here is the the trick to this whole
thing is that it's going to be a
function but you actually wrapped a
function inside of the parenthesis
inside of this this function here and
then you just call it like this and then
before this final parenthesis are
actually going to call the execution
like that and what this does is it
declares the function and a statement
and then it invokes it here and then
this iffy object will be available so
for instance let's do a example alert
hello
hipster code calm now this is going to
be immediately called because the
function is immediately called when the
JavaScript page is loaded if I remove
these parentheses here and just do that
you can see it doesn't get called the
key to this being called is those
parentheses now let me show you another
example so I add the parenthesis back
and if we go to our browser you can see
it got executed if I right click and I
view the the window object that we've
discussed in the previous videos let me
zoom in on this you could see within the
window object we have this Fe but it
equals an undefined because it's just a
function that's all it is it's
immediately invoked function of phone
doesn't have any sort of public methods
or anything like that on it it's just
immediately invoked and it calls this
hello world or hello hipster code comm
now if I didn't put the parentheses
there and we refresh this let's look at
the window object you can see the if he
doesn't exist because the function was
never called so that if he does not
exist in a global namespace now if I
bring the parentheses back it's gonna
exist in the note of the global
namespace and instead of this being
called I'm gonna say you know what I
only want you to be called if I call you
I don't want you to immediately be
called and doing an alert statement just
because you got loaded so what I would
do is I would define an object inside of
the function a return object and we'll
just call this we'll call it variable it
could even be the same name as the outer
scope but it probably won't be a good
idea but you could just say example
equals and it's just an empty JavaScript
object so open and close curly brackets
and then on this example we could then
give our public methods that we want to
be available so example will say we'll
just call it alert and we'll say it
equals a function and then inside the
function we will actually execute this
alert statement now because we have this
new object and then we attach things to
the object so we attach it attaching a
new function to example we need to
actually return this object in the if e
so the Fe has to return the object so
it's going to return example and now if
I look at the window object I can see
that the if e object is there now and it
has a value of object so if I go ahead
and say window dot if e you can see it's
an object if I look inside the object
there's an alert function that I've
attached so you see this MA
pattern in almost every single
javascript library out there in some way
shape or form they use this very very
often now the cool thing is is that this
alert function is not polluting the
global namespace space it's contained
inside of a closure which is all just
contained inside the scope of the if e
of the if e object well really what the
the if e is a module pattern that
returns this javascript object so
everything is contained inside this
object that is all being returned by an
immediately invoked function expression
so the good thing about this is that the
example alert is publicly available so
somebody can say if e dot example and
you can execute that code and I'll do an
example here so if I said window dot if
e let me clear this alright window dot
if he dot hello and then I call it a
second
so now if he died hello I don't know why
the hell I'm saying hello guys evident
if he dot what did I say alert that's
the name of the function crap
syntax error alright I got it right this
time if he alert then you can see it
execute the alert code I have no idea
what I was just doing there please
forgive me I'm tired anyway so you can
see if I just called alert outside of a
function if I don't use the parentheses
it doesn't execute it as a function it
just simply returns the function that is
if he dot alert so if I say invoke if
you don't alert you need to have the
parens and then it actually executes so
that's a publicly accessible method that
we put on our module now what if I
wanted a private function I could simply
say function test equals function oh you
know it doesn't even have to be I could
just say function test and then here is
this private function and let's just say
alert your mom I know it's a typo so now
if I look at the function expression
here I look at if e the object let's
return that it returns the object now
there's this alert that we knew what was
there before but where is the test
function the test function is not
publicly accessible because we didn't
make it publicly accessible we didn't
attach it to the object however the
reason why that's beneficial is because
this could simply say you know what
here's my publicly accessible method and
anybody that has access to this global
iffy object can execute alert and only
alert because I've said this is what is
publicly available but that can call
private functions so you can see it can
call a private function that only exists
inside of its block scope which is a
closure so if i refresh and now I call F
e dot hello or not hello I'm doing that
again alert returns you can see it's
actually going to
all the test function there so if I
execute it you can see it calls your mom
so a publicly accessible function on our
module pattern expose the method that
could be communicated with and that
method then called a private function
that only it could communicate with
which allows you to self contain a lot
of code and it prevents any sort of
namespace clashing and things like that
that can exist whenever you start
dealing with a lot of JavaScript
libraries all mashed together so it's a
very very important concept in
JavaScript it's something that every
JavaScript developer should be familiar
with once you start getting into you
know the meat of what is jQuery how does
it work and how can you create similar
libraries to your advantage definitely
you know shout out to Ben Allman who
coined this term initially so Ben almond
Kyle Simpsons another guy that does
really good JavaScript tutorials and
anyway guys that's what I have on this
video that is the immediately invoked
function expression and the module
pattern in JavaScript thanks for
watching guys please subscribe have a
good day and bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
