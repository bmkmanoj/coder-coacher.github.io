going to talk about the number one
languages to learn but I'm not going to
go through like some list or
whatever I'm just going to give a quick
rundown of what I think is going on
right now so we're going to look at one
chart in this video this is indeed calm
and luckily for indeed more luckily for
me I have indeed charts will attract
this out and deeds not perfect there's
other sites that are springing up all
over the place a lot of different jobs
websites out there that are given
different data but indeed com has a lot
of listings I know I've complained about
them as now as far as like having
duplicate listings and things like that
but this short seems pretty legitimate
in my opinion when it comes to actually
finding a programming job so a lot of
people are going to be like all talking
on the flavor of the week thing where
wjs where's react we're driving over
blah blah blah but this this is a this
is a pretty good representation of
what's going on right now if you're to
try if you're trying to be a developer
and you're trying to actually get a job
and get paid to be a developer Java is
still King Java let's just look up job
listings I mean John's job is all over
the place a lot of enterprise
applications are written in Java if it's
not in Java
the other one is dotnet and c-sharp
they're both about equally they're
equally stable I mean they're not going
anywhere and you wonder why like why is
it Java and c-sharp are so popular when
they're not so well why are they so
popular with enterprise where they're
not so popular with small you know any
developers or startups and things like
that and it comes down to really one
thing and that is like that is cut that
is corporate support or customer support
so if you have a company that is making
hundreds of millions of dollars you
don't care about saving maybe a few
million on an open source stack and then
taking a humongous risk on you know Joe
Schmo over in Australia or something
like that doesn't update his code repo
and all of a sudden like or he's the guy
that you need to talk to in order to
figure out your Django problem or
something like that the fact is if you
have a Java shop then you have support
from one of the largest IT companies in
the world which is Oracle you could get
people on the phone from Oracle and
Randa you're going to pay money for
but they could fly out here at your to
your ears to your location they're going
to take a look at your servers if you
have money that you're losing by the
minute because your servers or your
product is down you have that support
you look at something like no js' why
hasn't nodejs taken off in the corporate
world is growing yes but they're still
not the same level of support that you
get with something like Java with Oracle
or c-sharp and Microsoft so a lot of you
know big time servers are still using
sequel server and they're using dotnet
and there's and things like that so if
you want to get a job in this industry
it's Java and in c-sharp and it's still
that way I don't think that that has
changed at all now the third and this is
the best for like newer developers so if
you would ask me you know how do I get a
job as a newer developer that is clear
it's Java JavaScript I'm sorry
javascript is obviously it will es6 if
you can get into the web pack and babble
and es6 and you learn about all these
flavors of weak tools like the UJS react
or angular or something like that you're
going to stand a pretty good shot of
being able to eat your what yourself in
as a junior debt especially without the
experience because you know these these
flavor of the week things haven't been
been around that long so some of the
reasons why we you know this javascript
community is such a mess is because
these tools are only around for six
months or a year or so before they're
getting replaced or rewritten you know
through a 2.0 implementation or just
being completely shut down in favor of
something else so that levels the
playing field for from senior level
developers and entry level developers it
still doesn't mean you're going to be as
good that like enterprise development
was a bunch of you know developers
around you and you know github or you
know get 40 FS for merging and things
like that and task management agile
methodologies things like that but the
answer is clear if you're trying to get
in the corporate world in Java or C
sharp still if you're trying to get into
like a junior dev position as a web
developers and there's there's
definitely no question about JavaScript
if you're trying to like get into maybe
I mean I guess it depends on where you
are like I love Python but there's like
a lot of the job opportunities for
Python which is a little bit misleading
it's for the data scientist types you
know former PhDs or physicists that are
actually using Python for all their
complex calculations and things like
that
that's not really the kind of job that's
catered towards beginner anjaii thon
developers there are some Jango shops
out there and there's some probably some
Python /type startups you know even
startups I read it when it was coming
out and things like that but it's also
going to be difficult to kind of get
into those like hipster trendy things
too if you still have no experience so
really it's JavaScript HTML CSS if
you're a new newer web developer those
are the best things to focus on Python
if you truly want to learn one of the
easier languages and then try to maybe
get into an opportunity with like a
Django or flask if there's opportunities
around your geographic area for
something like that I think that would
be that would be much closer to the
JavaScript opportunity than something
like C sharp or Java because c-sharp or
Java they are some big beasts to learn
and it takes literally years sometimes
decades to master your craft to do what
it is that corporate corporations are
going to pay you a lot of money and
expect you to be able to do so that's my
advice all in one video all like under
six minutes and now you're talking about
my my sponsors guys check out deb
mountain coding boot camp they're 12 and
16 week courses their courses work they
can get your and they can get your foot
into the door the junior dev especially
if you're you know like I said the
JavaScript equation there so they're
going to be doing node J us they have
angular never react courses and then
they're going to teach you how to use
github and version control systems and
things which is something that you're
guessing it has to deal with when you
get into the industry and then the best
best of all and I'm like Coursera or
something like that you're working with
real instructors real programmers and
they're around you and they're teaching
your day in and day out
also if you try to build your portfolio
get out there and use site one two three
they also sponsored this video so if
you're trying to build like a portfolio
if you don't want to deal with all that
search engine optimization server hassle
all that garbage there now definitely
try one two three would save you a lot
of time and money over doing
like setting up your own host and server
and buying your DNA of dealing with dns
forwarding and all itself so yeah make
sure you guys check out those two
sponsors I appreciate you guys listening
to this message sponsors helping pay the
bills and also keeps your shirt on
growing so you guys take care and have a
good day bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
