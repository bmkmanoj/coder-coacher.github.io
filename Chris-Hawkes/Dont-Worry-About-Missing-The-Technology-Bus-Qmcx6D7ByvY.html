flame and he's like hey crusher
continuous passion for web development
and programming baffles me how do you
stay motivated and interested so I was
responding that flame has always been a
pretty one of my closest followers on on
this channel and he think it's yeah I
guess it does baffle um how how I can do
that I mean honestly it kind of baffles
me as well because I've been working my
ass off basically for almost about eight
years and his whole self-taught
development world and and I went from
you know being a made up programmer
somebody wasn't paid to do it to to
actually being paid you know junior
developer working my way up to the ranks
to the point where I'm now a senior
software developer and getting job
offers and opportunities and things from
all over the place so it's like I've
seen this this kind of progression I
feel like I have a long way to go man I
really do I feel like I'm still junior
in a lot of different levels I think the
more that you know the more you can the
more you know the more you realize you
know that you don't know a ton so
basically it's that whole you don't know
what you don't know kind of thing so
that said like to stay motivated I was
responding to his question it's just
it's a difficult thing to respond to but
the churn of JavaScript I would say over
the last like a couple years on has been
I think a bit of a nightmare like when
when react was coming out I think up
some videos from late 2014 maybe 20
probably pretty sure it was 2014 when I
was doing JavaScript and I'm not
JavaScript but react and I was uh I was
doing some stuff to felt like it was
really the answer a lot of people were
going the whole angular way and at the
same time it was that you know this
whole jQuery versus JavaScript
discussion and and people were kind of
moving away from jQuery and saying you
know we definitely want to move towards
JavaScript and then then with es6 came
along like react was completely
rewritten over and over again I think
we're on version we're about to give
them version 1.6 right and the thing is
like during that entire time like nobody
knew if it was going to be react or if
it was
like if you asked a lot of senior
developers who weren't keeping up with
it like in the.net world which is where
I was coming from many of them didn't
even like see the writing on the wall
the way angular what's that for why do
we need that you know and they were just
content doing you know their their
normal MVC layout using razor templates
and if you're in the Django world you're
using Django template engine or Jinja to
me there's just and they wouldn't need a
complicated front-end system like
angular and like at least we told
ourselves we didn't but then you know
these programs into these frameworks
they saw a specific problem so it's like
well you know if you've been down that
block where you're trying to create a
gmail or you're trying to create a
YouTube and you realize that you're
trying to manage state all over the
place that it's very difficult to keep a
UI updated when you're trying to
maintain all that state writing it from
the ground up so we clearly needed tools
in order to help us do that so it kind
of came like if we look back at the
history I would say it's like a lot of
like you know you had the backbone John
they did there was that whole phase of
backbone knockout require.js browserify
eventually that gave way to like gulp
and and then you know we obviously moved
towards like well Gulf was more of a
task runner we still use gold actually I
still use it quite a bit but yeah there
were things like okay do I use Bower do
I use do I use grunt as my tasks run or
show you guys I use go open there was
all these tools coming out all at once
it seems like and and and then like you
fast forward to about you know a year
and a half ago or something like that we
have you know the whole six
implementation where everything's being
rewritten in es6 and in mics is so we
were then using modules and trying to
figure out okay how we're going to
import modules how are how is module
loading going to work it and that took a
while I think to iron out you know for
us the standards to come into play and
then need a web pack and and then using
babel now to compile our es6 down to
older versions of javascript that's
still work in browsers meanwhile all
this is going on like none of the
code you write and
javascript still works you know the same
way across all the different browsers
like when you're dealing with some of
the older versions of ie like you know
ie 10 ie 11 and then you know God forbid
anything earlier than that but that was
the kind of that we were dealing
with back then and and even now it's
like it's not a reality to a lot of
newbie developers that think that
everybody runs their application in
chrome and that it's just acceptable
luckily for us so there's an industry
are really the user base of everybody
that's using browsers has definitely
gravitated towards Chrome and Mozilla
and and obviously opera but let our
safari less so not operated but less so
internet explorer inter explorer was
such a piece of that it gave ways
into microsoft to edge you know
basically edge is the same looking
browser as IE it's just they had to give
it a different name because IE was such
a pile of like for so long and it
really just got in the way of all the
web developers and really everybody's
user experience on the web itself so how
do I see motivated man the answer that
question I have no clue I really
don't I don't have any clue I would say
that I've gone through a bit of a
burnout phase over the last couple of
months it feels like the whole
JavaScript kind of fight it has to meet
it settle down maybe I'm just getting
older or more senior and I'm just like I
don't really care man if I'm programming
angular tomorrow over react I don't care
I know people personally that I've
worked with that have said that if we
move from like react to angular they
would literally find another job like
they are so invested in react and
Facebook and you know it's just like I
feel like the more senior I get the more
I just don't give a you know as
long as I'm getting paid to write code
and whether it's an angular view or
react I'll be fine like I am not
committed or attached to any sort of
technology to the point where like I
would look for a different job if we
change technology basis like if I had a
right job at a more I'd have no
problem with it I wouldn't be very good
at it but I would have no problem you
know getting it eventually within six
months or so I probably be pretty good
but so that all said like I think that
to stay motivated it helps to to not
care as much about all the phases that
we're going through in this web
development world whether or not you
ever tried to get into like requirejs as
far as a module loading is concerned if
you miss that without that ride all
together it doesn't really matter
because we don't need it anymore so
granted if you were like oh well I know
how we're going to handle modules you
know four years ago requirejs was a
pretty good solution at the time but
like we don't we don't use requirejs
anymore so if you've never used it all
this time it doesn't really matter you
know what I mean like it doesn't matter
that I know anything about requires us
or that somebody out there may not know
anything about it this is just an
example it's just an example of
sometimes like you can miss the bus on
technology and still be just fine it
doesn't matter but if you try to stay
up-to-date on all those different
technologies like it would absolutely it
will actually drive you crazy now as far
as the burnout is concerned I do want to
address that a little bit because one of
the things that that I'm starting to
realize is like I said I don't care that
much about individual technologies I do
like to code I like being a programmer
and I just want to make sure that I'm
doing things the right way for my career
for my family for even this YouTube
channel and things like that so I
haven't been as interested in some of
the web development stuff that's come
along lately in fact I could I could
care less about view or anything at this
moment I write react day in and day out
I write a lot of es6 i debug a lot of
stuff in Redux and i'm doing a lot of
stuff in nodejs
still doing c-sharp and doing a lot of
Python on my personal stuff so it's like
for the most part like I don't I just
kind of stick in that industry and it's
like once I feel like I have to move to
something else I'll do it but I'm just
kind of watching things from afar and I
don't I don't get too emotionally
invested and anymore so I would say that
that that is the best way that I stay
motivated and as far as interested I've
always just been kind of
did in technology but I'm interested in
the sense that I'm interested in what it
can do for me as a business owner and
you know as businesses out there what
kind of economic opportunities are going
to be created because of this new
technology or is it going to make our
lives more difficult so for those
reasons I do stay interested in
technology because I do want to stay
ahead of the curve as much as I can you
know generally speaking from a general
perspective and not like I said in the
nitty-gritty of should I be using view
or angular or react or something else so
that is yeah that's just it's kind of
all over the place I think but but right
now man like III I don't care that much
about web development where it's like oh
I got to do that stuff one of the things
I've been looking at lately I was
playing with blender yesterday doing
some more three modeling god that is a
nightmare
3d modeling is such a pain in the ass
man that tool system that UI is just
atrocious but I hear it's better than
three as Maxton and maya and things like
that so I could be wrong on that I've
heard that it's easier to use and I
don't think any of them are easy to use
but but I do play around with those
things a little bit obviously I've done
some unity gaming stuff I was playing
with golang the other day and I want to
get back into things like rust and I'm
watching in webassembly and so yeah just
I there's there's things outside of just
the web development world that I'm
interested in run a programming
perspective but but again not enough to
like you know pull my hair out or
realize you think that I have to spend
all my time learning so there's some new
scripting language or something like
that so I don't know man I would say
just whatever floats your boat do that
and when you need to take a break
especially if you're not getting paid to
do this stuff then today oh yeah don't
worry about missing the bus on some of
this stuff just let that let that bus go
man you'll get you'll get the next bus
coming down the street
