this video I want to actually focus on
how do we actually get input from the
user and one of the things that we're
gonna have to do in this actual tutorial
compared to the other ones is we're
going to avoid actually running the code
from within the editor because there is
a particular settings and things you
have to toggle in order order for this
to work so I just want to avoid that for
this tutorial so we'll write in the
editor but then we'll actually execute
it manually so let's go ahead and look
at how we can do that so like how do I
get Python to ask somebody for
information and it's actually very easy
we could say my name is a variable
equals input and then here is just a
string we'll say what is your name okay
and now let's go ahead and actually I'm
just going to go ahead and say print hi
plus my name so after we collect a
user's name we're just going to print a
statement hi plus their name so let's go
to where we store this this code and you
can see it's in here so we're going to
type our CMD to open up the command
prompt try to make this bigger alright
so inside here I can just say remember I
can say Python and then the name of that
I don't remember the name of the file to
be honest first file so python first
file then not to be if you're on Windows
it's not case-sensitive but here it is
what is your name so it's asking I'll
say Chris and it says hi Chris so that's
actually how you you take data from your
Python program so my name got assigned
the value that we typed into the console
and sometimes you see people doing that
if they need to actually deliver a
message to a Python script because a lot
of the times you might have dynamic
information you could you could have a
script maybe that looks for a rock band
and the script expects you to pass in a
name well how do you pass in the name to
your script and without writing it you
know hard coding it into the script so
that's one option that you have is just
simply to write a program that asked for
that information and then execute it so
another way though that you typically PC
people do this is they say import sis
and then from it if we look at sis we're
going to go ahead and say Prince sis now
this is the first time that we've
actually looked at an import statement
in Python and this is where things get a
little bit confusing these sis is a
library and we're going to look at this
a little bit more but this is part of
the standard library within Python does
all kinds of stuff
we'd have to I mean look it up real big
interview guys an example but it does
all kinds of stuff so here is Python
specific documentation if you go to
python 3 5 which is what we're using
this tells you all about the Syst module
and has all these functions and
everything in here a lot of this stuff
is going to be way over your head until
you're really familiar with Python but
this sis Arg V is something that is very
important you see that in a lot of
programs so RV it actually stands for
argument value and we're going to
inspect RV in just a moment here but
let's go ahead and put a breakpoint and
we're going to run our code and when we
hit the breakpoint we can now inspect
the assist property we could also look
over here make this a little bit bigger
and we can open up sis and then it's
inside of here we can look for Arg V so
here's our V what is this oh it's a list
so you can see our V is a list and it
has how many items it only has one item
that's why it's two zero index if there
were more than one item in here then we
would have we would have more values now
here's the thing that first value and
sistar V is the actual name of the
Python file being executed so it's
called first file so it actually gives
you the exact path from where python
executed that file so that's always
going to be your sis
our v-0 argument so you're going to see
sis our V a lot because people sometimes
need that value of where they are in the
file system
- you know take some sort of action or
to figure out which module got loaded or
there's there's several reasons whatever
you do see that and it's really just
that sis Arg V is a list and it's
grabbing the first argument by zero now
why am I telling you all this for a
beginner level series the only thing I'm
that you need to remember about all of
this really is number one that this is
this exists number two you need to know
that we can actually do the same thing
so instead of actually creating and
using an input to grab data from the
console we can actually look at an
argument that gets passed in to our
Python function and we're going to do
that by saying we're going to say in our
statement we're going to say print this
is the argument passed and plus sis Arg
V and now we're going to reference the
first index so we know that if we just
ran this code from our editor there is
no one index this would actually throw
an error because there's only one value
in sis RV and that's just the name of
the file now what if I ran it from the
command line though and I said Python
first file test now this is actually not
going to work either but we're going to
see why in just a moment actually I did
work my bed um sorry I thought that
Python would be the first human never
mind all right guys so this this did
work just fine the first value is the
name of the file which is first file
that that py and the second value is
test so I was easily able to pass test
and to this script so if I needed to say
you know this code equals so in my
previous example it's a band name I
could just assign it the value of sis
arc V and then all this code down here
says hey use D even though this isn't
real pretend this is real code and it
says oh oh you know I'm going to take
this band name that got passed in and
I'm going to look for this and that and
this and that and it's all based on this
argument that got passed and so that's
all I wanted to touch on
in this video because you will see this
kind of stuff a lot and programs you're
like oh what what the heck is it doing
and it's really just arguments that are
being passed in to the script sometimes
from the console sometimes Python can
import other modules and and have
arguments to that as well
but this is this is something you may
run into every now and then I just feel
like I needed to at least redress it
alright guys thanks for watching have a
good night please subscribe bye hey guys
so a lot of you asked me how do I get my
foot in the door to become a programmer
and I just want to take a moment to
mention dev Mountain coding boot camp is
a 12-week intensive course that focuses
on the technologies of the here-and-now
for web development some of the things
that they're actually teaching in the
Suevi course it's geared to get you into
the industry by focusing on things like
jQuery nodejs
react angular how to use github so a lot
of the things that you're going to need
to do as a developer as soon as you
start they're going to be teaching you
in this and this coding boot camp and
the entire goal is to be able to get you
into the industry within 12 weeks so if
you guys are interested in learning more
information about Deb mountain coding
boot camp just check out the link in the
description table of this video thank
you for watching and have a good day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
