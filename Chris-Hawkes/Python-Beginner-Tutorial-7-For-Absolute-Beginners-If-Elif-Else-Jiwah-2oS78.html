want to touch upon logical operators and
it sounds very confusing
it's very mathematically based term but
logical operators are simple just if
something is a certain way do something
or do something else so if it's not some
way do something else if it is some way
do this or do that that's really all
logical operators are they they they're
their paths or Forks in the road you
reach a fork you need to figure out
which way you want to go unless you want
to turn around go back where you can't
turn around and go back and programming
what you can but my example is that
you're either choosing left or right
dang it just pick a pick a direction and
go and that's what we're going to look
at and in this video here so let's go
ahead and take a look at how we do that
in Python we want to go ahead and create
a couple of variables here so we're
going to say my name equals Chris so
there's a variable name my name and it
has a value which is a string of Chris
now in Python I could say if name equals
Chris and it's just just the way we say
it we could say if not my Y Nia see the
variable name if my name equals Chris
now here's the funky thing we need to
equal signs here because we're not
assigning a value and programming you're
going to assign a value with one equal
sign if your equated weighing or
evaluating analyzing whatever you're
trying to say is this this then you are
using two equal signs and that's going
to end up burning you several times when
you're first getting started so this if
statement then needs a colon and this is
the first time we've actually had to see
this but this is standard construct and
all programming these are it's it's
called like lexically scoped and things
like that so you don't have to worry
about that those terms right now but
this statement though it needs to have a
colon and python one of the interesting
things about python when you compare
this other languages is that it forces
you to indent your code you cannot have
your line carry-on right here it has to
have a tab and
and if you're using an editor like vs
code it's going to do that for you
automatically now why is that what
pythons very particular it was developed
by a mathematician who was very specific
about doing things a certain way not
only that languages that allow you to
put code on one line suck they're hard
to read they're hard to debug even for
the people that wrote it themselves so
Python aims to be a readable language
and it forces indentation that actually
rubs people the wrong way but I don't
really understand that I've never
understood that I'm a guy that writes in
c-sharp JavaScript and Python all the
time it doesn't bother me at all anyway
I think it's just people that like to
complain about the language so if my
name equals Chris now on the second line
at the indentation we can say print hi
Chris alright so let's go ahead and do
this so we know the value is is Chris
right because we we've already assigned
it so this is kind of a silly example
but this is just to display the concept
shrink this again all right so let's run
the program and we know this is going to
print hi Chris because my name equals
Chris now what if my name didn't equal
Chris and that's that's when we need to
do something else so the fork in the
road right now there's only one
direction if my name equals Chris then
it does this but there's no other
condition like it doesn't if it's not
equal to Christ it just carries on it
doesn't do anything so that's where the
else comes in and this is the other
condition now the else is just simply
marked off with a semicolon we could say
print I don't know
all right so now and we're going to say
John we're going to change my name to
John and now we're going to equate it to
Chris and we know that it's not going to
equal Chris so this time it's going to
hit the else condition and go down here
I don't know you now if we wanted to
step through it I probably should have
done that in the first place but it's
not done really matter you put the break
point there just step through step by
step you can see it immediately didn't
it didn't even bother evaluating this it
jumped right to the else condition
because hey my name is not equal to
Chris so it just boom hit hit the else
statement no problems now what if you
wanted to actually compare a few
different things there's also the L if
an Elif can say my my name equals Billy
hey Billy you suck alright so now we
have this this third condition and let's
go ahead and hit that condition so we'll
change this to Billy
so now we'll put the brake on it I'll
live I'm going to put breakpoints all
through here actually that way we don't
miss anything all right
when we press play you can see my name
is equal to Billy so press f10 and jumps
down to the next statement is my name
equal Billy oh it is print hey Billy you
suck now it jumps out the else isn't
evaluated it just jumps out of the list
hey Billy you suck so that is actually
how you say like for instance in the
video that we did before this video when
we passed in a band name you could say
if band name equals this then do this or
maybe you're saying you know what I'm
not looking for a band I'm looking for a
movie so you could say you know the
first thing is either the title that
could be a title of a band or the title
of a movie and then another
argument could be movie or band and then
you know based on your if conditions and
things like that okay if movie do this
if band do that you know so it's a very
common thing in programming and life in
general I mean there's there's true
there's consequences to every choice
that we make and and that's all these
logical if-else statements are doing in
Python they're just they're logical
statements to say hey if this do that
but a couple of things you can keep in
mind is the forced indentation the colon
because they're like whenever you're
doing this whenever you have a statement
like this you need to have the colon and
then the indentation and then the
condition down at the bottom I'm sorry
this would actually be the condition and
then this is the the stain or the
execution so that's yeah that's a lot to
swallow I think just in this one video
but we're going to actually see this
more and more eventually this will
become I think much more comfortable for
you and at least I'm hoping so but just
let me know what you guys think
hopefully I'm not moving too fast I am
trying to get some of these these
tutorials doing though because um I know
a lot of you guys have have asked me to
try to do more of this series and do it
faster so I'm trying to do that now
alright guys thanks for watching have a
good day bye hey guys so a lot of you
asked me how do I get my foot in the
door to become a programmer and I just
want to take a moment to mention dev
Mountain coding boot camp is a 12-week
intensive course that focuses on the
technologies of the here-and-now for web
development some of the things that
they're actually teaching in the Suevi
course it's geared to get you into the
industry by focusing on things like
jQuery nodejs
react angular how to use github so a lot
of the things that you're going to need
to do as a developer as soon as you
start they're going to be teaching you
in this and this coding bootcamp and the
entire goal is to be able to get you
into the industry within 12 weeks so if
you guys are interested in learning more
information about Deb mountain coding
boot camp just check out the link in the
description tab of this video thank you
for watching and have a good day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
