next tutorial video for you at six and
this new one we're going to be looking
at a new way to write a for statement
and Java trip so in running a for
statement a lot of people use jQuery so
you could use the each function at all
this stuff because JavaScript didn't
have like a very good for loop not a
very friendly one I like with Python or
even see sharks for that matter so if I
were to have an array I'll save our my
array equals and there's been one too
all right let's head valley to my ring
and the old way I'd have to go like this
for VAR x equals 0 X is less in my array
length x add 1 to X and I could say
control of my array so that's the old
one let's go ahead and take a look at
that and you can see that we have 10
values that are cons will print it out
now the new way is we're going to pay
for and we're using left is what let
came first of our tutorial series i'm
going to say my array and then we just a
console dot log I so I'll let you guys
be the judge on which one's a little bit
more concise and easier for you remember
far as performance and things like that
between the two I'm not very sure of any
performance differences looks like i'm
getting a break point there
that's in my source map file anyway so
you can see that both of those outputs
say they iterate through an array of 10
values in a console log is so this is a
lot more concise using the or EF six
standard so there's not a whole crapload
to talk about there but i'll just want
to make sure you guys are aware of the
new for statements and es6 thanks for
watching make sure you subscribe and
have a good day right hey guys so a lot
of you asked me how do I get my foot in
the door to become a programmer and I
just wanna take a moment to mention dev
