video I'm doing monstroids to this is a
PHP wordpress theme so I'm sure you guys
have heard of WordPress really it's a
content management system says you
didn't want to go to hard route of like
doing something like django django
requires a lot more work and something
like PHP wordpress and on and you guys
know from the past I've never been like
a huge fan of PHP I don't hate on people
to use PHP I'm not a PHP developer so
don't I don't even claim the b1 like I
barely know it but PHP you can actually
work your way around it pretty easily so
for instance when it came to setting up
an e-commerce site i did two videos on
setting up the PHP opencart for both a
bun to and for windows and this is
something that's not going to be quite
similar but what it what it is is I got
is this this monstroids to from template
monster which is like they call it a
multi-purpose wordpress theme so
essentially what this is a team that you
end up using to build your site and and
and they try to make it easier so
instead of you having to learn all the
JavaScript and HTML CSS placement
everything you only they pretty much say
just you know follow our instructions
and you can have a website that looks
really cool it looks really professional
now the um you know the issue is and
this is you know not to confuse anybody
but when you get the monstroids to
template you're not getting this cool
embedded video along with the content
like this is probably a copyrighted
video that that I would imagine template
monster own or whoever created this this
template engine here for WordPress but
the point of this theme is that you can
build website says look like this you
know I mean so this is this is a website
they created which is running on PHP
WordPress using this template so it's
not like something that is just like
super easy to set up for my Windows
machine I have a damp installed and I
pronounce dance from what I understand
but as Apache myseif well one of the
things that I had to do guys and then
this
because when you're installing a theme
PHP needs to be able to allow a certain
amount of of upload like and by default
I think it only allows like two
megabytes which is very small and for me
I went to the php.ini file and I think
there's some sort of uploads command I
don't know where it is hold on a second
yeah here it is maximum allowed upload
size I turned it to like almost a gig
which is only because it's running
locally you might not want to do that
but the fact of matter is I think it
just needs to be 50 meg to be honest but
that is one thing that you might need to
do when you get this this team its first
first sale so one of the reasons why you
want to buy seems in some cases is that
a lot of people use like the free
bootstrap stuff and I use it myself in
fact hipster code was originally from a
free bootstrap theme that I ended up
adapting and molding into something else
but by buying a theme and you know this
175 bucks but there's there's other ones
that can be cheaper or more expensive
but it also kind of just reduces the
amount of people that are going to be
having the exact same style as your
website so that's important to you
that's that's one of those the perps I
guess or the positives of of buying a
scene so let's go ahead and take a look
at this here i have this wordpress site
running and it's actually running
through dance that's why center this
wordpress thing so if i go to my admin
here this is where i can actually
customize the entire design and what I
want to do just as kind of a goal is
just give an overview basically how I
would end up using this template in
order to kind of build like a hipster
code and I know like you lot you guys
away why even chance to grow that what
member wants my friggin site number two
it's like the only site that i have
actually running right now so anytime I
reference something that I actually own
instead of somebody else's stuff i mean
i'm going to reference my own site
because like i said it's the only one I
got pretty much the other ones are not
not as involved or whatever but here you
can see this is actually using a
bootstrap scene and it's running on
Jango so it's not PHP or WordPress so
the first thing is is that
you would want to on the left-hand side
you have all these different things when
you upload monstroids and one of the
things in case you guys are ever
wondering like how you actually upload a
theme let's go to my admin page real
quick and if you go to the appearance
wordpress makes is very easy so like all
you have to do is um is go to your
themes option right here and then
there's an option to add new and you
just actually upload the zip file that
you get from on story when you actually
purchased it you get a downloaded zip
file and you just upload the whole thing
and PHP and WordPress knows how to to
use it so I wonder if so this one's
saying this team recommends TM wizard so
begin installing I don't even know if
this is a free or not but we're going to
go ahead and try to do that I didn't
even notice that it was actually going
to do that
alright so did you do it or not
oh it would have been nice mobile to
click the install button that was right
below there that's what I good I shall
return to the dashboard alright so if we
go to the appearance and we actually go
to where I seem as you can see the theme
but you can click customize and actually
to get to the customization portion of
the scheme now this is actually going to
run a little bit slower on my local
machine machine because I'm actually
recording the video plus the damp is
just kind of slow with was running all
this stuff locally it's actually very
slow plus I have a crap ton of other
stuff running at the same time so the
first thing first is you have this
option of sight identity let sweating
just change this will call it hipster
code and if i watch i could say learn
general site settings this is a logo in
favicons so let's go ahead and look
select the upload image so we need to go
and select files I'm actually going to
grab so I wanted to put all the images
for hipster code inside of this
wordpress folder and htdocs which is
where damp actually serves all this
stuff so that way when i go to select
files it's actually where I'm going to
go so steep Sam htdocs and this is
actually by default where Apache
observing tell fuming vamps and now I
can go into WordPress images and it
would be nice if I can actually upload
multiple images at lunchtime do that
yeah I can't muster in fact watch them
all I guess I'd spit in one
I'm going to take a second all right
before the logo with Brendan just
selected hipster code 12 at those ice
not hipster codes up there we obviously
need to set the other background in fact
it might even be better to change that
to just although I all know veterans
that's gonna work either because the
background on it and too big but anyway
for right now you can see you probably
want to play with the file size and all
that stuff so here is just a upload
upload logo image
let's try that
retinol logo yeah a lot of this stuff
like I don't normally use now this site
icon probably important I want to do
that little H and now you can see us no
it's actually not doing it yet I'm
hoping that when this thing go yeah it's
going to show up in the browser tab when
this thing is done we gotta save and
publish it
alright so the next thing under general
site settings there's bread crumbs which
trying to show you where in the process
it is it says enable actually I'm not a
big fan of breadcrumb something get rid
of them and then social links down here
we probably do want social links inside
the footer so we have to actually set up
our menu for that so we'll end up doing
that in just a second and then you can
also change the page layout by my leave
it by the falls away it is here's if you
want to change the color scheme there's
all kinds of different of colors that
you can you can change so i'll give you
a lot of flexibility there
we wanted to change the font you can do
that here here's the header take a
little very snow gets and put a header
overlay
compared with you that doing anything by
the way I'm getting ready to have a
header over later so I'm going to work
out alright let's try a background image
for the header so i think i'm on mine i
had well that's not the very one let's
try this one yeah it doesn't look very
good but i think i could probably
I wonder what this looks like if it's
published because that looks terrible
right there
all right you know what I'm not using
that that's not gonna work all right so
we're going to move on from that for
right now
as the next time I look at is the menu
item so this this is actually where you
would go in and create the menu for the
page so we're going to add a new menu
here and we'll just call this main
navigation and then here you can say
where you want it to display I'm going
to do it on the main part and you have
to add actual link item so by the salt
it knows about the custom homepage so we
could add that you can do the sample
page to that's fine this is this logic
drag drop the order of the element so if
we save you can see on the right-hand
side you have this if we would have
dragged these around you see that's how
you change the order of the element
or at least she would sing
I was adding one more row peg
alright so let's try to train to change
this order because it might by default
always have ok so that's how you have
submenus that's pretty cool if you don't
want to so many I just want to put it
right there so you can see home there's
always going to be on the left hand side
it won't let you like you know mess that
up i ended up you know putting in some
places it shouldn't be
also if I were to say social and I could
actually have
the menu in two different places
although I don't know why you'd want to
do that
I said what I did is I created one blog
that uses this image here which I call a
testing first blog and i'm going to
create a new one so i'm going to create
a new post and here we'll say Luke use
my stretching wrong
alright and then when you go ahead and
add a new post here you can add tags
himself what you'll want to do for SEO
but here we're going to pick an image
and I'm just going to pick will pick
that one the time so we'll set that as
our featured image and I can publish my
article and then by going to the page i
refresh this after it's saved
alright so now we have the three blog
post here the second one the first one
so this is what the home page looks like
if we were to visit we can use that
slowly right here so besides this admin
part at the top which is the WordPress
admin this is what the site would look
like to a user bullet go ahead and
display the blog post differently if I
wanted to do that I can go into widgets
here and we're going to say know what
the header full width area we're gonna
adding a widget and I'll say was to
spoon out here I do like a smart slider
so on the smart slider it's going to
know automatic leeches and you can give
your smart fighter till just so it's
smart slider one now this hello world
post actually you actually know what you
know if I settled all this we don't want
that at all that would be bad don't put
a title there that's given alright so
this is by default the the text that you
want actually looks a little bit better
so let's look at it running I just
clearly I need to do something about
hipster crows way to be able logo and
everything but you can see it's starting
to look more like a real web page here
and then by clicking on them and saying
read more it'll take them for the page
where they can actually read more about
your blog and so here's what they can
leave comment so you guys I'm sure I've
seen that it's very it's a very clean
look very similar to like mediums clean
look so thats interesting
alright so now let's take a look at the
the footer area down here so we can add
some stuff down here we're going to just
do a widget going to the footer area and
down here we can say we probably wanted
to play a menu actually because normally
you have like your legal content and
stuff like that so let's see so let's
say custom menu and then what it's
called it's legal I have a legal menu
that I've created and that just has like
the typical pages that you normally see
inside of a legal thing which is like
contact terms privacy policy so you
would actually have all of that you can
also edit this and by saying I guess
we've sort of done it there
nevermind i was actually trying to
figure out and make it display
horizontally i'm pretty sure you can i
just don't know how and that's fine for
the moment now it's a reason why i think
that this thing doesn't really display
horizontally by the fallers because it
kind of goes with this column based
approach throw if you wanted to add
something else to the footer area then
you could let's say add another widget
and let's go and do a carousel so it
will display like all the latest clothes
now you probably wouldn't want to do
this in real life but if you if you did
you can see how it's like a column based
so this is like its own summer column
you can start going through all of your
stuff we can even add another widget
what you say calendar and it's going to
know to put it over here you know I mean
so that is like it's a lot of
functionality and everything that should
it's built in a specific way for
specific reasons so that people are
going to do it horizontally then I think
you're going to end up having problems
obviously you want to add these widgets
to your site so let's take a look what
all this looks like right now you get on
here and once again in just in the real
while this little you know work in
exactly the same way not sure why you
would want this going on here obviously
probably wouldn't want that so yeah
we're not going to get into too much of
me the overall level design I mean the
bottom line is that this saw this
monster boy too has like so many
different figuration options and need to
probably play with this thing all day to
get all kinds of different unique looks
and everything that you want but one of
the things that you want to focus on in
case you guys don't know about MailChimp
instead of having to deal with managing
mail servers which can be a headache
especially when they get hackney end up
getting fans are Sam getting sent from
your mail server which can end up
causing some legal headaches it's much
easier to have like a newsletter type
thing if you're going to have a
newsletter you might as well go with
MailChimp they have free plans I believe
they're there they used to be free let's
close it here yeah they have new
business free you can build some basic
campaigns and
I guess two thousand subscribers twelve
thousand emails a month so that's not
bad for free and then when you have to
pay you can see unlimited email
subscribers look too I guess that's
additional over the free I don't know
that doesn't make a whole lot of sense
to me they should be a little bit clear
on that anyway it doesn't matter on so
MailChimp that was probably easier than
you guys setting up a mail server so
instead of an account they give you an
API and everything that you can then end
up using and that's where you end up
putting that in here but that's all
integrated for you as well as if you
were looking to do that as far as adds a
lot of you guys want to monetize your
content so it's important to be able to
inject some of the actual google adsense
ads so that's where you would do it here
if you want in your header and you know
before your comment and before the
comment so those are the typical areas
that you know that would draw attention
but nobody clicks on ads unfortunately
but if you do have a nav lots of views
and you can probably make some money on
Adwords or a lab sense actually so guys
I'm approaching the 20-minute mark and
that's usually where I try to end these
videos because I know a lot of people
don't have time to watch longer videos
in that book make sure you guys check
out the monstroids template if you want
they have their own set of instructions
that we find that these instructions are
very good because I was just messing
with the template myself pretty much
reviewing it to see how I liked it but
if you but if you want to do if you
actually purchased a you have actual
documentation on the Montford web and
finally if you're interested on it can
be purchased as well through template
monster com alright guys make sure you
