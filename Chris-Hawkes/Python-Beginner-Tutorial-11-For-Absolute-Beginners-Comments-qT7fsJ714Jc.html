need to touch on comments and this is
something that's relatively a very well
minor not very difficult and something
that you see in the code and it's
important that I actually go over this
with you if you're actually going to
learn how to to program and start
contributing to other people's stuff and
that is commenting so what does comments
use for in programming and it's used for
documentation it's it's for telling
other developers and yourself three
months down the road when you're looking
at the code again what each section is
responsible for and in addition to that
we're going to get into more complex
stuff like functions and classes and
future videos and a lot of those
functions and things within Python need
to be documented so that you know it's
just it's clear what type of data needs
to be passed into the functions whether
it's a number or string and things like
that so all of that stuff is what Python
comments are used for and there's two
ways to do comments in Python the most
common way is to use the pound symbol so
anything inside this pound symbol is
just a this is a this is a personal
comment and you could have if you need
to do in the next line next line so what
this does is Python completely ignores
this as soon as it gets to the pound
sign you don't need to some people do -
some people do three like or three or
four
it depends just however you like to
style it we just need one pound and then
anything after that is just ignored so
that is the one and the most primary way
of doing Python comments the other is
called the multi-line comments so if you
didn't want to have to do a pound sign
for each each newline if you have like a
paragraph of comments that you have to
do that's when you would do the triple
quote and then anything anything inside
here is ignored by Python so those are
those are multi-line so if you had a big
paragraph that you needed to display
then all of this would be ignored so
when we run this Python is just going to
oh we're still in the saw infinite loop
by the way from my last video all right
guys so that's it that's comments in
Python thanks for watching and
have a good day bye hey guys so a lot of
you asked me how do I get my foot in the
door to become a programmer and I just
want to take a moment to mention dev
Mountain coding boot camp is a 12-week
intensive course that focuses on the
technologies of the here-and-now for web
development some of the things that
they're actually teaching in this
12-week course it's geared to get you
into the industry by focusing on things
like jQuery nodejs
react angular how to use github so a lot
of the things that you're going to need
to do as a developer as soon as you
start they're going to be teaching you
in this and this coding bootcamp and the
entire goal is to be able to get you
into the industry within 12 weeks so if
you guys are interested in learning more
information about dev Mountain coding
boot camp just check out the link in the
description tab of this video thank you
for watching and have a good day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
