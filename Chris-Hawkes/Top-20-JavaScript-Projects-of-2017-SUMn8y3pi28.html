list for JavaScript projects for 2017
there's no single source of information
that you can go to to get some sort of
top 20 list a lot of people tell you not
to jump around from thing to thing but I
just wanted to comprise a list of
projects in the JavaScript community
that that I feel like are going to be
relatively popular into 2017 some of
these projects I plan to work with some
of them I don't some I already do but
these are just one person's thoughts so
if anybody doesn't you know respect
everyone I listen to it that's fine I
totally understand but let me go ahead
and just get into this list here so
number 20 I have angular 1 I feel like
angular it has been doomed to just
become irrelevant ever since angular 2
came out and angular 2 has over shouted
angular 1 for quite some time now and I
really feel like angular 1 is not going
to be a hot language or project to learn
and 2017 number 19 is passport passport
if you're going to do any sort of
authentication or authorization
especially with knowjust and this is
like your go-to project for any sort of
integration like that it works very well
with Express and other frameworks and
definitely check that out number 18 is
pug this used to be the Jade template
engine which ships with the expressjs
framework by default for nodejs
I don't know why they changed their name
from Jade to pub but for whatever reason
they did I haven't really cared enough
to look it up but they did change the
name number 17 socket IO so if you're
going to be doing any sort of
synchronous to wait chat communication
like any sort of you know web client or
chat client or anything like that you're
going to be checking out this project
you can use it with uh with node really
any node framework out there but so and
I must say I want to mention too that
some of these technologies are not new
and it doesn't mean that they're new to
2017 but this is just my thoughts and on
what is you know what pops out in my
mind is some of the relevant stuff
number 16 is jasmine so this is the for
the longest time I feel like the the go
to JavaScript testing framework so if
you need it if you're just a indie
developer you probably want to get in
the habit
how do I set up Jasmine how do I use it
to run some tests because when you get a
job in the corporate world you're going
to be expected to test your JavaScript
code and and Jasmine is one of the most
tried and true testing frameworks out
for the JavaScript language so this
actually has a built in like test runner
it can run in the browser by default and
just just works extremely well for
testing anyway number 15 is Falkor and
this is going to be like the newest
piece of tech that I have on this list I
believe but this is actually a new
project that's being built in in regards
to how you structure your jason your
json data your api so it's much more
than that but netflix is actually
actually developing it right now and
some people say that it could be like
the next big project that we hear about
a lot next year that you know
everybody's going to be looking to try
to integrate Falkor into their next
project number 14 is quill i've actually
talked about this recently on another
video but quill digest is a WYSIWYG
which allows you to have much prettier
you know display of your your text and
your fonts and everything from within
your blog so a lot of people turn to
like a wordpress and they download a
theme a lot of people use platforms like
medium because medium provides this nice
fluid UI quill offers that same type of
thing but you can just pop quill into
your Django site your Ruby site your
nodejs site it doesn't matter and you'll
still have you know really pretty fluid
UI so definitely check out that project
I feel like that is going to be a pretty
pretty big thing moving forward number
13 is vue jf so a lot of people are
talking about via j/s and it's almost
like it's taking the react type approach
where when angular one came along
everybody you know once you started
getting into the real heavy duty
projects with angular 1 things started
to fall apart and and that's really
where like it started started to show
its warts with when react came along
they basically said hey we're not trying
to do everything i angular is trying to
do we're just going to do the view and
then here it's almost like view was like
you know what we're even calling our
name view but view j/s is
is a view library for it is very similar
to react but probably less complicated
from what I've seen so far view is
something that I do plan on checking out
but I haven't really done much work with
it yet number 12 is a d3 so this isn't a
new library either but if you're going
to be using like flowcharts bar graphs
anything like that then d3 allows you to
have a lot of it allows you to express
your data and some very creative and
very complex ways so there's as far as I
know there's no successor and there's no
alternative to what de3 is doing and has
been doing for several years now number
11 is 3 Jas so 3 unfortunately you know
I've been wanting this project to really
take off but I just don't see a whole
lot of going on with WebGL but if you're
going to talk about WebGL then you have
to talk about 3 Jas so if for anybody
that doesn't know WebGL is basically the
OpenGL graphics specification that was
introduced into the browser city you
could do 3d complex 3d gaming and things
like that within the browser it's a very
complicated process and it's something
that has taken a long time to catch on
and 3 Jas is probably the most
influential project in that open-source
standard of trying to provide better
tools to work with WebGL number 10 is
mocha this is actually another testing
framework that everybody seems to be
turning to recently they're kind of
moving away from jasmine and moving
towards mocha and a lot of the reasons
for that is because mocha doesn't try to
do everything that Jasmine does and a
lot of people like that and I've talked
about this in videos as well when you
have too much boilerplate versus too
much magic and for people that say Jah
people would say Jasmine has too much
magic in mocha just slightly more
boilerplate less going on underneath the
covers and much more customizable so
there's all kinds of stuff including
like an assertion library that comes
included with phantom jazz mocha it
doesn't have a certian library they
expect you to use this China Jas or they
don't expect you to use anything you can
use whatever you want and that's some of
the
the benefits of mocha but most people
use Choji s to do their test assertions
but you can heavily customize it you see
mocha popping up all over the place is
people's default testing framework
number nine is angular 2 a lot of people
would probably expect this to be a
little bit higher on my list and and I
really feel like you know with the whole
typescript thing versus Babel that I'm
not really sure that angular 2 is going
to going to blow up I do think it's
going to be relatively popular but I'm
not sure that everybody is jumping on
the angular 2 bandwagon right this
second just based on the fact oh you
know what happened the first go-around
so to date I haven't seen any overly
impressive apps with it with angular and
I really feel like angular 2 kind of
reinvented itself because of what react
was doing and and felt intimidated
probably by Facebook's react project and
then decided to do a complete rewrite so
since that time and it's been years now
I just I feel very uneasy about angular
number eight is a moment jeaious and
this is also not a new library but
anytime you're gonna be dealing with
time dates and everything like that
moment J s is the best framework out
there for that type of stuff so I I
can't think of anything better than that
number seven is redux and Redux is is
gaining a lot of traction now most
people associate redux with react but
Redux can actually be used for all kinds
of different frameworks it doesn't have
to be used with just react but react
with redux is becoming a pretty popular
option for a lot of web developers out
there and the JavaScript community and I
expect that to continue into 2017
number six is MongoDB not really a
JavaScript language and of itself but as
far as you know the whole mean stack
which is MongoDB and angular or you know
Express or Express and you can use
angular react review but MongoDB is it's
a no sequel database and it's all about
you're storing JSON documents and a web
server so or a database server and
MongoDB is like hand-in-hand with
a lot of nodejs framework so if you look
at a web framework like meteor Jas last
time I checked they only worked with
MongoDB so I mentioned it here is
definitely something that people have to
understand in the JavaScript community
is going to be relatively important
number five is the Express Jas framework
I actually created my own framework just
kind of messing around and trying to
learn nodejs myself I called it base ijs
but really it pales in comparison to
what Express does you know as I started
building my own framework I just kind of
started realizing that I was building a
lot of what Express does and Express is
a relatively minimalistic framework it
compares more to something like Python
flask as opposed to Python Django it
doesn't try to do everything for you you
can plug and play all kinds of different
things like template engines databases
things like that and it's just it's
really the go-to framework web framework
for any sort of node.js application
number four is web pack web pack is is
extremely popular we've heard so much
about browserify and Bower all these
different things like gulp a lot of
people using gulp with browserify or
common js2 to load modules and things
like that but everybody seems to be
turning to web pack when it comes to
just setting up a config and getting web
pack to do all the complex module
loading and unbundling that we need for
our JavaScript applications so
definitely web pack is a must learn in
2017 number three is Babel and I put
babel on here because it's really the
alternative to using something like
typescript and I think Babel is going to
end up winning out over typescript but
I'm not a hundred percent sure about
that actually I in fact I just kind of
said that it as I'm saying it I actually
don't I have no confidence in saying
that I think it's it's like a 50/50 race
between Babel and typescript of what
people are going to end up choosing in
the long run I think if I had to do a
slight advantage it would be to Babel
because typescript is just you know
quite a bit different than than what you
know people you're just actually writing
JavaScript for doing so but I definitely
don't
III think that angular
- and typescript is going to be a pretty
big option as well the typescript isn't
JavaScript and I didn't include that in
this list so Babel is uh is definitely
though I think a must learn in 2017
number two is react and and the react is
out you know obviously everybody's heard
of react been around for several years
now but it's more popular now than it
ever was and I think a lot of that has
to do with a lot of people being burned
on the whole angular thing they get into
angular and they realize that their
framework becomes unwieldy they don't
understand what the hell's going on
angular has a lot of different like
branded topics and-and-and names and
things like that and and people just
didn't like all the complexity and they
then you know I think a lot of people
realize that that we're headed towards
this web component based system of you
know as the web grows and expands and
and reacts so far does that better than
anybody so when it comes to like a web
component with a expose alais P I then I
think react definitely does the best job
there now number one is probably going
to shock you guys but it's jQuery the
reason why it's jQuery is because jQuery
is still used all over the freaking
place a lot of the samples of how do I
accomplish this or that it's all jQuery
on Stack Overflow and things like that
and and to be honest it's it's it's a
relatively large library but guys this
is really really important even still so
it's not going to go anywhere anytime in
2017 I expected to continue to be a
widely used library for a lot of your
your Dom manipulation and and if you're
like me I'll use jQuery with reactor
with angular or whatever I'm using I
have no problems using jQuery it's it
makes life a lot easier as a web
developer and it has for quite some time
and I really feel like if there was one
javascript language or framework that I
had to use in 2017 versus all these
other ones I would choose jQuery because
I could actually make a complex fluid UI
using something with just like Django or
flask with jQuery making Ajax calls to
my back-end API and I could still make
it fluid and nice I don't need to have
any one of these frameworks if I have
jQuery
so anyway that's my thoughts guys let me
know what you think please leave
comments and description tabs hey guys
so a lot of you asked me how do I get my
foot in the door to become a programmer
and I just want to take a moment to
mention dev Mountain coding boot camp is
a 12-week intensive course that focuses
on the technologies of the here-and-now
for web development some of the things
that they're actually teaching in the
Suevi course it's geared to get you into
the industry by focusing on things like
jQuery nodejs react angular how to use
github so a lot of the things that
you're going to need to do as a
developer as soon as you start they're
going to be teaching you in this and
this coding bootcamp and the entire goal
is to be able to get you into the
industry within 12 weeks so if you guys
are interested in learning more
information about dev Mountain coding
boot camp just check out the link in the
description tab of this video thank you
for watching and have a good day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
