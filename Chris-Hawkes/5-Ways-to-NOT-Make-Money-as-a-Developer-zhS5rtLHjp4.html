going to be talking about 5 ways to not
make money as a developer so a lot of
videos out there telling you how to make
money how to be a developer all this
other stuff and everything and you guys
if you've known my channel for any
amount of time you've known that I've
said first and foremost I don't have the
answers so a lot of people are like hey
you got a job you don't have a
programming degree or a degree at all
and you're still programmer and things
like that so you know they look to try
to repeat that success and unfortunately
a lot of times when you're trying to
repeat somebody else's success it's
already you know too late or it's just a
different situation and things like that
so I'm not saying that somebody can for
that don't even have an easier time than
I did it's just that nobody has those
answers so this is just 5 5 things that
I quickly thought of you know in
somewhat of a joking sense but also you
know in a very real sense as well so let
me go ahead and get started first one is
follow the advice of fake programmer so
you know unfortunately if somebody
doesn't have a programming job they've
never had a software development job
they never worked for a major
corporation or even a start-up for that
matter and when I'm talking about
startup I'm talking about more than just
some simple web development oh
hey I downloaded a template and
installed it for some pizza shop down
the street you know that's more
consulting you know work now
being a real developer like you're
working for large code bases you know
multi-million dollar projects developers
are making quite a bit of money because
they have to know quite a bit about what
they're doing so you follow advice
you're going to really you know you
follow there's a career or somebody has
a career then you're probably going
to have a time as well so they're
just there's so many resources out there
that are they're telling people how to
find success and they don't even have
success themselves and that's one of the
things that I think just gives the
entire internet and really everybody a
bad name myself included and one of the
reasons why it you know sometimes ii
guess even what i've done in the past as
well just because like i said i can't
guarantee success for anybody so spend
time on up work or the like so i've
actually registered to sites like i work
in the
when I was you know basically
considering this I go you know I can do
this scripture that's correct or digital
to work and things like that but the
fact that matter is those sites or
they're just a race to the bottom
they're putting you up against some of
the poorest countries in the world where
people literally will work for peanuts
so the work for $5 puta pie had that
that video that had a lot of controversy
where he paid somebody five dollars on
sivir
hour five or whatever the is called
to basically hold up Nazi and racist
slogans on the side of a street corner
and these people were willing to do it
for $5.00 now he was an asshole for
doing that because clearly people you
know are very you know very poor and
five dollars goes a long way in some of
those countries but the problem is is
that you know in the United States if
you don't if you don't have a hundred
thousand dollars a year in the United
States as a family you're not doing very
well so middle class is anywhere from
probably like 70,000 and you know
upwards to about 120 550 or so and for
most places around any major
metropolitan area you kind of need that
amount otherwise you know you're not
you're going to be hard for us to have
you know new cars vacations and things
like that so you know and that's kind of
you know that sounds real shitty but
that's kind of the American dream is to
be able to do all that kind of stuff and
and it's not just America but you know
it's basically most industrialized
countries whether you're in North
America South America or even you know
Europe and in other places so there
that's just the fact though there that
those up works and up work sites and
things like that to me I find them to be
a big fat waste of time surefire way of
not making any money because they'll
tell you don't you'll be like don't sell
yourself short on one of those sites so
if you don't sell yourself short you're
not going to get any calls anyway so go
ahead and you know waste your time and
give it a try but you know if your eyes
yeah it's not going to be very good time
next spend time building a product you
won't be able to complete so I've
actually made this mistake many times in
the past where I'm spending a lot of
time I can say in the amount of time
building a product that just isn't
feasible I don't have the capital I
don't have the you know the even the II
doesn't know how or the programming
resources in order to
make something of reality a lot of times
we don't look into the actual
infrastructure and how much certain
things cost to Billy get off the ground
and and for that reason if we're if
we're spending time on those products
unless we're trying to build our skills
we're wasting our time so you know it is
great like you learn a lot from failures
and things like that but you shouldn't
be failing on something that wasn't
sustainable in the first place there
wasn't even a remote reality the
unfortunate thing about about that
though and this is something I've
learned along the way is like you want
to be a dreamer but at the same time you
know these these these failed dreams
give you a much greater perspective on
what's actually possible and what's not
possible now there's always you know
that one in a billion or one in a
million shot which if you're like me
like you don't want to rely upon those
one-in-a-million shot so you want to
have something much more surefire you
know one in ten shot to succeed
something like that which even that is
terrible odds but it was like is that
reference from the Titanic movie where
the main character Jack was downstairs
with the aristocratic ristic kateri over
suppression being a risky cat from the
Disney movie pennyweight aristocrats
from you know the from England in the
United States and my girl
you know very super rich and his
character is not and the one rich guys
like he's like I we like to define our
own luck and things like that so
basically these guys are making the
rules and you know playing by their own
rules and things like that but the point
is is that you want to obviously create
your own luck you don't want to rely
just on you know some sort of miracle
chance that your products going to
succeed or you're going to have success
so the next one is start a blog and this
is also for like a vlog youtube channel
it's great I think it's great for
marketing it's been great for me
obviously but I've also put in over four
years of effort into this channel so if
you're just like starting off if you're
think that you're going to make money as
a developer trying to be a YouTube star
or something like that and definitely go
out and make your channel and you know
do what you can to try to promote
yourself but I would say it - my advice
is to use it more as a portfolio
which is what I even consider this
channel even though it does bring in
income and things like that it is
definitely more of a portfolio than it
is any sort of thing that I rely upon to
feed my children or pay my mortgage or
anything like that so you know
definitely use social media to your
advantage but the funny thing is I've
actually talked to younger children in
fact my daughter had a friend that his
actual plan was to be a youtube star so
like that is like a terrible plan that
is one of the worst plans I can ever
think of for my children or anybody that
I care about to have I think it's great
to pursue it but if that's like your
dream in life I mean I don't know man
there's the size it's an interesting
world that we're living in for sure the
final one is live in the middle of
nowhere so unfortunately like the tech
centers are there in selected areas I
say around the country within you know
they obviously United States is what I'm
talking about since that's where I'm
located but you know being being if
you're not established already as a
programmer it's hard for you to live in
the middle of bumfuck nowhere USA like
it's much easier for you to be able to
network and find opportunities because
networking personal networking is one of
the best ways in order to be able to
find jobs in fact even now like I mean
it's through networking through personal
connections that I feel like I would
have no problem finding a job anywhere
but that is the most important thing to
actually know people that can get you in
the door or get you past that whole HR
experience because you know it that it's
just so much easier that way otherwise
your your resume could be lost in a
stack of thousands so so if you live in
like I said in the middle of nowhere
then it's gonna be much harder be real
and network you know some sort of you
know middle like middle Georgia area is
not gonna have a bunch of tech meetups
and stuff like that compared to you know
DC New York City's Silicon Valley like
things like that so I would definitely
say you know trying to if you have the
ability to relocate to an area where
there's more opportunity I mean that's
clearly that's always been the recipe
for success if you look at like Los
Angeles or trying to get on Broadway if
you're going to be on Broadway or
something like that you're going to New
York City if you're trying to get into
Hollywood you're going to LA and that's
what people do and
you know a lot of times they go out
there and I don't find any success so
it's not like it's a surefire way but
once again you're gonna have a much
harder time in the middle of Georgia now
even even though we're all socially
connected via the internet now and we do
have the ability to communicate with
each other it's still very difficult to
build business connections and be able
to get capital and things like that when
you can't meet people face-to-face and
and you don't have connections around
even bill to help you get things off the
ground and things like that so those are
just a five quick things like I said
that I thought of that that can be a
surefire way of not making money in this
industry all right guys thanks for
