we're talking about isomorphic
JavaScript and what that means is
nowadays when you have modern websites
you have you have servers that are
actually well let me let me back up for
a moment so a lot of websites nowadays
are using nodejs or using JavaScript on
just not just a client-side now but also
on the server side but the problem was
something like requesting a web page and
then having all of your content built
after the page has been requested is
that a lot of the search engines weren't
able to read what the page was about
they were looking for the old-school
source code to start looking through
titles and texts on the page in order to
figure out what it was all about but
with with JavaScript rendering and the
browser it means that the page has to be
requested code has to be fired off and
then it's built inside the browser and
search engines weren't waiting for that
process to happen in many cases they
didn't even have the capabilities have
been able to understand you know how to
how to actually process the JavaScript
and and work with it now from what I
understand google has made a lot of
headway and understanding how dynamic
JavaScript based websites are basically
they're having a better idea on how to
read them in order to place them in the
right search results and all this stuff
but I'm not a hundred percent sure you
know how come well I'm really I'm not
confident that they can do that at all
I'm really not but I'm even less
confident that a company like Microsoft
with Bing can do it properly so a lot of
people were saying well you need to be
able to render this JavaScript on the
server and then pass down the render
JavaScript at least initially so that
the search engines could have a greater
idea on what the website was about so
this is a website that actually built
for a friend of mine so the the website
here is is using nodejs and it also uses
react in fact react is being rendered on
the server so it's using isomorphic
JavaScript so what you get back is if I
looked at the page store
it's all jumbled into this thing there's
no format to it whatsoever all this was
rendered on the fly on the server when
the page was requested if I inspect and
I look at the actual elements here you
can see that it's a little bit more
structured there but what's interesting
about this is that it's not coming down
as an HTML page if we look at the web
server this is what's going on here it's
a it's a relatively simple site it's in
fact it's a single page and you can see
that it's using a nodejs but here's the
the key here is that it's using a view
engine the JSX view engine and it uses
this express react fuse which is an open
source project to be able to take JSX
code which is reacts JSX code and then
break it down into raw JavaScript and
then send it down to the server but
instead of just sending the JSX code to
the server it's actually all being
executed and the HTML that comes out of
the JSX javascript code is then sent
down but the good news is for search
engines is that they're able to parse it
now it's a relatively rough around the
edge so I didn't spend a ton of time but
you can see it's using react and then it
has this default layout because I
figured that it would have more pages
eventually but really it doesn't need to
be me anything more than just a single
page at this point plus I'm not getting
paid for it and you know I need to get
paid if I was going to continue to do a
lot of work on this thing but this is
the default layout so the default layout
this is how you actually call the master
page and the instant master page is
being rendered here so if we look at the
master page it's essentially the main
page that see it has all the information
inside of here but all this stuff this
isn't HTML if you notice closely this is
actually called JSX so it has no it
looks very similar to HTML but it's not
you can see like it's using class name
instead of class and a lot of different
different things going on in there but
ultimately though this is all being
rendered so it all gets built and
rendered on the fly whenever it's
requested and the only problem with
something like this is that typically
react is more you know built towards
components and things like that and then
one
you have the HTML page down it's like
well then you still want to be able to
have little you know components that are
communicating with the server and stuff
like that it just it takes a little bit
more planning I think and I don't know
in some ways that kind of sucks like the
kind of holes that are the hoops that
we're jumping through as developers
these days to do stuff that you know
simple template engines can just handle
for us you know we make life a little
bit more difficult it seems like at
times so I mean this site's not bad I
mean it's not it's not the greatest
thing but it's a it's definitely not bad
but it's it's a bit of a process because
if this thing became more complex and I
have to have you know some some of the
Java
HTML is going to be rendered via
isomorphic JavaScript others is going to
be passed down and calling plugins and
rendered after the page has been
requested and it's like we do all of
this stuff just so that Google can
understand it a little bit better in my
opinion Google needs to understand how
JavaScript sites are executed and we
don't have to worry about this nonsense
but either way that's just my opinion
and I'm sure we'll get there eventually
if we're not there already but people
had asked me to talk about isomorphic
JavaScript I'm not a master with it but
this is the extent of my experience with
isomorphic JavaScript all right guys
thanks for watching have a good day bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
