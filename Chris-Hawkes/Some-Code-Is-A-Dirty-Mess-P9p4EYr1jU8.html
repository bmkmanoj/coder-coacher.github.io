a pretty scene from nature and just hear
me out on this for a second this this
river right here is the Rappahannock
River so it flows down through the
Fredericksburg region this was actually
a major river the data crossover during
the American Civil War and it wasn't
exactly easy when you have like cannons
and you got to try to get across
the freezing cold river but anyway I
kind of equate something like this to
like a coding project where it's like I
used to get and I still do I'll get
really excited about you know some sort
of new open source project or some you
know some new you know code line or
something and generally I get excited
because I'm like man it looks like this
you know this luscious great product
that i can i can just you know I do
whatever I need to do or it's like an
open field we're basically I can just
run and there the world is the
possibility you can do whatever you want
with it basically I love to sg's new
technologies and these new frameworks
and things like that and I try to
immediately think how can I take it and
how can I make something you know good
from and how can I make something new
and better my situation in my life or
maybe i'll make the next Facebook with
it or something like that but often
times though what you see is not what
you get I mean so even right here like
this this looks like a nice little
pretty scenery and everything but what
we fail to see sometimes when you're
looking at the bootstrap page that
describes all the benefits of the
framework is you actually you fail to
see that this this area right here is
covered in ticks right there's
mosquitoes flying around this bitch
there's snakes along the shoreline it's
muddy as hell I don't want my dog to
swim in the water because there's
actually quite a bit of pollution
sitting inside the water in fact I just
read a sign that they just put up just
recently where it says that the fish
contain PCBs and that you shouldn't eat
more than two fish a month or some
because of all the pollution that's in
this river and honestly it's the same
damn thing with code lines just because
you see some pretty bootstrap theme we
all we often fall for that like you
know we're going to be jumping on the
redox bandwagon or this bandwagon or
that bandwagon and hey look it's got
this reputable site and it's got a bunch
of stars on github and but we fail
to see the the you know the hidden I
think the hidden issues you know what I
mean like so this you know this serene
looking environment here which looks
very very serene I do think it looks
pretty and everything but I know that
there's pollutants all in this water I
know that there's snakes along this
bitch I've seen water moccasins along
the shoreline in fact one time I saw a
rabid raccoon walking right down the
shore when one I actually and my brother
were down here one time and with bayside
actually and this one I'd raccoon was
just like staggering through the path I
mean I knew he was rabid he was just he
was out of his mind probably in the late
stages of rabies I would imagine but
anyway I just thought it was a good
example I often see like you know like
open fields and I you know these uh
these flowing valleys and stuff like
that and I'm like man it would just it
just seems like you know you think of
like a woods that Disney movie where
that lady's just running for some field
and you think of the same thing with
with code lines and all the
possibilities but then here's like man
you know what I probably be itchy as
 running through that field I'd
probably have a million ticks on me and
there's probably snakes and spiders and
 shoes so oh man yes sometimes what
you see is not what you get encoding and
i just thought i'd share that with you
guys alright let me know what you think
have a good night guys bye hey guys so i
just want to take a moment to give a
shout out to my sponsor dev mountain
coding boot camp make sure you guys
check out their website we've talked a
lot about whether or not the college
degree is worthwhile and people have
asked me that and you probably shouldn't
even be asking me that because I don't
know that anybody has the answer to that
but I can tell you that with the
technologies that are being taught in
school and typically you know for a
hundred-thousand-dollar four-year
universities you know people are finding
as they come out that they're not really
ready for
the IT world and that they're actually
learning a lot more from within the the
workforce and that's probably the case
with a lot of things but with IT it's
even more so because technology changes
so fast so with coding boot camps like
dev mountains they teach you
technologies that you're going to use
right away in the job force and the idea
is to get you into the industry as soon
as possible they're going to use stuff
that's like that is being used
everywhere even things like jQuery where
you might be hearing you know a ton
about this or that or I mean they're
going to be teaching a lot of this and
that that is you know of right now but
also a lot of what is being used in the
workforce so they're their entire goal
is to get you into the workforce as soon
as you complete the program so make sure
you check out the description links that
I provide in there for a dev mountain
for all my videos they have the links in
the description alright guys thanks for
watching and please subscribe bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
