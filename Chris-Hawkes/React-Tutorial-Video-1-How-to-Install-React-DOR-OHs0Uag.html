getting started with react series for
hipster code calm and a few pre
prerequisites that you're gonna need in
order to succeed in this course you need
to have no js' installed on your machine
I'm going to be using Windows but it
doesn't matter if you're using something
else it shouldn't change too much from
what we're doing most people do use
Windows as an operating system even and
2016 so here's nodejs if you install it
it includes a package manager which is
called NPM and NPM is used to install
all kinds of different stuff on your
machine the next thing you need is you
need to have a editor a text editor
where you're going to write your code
and a place to store the code so I'm
gonna put everything in this new move a
new music project and it's just a folder
inside my C Drive so if you can see here
I have a C projects and then new music
so I'm putting all my files here for the
tutorial inside of this the you know
this directory here so we'll be good to
go the next thing is there's other
tutorials available on hipster code I'm
adding more all the time so if you want
to check out more tutorials for me just
go to this website everything on here is
gonna be from me for the most part so
the next thing is let's take a look at a
few things first of all I wanted to
explain that we're going to be using
react and the modern way to use react is
now using webpack as a module bundler so
it takes a bunch of different react
modules and it puts them all into one
file making things easier to deal with
react uses something called JSX which is
similar to JavaScript it's almost like a
Java Script a XML HTML combo but
basically you write HTML and in
JavaScript format but all JSX does is it
gets compiled down to raw JavaScript the
way to compile it down to raw JavaScript
is to use Babel and Babel is also it
also allows you to write in the latest
standards of ECMO script 2015 and what
that is is it's the modern version of
JavaScript so not the modern version of
JavaScript is not supported in all
browsers but babel allows you to write
it in a way that is futuristic but then
boils down to JavaScript that works and
older browsers as well the next thing
you need is the editor so atom editor is
the editor that I use to write code it's
just free you can download it to windows
no big deal and you'll be good to go
there so first things first I want to go
ahead and I have this directory open
which is the new music directory you can
see when I do a search on it that
there's nothing in it so it's empty and
what we're gonna do is we're going to
use NPM and we're gonna say I'm it and
what this does is it creates a JSON
config file and Jason is just a XML
successor essentially to transmit data
it stands for JavaScript object notation
but you don't really need to know that
what we're gonna do here is just press
enter for all this stuff and we're gonna
put my name as the author you can put
your own name if you want and then we
say yes and what this does it creates
this package JSON folder so when we
start installing dependencies those
dependencies will go inside of the
config and the reason for that is we
could take the entire directory with the
package config and put it on somebody
else's computer or some other server and
if we type NPM install NPM is going to
keep track of all the dependencies of
that project so it makes it much easier
to transmit to other projects so what we
need to do is go ahead and start using
NPM to install all the dependencies that
we need for this project to run so we're
gonna say npm install saved so - I even
say if I've you know I just - I haven't
saved I'm worried about dev and now
we're gonna add a bunch of stuff here
we're gonna install babel core and then
we're gonna install babel loader make
sure all this is separated by a space
the next next one we want to do is babel
- preset - es2015 next one's gonna be
babel pipe and preset - react I'm just
putting spaces between all of these next
we want to do es6 promise so promises or
something that's added to echo script 6
but most browsers don't support it so
that's why we needed here now we're
going to have react dom and before I
even
son of a bitch I'm gonna have to type
all that again you know this is raw and
uncut I'm just gonna go ahead and
install web pack first so do this NPM -
- I'm sorry NPM install - - save and
we're gonna install web pack first the
reason why we want to do this is because
web pack is gonna be one of these
packages in here is gonna have a
dependency on web pack and NPM is gonna
it's going to fail the install because
it doesn't have the dependency it needs
so if we tried to do it the way I was
just doing it we're gonna run into that
problem I didn't think about that until
late but you know there's gonna be some
mistakes throughout this tutorial hope
you guys can forgive me because I'm
human but let me know and I'll
understand if you want to work on
something else or watch another video
but anyway so we're gonna go ahead and
do what we were doing before where I say
NPM install save now the web pack is
installed able core Babel loader Babel
preset es2015 Babel preset react es6
promise react and react if you ever
wondered why I react and react are now
two separate projects it's because ever
since react came out with a new react
native project they wanted to keep all
the Dom rendering stuff out of the react
library separated from everything else
because react is now more than just Dom
manipulation so they created essentially
a few separate projects so if you're
using it for like the you know the Dom
manipulation which is what most people
use react for then you would definitely
want to use the react down library
otherwise it wouldn't work so we'll see
here as we get further and further end
of this so this thing installed a ton of
stuff for us which is cool and now that
we have that that should be everything
we need so in the next video I want to
get into how we actually configure web
pack to you
to work with react alright guys thanks
for watching and I will see you in the
next module</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
