video I talked about whether or not a
college degree was necessary for
computer science and I admit that the
title was a little bit inflammatory when
i first posted it so i went ahead and
adjusted it because you know i'm not
trying to knock anybody that has a
hundred-thousand-dollar computer science
degree i'm really not my entire point
was just simply that there's a lot of
knowledge to be had out there on the web
nowadays when so some of the let's just
look at some of the examples one of the
guys that responded I'm had a pretty
decently written comment and was
basically saying that it requires a
bachelor's degree in order to write
architectural software so if you want to
be a software architect you need to have
a bachelor's degree at least because a
bachelor's degree apparently is going to
teach you how to write complex software
architecture and then like a PhD or
masters degree somewhere along those
lines I mean that's where you're kind of
writing the next cutting-edge thing and
for in many cases I think that there
that is probably you know the general
rule that when somebody is running very
complex software for a very you know
large company or come product that's
going to be used by millions of people
or military whatever whatever have you
the chances are pretty good that that
person is probably fairly well-educated
so I don't disagree with that whatsoever
I don't disagree with the fact that
you're going to get more theoretical
computer science knowledge at University
than you would on pluralsight but what I
was trying to say is that for me
personally speaking I worked with a lot
of really good developers that work with
several different companies and from
what I've seen out there in the real
wild is not this cutting-edge stuff that
people have to have some sort of
computer science degree in order to be
able to figure out one of the best
programmers I've ever worked with a guy
that's written software architecture for
quite some time now some of the smartest
guys I've ever worked with and he has a
degree in art and then there's another
guy that never took a college course and
his entire life and and he's also a
software architect so just right there
just in my own personal experience of
being an IT for not even that long I've
seen it firsthand that you don't have to
have a computer science degree in order
to write complex software that's used by
literally millions of people now I was
also making the example that back when I
didn't even know what I was doing when
it came to like Django I had a website
that was on actually I switched it off
the google app engine but i was writing
django code back then and the the
website was getting over 250,000 people
a month and it was on a stack of my
sequel I had engine X serving up static
content apache2 for engine X nor apache2
engine X was a reverse proxy server for
all the static content so I had this
entire stack set up right I had to set
up my OS and and set up my firewall
rules and basically I'm doing all of
this stuff and I'm reading write-ups
from linux communities and things like
that barely knowing what i'm doing but
smart enough to be able to figure out
okay these are the instructions that i
need to follow oh this doesn't work
ok what do i need to do why isn't this
working and that you get better at you
know i should go along in fact some of
the that i was writing last night
and earlier this morning that has
nothing to do with my day job or
anything else i'm working on this this
thing where i had to set up a reverse
proxy can web server in order to be able
to sniff out network traffic long story
short but basically there was no
documentation on anything that i was
working with and I mean I just had to
figure it out so am i considering myself
a genius no not really but I'm a
programmer who doesn't have a degree
who's been doing this for quite a
while and can look at stuff that doesn't
have any documentation and still figure
it out in fact not only that I was in
the C sharp rapper library changing the
 source code from something that
was written for years ago because the
 didn't work for HTTPS traffic it
wasn't able to sniff it out so that that
said I mean people can figure stuff out
like just because I didn't go to a
computer science course I take computer
science seriously in college or
something like that doesn't mean that
I'm not capable of doing it and it
doesn't take a genius either so genius
has exists out there and they never have
to go to college I understand that but
you don't have to be a genius to do a
lot of this stuff I mean look at this
logitech user interface and I'm looking
at right now logitech is probably is a
billion-dollar
I'm sure at least maybe not a billion
but I would imagine logitech is probably
done anywhere from fifty million dollars
in revenue or maybe profits I don't know
what their profit margin is but all I
know is that if you go to like any sort
of departments or logitech software is
there it's a pretty big manufacturing
and software company and the user
interface is relatively subpar so did it
take a PhD in order to build a subpar
user interface I don't know I really
don't but the fact of the matter is as I
personally work with some very smart
people that didn't have a bachelor's
degree when you talk about theoretical
computer science and things like that
where you start thinking it maybe even
likes courses like compiler courses and
such where you don't see a lot of that
in day-to-day communities like you know
what we have in the JavaScript world and
stuff like that but say you know you're
talking about building the next you know
let next compiler or something you're
obviously going to take a significant
amount of smarts and okay so you go to
rice university or you go to university
of chicago or Harvard or anywhere
Stanford okay so you go there but now
what I was trying to say is that that
we're moving into this new online
industry where you have Coursera where
you get your getting those professors
teaching the course to you in some cases
for free and then you can pay for the
optional certificate or whatever in
granted it's probably not as effective
as going to Stanford and sitting in a
class of 20 people and listening to the
professor on a weekly basis or what have
you but it's still relatively effective
and I have a hard time believing that
somebody sitting in the state of your
classroom is actually going to be able
to you know master everything they need
in the dragon book in order to write the
next C compiler that does a better job
than you know the Borland compilers and
all the other that we have out
there already so I don't know man i'm
not i'm not really buying it to be
honest with you i'm really not so i
stand behind the fact that you know
company shouldn't discriminate because
you don't have a degree if you could
show that you know what you're doing
then i think that that should be the
number one thing i mean it should be the
number one thing and if and another
person in fact the same dude was he made
point when he said that well actually he
made a misguided point and it was a
misguided comment along with a good
point but basically he said that if you
have a a company that doesn't value
college education like they're basically
a company well in some cases I
would say that that that is true like
right how many big companies out there
do not value a college degree I mean how
many companies at all do not value a
college degree I agree with that like
you would that's never the mindset you
would want to have of a corporation that
says oh you went to Princeton you're a
piece of like you never want to
work for somebody like that that's
that's crazy okay so but but on this at
the same token like if that company is
willing to say you know what we like to
have people with degrees but we're
willing to flex on these rules because
certain people have showed certain you
know either ambition or you know the
future growth or what-have-you I mean if
they show that they can that they can
learn and that they can do what you did
what it is you need to do then I think
you know that the companies can have the
best of both worlds of course they want
college degrees but but if they're
willing to flex on that did I say that
they're not a company I think
that's the light that's the ideal
company that's the company that people
should want to work for so yeah
misguided comment I'm not even sure
where you are because you were talking
about the American education system you
mentioned something like along the lines
of oh well if you're just like a code
monkey sitting in some corner office
writing JavaScript over the last four or
five years you're going to be out of a
job eventually now that's too
if you build yourself up a nice uh you
know business portfolio if you get
yourself involved in business and
analytics and also Jessia being you know
either a systems analyst or a business
analyst if you know typically
programmers aren't just programmers
they're not just code monkeys in the
business world like you are solving
complex business problems using IT and
programming related solutions so that's
actually what i consider myself I'm a
businessman first and a programmer
second so that's actually where I fit
right in I think
you know from a customer's perspective I
try to your stay in the cutting edge you
know what technology is in Erbil to help
me push you know a business agenda I own
my own business even this YouTube
channel shows some entrepreneurial
skills of trying to build something from
nothing so I don't know I think I think
it's that's a comment
like if I there was a company that
literally just wanted me to pound out a
ton of code day in and day out and not
really be able to put my int you know
any sort of insight into what I'm
building and stuff like that that's a
 company in my opinion so most
companies that I've seen that isn't the
case I mean you do get to you know you
get to have meetings you get to meet
with other departments you get to meet
with other companies in many cases and
try to build solutions and and and
that's key I think honestly that's it
it's really key so that comes with
experience and yeah that's definitely
that's key of my book programmer analyst
is what I like to be considered I like
to uh I like to build things you know
what I mean like I don't want to just
follow some schematic and I don't think
anybody's really doing that for the most
part even with our websites these days
with like bootstrap words I all we want
to use reactor we're going to use
angular or something like that there's
there's always something new to learn so
it's not like the next five years is
going to be JavaScript and it's all over
with that's that's completely ridiculous
yeah that's just ridiculous anyway guys
let me know what you think and have a
good night and stop staring at my notes
all right guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
