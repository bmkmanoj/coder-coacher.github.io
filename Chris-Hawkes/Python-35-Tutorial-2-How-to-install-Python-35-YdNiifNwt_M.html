need to go ahead and install Python so
we just need to go over to the
python.org downloads and then python 350
I'll provide this link in the the
description and we're going to use the
64-bit version the web-based installer
and we do want to add it to the path
so this is going to take just a few
minutes for it to install and I'll be
pausing the video in between well while
this thing installs so after it installs
it's going to ask you if you want to
restart and that really sucks so I'll go
ahead and just take care of that now all
right so now that the computer restarted
it seems like it's been an hour because
I didn't do a Windows Update and I could
not just jump right into this but anyway
so I'm after like an hour
this thing has restarted now and in
Python because of our installation
directory I put it under our users
directory so users and then your
username app data local programs Python
Python 35 now you notice if or if you
did notice that we did say add it to the
path which was a check box on the
install window and it did add it to the
path but the problem is if you have
multiple versions of Python like I do
you can see well actually I have Python
and multiples I have under my C Drive I
have both Python 27 and Python 3.4 and I
have it set up so that if I open up a
command prompt I can do it as admin or
not it doesn't really matter but I like
how admin has a bigger font adjusted for
me so I have if I type Python it's
actually going to find the first
available Python on the path which is 2
7 8 because I already had that installed
so what I want to be able to do is type
python 35 to be able to differentiate
between the two you shouldn't have to do
that if this is the only version of
python that you have but in my case it's
not so let me go back to that folder
where it installed 2 which is like I
said this huge long path and I want to
change the name of the Python
application here I'm just going to
rename it to Python 35 that way it's you
know 3.5 and hopefully people know that
so if I type now python 35 you can see
that it did find in the right python
location because this is the first
python application that matches any
other keyboard python 35 so anyway that
is how you're going to end up the
if you have multiple versions of Python
installed in your machine now Python
comes with an editor which is pretty
cool
now there's two things in Python so the
way we launched Python before this is
called our shell and we can actually
execute Python code from within this
little command line thing but it's I
guess it's efficient for just fast
calculations like eight times eight will
calculate the 64 so you can just I'm not
sure why you would ever want to do that
but I mean it is sometimes helpful I've
never really used it that way but it's
one of the selling points for some
reason so quick and dirty calculations
are quick and dirty test code this shell
is a good thing to use
now Python also has a built-in editor or
not really built-in but it comes with
the installation and an editor is a
program that you use to write code it
actually makes writing code a lot easier
there's very expensive editors I
actually recommend the one that I have
in the description which is pycharm
that's kind of the industry standard
with Python but I personally also like
Visual Studio because I use Visual
Studio for a lot of web based stuff a
lot of c-sharp stuff and it's really
just a superb application I'm not a big
you know Microsoft guy either so you
know I say that even though I don't
think Microsoft the end of the world of
Microsoft but the editor that comes with
Python is called idle it's not that
great but it is you know something it's
better than nothing and for the start of
this tutorial series we're going to be
using idle so idle can be found under
your install directory under the lib
folder which is short for a library and
inside of there you're going to see an
idle Lib so we're going to open that and
then if you're on Windows like I am you
need to go ahead and launch the there's
an idle like a what is the extension
here it's a pyw file or something let me
see
you
yeah pyw file so you're going to want to
not do the idle that py file but the
idle pyw and this is your editor now so
it actually starts by using the default
shell a shell format but what we can do
is we can actually create new files here
and then this gives us like Python so it
gives you the different color code and
stuff like that' actually makes
developing in python a little bit easier
so it's not the best editor but it is
good enough for getting your feet wet
with Python alright guys so this is a
video that's going to wrap up how to
actually install Python we're using
Windows but a similar process for Mac or
Linux and you know once again if you
have two versions of Python make sure
you rename python 35 so it can
differentiate itself from whatever sort
of older python installation you may
have all right guys thanks for watching
