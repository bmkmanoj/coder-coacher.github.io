kidding
I don't know I'm doing that all right so
I'm getting to do a tutorial and this
one is going to be on Python but I'm
going to do something a little bit
different basically just for like shit's
and gigs just kind of show you like okay
how am I going to approach a simple
problem and this is something that I
have not scripted at all whatsoever so
it's probably going to be very off the
cuff here but what I'm going to do is
just say we'll call this like jobs
finder that's the folder I'm going to
put inside my projects folder so I'm
going to open this folder in Visual
Studio code I do have Python installed
on this joint so I should be able to
create Python apps and stuff like that
so what I want to do though is I want to
install selenium for pipe so what I'm
going to do is open up a file explorer
to the location that I have jobs finder
CMD and that's going to CMD by the way
is a little shortcut on Windows you can
open up your command prompt mother open
up your command prompt to that file
location so you can see it here we have
nothing in here what I'm going to do is
tip not even have tip installed
yeah so obviously need to have Python
installed because otherwise you're
running on pip
so download and install python if you've
never done that before i have videos
guys python for absolute beginners I'm
not just saying how to plug my over
and over again but I will tell you these
videos are out of your menu get started
on this one make sure when you follow
this series that I'll be trying to get
up to date on Python that you click the
box to add Python to your path because
otherwise you're not going to find it
when you type eyes on it's not here know
what the you're talking about on
Windows unless you click that little box
so there's going to be an install
process you're going to want to follow
that all right so there's um there's
that okay so let's go ahead pip install
selenium alright so this is going to
download across the web it's going to
install selenium so now we can use it so
if I run Python I should be able to say
in for
selenium all right good so if you can do
that and there's no error messages in
you're good so we can press control Z
control or control Z and enter I think
it's out of there all right so now we
have that running let me go ahead and
see from within Visual Studio code if we
go ahead and create a test py file and
I'm just going to print your mom is hot
I'm sorry to anybody that might like not
you know not talking about your mom
especially if your mom passed away and
on I like that would be terrible
alright so if I go over here to the
little debugger within Visual Studio
code also you guys can get in to set up
on Visual Studio code I think I have a
video python for this hall I think I
have a video on that
that's Visual Studio don't get that
confused but anyway go to visual studio
code so I could type whatever it knows
are you talking about B download this
you download the Python by John Jemaine
plug-in and saw that extension and
you'll be good to go and you'll be ready
where I am here once again I have videos
in all this stuff so make sure if you
guys are just like picking up your Lego
I've never done anything and Python with
the am i doing go to that series
and watch that and you'll be good
alright so now that we have this test up
you want to actually get the debugger
working so I'm going to say you know
what added configuration I'm going to
look for Python alright and then
something tells me this isn't going to
work in it to make me mad but if we're
going to try it anyway so that I have
that that I'm just going to I can close
that file and now I should be able press
the play button if everything goes well
this thing is going to break on the
first one which is really annoying but
if I click play you're going to see to
the debug console the or the output will
really just a debug console your see
your mom is hot that printed it out
that's your Python program running so if
we don't want that stopping on the first
line what I can do is go over to the
files by clicking this little document
thing it shows you all your files in
here vs code creates it creates as vs
code folder
there's a large JSON which is JavaScript
stuff but don't worry about that but in
here there's going to be something like
stop on entry without that these Souls
so do we have more than one of those in
here I'm going to do that on all of
these control f is for find by the way
so that brings up your you can just
double click you can double click this
and then control C control f and it
should automatically put that in there
and you enter it and you can see false
alright so there's a bunch of these in
here so what I'm going to do is I'm
going to actually copy this entire thing
and if I do this I stay true which is
what it was before this is probably
really confusing for you guys but if you
don't want to do this you don't have to
but there's this Find and Replace all
which is really cool functionality and
you should probably learn something
schools to your advantage but you can
see and stop on entry true I could say
hey find all occurrences of this and
replace it with this bottom part so I'm
going to say false and then I can just
go over here where instead it's not this
one but this one whereas like multiple
it says replace all told and I did that
and it replaced every one of those stuff
entry true so if you ever find yourself
having to edit you know a lot of
manually and stuff like that it probably
means you're going about it wrong
unfortunately these kind of these little
tricks and stuff they they just come
about like if you're doing this all the
time most likely you're going to go
through and just you know change every
one of those truths to a fall so you'll
be good to go anyway by doing that
though we go back here if we click our
little debugger and click Play you can
see it's not stopping on the first line
or anything like that so we can just run
our program alright the next thing we
want to do is go to this website right
here which is chrome chromium and we
want to download the chrome driver the
latest version 2.30 because let's go
ahead and I since I'm on Windows I'm
going to grab the 32-bit chrome driver
for Windows and it's a zipped directory
so I'm going to put chrome driver in
fact we'll even copy this
entire thing and we're going to put it
inside of our projects directory where
our jobs finder code is I'm just going
to paste it right in there so there's
the chromedriver it's just an exe it's
an executable so it's standalone or just
run key all right so now now in order to
get started with selenium we need to go
ahead and import it at the top of our
file so we're just going to use this
test up py file that we have here and
I'm going to get rid of what we have a
for Wednesday from selenium and for
webdriver and you can see by the way if
it's giving you if it's
giving you suggestions as you type
that's good you can use that to your
advantage you can tell the imports and
then when I type web you can see all the
webdriver if you just press tab it'll
fill in the remaining one and also while
we're at it while you're typing
if I want to say you know it not
webdriver but while I can just use my
down keys to select one of these other
ones but we want webdriver so once we're
going to click tab and also I'm going to
disable this lender because it's
annoying as
I know a lot of you guys have told me
about that as well that thing is really
annoying
it didn't used to be a default but
linters are not important for people
just getting started really not
important there's probably some like you
know beautiful quote quality people out
there they're like oh that's terrible
things data but it's true alright so
let's go ahead and create our driver
variable driver equals web driver so
we're using our web driver dot Chrome
now here is the interesting thing we
need to actually spell out the location
to where the chrome driver file can be
found so the chrome drivers I don't have
to say DFC does that's the interesting
thing so they're programmer now we're
going to try and see if this path
because this is something that's called
a relative path and not an absolute path
meaning it's relative to where you are
in your current directory so this should
be the root directory of the project and
then this should be the root directory
and in chrome driver I think I'm always
bad about that sort of thing
but anyway let's read and do it driver
got kid and we're going to say HTTP WWII
wanted you guys are interested in seeing
more about tutorials I have like
everything there also subscribe to this
channel but let's go ahead and just play
this this thing real quick so if I go to
my debugger and click Play you need to
allow access on windows so I'm going to
do that you can see chrome just went
ahead and fire it up and just
immediately close so now if you don't
want that to happen
press f5 and by pressing f5 it's going
to run the program again but it's going
to close again you
alright to get out of that unnormal are
that annoying closing behavior if we
just go ahead and press control f5 to
run the project it'll actually keep the
chrome driver open which is what we want
so here you can see that we have the
window open now what's weird is like
it's not fullscreen so it'd be better if
it was like fullscreen by the way
there's the website that I own so make
sure you check it out for all my
tutorials and everything I used to pay
for writers and everything but I don't
do that anymore wasn't worse than
unfortunately and I was just losing
money every month so you guys could help
a brother out I appreciate it alright so
we want to make the thing fullscreen
what I'm going to do is say from
selenium-webdriver got chrome options
import options just like that alright
and now I need to go to instantiate an
object from that from this a chrome
option is my variable and I'm going to
instantiate the options class that we
just imported now I want to say chrome
options dot and arguments and then I'm
going to pass in the argument and the
argument is called start maximized so
I'm going to say ivan ivan start maxed
in
all right that should work but now we
need to say okay alright instantiate
Chrome I need to pass in my options I
can do it as a named argument ugly by
saying chrome options alright
nevermind I'll just say chrome options
equals mine chrome alright there we go
alright so chrome option is equals
chrome options hopefully that works I
don't know if that's going to work or
not it might you may not have to have
the name to argument there but we're
going to find out all right so here's
the chrome options and by doing that now
if we go ahead and press ctrl f5 again
and we run it did it work
control left on all right there we go
all right so yeah it's in full-screen
mode now so that's how we can do this in
full-screen mode
all right so let's see like okay so if I
was going to create a simple project to
say hey you know what I'm going to
monitor I want to monitor website for
job so let's say you know we're going to
say glass door what is it jobs are glass
or jobs so here's this page this is
going to be the page that we actually
end up loading up and we're going to say
so we'll paste that URL right in here we
only need one single quote on each side
so we're saying hey get that page once
you get that page we then need to
identify this location so what we're
going to do is we're actually going to
use something called an XPath so I'm
going to copy what I just when I'm using
Chrome own or right-click on this input
and you can see under the elements panel
of chrome debugger down here that you
have this this keyword so if I like if I
look at the name here or the ID I'm
going to look at the idea because I
these are supposed to be
so I'm like hey I want to fly this input
so I want to type something in here so I
could say driver dot find element I'm
going to say by XPath and then inside of
here I'm going to actually have my XPath
which is like that for forward slash
means I find the position anywhere in
the Dom where the ID matches the ID that
we just saved and now I'm going to paste
in keys all right actually no I'm not
going to go over like that that's not
cool let's just say Python be more more
responsible here all right so if I go
ahead what if i refresh this browser by
saying refresh here if it's going to
launch a new browser or not of course
not until that's live again seems like I
got to kill this thing and press ctrl f5
each time for it to pull up I think it
needs to like kill its older version so
now this looks slightly different and
it's slightly interesting because what
this is showing me it says hey Glassdoor
just gave me my own little custom page
that isn't the same if I didn't have my
home or my profile loaded so let's go
ahead and sum your browser if you've
never gone to Glassdoor probably looks
like what I'm looking at here so once
again very similar we could say you know
a keyword search the ID is different
though you can see the idea is different
that's very interesting all right so I'm
going to copy this key word search ID
and we're going to do this you can see
we get an exception here because it's
like hey we couldn't find it it's
because glassdoor's gave us a different
version of the page than what we saw
from my chrome profile so spend stop
this and we're going to press ctrl f5
what I did is I replaced the ID with a
keyword search hoping that that will
work
all right so now you can see it typed in
Python and it sounds ah so now it's like
okay well what I want what I want to go
and I'm going to click this button here
so I can go ahead and right-click on
that look at the button and you know
what good Chrome as the built-in ability
where you get is right click and say
copy XPath the only problem with a copy
to XPath is that it doesn't always work
sometimes it's better to drilling by
yourself using this this specified way
but anyway you could paste the entire X
type in here I'm going to in single
quotes so I could paste the entire XPath
and instead of thing sendkeys I mistake
click so now stop it so if everything
goes well in full blast or it's going to
search Python and I'm going to click to
search for jobs and there you go so now
you see a bunch of jobs and now if I'm
like you know what I want to get all of
these elements here and I look at this
something like uh okay it selects blah
blah blah looks like if I look at this
individual element this is where there's
a list of elements so this Li mhm okay
so we have this J grid hover J grid
hover class okay and that's a selected
one could also say filter toggle I'm
going dad so I'm going to say let's try
to drill down from here so what I want
to do I'm going to try to find so fine
by exFAT so I really I can copy this
entire thing right here I place it at
this next line and if we go back over
here what I'm trying to do is I'm trying
to get the XPath I can say hey give me
all the list elements in here so I can
get their text and everything so here's
like okay Li so really I'm going to try
to go for this but instead of a plot on
an ID it's a test we need to say you
know your class it will paste in our
class name and now I'm going to say
let's see see we see we're just going to
talk let me think um let's just do it
print stop I just want to have another
line of code here that I can put a
breakpoint on so I'm going to place a
breakpoint here and I'm going to press
ctrl f5 or debug and what I'm trying to
do is find out if that X pass it's going
to grab those job items that we're
looking for all right so now no it
didn't it didn't work at all all right
let's cool well I can do let me close
all these windows to do it these windows
open here alright and this time instead
of that I'm going to go to my little
debug I'm gonna click play because I
want this breakpoint to be hid I want
you know what else I didn't do all right
you know it's I'm going to stop that
real quick what I'll do is I'm going to
sign this variable so I'm going to say
jobs list equals and instead of fine
elements we can say elements because we
want to find every element in
and in fact I'm not even going to just
stop down and say I want all the Li
elements so what I'm doing is I'm saying
hey fine whatever this class is which is
that UL thing in fact I can even do more
specific I could say you well with that
class and then I could say give me all
the li elements list item elements and
assign it all to this job's list so I'm
trying to do here
all right so now if I look at jobless
exactly what I want to hear man we have
a bunch so you know these are these are
all the web elements the selenium web
elements that consists of our data so if
I look into each one of these online hmm
let's see what we got here we got
locations we have some IDs all the stuff
looks like it's like in memory stuff but
here Python jobs and Fredericksburg
look there's the text that we're looking
for all right so what so now if I was
like you know on the south this I'm
going to say 4x and you know it will
just say job in jobs a list print job
text now if we run this
you can see that it's printing out all
the texts related to each one of those
Li elements so if you were like looking
for you know specific texts or something
like I hate I want to prove the last
words they got all the latest routes and
stuff like that and then you're like hey
you know what I'm going to I'm going to
automate all this you know so it's like
okay I'm not interested in you know
these like specific keywords like for
instance you can have a list of keywords
like keywords equals and it's a list you
could say Python and will even say data
and a list so then I could say for job
and jobs list if job dot text so I don't
write in Python as much anymore but I
hardly ever write toys on except for my
Django website I've been ready to see
him non-stop c-sharp and JavaScript for
four years now but I do write a lot of
Python still like when I'm teaching
itself but yeah I'm not I have this
Django website but besides that I have
not been doing a lot of Python
development like in the last year but I
still know this very well I my pain
so if okay so I'm going to say if you
know we're going to say me on a
second
you know what let's um let's not be too
difficult with this for just a second
here because I need to figure out how
I'm going to say for each element and
the keywords list to go then you know
through every job and make sure that and
there's a way to do that but that's like
it's not even a more advanced Python but
it is very confusing for for newbies for
right now let's just say you know what I
just have I'm going to say if just one
particular things I'm going to look for
the keyword senior like say I'm only and
you know I'm only interested in seniors
then I could say you know print jobs are
text alright so what I'm saying if
seniors in the job text go ahead and
print that
texts out because otherwise let's just
pretend that's you know the one keyword
that I'm interested in and I don't want
all the other stuff because most likely
you don't want a ton of data you have to
dip through it and everything so now we
look and we got nothing
so that's thankful that's not cool let's
back up real quick so I run this again I
want to see this list real quick and
he's like you know what before we even
get what I'm going to do is say you know
what I'm going to write this stuff to an
out file so I'm going to say instead of
print I'm going to say I define my out
file I'm just going jobs out file equals
open I'm going to give it the road to
path around that which is we'll just
call this job dot txt and we're going to
say create a new jobs txt file and then
for every job in this job list we're
going to say jobs out file dot right and
we're going to then write extra must say
writes line you know interesting jobs so
right and then we're going to then say
job I want to get this kind of a whole
obstacle thing I was talking about where
I'm just not even playing this stuff out
it's been a very long time
also since inside I'm probably since my
tutorial that I created I think was last
September which you all know how I roll
men you can't mess with the best stay on
them Santa also because of a weird
little thing with Visual Studio or maybe
is even Windows 10 I didn't use step it
isn't I didn't used to have to
explicitly close an actual file that
you're writing to but when you're using
Visual Studio code I know for a fact
someone who's ten you're really your
file is how you have anything in it and
the reason why is because we enclose it
so let's go ahead and do the right thing
close it even though we didn't do
to have to do that but we now do so we
just have to say the variable name which
is this job out file that we have dot
close and that will close the file free
up the resources till we go and run this
it's going to create a file called jobs
dot txt which is a text file and it's
going to have all the jobs that we just
pulled off here ok so now if we go to
our jobs finder we look at the jobs file
you can see that all that stuff which is
printed out here so now we have it saved
so now let's go ahead and look at okay I
want to restrict this to just senior so
it looks like there's a bunch of seniors
when they're all capitalized which is
why this is why what we did before did
not work so we're going to say if I'm
used to those other parentheses because
of all the other languages that I use
which usually requires with Python
doesn't so will say if senior in and we
can say jobs out file dot write job tech
sorry so now only is that that text
contains senior do we write it and
that's what we're going to do now so by
the way when you do this new open file
and you have a double you hear that W
means create a new file if there's one
already there it's going to completely
overwrite it to delete it it's going to
create a new file we want that to happen
because otherwise every time we write to
run this program it's going to like keep
repeating the same data over and over
again and our data is going to be ugly
so sometimes you want to append to a
file that's already there and other
times you want to write a new file and
what we're going here is writing a new
file because that's what we want to do
otherwise we have a bunch of data so now
if we look at our jobs file that we have
only a few select select values here
which is which is nice so that is a
pretty good demonstration I think on on
Python web scraping so you're probably
asked them like ok where
you go and I don't know where you go
from here man I really don't another
thing to if you wanted to you could've
just went like this senior and then said
jobs that tax got lower or you know what
I think it's lower job text I think
that's how you're doing Python spend so
long but what that does is it takes all
the text and it turns it to lowercase so
now you're only going to compare
lowercase to lowercase and therefore you
have a case insensitive search or you
have the name lower that doesn't exist
in Python because I don't remember what
it's called
javascript is called to lowercase and it
looks like lowercase hi mother right on
uppercase to lowercase that's usually
the best way to figure something out to
guys as other is just to lower I think I
had that right to begin with alright so
once again if you're writing in a bunch
of different languages especially if you
go a little year or two but the one
thing that remains to San Jose a lot of
people like do I want Python to learn
PHP don't learn this or that doesn't
matter because honestly like you're
going to run into the same no
matter what language you're using some
languages require more stuff to do that
 some languages require less some
make it easier to do certain things some
make it harder it's really no difference
man so like don't worry about learning
this or that your your your skills are
going to transfer from one language to a
next IV do this stuff a bunch of times
you're going to be like oh this is
easier I've done this before stuff like
that but clearly guys there's a few
takeaways here number one you want to
use selenium
for a lot of like automation tasks and
things like that number two you kind of
see how like we've done some importing
some options and stuff like that number
three we're using the power of the XPath
man I have a video out there which is
free badass I think the
XPath and of course I'm not the first
one to pull out that some now
should always be the first one to pull
up did I take that now I'm like
what's going on here there it is
explicitly search in YouTube music oh
crap no just think oh I got 39 elbows
including my own come on man don't make
me be like that you guys got to go to
this thing and I'll vote it and share it
now but in this video here man I go
through how to like target even stuff
like in YouTube with X dollars and 7
it's more complicated exercise you guys
should make sure you check it out and
it's all about so it's all about uh you
know I'm just going through and all that
stuff and now using XPath alright guys
thanks for watching man make sure you
subscribed if you want more videos like
this so you guys go to subscribe and
support my channel I appreciate it thank
you have a good day bye hey guys so a
lot of you asked me how do I get my foot
in the door to become a programmer and I
just want to take a moment to mention
dev Mountain coding boot camp is a
12-week intensive course that focuses on
the technologies of the here-and-now for
web development some of the things that
they're actually teaching in the 12-week
course it's geared to get you into the
industry by focusing on things like
jQuery nodejs
react angular how to use github so a lot
of the things that you're going to need
to do as a developer as soon as you
start they're going to be teaching you
in this and this coding bootcamp and the
entire goal is to be able to get you
into the industry within 12 weeks so if
you guys are interested in learning more
information about Deb mountain coding
boot camp just check out the link in the
description cab of this video thank you
