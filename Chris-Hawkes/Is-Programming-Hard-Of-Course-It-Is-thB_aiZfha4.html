mountain coding boot camp they're a boot
camp that is based out of Utah but
they're also in Texas in Arizona now
they offer courses in web development
iOS development UX or user experience
design Quality Assurance and major
companies are hiring some of their
alumni hey guys what's up so coatings
not hard right all we have to do is do a
little hello world and we give her a
little example of what coding is and and
it's apparently really easy I was
actually watching this video and it's
very inspirational but this video it
says coding is not difficult
I was 13 when I first got access to a
computer my parents taught me so yeah if
you go and watch that video it's all
these different influential people in
the IT field like Steve Jobs quotes and
Bill Gates Mark Zuckerberg and they're
all basically trying to promote coding
and that's good because I do the same
thing on this channel everybody should
learn the code and the thing that I just
kind of wanted to spell though is that
like coding as difficult as a mug I'm
you're gonna have a hard time coding
there's no question about it like coding
is difficult even for the smartest
people in the world you're gonna have a
difficult time coding you're gonna start
off with stuff like this and you might
even start off with something even even
easier than this if you're gonna use
something like JavaScript or Python
versus C sharp or like a fully object
morning line which like Java but
eventually you're gonna run into code
bases that become really large and any
sort of development job any gig that you
get you're gonna be dealing with large
projects where by the end of the day
every well most of the days you're
gonna be probably leaving work and
you're gonna be like damn I don't feel
like coding anymore because I just spent
all day like racking my brain up against
code and that's how a lot of development
shops are actually run not all of them
but a lot of them are but it so it's
difficult so let's let's give an example
here's a code base that's not even that
complex so I'm going to to github here
and I'm just gonna show you the Python
Django codebase and and here's the the
Django core project here so here's like
the core of it so here's signals is just
a simple file here but there's tons and
tons of different files here but you can
see all these different files are doing
different things and different functions
and classes and so a lot of stuff going
on here they're all these regular
expressions going on in there
a lot and this is just one file for
validators which wouldn't make sense
since that's why they're uh anyway so if
you go through this entire Django
project there there's gonna be a lot
going on with this there's tons of
people involved in years worth of
development effort and you may end up
going and your first gig as a junior
developer like first job right out of
college whatever you might have to
maintain this thing you might have to
say oh there's some weird bug going on
you're gonna look at the bug and you're
gonna like isolate that it's somewhere
in like dB probably in the utils or the
that's basically what your job is gonna
be you're got to hunt down the bug and
this massive codebase there's nothing
easy about that now a lot of times like
we have you know good logging exception
handling or error handling and and other
times we don't so like I know that
that's always a case-by-case basis as
far as how quickly you're gonna be able
to navigate around and find the bug but
this is just one particular example like
of okay I don't know anything about
Django I'm a Python developer
I'm just expected to be able to jump in
and figure out something that's wrong
with with this Django library you know
within probably if it's if it's a
typical bug within a few days like
you're supposed to get that bug taken
care of so depending on the complexity I
mean if it's like a bug that requires
like a redesign obviously then that
could end up changing things but your
typical blog is just is a few days
usually from what I've seen
now here's another codebase like with
with tensor tensor flow this is all
written in like C++ and C this gets way
more complicated so tell like any one of
those people on that influential video
like to have them look at this stuff and
Intel like even the best developers like
oh yeah like totally know everything
that's going on and tensorflow library
this is for machine learning so if you
can jump in here like that you mean
you're really good number one I'm not a
C or C++ developer so I really would not
jump in a codebase like this but it's
still like there's so many different
files there's there's a ton going on
there that I know we take a long time to
get up to speed and be able to maintain
a library like that here's another
example of get like so gate is written
also in C and and it was written by
Linus Torvalds
for Carville it's horrible - anyway
creator of Linux and I didn't realize
git is actually using Perl so that's I
thought that was interesting but
that brings up an example of this too so
look at this complicated piece of code
here and this thing actually prints the
12 days of Christmas apparently this is
also written in C so clearly in this
example like nobody's gonna write code
like this but there are certain
languages that allow you to write code
like this like JavaScript you can mangle
your code and then sometimes you will
have to come across libraries that are
all mangled and you can try to unman GLE
them and things like that and in fact
that's only happen to be one time but
that was that was that that project
sucks but anyway the the certain
languages allow you to basically troll
people in a way that you can do like
this so perl is a good language where
you can really troll people and write
something that only actually nobody
could understand like three months from
now so am i trying to say don't be a
coder or anything like that no
definitely go out in code I just
understand the coding is it's
complicated you're gonna spend a lot of
time google searching stuff you're gonna
be dealing with libraries you're gonna
be dealing with undocumented code know
like exception logs like you're gonna
have masses of massive amounts of people
that you're gonna be working with it's
difficult so anyway guys make sure you
just you know make sure you know that
it's a journey so yeah guys that's all I
got I'm just make sure you just know
that the journey of coding is fun it's
easy you know when you first start out
but it is gonna be more difficult but
eventually you're gonna be able to look
at stuff like this and be like oh no no
I'm just kidding you're never gonna look
at something like this and understand
you know what that what that's doing but
there there's gonna be code that looks
like this to you now that will actually
start to manifest itself and actually
look much more clearer so when you're a
junior dev I guess is a good a good
analogy like a lot of code that you look
at that's like typical moderate to
advanced you know senior dev code
probably looks like this to you maybe
not that maybe not as bad but but it
could look that bad and there are
certainly times that I've seen code
bases where I'm like look I might as
well be looking at this so that I think
that will lessen for a lot of developers
and you'll find that that you know that
that is like starting to kind of like
come into clarity but this code is
absolute an atrocity like this is like
this is just so many trolling somebody
but anyway guys thanks for watching have
a good day bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
