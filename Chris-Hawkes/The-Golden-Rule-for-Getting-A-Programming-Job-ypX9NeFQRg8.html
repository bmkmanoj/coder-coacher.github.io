follow-up on the last video I did and in
that video I was talking I was answering
a question and the question was really
about how all these different jobs out
there they're asking for everything
under the Sun they're asking for 15
million different things and there's a
difference between asking for like 15
million different programming languages
you know Java and then you know and then
jumping into like JavaScript c-sharp PHP
whatever like you started asking for all
those types of different skills you're
not being reasonable and most likely
what you're seeing is a job description
that is like for most likely IT
recruiting firms and and you know just
consulting companies that could be
dealing with any one of a number of
technologies so they want you know
people that are skilled in all these
different areas that they can you know
turn to so that is like the first thing
and that's kind of the why was i well
you know don't really worry about that
and you know fine finally you know the
the jobs that are more reasonable now
that said there are still jobs where
it's like hey we need you to know a
little bit about store products we need
you know with TFS is how to use you know
whatever version control system is how
to how to deal with you know get you
know deal with merge complex basically
just need a typical day-to-day you know
development stuff that you'll find like
with net and and its infrastructure
you're gonna deal with a lot of you know
though they'll ask for things like
c-sharp and visual basic and then also
they'll ask you about certain things
like if you're not using git you're
gonna be using like TFS for version
control and they want to know whether or
not you want to know about agile
methodologies and if you don't know
about any of this stuff and in many
cases you probably wouldn't if you
hadn't had the job before or had a
development job before so so companies
that are not willing to train you on
those things you know they're gonna ask
for those specific skillsets now the
thing is is like when they mention like
you don't they'd be a TFS admin or a TFS
expert but you need to know what a TFS
task is and like how to associate a task
with a check-in and in things like that
so those are those are basic things and
even a lot of companies will still be
willing to work with you in training you
on those specific things for instance I
once took a job as a developer
where they knew I had never used it in a
professional capacity they didn't care
because they based on my previous
experience and everything they felt that
I would be able to learn it and that's
basically what they told me they're like
all you'll learn in no bra you know one
or two weeks and you know and it
probably was one or two weeks it's
really all it was and I thought it would
be a lot more but in my get expert know
I'm not a good expert like I could just
I would be able to move into a
development shop that uses get or I
could use the one that uses a TFS for
version control but either way I'll be
able to just kind of slide into either
one of those but that's also because I
have eight years of experience in doing
this stuff and also being able to slide
into new technologies and everything so
let me get back on the point and what I
wanted to follow up in the previous
video and what I failed to mention and
really the most important thing probably
and I would say really I speak for from
from definitely from an American
experience but I honestly would would
venture to say that it's probably the
same and pretty much every every country
out there so definitely the United
States and Canada I would I would think
are the same in this sense and that is
that there is one golden there's one
golden thing that you need to know as
far as getting a job in the IT world I
really there's one golden factor that is
the golden factor that stands out head
and shoulders among the rest and that is
drumroll
it's all about who you know it really is
it's about who you know who can vouch
for you and who has that that ability to
get you that job you know and and that
is the most important thing it's why you
don't want to be an asshole that nobody
wants to work with if you know somebody
on the inside that can they can truly
vouch for you and usually that comes
from working in the same professional
capacity it's like hey Chris I'm a
youtube subscriber your channel couldn't
you vouch for me no dude I can now I
can't put my professional career on the
line if like I truly have never worked
with you and in a professional capacity
now there's people that I've worked with
though that I know and then there are
certain people that I know just based on
the conversations I've had on my youtube
channel that I know would be good
developers but I still couldn't vouch
for you that uh yeah that's it so what
it's just part of the things like in
order for somebody to truly vouch for
you typically speaking you have to have
worked with those guys like you had to
have worked on projects you kind of have
to know what their work ethic is like as
far as like do they show up on time are
they cleanse eat you know do they take
showers and things like that Steve Jobs
didn't take a shower nobody wanted to
work with a mandatory because he stunk
so bad like he had to work night shift
because he stunk so bad because he
thought that because of his all fruit
diet that he didn't have to take showers
and things like that those are little
things that you will quickly realize
about somebody once you start working
with them day in and day out but it's
it's it's those reasons why you can't
just vouch for somebody over on an
online through an online you know
relationship compared to like in person
or something like that but but yeah that
is the golden role unfortunate it's all
about who you know it's always been that
way as far as I know and especially in
the United States it just it just is man
um anyway it is about what who you know
and the reason why I kind of want to
create a separate video on that but that
is the most important facet to what I
was discussing in the previous video
about how I told you not to worry about
all that different stuff you're gonna
pick up on the skills that these
companies need you to have once you get
your first job you're gonna pick up like
70% of all those skills you need we're
going to completely reinvent the wheel
every few months with new technologies
and things like that that's that's
inevitable but you're going to learn it
quicker and everything but once you have
that
job you have that experience and
experience speaks for itself once you
have that now getting that that
experience though that is the hard part
that boils down to literally do you know
somebody that can get you in or do you
just become creative and and do things
like you know developer bootcamp so you
get your computer science degree do you
do you start your own business and build
your own portfolio do you contribute to
open source projects do you just answer
questions all day on Stack Overflow you
know there's all kinds of different
things that you can do to pad your
resume um anybody that's looking for a
job and trying to get into this industry
I definitely think you should have at
least some sort of website out there
something showcasing hey this is my
getup is this this is that you know just
there's no reason not to these days
there's really no reason not to it's so
easy but all right guys that's it man
I'm trying to keep these videos short
and sweet thanks for watching man make
sure you guys subscribe yeah make sure
you subscribe
definitely definitely appreciate the
support all right guys take care
